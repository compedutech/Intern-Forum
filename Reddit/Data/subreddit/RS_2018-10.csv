9kbw6h,35,2018-09-30,Job Search - Lessons Learned,robinsoncrus0e,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/9kbw6h/job_search_lessons_learned/,"I graduated from the program in August and accepted a job offer this week (details in the hiring thread).  Finding a job was *much* more difficult than I expected.  I thought sharing my process and the lessons I learned might be helpful for some of you.

**Background**

I graduated the program with a 3.95 GPA, but had no internships because I was working in my old job for most of the program.  I like to think I'm a competent developer, and I felt comfortable with all the concepts we worked through in class.  I worked on one major personal project, a cryptocurrency portfolio visualization tool ([www.sonarcrypto.com](https://www.sonarcrypto.com)) built with Angular 5, Express, and MongoDB.  I probably put a few hundred hours into the project all told.

I started applying for jobs in April and continued until this month (September).  I was looking for development jobs (not testing or infrastructure) in a major city.  I submitted  over 400 applications total.  I got some sort of response from maybe a quarter of the places that I applied to, mostly rejections.  I was contacted for phone screens/coding tests by \~25 of the companies.  I had six total in person interviews over that period, and ultimately got lucky enough to have three offers come in at the same time this month.

**Two Things to Expect**

You'll mostly get silence/rejections - just the nature of the beast, especially if you have no experience.  Seems like companies are desperate for developers with a few years experience under their belt, but reluctant to take the risk on people who don't have any experience.

Some companies will treat you poorly - I was stood up for scheduled phone interviews by 6 different companies (literally).     
I was told as I was leaving a final round interview  for a company that I would be a great fit for the company, and then contacted a few days later saying they needed to hire a more senior developer instead.  Another company invited me to an on site interview, and then cancelled it as I was beginning to make travel plans.  I spent a bunch of hours on code samples, only to be completely ignored after they were submitted.  Unfortunately, you can expect to get some of this in your job hunt.

**Things to Remember (in no particular order)**

Don't let yourself get demoralized - it feels bad to get blanked and sometimes treated like crap.  It helped me to realize that it wasn't an indictment on my capability; instead, it's just the way the job market can be for entry level developers.  If you've completed this degree, you've got skills that are valuable to companies.  It's just about being patient to find the place that fits.

Bulk is your friend - apply to a lot of jobs.  Because of the things I just mentioned, it's a bad idea to put too many eggs in one basket.  Things that look like great opportunities can fall through in a second.  In July and August, I applied to 5 jobs every day which is not too much of a time commitment.  If you're in the middle of the job hunt, I recommend you do the same.  These online job boards make it easy for you to apply to a bunch of jobs, but also makes it easy for everyone else.  Companies have to sort through dozens of resumes for each job they post.  Putting a lot of applications in increases your chances of getting through to an actual interview.  Power through!

Nepotism is your friend - If you have a friend/family member connection to a company you're interested in, use that connection.  It will almost always get you to at least a first interview.

It's easier to get an interview with companies in your city - Companies are much more likely to bring you in for an interview if you're local.  It means they don't have to pay travel costs.

Write a cover letter - I thought a cover letter was a waste of time, but as soon as I wrote one and started including it in applications my response rate went way up.  Explain your passion for computer science.

Practice your two minute background talk - almost every interview you have, whether with HR or an engineer or the CEO, you're asked to talk about your background.  Spend some time practicing so this important part of the interview is clear and flattering to you.

Get very comfortable with language syntax with one language for coding problems/whiteboarding - It really helps to be automatic with language syntax for these problems.  It means you don't waste time remembering keywords and instead can focus on solving problems.  I recommend Python because it is very flexible.

Know the concepts that come up in coding problems/whiteboarding - Most companies don't give really tough gotcha questions.  Instead, they normally give questions that are just a variation on the usual themes (object oriented programming, sorting, recursion/DP, time complexity, data structures, testing, etc.).  As long as you're comfortable with those things, you'll do well.  I think understanding the general concepts is much more important than grinding on HackerRank or something like that.

Talk through your thoughts in coding problems/whiteboarding interviews - Interviewers care more about your thought process than immediately coming to the most efficient solution.  They'll also often give you hints as you talk.

Get experience through a personal project or internship - This may be the one thing that increases your chances of finding a job the most.  My personal project was a major talking point in almost all of my phone screens and interviews.  I don't think I would have gotten my foot in the door with nearly as many companies if I hadn't done it.  Companies want to see your personal capability and what you can bring to the table.  A personal project is a great way for you to demonstrate your understanding of software architecture, hosting infrastructure, relevant technologies, etc.  This kind of experience is what can distinguish you from other candidates.

&amp;#x200B;

So none of that was particularly original, but I hope there was something that was helpful.  Most important thing is to keep your head up!  You'll find a fit if you keep looking!

Yesterday I received a letter from USC Dornsife for a program called Resident Honors Program (RHS). (Image: [https://imgur.com/7cZ3xTU](https://imgur.com/7cZ3xTU)) They began with ""Based on your excellent academic performance"" and I know that the only score that they could possibly have is my PSAT from sophomore year (1450/1520). I was wondering if this letter was sent to a large group of people and how I stack up with people who might apply. I am currently a junior.

Demographics: Indian Male from Bay Area

GPA: Maintained 4.23 GPA (weighted) and 3.9 (unweighted) (Freshman Year)

Maintained 4.53 GPA (weighted) and 4.0 (unweighted) (Sophomore Year)

No Rank given by school.

PSAT (10): 1450/1520

SAT (August score, retaking in Oct.): 1520/1600

SAT Subject Tests (taking this year or next): Math II, Physics, 3rd one TBD

AP's: (Past) Computer Science Principles, Physics 1, Computer Science A, (Current) English Language, Calculus AB, (Next year) Literature, Chem/Bio

IB's: (Current and Next year) Computer Science HL, Physics HL, Economics SL, Spanish SL

Honors: (Past) English 1 Honors, Biology Honors, Chemistry (Solid State) Honors, English 2 Honors, (Next year) Multivariable Calculus

EC's: Eagle Scout (Projected Fall 2019) (Currently Life Scout), 8 Years Black Belt ITF, Internship (2019 Summer), Tennis, (Football), Volunteer Teacher at Citizen Schools (Spring 2019), National Honor Society, and assorted clubs.

Some additional questions I had were is RHP binding? Does it make it easier for me to get into USC if I decide to finish my senior year and apply then? How have people who have participated in the program felt about it? How hard is it to get into? Is it worth applying?

Thanks for all of your input!"

Small, prefer &lt;15K total students, such that people are well connected and alumni network is strong.

not too hot but still generall sunlit (not grey/dark skies often), related: I like nature but not rural

I have no idea if I would like a big city since I've lived in the suburbs my whole life,

I love entrepreneurship/startups and working on projects with intensity even if they seem like odd projects, and also a high level of funding / endowment per student

I don't like intense competition where people aren't willing to even share what internships they apply to etc.,

I like it when I can build a pretty deep relationship with my professors.

I want to major in Physics/Engineering/CS but likely also have interdisciplinary interests Psychology/Design/Business/Japanese, and of course want to be a good writer

\--- My list of 20, I have all the minimum stats for all these and no massive hook but good EC's

Huge Reach: Stanford, Princeton, MIT, CalTech, Columbia, UPenn

Reach: Brown, Cornell, Harvey Mudd, Dartmouth

Target: Rice, UCB, UCLA, CMU, Boston, Pomona, Lehigh, UMich - Ann Arbor, Tufts

Safety: UCD, UCSD, Santa Clara, CPSLO, UWash

Some that others have recommended to me: CPP safety, College of William and Mary

My dilemma is that there probably isn't a perfect college, and as such I put in colleges that satisfy most of my preferences. This makes the list too long. For example, UPenn - it's competitive, kinda big, and in a big city. Yet I really like that I would get both a great STEM education and can access the best business school in the world and am considering ED. And there is a small chance that I will be unable to get a job if I don't do a startup right away since it's preprofessional. Am I wrong to do that, and if you were to narrow this list down to 15-16 for me, counting the UC's as one and CP as 0, what would it be? Thanks so much."
9kcx4x,0,2018-09-30,Advice on major for career,Madler84,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9kcx4x/advice_on_major_for_career/,"Hello,

So to start off my end goal is to be either a game developer or designer.  My fall back plan is to be a web designer or developer.

Currently, my major is a bachelor of science in information systems and technology: design and development.  I have 50 credits completed.  

Starting out I thought this major covered all bases and would be a good degree that employers would like.  But looking ahead at the courses it largely focuses on systems and network, with a few development and programming courses. Which seems like I'll be taking a lot of courses that won't apply to my career and I question how ready I'll be for the workforce once I graduate.

Courses include:
object oriented design and software applications;
Language, logic and discrete math;
information and organizations;
usability engineering;
Organization and design of info systems;
Computer &amp; cyber forensics;
Distributed-object computing;
Intro to systems analysis and design;
Ist integration and problem solving;
Internship;
Foreign languages (3 courses);

This really comes across as an IT degree which is nice but lacks in the design aspect.

Im really considering switching to the digital design degree because the courses look a lot more useful and I can still minor in the previous degree.  But it provides so much flexibility that I can customize it to where I take just as many development courses as the previous and I really get great design knowledge as well. 

 The courses included with the digital design degree are:
Intro to computer graphics;
Gaming and interactive media (communication);
Application development design;
Intermediate &amp; object-oriented design;
Object-oriented design &amp; software applications;
Usability engineering;
Intro to visual studies;
Scripting fundamentals for visual arts;
3d design fundamentals;
Art of web design;
Animation fundamentals;
Computer 3-d modeling rendering &amp; animation;
Application design;
Digital multimedia design capstone;
Digital multimedia design studio;
Intro to digital art and design criticism;
Writing for the media;


 With all that said Im fearful of changing majors because from my research it seems that design degrees aren't that highly thought of.  I figure though with the customizability of this one I still get a great foundational development knowledge as well as great design knowledge.  I'm curious though will employers only look at degree title or will they actually consider the courses you took as well?  For those with experience in this industry would you recommend making the switch or sticking to what I've been doing?

Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for thoughtful recommendations."
9kdiv3,4,2018-10-01,I’m a Senior in College who is thinking about turning down an 90k+ job offer to pursue other options. Am I crazy?,garnetandgravy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9kdiv3/im_a_senior_in_college_who_is_thinking_about/,"Something to know about me - I’m a double major in Finance and Industrial Engineering at a very good school (20% acceptance rate, to give you an idea). Not top ten or anything, but well respected in both of those departments. My GPA is a 3.26 (too much partying freshman year, but very solid since) and I’ve had internships after each school year. 

I interned at a big bank in NYC in Operations this past summer and got a return offer. I liked the bank - good culture, good people and my hours were fine. The offer includes 80k as a base salary, 10k in relocation, and 3-7k in year end, performance based bonuses. Other metrics include 17 vacation days (plus normal holidays) and 6% match on 401k. By all accounts, it’s a pretty damn good offer, one that most would take and run.

My concern with the offer is that I feel I don’t have a ton of growth potential, particularly as it pertains to salary and doing what I’m truly good at - Finance (or so I think). I could transition out after a couple years, but I feel like I should test the job market. Issue is a) My offer expires literally tomorrow - I’m planning on calling my recruiter and saying I need more time, though I doubt she’ll give it to me and b) I doubt I’ll find a job as ‘cushy’ as this.

People have pushed me in numerous directions. In particular, I had an hour long phone conversation with my Uncle, who talked about the value of loyalty but also said that it’s incredibly important I go through the process of finding a job. He said I’ll come out a better interviewer, more knowledgeable and all around a better worker.

What can I do to make this decision? Am I being stupid? Am I overthinking it? There are so many other factors that go into this but it would take over an hour to write it all out. Does anyone have any experience similar to this (I.e. offer deadline)? What did you do, how did it turn out and what do you think I should do?

I just graduated from a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering with Honours in the UK but Im currently planning on working in Australia. My aim in the future is obviously to do a MBA. I personally love analyzing businesses and tend to read company reports just for personal interest.

I was hoping for the following questions to be answered:

1. Should I first be doing a Masters in Engineering before pursuing a MBA (if that's even possible)
2. I was wondering what steps I should be taking right now if I want a career in Finance or Consulting in the big firms
3. Are there any accreditation or exams that i can take which I don't mind studying for but it would prove that I am knowledgeable enough to take on a internship
4. What masters program should I be looking into if I want to pursue in a finance/consulting career.
5. From my research, management consulting looks like a outlet where i can utilise my creativity whereas Valuations/M&amp;A looks much more concrete where I would adapt quickly. I personally love to making creative solutions however Im not sure my skillset would allow me to get into management consulting.

Let me know what you guys think is best and thank you for reading

This question may have been asked before but I can't seem to find anything too relevant about it. I'm currently going into my second year of BEng Mechanical Engineering at decent Russell Group uni in the UK. I'm considering the option at the end of this year of changing to the 4 year MEng course if I achieve the required grades. This, though, would only really benefit me if I were to pursue a career in engineering; however at this point I'm unsure of whether it is really what I want to do. In these other professions, namely accounting or possibly IB, I am considering applying for summer internships now that most firms state are only available to students after their penultimate year.

My question is, would you recommend appying for these internships at non-engineering companies this year? If I were to decide to pursue a career in engineering, which I'm almost certain would lead me down the MEng route personally, would I be able to then back out of any summer placement I may have managed to secure, as annoying as that may be for a company? I doubt they'd let me do it anyway as I then would still have 2 years of my course left to complete. I'm currently unsure of al the options I have, and don't want to close off any avenues as of yet."

Keeping up appearances and wasting time.  


I go to classes and occasionally meet up with friends. I do it, because that's what people do. I tell myself I'm going to try and get an internship at some point, because that's what people around me do, but of course I know I won't and I know exactly why, because I don't care.


Even the ways in which I waste time has degenerated. I used to mostly play video games. Then I switched to mostly watching series and movies. Now most of my day is spent on reddit or watching youtube videos. If I get myself to watch a movie, that's a good day. Last time I did that was more than two months ago. I think that's because I'm not just wasting time, but killing time until I can go back to bed and the more pre-chewed the things are I'm starring at, the less I have to be involved myself to get through the day.


I tried some of the generic self-improvement advice like doing some sport and went running in the morning twice a week for a while. I stopped. It just made me feel like shit afterwards with no redeeming qualities. When I hear advice like ""get a hobby!"" my first thought is just ""how? I don't care about any of these things"". 


All in all life does not seem very appealing. Sometimes this general melancholy shifts into a more intense feeling of sadness, I start crying and genuine suicidal desires come over me. Usually I feel a lot better after crying, but the desires do scare me.  


Recently I've been thinking that my fright over those desires may be misplaced and I began considering what the best way to end it would be."

For those asking why I work so much while I’m in school, it’s because I don’t receive any help from my parents to pay for school or living expenses.

Posting here as I am at the stage where I am trying to figure out what steps I can take going forward to advance my career. I just recently finished my bachelors degree in CIT, cleaning up my last 4 classes over the summer with online classes. During this time while I was finishing up my degree, I started the job hunt which after being rejected a lot, I was hired by a small company of roughly 30 people to do support. We are a re-seller of a software that we assist in integrating in with other software. We have a small support department of me and 3 others plus my supervisor. I am making about 35k which is lower than I wanted out of college but I don't really have the experience in IT to bargain for more. I missed out on having an internship through college as I switched majors from Criminal Justice about halfway through and then never got one for IT. 

I've now been at this job about 4 months and in that time I was in second for number of tickets resolved in my 2nd and 3rd month(just behind my coworker who trained me) and I lead the support team for number of tickets resolved last month. A new group was also formed called advanced technical support to take care of newer customers who are running into issues during the early stages of using our software and I was added to that along with my boss and the boss of my boss.

I do enjoy my job and as of right now, my only complaint being I wish I made more. I am still learning stuff that I didn't know as well like more about SQL, AD, etc. I'm not entirely sure what I want to do in the future and I don't know if I'll ever make enough here to get me to stay. I also don't see the potential for growth here as the company is so small and there isn't much I can move to. I was thinking something along the lines of Network Admin or Systems Admin but I am still undecided. I was curious if anyone had any advice for me going forward? I know i should start working on getting some certs but I don't know which ones I should be focusing first to give me the best chance of advancing my career. Also should I be keeping my eyes out for other jobs given that I now have a little bit of experience and a completed degree or should I try to stay here for at least a year and see what they give me? Any advice helps! Just trying to sort through some short term and long term goals for myself."

Long post, but its first week so maybe you'll read it :)",get_top_on_thephone,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/9kjhl9/third_year_feeling_lost_and_down_long_post_but/,"Hopefully since its first week, many of you will have time to read this. I have just been feeling so down and needed to vent a lot of my issues. I am just looking for some advice from anybody especially those who have maybe felt the same way and gone through the same issue. Hopefully this post may relate to some of you.  
 

I am a third year student (Biology major) and I just feel like I am wasting my time here and I just feel so lost and feel so behind. I came in here as a freshman, but I had already completed my IGETC and basically didn’t need to do any general education. Basically, I was a freshman, with junior standing. I talked to a counselor my first year and she recommended that I just stick it out for four years instead of me trying to graduate early. I am guessing she made this recommendation because of me not having to worry about the finances of school. But I think that was the worst advice I have ever followed in my life in which I take full responsibility for. This or winter quarter could have possibly been my last quarter and I could have maybe already graduated. I instead was playing around the entire last year with the idea of a minor and major, which I do not think I will continue to pursue.   
 

The goal has always been medical school, but here I am as a third year student who has joined no clubs, not done anything that I can actually put on a resume, and subpar GPA (3.6). I just feel that I did so much in high school all to throw it away here by having this false sense of security that I could take things slow. I don’t want to just be a Biology major that will probably be rejected by many medical schools and I just don’t know what interests me. I still like biology and all that, but I just feel that something else is calling me. I also want to be able to be employed and start making money for my family, an issue I won't really dive into.   
 

I feel particularly disappointed in myself that I have been given this great opportunity to attend this school and just feel like I have wasted so much time. I see people in my year that truly started as freshmen and basically we are on the same schedule to graduate now. I know comparing yourself to others is not productive in any way, but I do think about it.  
 

I don’t know what to do. I wanted to pursue the additional minor or major to make myself more employable, and I feel like I could brute force my way through it, but I am not particularly interested or motivated to do it at the moment which I know is not a recipe for success. But maybe sometimes you just have to? I don't know.  
 

I guess I could just bring my GPA up and start actually doing productive things and shoot for medical school, but I feel that everybody is just so ahead with basically 2 years of additional things to put on their application. I have 3 Bs and I dropped one class, which I know isn’t the end of the world, but realistically as a third year I don’t think I would be a very competitive applicant. I am a first generation student and I just don’t want to let my family down.  
 

Does anybody have any suggestions on maybe alternate career paths or just any advice from people who have been in similar situations? Any minors/majors that anybody recommends that might make me more employable? Any internships that are really beneficial?   
 

Sorry for the long post, I guess it doesn’t really matter if anyone reads this or not. It was nice organizing my thoughts into words instead of just having them all pent-up in my head.  
 

Also I guess if I could give any advice to a lot of the freshman( btw, Congratulations on getting into UCLA!), is have fun and really experience the college and all it has to offer! Don’t take anything for granted and really push yourself to succeed while still having fun and taking time for yourself.   


Maybe it doesn't sound as bad as it really is, but I just truly feel so uncertain with everything, I am kind of just taking things as they go and I really really don't know what to do.

Anyways, just wanted to rant I guess. Still don't know what I am going to do, but new year and that's just life I guess. 

TLDR: Basically started off as a freshman with all my GEs done, now a third year and feel like I have wasted way to much time exploring other interests that I have basically abandoned and have been taking very weak course-loads. I feel lost, useless , and do not feel that I am a competitive applicant to get into med school. Looking for alternate career paths and maybe other minors/majors. I am just looking for any advice. Would appreciate it if you could read the post though."

Next semester I plan on taking EECS 280, SI 110 or stats 306 and potentially math 217(I have credit for calc 1, 2 and discrete math). I'm also planning on taking 281 during the spring.

I'm a really experienced programmer and the CS classes shouldn't be what is most difficult in comparison to my other courses(kinda weird but cs is my passion whereas classes like anthropology are not).

&amp;#x200B;

maybe this is because midterms are upon us but I'm beginning to worry about my GPA and how that effects my employability in the future. I have no concern in doing well in EECS courses or technical interviews but I'm concerned if my GPA is 3.2 or something like that people won't even want to interview me.

&amp;#x200B;

If there are any cs majors who can speak towards the effect of GPA in comparison to actual programming skills and how that effected your employability or ability to get hired for internships or jobs it would be greatly appreciated to hear your input.

&amp;#x200B;

On a final note, as a student I believe in pushing myself to be the best that I can be, even if that means that my GPA takes a hit. I'm a bit torn because even in the midst of this post, I truly do not care what my GPA is, because I know the knowledge I'm accumulating in courses like linear algebra are far more valuable that other ""BS"" courses(within the realm of CS related careers). Should I keep this mindset or is it smart to cater courses towards boosting my GPA even if it means my knowledge as a student might not be pushed as much?"
9kla23,3,2018-10-01,college calculus is killing me and i don't know how to survive it,2dum4skool,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9kla23/college_calculus_is_killing_me_and_i_dont_know/,"posting on a throwaway. tl;dr: i cannot pass a class required for my major despite accommodations and medication, largely due to nature of the tests (computer graded), and i don't really know where to go from here. seeking any advice or comfort

well... guess i'll cut right to it. this is my fourth time taking calculus 2, required for my engineering major. 

Time 1: my parents pressured me into taking it as a summer course at a community college while working a full-time internship. went about as well as i should have expected for a 3 hr monday and thursday class, and i withdrew. 

Time 2: i went back to my full-time college and took it. the teacher i wound up with was a newly hired professor's assistant, with a strong accent and mumbling problem, whose tests were incredibly difficult. by the time i withdrew, only about a quarter of the class was left. it was towards the end of this semester that i was first diagnosed with ADHD-PI

i took a full year off of school working an all year long full time internship position, partly in hopes of getting my diagnosis and medication arrangements figured out. unfortunately being in a more rural area for work, the only doctor available to me was strictly against any type of stimulant. 

Time 3: tried again to take the course at my full-time college. unbeknownst to me, during my time away, every math class switched from paper or scantron testing to webassign computerized testing. we are only allowed the most basic calculator for tests, one sheet of scratch paper, and 45 minutes. no formula sheet given, you must memorize anything you need. Tests are only about 6-12 problems, usually 2 submissions allowed per question depending on the professor. so much as accidentally pressing space after an answer will mark it wrong, as well as any other formatting errors in addition to sign errors and small math mistakes. after much bothering the professor, i managed to get partial credit on one test, but that was all. barely surviving the class, i went to the professor for his opinion on if i could make it through the rest of the course or not, and if there was anything more that i could do for partial credit or to better prepare myself for the online tests. he told me i might as well just withdraw. i was not able to get an appointment with a new doctor back in town until mid-semester, and was on 100mg straterra until that point, which i felt did not help me at all.

Time 4: here we are now. I am on 70mg of vyvanse, i've been worked off the straterra but ever since i've had lots of trouble getting to sleep, and getting enough sleep. my teacher this semester refuses to offer any partial credit of any sort on tests, and says there is no way for me to review my answers to tests questions after the fact to see where i went wrong/what the right answer was. though i now get time and a half through disability accommodations, i have still yet to finish a test in time. i got a 56% on my first test. and a 13% today. im falling terribly behind in all my other classes because of how much time i've devoted to working problems and seeing tutors, none of which seems to matter against brutal computer

the past 2 semester i've asked for exceptions/overrides for this class to be able to continue courses in my major, and been refused every time. calc 2 is the only class i *can* take in my major now, and i'm falling more and more and more behind with things every time i fail it. my full ride scholarship only lasts 4 years, and theres no way i'll graduate in that time, let alone manage to keep my gpa high enough to not lose the scholarship. while im okay with taking longer to graduate, im not sure i can afford it. i don't know if i can pass this course at all. i don't want to change majors, i did really well at the several internships i've had already and really enjoyed all 1.5 yrs of experience i already have under my belt. due to the nature of engineering, the job i want is inaccessible to me without finishing a degree.

campus office of disabilities doesnt seem to know much of any about how math testing works, and says other accommodation options are up to that department, but that department says it's up to the office of disabilities. i marched straight to the office of disabilities after the test and was told they were busy, but they'd send me an email. (have not seen one yet) i am at my wit's end trying to not just pass this class, but the 12 other credits im taking, not including all the extracurriculars i've let fall by the wayside in an attempt to focus. my therapist thinks i should look into a lawsuit, my parents think i should look into transferring, im considering medical withdrawal, but none of that fixes shitty fucking computer grading

where should i go from here? should i be hounding my professor more about how the hell to manage these computerized tests? should i be approaching the dean of students? filing a complaint? initiating a medical withdrawal for the semester? i just don't know. it seems the harder i try, the worse i do. i'd rather walk out in front of one of the buses and not have to continue dealing with how much of a failure i am, it hurts too much. i feel like such a fucking idiot all the time, im almost a year behind where i should be in my degree already

any insight, advice, or support you have is more than appreciated. every engineering student advice page can be summed up to ""clearly you arent trying hard enough"""

New account just to be safe. As my username hints, I'm Greek, working in Athens.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a company where I started as an intern. In a few months I will be working there for 5 years. I make 1300 euro / month (net), plus some bonuses (about 3000 euro total), so total about 19k / year. My expenses so far are minimal, so I save a good amount of my salary, although it's not much to do anything substantial (like ever buying a house). The company I work for is pretty relaxed, there is no dress code, I work 2 days / week from home, nobody is forcing me to work overtime - although sometimes is necessary.

I'd say my skills are above average. My position is supposed to be Java back-end dev, me and a few more people maintain about 7-8 Java projects (about 100k lines each) with different MVC / front end stack, different databases (mysql, postgresql, semantic web databases, XML databases).

I also do  other things, like working with multiple languages (small fixes mostly in Javascript / Python / C# / XSLT / XQuery / SPARQL), setting up Jenkins jobs, working with Docker containers (creating images, deployment in cloud, log monitoring). I work mainly on Linux, and I'm pretty experienced with it, which is useful, since all our applications are deployed on Linux containers.

I've refactored and migrated most projects from Java 6 to Java 8+, along with their dependencies. I've refactored a monolithic Java application to SOA (Spring Cloud) in about 1,5 month, without having any previous knowledge of it. We also maintain about 10 small SPAs, written in different technologies (angular 1, angular 5, VueJS). Our job is to fix any issue that comes in our queue, no matter what language was used for it, who created it, and how long ago that was. It might be programming related, might be network related, might be something else.

Oh, I also manage all JIRA and similar issue tracking systems, since there is no real project manager on the project. I talk with clients directly, using Skype, phone, or email. In the past 4 years, I've also interviewed people for similar programming positions, and gave the green light to hire them. (or not)

In a few words, I do everything. Our project is hard, and I've seen a lot of people quit because of it, or need at least 1 year before they become slightly productive. Then they also quit.

I've been pushing myself all these years because I think the project while hard, is also interesting, and I never got into programming for the money, but because I've always wanted to do it one way or another. I'm in my thirties, which means I got my first programming job very late, and I had to catch up. I've learned a lot in the past 4 years. Before that I only did programming as a hobby, although I have a degree in CS.

&amp;#x200B;

But honestly, while I enjoy some things in my work, it's starting to get too scary too fast. I've becoming stale, tired, and while I have a stable job in a country where many people are trying to survive, I feel like I'm destroying myself. I keep seeing people migrating to other EU countries, working for (probably) better organized companies, having successful careers, with much better salaries. Although I never wanted to leave my country, I'm starting to think about it. But even if I wanted to do it, I feel lost. I've never had a real interview myself, because I got in as an intern, I have a lot of experience but in many fields which might not necessarily be a good thing, because there are definitely gaps that I need to fill, and I also feel I'm not getting paid what I should be, but I have no idea how to estimate my worth.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what I'm waiting to get out from this post, but thanks for reading it."

I'm surprised I don't see many posts here, or elsewhere on reddit, about working full-time at Citi. And the few threads about their internships are hardly much to go off of. Could be that most people prefer to pm this type of conversation.  
  
I've been offered full-time at Vanguard after a summer internship there and it's not a bad offer, but it's also not great. No relocation, about average or below-average pay, and it's in a state I'm not particularly interested in moving to.  
  
### The typical questions &amp; answers  
  
So I'm going into my final round interview with Citi and I'm hoping to find out as much as I can about their work culture, seeing as how I can't possibly get as much insight as an internship gave me. What kind of questions do you all typically ask to find the truth about work culture? Every company on the planet right now says they:  
- Have great work-life balance,  
- Offer amazing benefits,  
- Work on cool things,  
- Have a rotational culture,  
- Provide room to grow into a career and progress  
  
So how the hell do you filter through these? What are some questions I can ask that can't so easily be defaulted to one of those answers? **I really want to know** what progression looks like and how long it takes, how their culture handles new ideas or conflict, work staying at work and not following you home, that kind of stuff.  
  
What matters most to me is working with people I enjoy being around 8-10 hours a day, which is gonna be hard to determine in a day or two of interviewing. They do have a happy hour the day before the interview to meet with current employees, though, so I want to make the best of that.  
  
Thanks a ton in advance."

- Do you know of any good Financial Analyst Programs?
- How can I prepare myself for a Financial Analyst Role? (Financial Modeling training...etc)
- When do banks and firms start hiring for these roles?
- Are there any places I should look other than LinkedIn, Indeed, etc?
- Any other advice would be great!

Thanks!"

This post serves to ask for advice and an overall opinion on one's career path after undergrad.

I'm currently a senior undergrad in physics and astronomy while pursuing a minor in computer science and mathematics. However I'm actually a bit behind on the computer science portion. I took java in high school, used python here and there for lab work, and currently taking C++. But only recently has the existential crisis of what I really want to do after school come up. Initially it was to go into grad school, but now its seeing if I can make it into a programming related job. What would be your best advice for someone interested in making this transition? If at all, by that I mean programming in physics potentially. Lastly a major concern of mine is the universal problem with needing experience to get experience. Mostly planning to apply to a lot of internships and jobs hoping for a miracle. 

I'm just desperate to get to a place that doesn't even exist yet. "

I was wondering if you guys think it's a good idea to have multiple resumes since Computer Engineers fit both lower level jobs as well as higher level jobs. I'm currently applying to mostly embedded/firmware jobs because I'm most interested in those but also have been applying to software jobs because I have some web development experience through internships and classes. I am worried that it would be a con to have some of my hardware skills listed in a resume for a strictly software job (SPI, I2C, LTspice, Oscilliscope, Signal Analyzer, Logic Analyzer, etc.)

9ko12a,8,2018-10-02,Employer demoted me after learning of my pregnancy,pregomama,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9ko12a/employer_demoted_me_after_learning_of_my_pregnancy/,"I work for a financial institution as a management intern, my job title has been changed to loan officer intern after my manager learned of my pregnancy. 

My husband and I found out we were pregnant in June. We found out very early on (5 weeks). I scheduled my doctor appointment to confirm that indeed we were pregnant- this appointment took place at 9 weeks. When I told my manager I had a doctor appointment (I told her the day I made the appointment) she made a comment about one month being “short notice” when others had given hours notice or a days notice with no comments from her. We went to the confirmation, they scheduled a follow up with an ultrasound for 13 weeks. I told my manager about my new appointment and she asked some nosy questions to which I broke down and told her we were expecting but we were not announcing yet (we had a miscarriage in February and wanted to wait until at least the second trimester). 

At 10 weeks, she asked me to meet in her office. She asked me what my intentions were when the baby comes, return full time, return part time, don’t come back at all. I was honest with her and explained that if the circumstances with my husbands work stay the same as they are now that it would not be feasible for me to continue to work full time and I would need to decrease my hours to a part/full time 30 hour position if possible. I was very clear that we have not made a decision and we are months away from making any permanent decisions. I said my ultimate goal would be to return full time as a 40 hour employee but anything could happen. I could not have been more clear when I said I was not ready to make any big employment decisions- we hadn’t even had an ultrasound to see our baby and we were still in the danger zone of the first trimester. 

Week 11, my manager comes to me and says that her and her boss have decided to change my job title, leave my pay rate as is, and revoke me of all managerial responsibilities to allow me more flexibility with my pregnancy. I was stripped of my internship because of my pregnancy. 

Since my job title has been changed, she takes every chance she can to send me home early on sick time whenever I look even a little uncomfortable, despite my protests that I’m fine to stay. I work a desk job so my hips get real tight and I walk funny to the bathroom and printers sometimes while the joint loosens back up. I feel as though she is trying to force me to deplete my sick time so that my maternity leave is shorter. I’m just speculating here but it really feels that way. 

They have since posted my position, interviewed and hired a replacement management intern within my division but in another market. 

I feel discriminated against and don’t know if I have any legal grounds to go to HR or consult legal counsel. Is this discrimination? Did I screw up by being honest in my thought process about returning to work? Any advice is appreciated, thank you! 

TLDR; Manager changed my job title, left pay as is, revoked my authority levels and responsibilities immediately after learning I was pregnant.

I had a summer internship doing software engineering in fintech. And it was a really good experience, but I don't think it's what I want to do forever. Culturally it feels like tech companies would be a better fit. 

That said,  the fintech company extended me an offer. They want an answer very soon. Initially I was against taking it just because I hated that they were pressuring me to make a decision before my school even had its first career fair of the year. 

But then I did my first interview for a tech company. And I'd prepared some, but it didn't go well. And that's kind of freaked me out, that maybe if I don't take this offer I'll never get anything and I'll regret it.

My parents are wondering why I don't just accept the offer, plan to stay for a year, and start looking at other places. I guess my worry is I've heard people say that it's harder to move from fintech to tech than the other way around. And the fact that there's so much fanfare around new grad recruitment, that companies have special recruiters and special programs just for new grads, makes me worried that if I just settle for the offer I have and plan to move on soon, I'll have missed some huge advantage of getting hired as a new grad at one of the big companies. 

Is this true?"

However, I feel as though my resume is strong enough that I can easily compete with other college students. I'm passionate about finance (although not the most well-versed, I'm pretty good on basic concepts and I learn quickly) and I'm interested in exploring it further. My brother works in PE, so he could probably help me out in terms of getting a few connections. Is there any firms that would even allow a high school student to join their applicant pool?

Just a brief summary of why I think I have a chance:

I'm a top student at a selective admissions public school that is named #1 high school in the nation. As a junior, I'm taking a college-level number theory class since I've already passed through all the calculus classes. I've already worked for a startup this past summer at 1871 in Chicago and can get a pretty good rec from my boss. I'm fluent in C++ and Java, decent in Python, and I can pretty much do anything related to tech (including Office Suite and all that). And most important of all, I'm part of a research group for the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in Switzerland. This means that I go to Fermi National Laboratory to work alongside particle physicists on the same project over the school year."

I'm a junior CS student in the Midwest. I've done two summer internships, both of them in financial corporations, in my state, and doing back-end dev work.

My reasoning being that, if I were to accept that offer, I would just be spending another summer doing back-end web dev in a financial corporation in my state.

I am currently 16 and will get my license within the next few weeks. However, my parents insist that they will not let me drive myself after that due to my ""inexperience."" However, I have been driving for 8 months already and have not even gotten close to an accident. When asked about why they think I am inexperienced, my dad can think of only one incident which he thought was dangerous (even though I was following all rules, and was nowhere near a crash). On the road, I follow all rules perfectly, rarely speed, and never forget my turn signal. I can maneuver different roads and turns with ease, and never get lost on the road when I am able to navigate myself (using GPS or memory, not my dad spitting meaningless directions in my ear). They constantly mention how I am not able to drive unfamiliar roads. Even though I strongly disagree with this, it doesn't matter, since I literally want to use a car to shuttle between school, the gym, my job, the grocery store, and a few other very local places. When I try to be reasonable and explain why I feel I should be able to drive, they interrupt me and just restate the same points over and over. Then they start screaming at me for being disrespectful, and say I started it. Then when they are out of steam, they just leave without actually listening to me. We have a safe car, good insurance, and a safe set of roads between the places I want to drive to. But nothing works.

This truly feels extremely unfair. Apart from trying for nearly a year to become a safe and confident driver (in my mind, successfully so), I have done everything in my power in other parts of life to excel. I maintain excellent grades, have gotten stellar results on my SATs and AP exams, and have worked extremely hard in various extracurriculars (captain of a varsity team, president of a club, multiple awards for research and other events, multiple internships, etc.). I have never even considered using alcohol or drugs. Without sounding stuck-up, I have worked extremely hard to be a posterchild for my parents.

As an only child, it gets extremely boring to sit cooped up at home. All my friends are out driving and hanging out, and my license was supposed to be my way to join them. Only recently was I able to really get become close with a few good friends of mine (I did not have many close friends when I was younger), and my parents restrictiveness is simply preventing me from doing anything significant with them. We rarely hang out outside of school, since most of the places my friends go are the gym and restaurants which I need a car to get to. I can't even remember a time where I wasn't counting down the days until I got my permit, and then my license. It's natural for me to want some independence - even more so when I have typical helicopter parents. Whether you want to call driving/independence a right or a privilege, I think I have earned it regardless. I should be able to drive, plain and simple. But my parents will not budge. I try to show them how (not exaggerating) every single person in my grade who is able to get a license is allowed to drive freely. They say they don't listen to other parents, but flip-flop on this and constantly take random parents' advice for issues such as college.

When I try to tell my parents that the situation genuinely feels psychologically-damaging, they tend to ignore me and keep repeating the same crap about me being inexperienced. When I try to ask for a fair date by which I would be able to drive, they won't give me one. It is truly like hitting a brick wall.

In the end, is there any way to reasonably convince my parents to let me drive and have some independence?"

If I were single I would move wherever I want, but as I have a very pregnant wife, I don't want to move until sometime well after her delivery. Because of this situation, I feel that a remote job would be right for me as a junior developer fresh out of college. I have done remote work before, but not as a developer, I don't mind being alone all day with minimal human interaction.

What are your experiences working remote? If you worked remote as a first job post graduation, what did you think of that experience? Would you recommend it?

Is it easier to get into a 1 year program versus the 2 year? From my research, stats are slightly lower for 1 year, but not by much."

Unfortunately, I didn’t read the problem carefully and after I implemented my solution (which was the simple recursive function: left node- search root- right node) the IDE wouldn’t compile because the method arguments were greyed out. Ultimately, this meant that only an integer could be passed in the method but not an actual BST node. 

This was really frustrating. Why couldn’t the question have asked just to implement the search function in a BST without using recursion? Then I could’ve at least spent my given hour finding a solution. 

Sorry for the rant. This whole ordeal makes me feel too stupid to even qualify for a software internship. "

9kwsjw,5,2018-10-02,"Episode of extended psychosis (best phrase I have to explain it quickly) happened a year ago, never got any answers, worried it will happen again, what happened to me?",jame5richards,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9kwsjw/episode_of_extended_psychosis_best_phrase_i_have/,"Long one, appreciate some input or if anyone has gone through something similar but got better help than I did. Also I've never written out a full account of this without any filter, might be cathartic  

I have had issues with depression in the past, which I was treated for with medication more than once, but had never experienced any sort of hallucination or delusions until last year. I was supposed to be graduating college, but I had failed a class and was no longer going to graduate. I still had to study for finals though, and the two weeks leading up to those finals were a living nightmare. I was stressed and studying for insane hours, yes, but I'd done all that before. This felt different and increasingly got worse. 

First were things like, I would be studying and look up to realize I'd been staring at a piece of paper for two hours straight. Then I started feeling like everyone was looking at me, like I was being followed. Thought my roommates were talking shit about me in the living room, when my girlfriend said she couldn't hear anything. Eventually it worked up to me believing in large scale conspiracies. Such as: 

my phone had been bugged since freshman year by fellow students in my program, collecting damning evidence of some kind and mostly just trying to embarrass me to the whole world in some way,

my girlfriend of 3 years was actually just an actress hired by my friends from high school to make me see that I shouldn't be so attached to a relationship once she revealed herself to me, 

the cops were following me because they thought I was a drug dealer when I really only smoked a bit,

I had done all of this before and not graduated, like I was in a continuous loop where everyone was aware of the loop except for me (like ah shit he didn't graduate again, now we have to set all this stuff back up and wipe his memory),

And various other things that I 100% believed were real at the time, but through a clear lens sound ridiculous. 

I'm still pretty confused about the timeline of everything tbh, and I try not to talk about it with her since it's the most embarrassing thing I'll ever do, but apparently somewhere in the thick of that I proposed to my girlfriend twice (no ring). She didn't realize what all was going on in my head, so she was excited and said yes. But I had talked to my dad about people following me and some of the other things, so when they talked they kinda put together something was going on. He came to our college town the night before my first set of finals. 

This part is pretty blurry. They start guiding me to the car to ""take me to my final"" but somehow I knew they were taking me to a doctor. At the doctors I thought they were setting me up somehow, like I would walk out on to a stage to be embarrassed some way. They take me to a room and pump me with some type of drug to get me to sleep but it doesn't work. I tell them I know the drugs are just water. They give me more but I still don't sleep. Then I think we go to a different doctor? Then from there we go to a mental health hospital in the state via ambulance. I remember believing the ambulance is a front of some kind, as we were being followed by a bunch of seemingly normal cars. I don't struggle against the restraints because I've resigned myself to being killed by these paramedics. 

I also remember a delusion about that last trip from the doctor to that first mental health place where I thought my answer to this doctors line of questioning determined where I went, and I had answered incorrectly so I was going to a bad place. 

Anyway, my family is allowed to transport me from the mental hospital to a different one in our home state. At this point I had been catatonic for a little bit (the drugs they gave me might have contributed?) but had come out of it mostly. Still believing in horrible conspiracies but at least talked some (the night before we left my brother was allowed to sleep in my room in a chair and I thought he was sent by the mafia to kill me. I also vividly remember having the sensation of ""tripping"" and seeing words crawling on all the walls). 

A lot more stuff happened at the mental hospital I went to since I spent 27 days there, but this is already way too long. The thing that is still bothering me s that they never found a diagnosis that fit. One time an aide sat me down when I was having somewhat of an episode and he said ""Why are you here?!"" And I was like ""I honestly don't know"" and that's when he made me ""admit"" I was there because of drugs (I only ever smoked weed). And that I needed to get off drugs. That's the closest they came to explaining how this happened to me. They messed with my prescriptions until they found a cocktail they thought made me most normal, but they were all pretty low dosages. I honestly still wonder if the drugs were making everything worse. 

After I got out I found I had extreme anxiety problems that were not present before. I could not function and I tried to start working an internship way before I should have. I was seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist but the only thing either of them could say I had was PTSD from the trauma of the breakdown. I don't believe I got anything from this therapy, or any of the previous therapists I've ever been to in my life for that matter, so I really don't get the point. I'm willing to concede maybe I haven't found the right one, but 0/4? seems like maybe not everyone can get something useful from it. 

Bottom line is I have no idea if this was an isolated incident or if this is in some way indicative of how I'll be in the future. Or maybe the nurse was right and since I smoked weed I just fried my brain (which is not how I thought weed works but hell im at a loss). I've been doing great the last five-six months, I have a job an apartment and the same girlfriend (she's a fucking trooper hanging in there with me but she has extreme anxieties herself),but I just feel that event looming over me. Like at any time I could start to slip back into it and not come out of it this time. 

Tl;dr I had an episode of psychosis that lasted between 10-15 days (roughly) and was never given a valid explanation, worried it could happen again"

9kwwn6,2,2018-10-02,"A country, a skill, an industry i’d like to be apart of, where do i go from here?",absoluteolly,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9kwwn6/a_country_a_skill_an_industry_id_like_to_be_apart/,"Hi there, so i currently live in Istanbul, a year ago i graduated with a bachelors in visual communications from the arts university of bournemouth. Im well rounded and maleable, if that is something i can say, i.e. i can generally pick up a skill i find interesting and with enough dedication i can get profficient with it, and i do so frequently to spark that interest, however this means i am more of a jack of all trades master of none sort of person. 

That being said, to my understanding it is easier to be ‘wanted’ by employers if you are very good at one thing, so having generally been a very indecisive person, i tried to wittle things down and pinpoint the three aspects i describe in the title.

1) A new country: I am a dual citizen. Half British, Half Turkish. I have lived in Turkey my entire life, I went to an IB school here that operated as an American International school. As a Turkish citizen as of the age of 21 we are required to do mandatory military service, however as a dual citizen i have the option to suspend this by oriving thta i am studying abroad, i did this and currently have 2 years more suspensions, I can then suspend this indefinitely until the age of 39 by earning a paycheck abroad, the go to logoical choice would have been the UK, but i honestly was never a fan of my lifestyle while I did live there to study. So i started lookingat places with similar climates and enviornements as Istanbul, and concluded that Vancouver, Canada might be conceivable option, because as a british citizen i have the option to work in Canada for up to a year without something like an H1B visa before applying for citizenship there. I had considered the US, but the difficulty of migration is rather off putting. So that is my location of choice thus far.

2) A skill: As ive said i have a hindering issue of having a broad interest in a plethora of activities and skills ( i sincerely hope this doesnt make me seem protencious ). I think this starts to speak for itself with the paths i chose after high school. Coming out of school this was an issue so i picked what i was strongest in which happened to be Art, so I studied Visual communication (Graphic Design, Editorial, crafts(book making etc), Illustration, Typography, Front end development and some more) to try and find a focus, i never really came to a conclusion again as i really enjoyed dabbling in every aspect of the study. But as I want to get a move on in my life so i can pursue those interests with less worry and more comfort I once again chose what i was strongest in. After some experience with internships here Istanbul the conclusion was that my strong suit was illustration and that i disliked the environments of advertising agencies.

3) The industry: The problem is i am not as passionate about illustration as id like to be. I do enjoy it, and i am very much okay with pursuing an early career in illustration.

I am a type of person that likes to make things easy for myself, thats not to say i dont take on difficult tasks, but rather I actively work to get out of / or quickly solve aspects of my life, if i do not enjoy it, if they do not offer valuable development for my learning, or if they make me uncomfortable. Im sure thats pretty standard i just wanted to make a point of it, i dont really want to work a job i dont have to.  

That being said, what i am passionate about are games and esports, this is the industry i have largely had on my mind in particular over the last year. 

After job searches (coming across jobs titled as Art director, Junior Graphic Designer and the like that seem to come closest to what i would be interested in) in that time i have not seen an opening in that industry for an entry level job with my marketable skills, or rather i have come across a few, but they are that, few and usually expect more experience than i have, and ar not actually in Vancouver.

I have also actively been looking at jobs (linkedin, indeed.com etc) within the design industry as well, and im starting to feel that i am either being unrealistic, or im not looking in the right places, or the right job titles. Perhaps im being a bit too picky, but having had chronic depression for most of my memorable life id really like to fcous on getting of the door with a smile on my face. So id really appreciate the help trying to figure out what the hell it is i should be doing.

If any would like it i have a minimalist cv i can send in the morning.

I really appreciate you reading through this garbage and all the help that might come with it.

I apologise if i havent been concise about something, or perhaps i havent gone into enough detail on anything in particular, please ask for clarification if thats the case.

Thank you."

I'd been trying for the last year or so to teach myself programming and get an internship. I succeeded (yay!). But just a week in I hate it. I stare at the same problem almost constantly for 8 hours, everyone I work with is a shut in, and I'm barely writing new code so much as trying to work around what other people have built. I don't really know what I expected and obviously I'll give it more time, but I feel very unfulfilled doing this. 

On the other hand, I have an IT Helpdesk Job as well. Everyday I'm running around fixing people's computers, troubleshooting network issues, VNC'ing into people machines and helping them with software issues. I'm juggling a lot of things at once, getting the chance to move around, and no two days are the same... And I friggen love it. The satisfaction I get from solving someone else's problem is huge.

That said... I don't know where to go from here. Alot of people see helpdesk as an entry level position because they don't like the work, but I do. Will higher levels of IT (and better paying) still bring me that satisfaction. And also what other types of careers can I look at?

I had an internship in marketing, and it was very much the opposite for me. While I talked to people on social media, it was just rehashing a talking point and I felt incredibly dishonest. Also, though a lot of people crave a 'creative' job, I really disliked that some of my work had no parameters. I never felt as If I was doing things the right way, good enough, or that it was useful to people. A very different feeling from seeing someone's screen light up and know that I'm heading in the right direction.

My parents always pushed me away from labor jobs because I wasn't the most hard working kid. But I honestly can see myself working well in some sort of trade job, fixing plumbing or installing a new cabinet. 

I'm just not really sure, my life has always been on a different track. I'd appreciate any advice you have.

Using a throwaway to prevent identification.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

I have been lucky enough to receive intern offers from two quantitative prop trading shops, with one wanting me to focus on quantitative development and the other quantitative trading. The two companies are roughly equal in terms of prestige and compensation.

My technical interests mainly lie in probabilistic modeling (random processes, stocalc, etc) and machine learning. From what I have read, that makes me sound like a better fit for a quantitative researcher role. When I mentioned something like that to the two companies, both assured me that their position would have me work very closely with researchers and that it would be easy to switch if I so desired. 

Personally, I am a hyper-competitive individual, but often fall into traps where I take on so much stress I make myself miserable. I love learning new things and conquering new challenges, which has turned me off from traditional development (which I find monotonous).

&amp;#x200B;

As I am new to the industry, I am having a tough time deciding which offer I should pick. Here is what I see as the main differences:

Pros of trading

* New challenges and problems every day that involve fast-paced solutions
* Probably (much?) higher compensation down the road
* Seems to be a more prestigious role if I do not get/want a return offer
* Might be a slightly better company fit
* Better location and better in-office perks

Pros of development

* Much less stress and an easier pace
* Slightly better hours (40 plus 5 for lunch vs 50 with lunch at your desk)
* Easier to move into research as I would be working directly under a researcher
* I have met the team and really liked them

I'd love to do something like this, but there's just one hiccup: cost is about $10,000, even with the student/alumni discount.  that seems pretty fuckin unreal, is that normal for something like this?  would this be worth it in the long run?

there's 5 spots left, so I have to decide ASAP.  any help is appreciated, thanks.

Currently I'm in my penultimate year completing a BS Computer Science degree. The pay is monkey balls in the UK; senior developers in high cost of living areas earn half of what graduates make in low cost of living area in the US.

I'm thinking that if I can get into a corporate that has offices in the US, I could apply for an internal transfer via L1 visa. IMO, it's less luck based because H1B is a lottery and it'll be almost impossible to get a job offer in the US without work authorization.

This year I'm going to aim at getting an internship at a smaller company that won't ask difficult leetcode questions. I'm pretty bad at leetcode/hackerrank right now. I can solve easy questions and some mediums. But the dynamic programming and hard questions will leave me stumped for hours. I think if I grind it for 6 months (or by getting a tutor) I'll have a chance of getting a good tech job at FaceAmaGoogMicro next year. Maybe after a year of working in their UK office they might accept an internal transfer request? Or is that delusional/unrealistic? I imagine lots of UK employers will be hoping for an internal transfer because of the huge salary differences.

1. What is the work life balance like? I've seen multiple online forums mentions poor work-life balance, but they engineers I interviewed with seemed confident in a 40 hour work week consistently.
2. How competitive is Cerner's pay for Software Engineers? I don't have a strong grasp on what a good starting salary is for new grads in software engineering. Cursory internet research suggests starting salary is around $65,000 - $70,000. I may be blinded by the Microsofts and Amazons of the world, but this seems rather low for a Medium CoL area.
3. How much room is there for growth within the company? I don't mind starting off at a lower than average  salary if there is room to reach a more adequate one down the line.

I was finishing my CS degree, and wasn't really able to find the time to get more into Android after work, so everything I learnt during the internship was in the office. The first couple of days I was given some simple tasks like change some colors/images/fonts, add new TextViews, reposition the elements of a layout. But with each week, the tasks became harder and harder and since I had no experience with Android, I was just googling the best way to handle my tasks and didn't really had the chance to learn the whole platform this way. For example, a new screen was needed in the app we're developing, so I had to learn how activities are created and how layouts are attached to them. Next task was to fix a bug with the location. Now I had to learn how the location works in Android. I was jumping from one task to another without really getting into much detail, just the bare minimum of what I needed to know to either fix a bug, or add something new to the app. The good thing was, that we had a senior Android developer, who I could ask for help or to review my changes from time to time and point out any mistakes. Now that he left, I am the only one responsible for everything about our Android app, and I feel like I am not capable to handle all these responsibilities like creating a new SDK from scratch, or rebuilding the app we currently have. I don't have a deep knowledge of the platform I work with (for example, it took me whole day today to find out that DateTimeFormatter existed and it's much easier to use that instead of writing 10 methods to validated a date input). I am not that familiar with Android Studio. I don't know how to test properly my code. I still don't know how to properly read my stacktrace sometimes. But I want to know all of that. And now that I graduated, I have all the time after work to practice and learn more of what I need to. So what are the best ways I can start learning this stuff? Should I just start one of Google's courses for beginners and move to the harder ones as I progress and pick up and practice all the new things I learn from there? Or simply open the docs and read and practice along? Any advice is very much appreciated!"

On the other hand, I am not sure as to what kind of tech Mastercard is involved in, other than that I might have been put into their C# and .NET team, which is something I am not looking to work on. Below, I have outlined their location and compensation details.

* American Express
   * $75000 annual salary, $5000 signing bonus, 10 weeks internship. Averages to about \~$46/hr
   * Located in Sunrise, Florida (suburb of Ft. Lauderdale),  although I had mentioned in the interviews I preferred New York City

   * $24/hr, $5000 signing bonus, 10-week internship. Averages to about \~$34/hr. 
   * Located in O'Fallon, Missouri (suburb of St. Louis?)

Location wise, I feel both of these locations don't have that great tech scenes (I may be wrong, I have no idea), and since I am an international student, I definitely need a return offer from whichever company I intern for due to post-graduation visa issues, or should be able to find something else in the area with tech opportunities.

December. I’m so excited yet so scared at the same time. 

My whole life I’ve grown up with the mindset that I need to be strictly professional in any job &amp; career to ever make a name for myself within any company or business that decides to take a chance on me. This has always been completely fine with me, as I like the challenge of being put outside my comfort zone to perform well in a work environment - it’s thrilling to me.

On the other hand, I’ve also used college as a time to experience new mindsets and ideologies. I’ve learned more than I ever thought I would about myself along the way and have really turned into a person I’m proud &amp; comfortable to be. I figured out how to understand anxiety &amp; depression and that they are very are real in my life. I always used to push away the thought of them being apart of my life because I was under the impression that I was mentally capable of handling anything that could come my way but quickly realized (once shit hit the fan HARD in my life) that this is not the case.

I’m much better now - I’ve learned how to cope with these struggles through various outlets such as yoga, clean eating, medical marijuana, spiritual walks, etc. Soul searching, essentially. I’ve really adapted a (for lack of a better word) ‘hippie’ heart, as I’m drawn in by anything that screams the culture of positive vibes, open minds, and free-spirit. This way of life truly brings me a sense of complete happiness. I feel as if I’ve been able to start actually living my life instead of hiding behind it through my past troubles. 

Now to get on with my current dilemma - I’m at a crossroads. I would love love love more than anything if I could continue with this lifestyle I’m currently living, but be able to make a career for myself &amp; be financially secure. Ideally, being in an environment that’s challenging but not bring an enormous stress-bubble back into my life because of not enjoying what I do or being unhappy in this uber-professional atmosphere that doesn’t feel fitting to who I am. Don’t get me wrong, I consider myself very professional when I can &amp; want to be, but I just want to make sure it’s in the right environment to do so. I just can’t imagine myself pushing numbers into a computer everyday or doing something that’s not very stimulating to help grow my wonder for life. 

How do I get my career &amp; personal interest to align? Why do I feel so torn between financial success &amp; sincere happiness? How do I merge the two?

I would very much so enjoy a career that can give me a consistent paycheck (enough to cover rent, student loans, and everyday living expenses) &amp; health insurance. Other than that, I’m flexible. 

My degree is in Linguistics, with a smidge of marketing &amp; communications experience thanks to an internship at a local business a few semesters back, but my interests consistent of culinary arts (always have &amp; always will love to create masterpieces in the kitchen - I even have been told several times I have great potential within this field, but no actual real-world experience), modeling (no actual experience, but it intrigues me more than most things and I feel as if I could be successful with this as well - not to toot my own horn or anything), and becoming involved with the marketing side to the cannabis industry. I believe there is a lot of untapped career potential within this industry (that is growing by the day) that I would love to invest myself in, but am unsure how to obtain a career in this field, considering I have zero experience to put on paper regarding this field. 

Am I just SOL or do these seem like realistic goals &amp; dreams? I’m craving a successful future that brings me genuine happiness, I just need to know where to start &amp; what to look for. Thanks in advance for all the constructive criticism and positive feedback. "

Fall 2017 - Switched from mechanical to CS

Summer 2017 - CS internship

Fall 2017 - Had MSFT and G interviews for FT, got absolutely wrecked.

Spring 2018 - Applied to lots of smaller companies, got offers at most of them (had 8 offers around 60-85K). 

May 2018 - graduated with a ME/CS double, took the 85K offer in NoVA. 


Based on my competency level compared to my peers from university, I feel like I should have a much better shot at passing Big N interviews. Most of them are moving to Seattle next spring with FT at Big N. Now that I'm actually done with the CS curriculum (only halfway done last time I did the Big N interviews) and have some more real world experience under my belt, I feel quite a bit more confident. I was successful in CS at school, but was definitely lacking in experience cramming the whole curriculum into a year and a half. 

My question is, when should I reapply to Big N, and should I apply for industry hires or new grad roles? I was planning on staying at my current company for about a year, but if the threshold for new grad positions is 1 year post graduation, I'd be fine jumping ship a couple months earlier. I feel like, based on my total experience, I'd be closer to most new grads who spent 4 years just focusing on software. "

- I changed to CS major late so I dont have a legit software engineer internship.

Talked to a variety of companies all the way from local ones to big names like Google and SendGrid. 

Half of the recruiters/engineers there that I talked to seemed impressed with my personal projects and I held conversation with some of them for about 30 minutes and I felt like it went well.  One engineer even gave me his personal business card and said ""let's keep in touch"". The thing is, all of them though said we will review your resume or make sure to apply online too even after looking at my resume for 2 minutes. No phone screen offers or anything like that at all even after going over my resume. Is this normal? 

Why are they at the career fair if they just want you to apply online anyways? I hear stories of people getting internships directly at career fairs, but I felt that the experience was really underwhelming. I guess it might have to do with the fact that I am a sophomore and companies are mostly looking for juniors, idk?

How has your internship been at career fairs? How can you really step up your game at them? I am a good talker, and I picked good subjects on my resume to talk about and also asked the other party questions too. 

How do you guys pitch yourself or introduce yourself to recruiters? 

For some background info:
I would say I have a decent resume with 2 mediocre personal projects that I did freshman year, and a really good one I started in the summer that everyone was interested in. I have a 3.67 gpa with a 4.0 CS gpa. I did a high school software dev internship(unpaid) and I was a research assistant for a civil engineering lab that cleaned dirty data with Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming into college I wanted to pursue a mechanical or electrical degree but was placed as an undeclared major. I was told that I could still transfer into the engineering school after my freshman year but needed to make sure that I made the cut off GPA which was roughly a 3.8. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my sophomore year I'm sitting in my first mechanical engineering class.

&amp;#x200B;

In my sophomore year I had no idea what I wanted to do but I knew I wanted to study abroad before I graduated. That summer before my junior year I spent a summer in Barcelona which was also my first time outside of the U.S.

&amp;#x200B;

Going into junior year I knew that I needed an internship or else I'd be going into my senior year with no real working experience. The course load that I had for my junior year was intense and to place the cherry on top I was getting rejection letter after rejection letter sent to my inbox. A whole year into the recruiting process I landed an internship in April. It was at a small company but that late in the game I was more than willing to take anything to build my experience. I should also probably note that I found myself an amazing girlfriend at the end of my junior year. 

&amp;#x200B;

My senior year was definitely one for the books. To keep the story short I was my mom's primary giver while she battled pancreatic cancer. At the same time I was a full time student and commuted back forth from my hometown to my college town. You're probably wondering why I didn't just save myself the trouble and take off for one semester. As a first generation college student I told myself if I had the chance to finish out and give my mom the opportunity to watch her only child walk the stage then I would give it my 110%. Unfortunately, she passed away almost a year ago in October and I walked across the stage in May. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of taking summer classes to finish up my degree over the summer, I was found myself working at a chemical manufacturing company in central Texas. I realized that college isn't a race. Take your time, spread out your classes and get as much experience as you can before you graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I'm in work out clothes and there's a bunch of recruiters at my university for a recruiting event. I've received a bunch of emails from the engineering department about this event but just ignored them considering I never do to well at these type of events. Going with my gut feeling that I should just shoot my shot I do a last minute audible and head to the library to print my resume to talk to the recruiters. The outcome of deciding to shoot my shot? A full time offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this story is all over the place but I'm just sitting here feeling the need to give everyone that is currently down in the dumps a glimpse of hope. If you're thinking about talking to that recruiter, asking that girl/guy for their number or whatever it is that you're wanting to do, you should definitely go a head and shoot your shot. "

I clearly wasn't good at writing code, an Internship with a startup early on gave me a taste of what Sales and Marketing is like, so I decided to head that way. Left the last startup job as I didn't see a clear growth path and saw everyone else in the team but me get promoted over the course and basically everyone in the team of 5 was at a senior level to me. 

New gig - Was hired just for my comm skills and fancy college degree on my resume. A month later the founder(who hired me) isn't happy - says I have great work ethic but can't take a lead for shit

*(For context - It's an online accounting firm made of 6 people - 2 accountants, 2 developers, the founder and myself - and I need to team up with the accountants push them to write content on blogs, Quora, etc),* 

Now the founder expected more from me being from a nice college, startup experience yada yada. Had like 3 of these talks - Last one of those I was asked If I feel the team is inferior and why do I not interact casually with them often. I'm realizing day after day that is actually the case(I feel the rest of the team being inferior). 

Also I've seen in more than one instances that the founder, who I think is a smart guy, seems to get really arrogant several times and doesn't allow me to make decisions in terms of marketing - and I'm left with doing tasks like writing and designing emails, which seems to get boring over time.  
It's been 4 months into the role and I'm not also seeing any significant results and I've been working my ass off. I wasn't given a hike off my last CTC as he mentioned the startup was not yet profitable, which is actually the case, but the founder is a rich guy with decade worth of Investment Banking tech experience. 

My question - is it too early to decide to leave for a bad fit, before I stay some more time and at least see some results of my work? I was hired as a Growth Hacker and all I pretty much just send emails and write a lot while not making a lot of money, so it gets really frustrating. I'm turning 24 and don't really have any savings at this point(Ended up loosing a lot in stocks)

Any kind of advice in general is much appreciated."

I went out for drinks with a group and this guy D, groped me grabbing my waist and breasts and ass. I pushed him off me repeatedly, and he kept coming back and doing it again. After this happened several times, at least 3, another guy in the group grabbed D and kept him away from me.

D knew I was angry the next day, that much was obvious to the rest of the group. He said that he had blacked out drunk and didn't remember that part of the night. I was worried that I would hurt my career if I kicked up a fuss, so I didn't.

Later during that internship, D made jokes to me about how he was good at climbing, had climbed onto the roof of his old school, and would climb into my window sometime. (He never did fyi) 

He also make jokes like ""I'm gonna rape you"" wtf ""Don't get mad, I said I'm gonna GRAPE YOU"". 

I didn't report any of this because I heard bad things happen to women in my industry who report harassment. (I no longer hold this view, I should of reported it all) I did often make it clear that I didn't like those jokes, by telling him he was being creepy, and that his jokes were not funny.

After the internship, I said over text that I did not want to see him anywhere, to get texts or calls from him, to have him contact me or come around me at all. He replied with a lot of texts, and unanswered calls, at first begging my forgiveness, then basically telling me ""fuck you"" for not responding or being willing to work things out.

I said again that he should not contact me, and he didn't speak directly to me again. However over the next year we did have a class together where he took snapchats of me, when I was unaware, and captioned them with insulting stuff and sent them to mutual friends and acquaintances.

----

All this ended about 2 years ago. So right now, I no longer am afraid of kicking up a fuss, like I used to be. But I don't know whether I should report all that.

On one hand, I am worried for the safety of other women he works with, or becomes fixated on in the future.

On the other, it has been a long time since I've seen him, and I don't know if I have enough to make it worth reporting.

Should I file a report? What would likely come of it? I'm thinking that even if this stuff is on record, it could help some other woman in the future. Like, proving there's a pattern of behavior.

I just graduated with a BS in CS &amp; Info Sec and I’m not sure where to go from here. I have no experience and no internships. My job experience has been mostly customer service and tech support at a wireless carrier and cable company. I’m tech savvy and I know the basics of C++, Python, and some SQL. I’m not exactly sure what I’d like to do and that’s really due to not having experience so I can’t say what I like or dislike. I have some interests such as security, networking, and databases (database systems was my favorite class in undergrad). I just don’t know what I should be applying for and or what I’m even qualified for. I’ve read so many times that you have to start out doing help desk, but I’ve also been told that with a CS degree, I should be able to get something better than help desk. I was told I should be applying to software engineer positions. The thing with that is I think I’m a bad programmer. I’ve read the kinds of questions they ask you in technical interviews, and I’d fail miserably. I think I could be become better programmer, but I feel like what would help me is seeing how it all comes together in a world setting. I’d like to see what is done on a daily basis and how the topics and concepts from class translate to the job. Basically things you get an understanding of when you intern, but I’ve graduated already. Ideally, I see myself doing something that’s kind of a mix of IT and CS.

Any suggestions/advice on where to go from here would be greatly appreciated. And I’m really interested in what types of positions I should be applying to."

Since December 2017 I’ve been working in a department on my campus as the marketing intern, but this has mainly required doing all the graphic design for the department.

My former boss left at the beginning of August, and without my knowledge the director changed the title and job description of my boss. No one ever mentioned this to me, but I only realized something was up when my new boss completely took over a project that I had already completed and had approved. 

I was fairly taken aback when my new boss started from scratch on the posters and other promotional materials for an event that I had already finished. 

I sat down with her at the end of that week and asked her about her position, this is when I found out that they had changed the job title and role entirely. I also clarified what I understood my role to be. I had gotten the sense that she was uncertain what my responsibilities were, so I wanted to ensure we were on the same page. 

She told me that the director of the department was looking to change the way we have been working, in her words “from advertising to marketing”. But other than that she didn’t have any specifics.

The next week I also had a conversation with the director and asked him if my role would inherently change with this new shift, and also asked for specifics of what that shift entails. 

And he didn’t really give me an answer.  

All he truly said was that there are going to be changes, but he can’t tell me what they are because he doesn’t know what they will be.

This was all several weeks ago and since then my new boss has been taking more and more of what I thought were to be my responsibilities. I’m feeling very uncertain of myself like I’m incapable of doing my job. 

The issue is that I feel an obligation to remain here. The director reaffirmed in our meeting that he expects me to be here until I graduate. I also used to really enjoy working here up until this point. Now I’m dreading work and my motivation has dropped. 

But there is also this hope that maybe things will improve if I stick it out. Maybe in two months everything will be figured out and I’ll enjoy working here again. But I also fear that maybe things will be the same.

I’m looking for advice on whether it is worth it to stay or not. Would it look bad on my resume? What do I say to future employers when they ask why I left? Should I stick with it?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a senior engineering student at University and am posting around a little bit to get some various opinions on this situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

To get those in the know, the beginning of the Fall semester is the prime time for recruitment with engineers at my school.   There are multiple career fairs and employment workshops of the like.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, the company I interned for last summer gave me a full time offer for post grad - Wohoo!  Unfortunately, this position is a project management position and I'm one of those nerdy engineering students who actually wants to go down a more technical route (for my first job at least).  So I've been going to the career fairs, got some interviews, and moved on to the second round in a few.  In particular, the company that is looking the most positive is doing product development with a top appliance company.

&amp;#x200B;

So my big predicament in this - I really want to go into the automotive or aerospace industry eventually.  The company my current offer comes from and the appliance company that invited me for a second round both are not in these industries.  With the appliance company, I will get the opportunity to go get my masters degree in mechanical engineering paid for at a top ten engineering university in the country and to do actual engineering work in product development (which is the type of engineering work I want to do, just not in the industry I want).  The project management position, however, if a for sure deal and is an extremely good offer about 15% above average starting salary for new grads like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also ponder taking an extra semester and doing a spring internship in the automotive or aerospace industry (I've made some good connections with 1 automotive company in particular) and just work there for the spring/summer.  That way I for sure get into the industry that I want and move from there.  Only problem is I will miss out on living my last semester in college with my best friends.

&amp;#x200B;

The outlook that looks the most probable right now is working for the appliance company and getting my masters degree to make me a more attractive candidate when moving industries.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on the situation?  Am I possibly thinking way to hard about it right now and just go with the flow?  Any feedback you guys have is really appreciated.

I'll just start with saying where I'm at.  I'm currently a junior at  a decent state university and not sure if I should continue with a career in computer science.

In high school I was very good at math and science. I was also good at English and history, but didn't enjoy them as much. I was introduced to software when I took AP Computer Science my senior year of high school. We learned basic stuff like java syntax, some data structures,  sorting algorithms, etc. At the time I enjoyed being given a problem, writing up some code, and then solving it and having it do stuff on a computer. After that class I decided to major in software engineering in college. I don't dislike my software classes now, but I can't remember the last time I was ever excited to go to one either. However, I do think I still enjoy when I write code and it does what I want, but that seems relatively short term.

I interned at a small-medium sized, but relativity well known, finTech company, and was pretty fortunate to get this internship. I got placed on the data engineering team, and got to use stuff like Spark, stuff related to the hadoop ecosystem, and other technologies. I got to interact with data scientists who did stuff with machine learning. It was sorta interesting, but I was essentially just moving data around. And it wasn't that I was just doing ""intern work"", that's what some other employees were doing as well. I just felt like some corporate monkey. 

I've thought about if I could just find a company that did something I really supported or a company I enjoyed then it'd be fine, but I Just don't know if I can sit behind a desk all day typing on a computer for 20-40 years. A doctor gets the satisfaction of helping other people. A teacher gets to have a positive effect (I would hope it's positive) on people's lives. I don't think I'll get much satisfaction from making some tool/piece of software that other companies will use.

I have a good gpa, a personal project, and an internship all behind my belt. I think I'll intern again next summer to see if this is truly something I want to do. I know I'm capable of having a ""good"" career in software, but I just don't know if I'll be happy doing it."

I am here today to ask a few questions about which part of IT I should get into after I finish my degree.

Background: I live in NYC. I am in my third year of college and I am a computer system technology major. I just joined a Tech Support internship a month ago and currently working in a public school. (I am responsible for printers, smart boards, iMacs, and few windows machines.) This internship will last for three years but since I am graduating in two years, I am planning to resign it if I get a full time job after I graduate.

This major has four paths I can choose: database, network &amp; security, IT operation, and software development. I know I will either have to go for network&amp;security or IT operation because those two paths are most interested to me.

My few questions are:
1. Is cyber security have more opportunities compare to IT operation in NYC?

2. I am planning to get the CCNA certificate because internship experience and a degree might notnbe enough to land a full time IT job. Which CCNA should I go for before I graduate?

3. What is the salary gap between security and IT operation careers? I know I shouldn't ask this but I am very curious.

The tldr version : I am a international student with a masters degree in data analytics. I have a job offer that is kinda ml related to my coursework ( it's more of a Java based etl role) that I'm not really keen to accept. I honestly believe I can crack better jobs, but I want to take this because I figured I can always switch later. I really like working on data analytics problems ( and have a bit of experience with it as well), but the idea is to pay back my loans as soon as I can.

My education : I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and a masters in data analytics and engineering. A lot of online courses, but I wouldn't dream of including that on my resume.

Work ex : I worked with Uber India *while* I was in college for 3 years ... I was part of a startup which handled marketing for Uber. During my masters, I worked as a data analyst intern for a restaurant chain. I also worked as a research assistant (the position didn't exist as such, I created it by talking to the professor). Most employers have a tough time considering my profile because they argue I don't have any real work experience ( work ex during college doesn't count apparently).

Languages and technologies I'm comfortable with : sql ( and other rdbms), python, machine learning, deep learning and visualization tools.

My positives  : while this is a purely subjective assessment, I truly believe that I am at least better than a percentage of the competition when it comes to my technical chops and my ability to understand and translate business requirements. I also tend to and like working on unique projects ( for instance, some of my peers might work on kaggle datasets that are completely clean and just end up applying standard sklearn algos), and I have documented proof of the same. Haven't seen interviewers ask questions about this though. 

The negatives : no ""real"" work experience, I'm on my f1 opt so companies are shy to hire people like me, I'm not extremely good at interviews.

The area where I need advice : I'm looking to pay off my student loans as soon as I can (the idea is, the longer I wait, the worse it'll get). I have one job offer in hand, but the work isn't that exciting, it's on technologies I don't like (but know), it's in a different state and average pay . Do you suggest I keep looking for new jobs or accept this one and figure out how to switch later?
I've had a few interviews that went to the final round, so I think I can safely say I'm not a complete idiot who has no idea what to do.

Any thoughts? More information you need?

Edit 1 : I'm located in the US, if that helps. "

I’m a junior in college majoring in Interactive Media Design. Growing up I really loved artistic things, but have no prior experience of design, etc. I’m taking coding classes right now and I’m super excited about them. I love learning about the codes and there’s not a day where I don’t want to learn about them, however after doing tons of research in UI/UX design, I’m worried I don’t have enough experience in using some of their programs like others. I’m literally starting from scratch, but I know for a fact I want to go into the tech/design field. 

I’m going to be speaking to an advisor about this on Friday, but would love to hear everyone’s advice. Does anyone have any outside resources or advices? I really want to pick up some experience before entering my major and applying for an 2019-2020 internship. 

Thanks for the help in advance everyone :)."

Advice,2020choice,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9li2qp/effect_of_unconventional_last_name_change_on_job/,"Hi guys, so I'm going through kind of a complicated situation regarding my name. I am changing my complete name (first and last) for personal reasons just having to do with the fact that I've never liked my name and that I came from an abusive family  (I really didn't want to share that last name anymore). So I made the decision to get a legal name change (all the papers have been filed already). The only issue is, I'm currently on my second internship and the contacts I've gained here annd from my first internship are going to be crucial at me finding a job (I'm nearing the end of college). Everyone in my ""professional network"" knows me as ""newfirstname\_oldlastname"". I'm just really afraid of the ramifications of changing my name (as a male college student, it isn't exactly the ""typical"" thing to do). Where I am interning and just the general field I'm going into is pretty small and tight-knit, so if there's something ""off"" about you pretty much everyone will end up knowing lol. I'm just afraid everyone will think I'm a total weirdo or some sort of fraudster for doing this and that it will have a devastating effect on my job search. I kind of had this thought today after my first informational interview where the guy asked for my resume and I didnt know what name to put on there ugh. To top it off, (and this is by total, complete coincidence), someone high up in my internship shares my new ""picked"" last name so I'm afraid it would be extra weird if I start announcing to people that my last name has changed once the name change is officially approved. And I know that especially in fields where competition is high, anything on a person's resume or record that raises an eyebrow can end up killing their chances. Any advice on how to handle this?"

Recently I’ve been trying to figure out what school would be best for me to go to. A little background, I have completed my AA and have been accepted into a few Florida schools but have narrowed it down to two. 

The first is [UCF in Orlando](http://ucf.catalog.acalog.com/preview_program.php?catoid=3&amp;poid=807 ) which is about 4 hours away from my family. It would cost roughly $25k-$30k to graduate. My gripe with this choice is that it’s far away from family. I am very close to my family and it means a lot to be relatively close. Good program and a lot of opportunity for internships. 

The second is [FGCU (Florida gulf coast university)](https://www.fgcu.edu/eng/softwareengineering/softwareengineering-bs.aspx). It would cost roughly half of UCF because of the grants I would get. It’s only about 30 minutes from my family which is great, but I don’t think it’s as good as UCF. Not sure about what kind of opportunities they have for CS majors but I am waiting to hear back. 

Edit: I am also considering FIU as it’s about 2 hours from me but I am not sure about cost yet. I do know that good companies recruit from there though. Although I have heard of people transferring out of the program. 


I’d love to hear advice from anyone as I am really not sure. Thanks in advance!!"

I made a post earlier about how I faced reality with my technical skills and seriously need to wake up and start grinding. Because I was an idiot and neglected truly understanding DS&amp;A last year it has really come back to bite me in the ass and I know the next fucking hirevue I get is just gonna be another frustrating 60 minutes of guaranteed rejection. 

I know I shouldn't lose hope, but I also know I didn't deserve have the second-rounds and on-sites I got this summer. From this point on I am going to go back and learn all the essentials I missed and hope to be competent when I apply for full-time positions next year.

With all that being said, is it much harder for new grads to get full-time jobs if they have zero internship experience?  I really wish I found this thread earlier because from what I have read it seems like almost all interns pretty much get a return offer. Also if anyone has any tips on crash coursing essentials for coding assessments due by next week feel free to leave them here lol."

Now this sounds incredibly stupid but it's the truth. Every class in university we are instructed to download new software/packages/access servers.

Today i tried to get something working for 1.5 hours including using stack overflow and still no dice. To be fair my classmate trying to help couldn't do it either and just said ""Get linux"". I tried to do that in the past and literally couldn't work it out (i think my pc in incompatible but still).

This cycle just keeps going. I've failed assignments and classes because i couldn't even start writing code yet. It seems like all my peers have an ingrained knowledge of the terminal and servers and linux and troubleshooting and everything and i have no idea on where to even start.

How did they know everything before we even started university? This knowledge seems so varied but basic that there's no 'codeacademy course' to go off (if there is i'd be so keen).

(salary)",emachinez32,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9ljn4z/22_years_old_just_graduated_been_working_for_4/,"Hi r/cscareerquestions!

I'm a 22 year old living in Dallas that recently graduated from CS. Throughout college, I made the unfortunate mistake of not continuously learning (outside of classes) and never thought of working on any sort of side projects to increase my CS knowledge and salary expectations.

I've worked 2 technical internships (Java RESTful API stuff that made absolutely no sense until just recently when I started writing my own .NET Core MVC app) and am currently at a $65k consultant job. I've just wrapped up my first project, and am moving onto my second next week. Both projects have been in the test automation space, which is cool to know/learn, however I find it boring, plus it's not my ultimate goal.

I believe that cloud computing &amp; AI will be the most important/profitable fields in the future, so these are what I want to go into. In an ideal world, I would've built up a better resume/portfolio while in school, and would've been able to get a big-name CS job doing cloud/AI, however that didn't happen.

My goal was (and still is) to develop a good enough skill-set/portfolio within a year of working (so by next summer) to have a ""reputable"" CS job making a minimum of $90k.

How reasonable of a goal is this? Additionally, what steps should I be taking (inside &amp; outside work) to build a strong portfolio to achieve this? I've started (keyword started) on a lot of side-projects (5 or 6), but I find myself constantly jumping from idea to idea, and eventually no project gets completed.

It's a little overwhelming for me to ""pick"" what CS area I should start learning (back-end, front-end, cloud, mobile, automation, etc), and honestly I'm just looking for some guidance about where I should start today, so that in a year's time from now, I can secure a ""good"" CS job making $90k.

Thanks!"

Total amount of printers when I started: 9

We had a 5 man IT team for about 80 workstations and 4 full size server racks where we hosted all our own applications and databases in house. so our fairly large team for the size of the company was rather busy.

of course the intern (yours truly) got all the shitty printer tickets assigned to him.  but a plan to lighten the workload was quickly hatched and with the blessing of the head of it ($HIT) was put into action. A short informal meeting was called.

&amp;#x200B;

The cast:

$me

$HIT

$OM - office manager

&amp;#x200B;

I proceeded to tell the group how much paper we used. how wasteful it was. how many trees died because of us and that my weak little boy scout heart could not take it. (yes I was and still am a scout troop leader)

As an  ""afterthought"" I mentioned the the amount of money we spend on printer paper and toner in the last year and that we had plenty of space on our file servers who are also easy to upgrade if necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the meeting I printed (the irony is not lost on me) signs about saving the rain forest and reducing CO2 emissions and taped them up near all the printers. A few weeks later we canceled the lease on 4 MFP's threw out the desk printers and moved the shiniest and least troublesome MFP from the development office to the central hallway so users had to walk further to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

After my 16 month internship there was only one printer there we estimated that printer usage got down to less than a quarter of what we used to. I had not seen a printer related tickets in the last 2 months.

This is a throw away account, as I'm usually not one to post things like this publicly.

I guess I'll give you the lay-down of my situation: 

A year ago, after a depressive break down at a dead end job left me hospitalized and unemployed, I've decided to move back to my home town in order be certified to build websites. My reasoning was that if I could gain a skill that would be valuable to today's market, in addition to my current BFA, I could potentially give myself a chance to be more employable and financially independent. I signed up with a community college (because for-profit schools are predatory), set up healthy boundaries between me and my family, and felt like I was making a positive change for the future. It seemed like things we're looking up. 

Cut to now, and I am a 26 year-old dead beat who lives out of his grandmother's basement, has to rely on his father for financial support, who's only job prospect is an ""internship"" at a graphic design studio, and who lacks personal discipline/self-organization/planning skills what so ever.

Before I talk about anything else, I will state that I am fully aware that I am the cause of my own misfortune, and as a result, my family have to suffer for my actions. Every time I mess up (scratched my grandmother's car at a garage, get sunblock stains on my mother's furniture, etc.), I go through an emotional break where I end up hating myself for a few days, finally let go, and then proceed to forget everything I should have learned from my own mistakes. Not only that, but I am inconsiderate of other people's feelings, often side-tracked by work that stops me from focusing on other work, and lack the ambition and discipline to actually make actual lasting change in my life.

I am not here to present myself as some ""tragic"" victim of a cruel world. Instead I am going to be truthful: I'm just some asshole who never learns. I live an otherwise privileged life and have a family who, despite screwing them over repetitively, loves me very much. On all accounts, I'm lucky; Other people have it worse. What I realize is that I'm parasitic, I take and never give back, and whenever I try to change this about myself, I just go back to square one. The funny thing about rock bottom is that it's not a one time thing that people hit and progress from their; It's a constant loop of repetitive failure, an inability to learn from past actions and a unwillingness to change bad habits.

At this point, I realized that the only good thing I may contribute to society, as well as my family, would be for me to end myself. Ideally, I would like to go to somewhere beautiful (a national/state park), find an isolated high place, and then jump towards my death and become carrion to whatever finds my remains. I would like to leave a note for my family, sating why I chose to die and instructing them to cremate my remains (if found) and to not hold a funeral. I don't want to be remembered for anything.

This might be a post where I might just ignore it for the next couple of weeks, or I might actually take initiative in my life for once and end things once and for all. All I know is that I want to make sure I don't leave a impact that would significantly harm someone. I understand that killing myself would be detrimental to my family's emotional wellbeing, but in the long run, they would be in a better place not having to worry or take care of someone like me. The only reason I am making this public is mostly trying to find a place to vent. Part of me wants me to think this plan is all wrong, and that I only want verification that I still ""matter"". Also, I feel that telling my therapist the true extent of my plans would land me back into a psychiatric ward, and thus burdening my myself with medical debt.

This has been an issue that I have been dealing with for years now. I guess now I understand that disappearing into the woods would be a better alternative then living the parasitic lifestyle I have now.

TLDR: I am a human parasite who is unable to learn from past mistakes and realize that this is harming everyone I love. Going into the woods to die is a better alternative that putting other people through hell.

In my contract which I signed when I first finished my internship it had a job title from two iterations ago and a totally different wage, it also states I need to give three months notice after working here as long as I have. An intern is being hired to my department to help spread the load but I have no interest in staying even that long. Were I to get a new job and immediately leave (interview upcoming) is that appropriate as in the absence of a full written contract which is up to date I see the advice from HR as a verbal contract which we've gone over several times.

The delicate issue is that no one here knows half of what I do, that i'm looking to move on or even the tools I use day-to-day so were I to leave with no notice period it could cause nightmare issues but I seem to be legally obligated not to work a notice period despite my original contract and I'm definitely not inclined otherwise!"

I'm 21 y/o newbie ""sysadmin"". I started at my current company roughly 3 years ago as an intern and I've transitioned into a solo ""sysadmin"" role after my mentors took on different roles within the company.
I currently support ~500 users with pretty much everything. I'm learning as I go, while trying not to let the place burn down.

I'm swamped and recently I've been getting my ass kicked with randomly occurring lockouts. People are not pleased and since I'm the only one to get mad at I'm facing a decent amount of shit :-)

Every weekend for 3 weeks now, at seemingly random times during the day or night, ~10 of our high-level employees get locked out for no reason. This includes staff like our directors, team leads, and the owner of the company. They want it fixed yesterday, but I'm stuck and can't get anywhere. I've contacted some MSP's but they seem just as ""qualified"" as me to deal with this.

We run Remote Desktop Servers ""in the cloud"" (own hardware in remote DC) via Thin Clients. On these servers we run a workspace client that connects their printers, shares, programs, user profiles, etc. 
There are no Domain-Joined workstations these people can hit with their AD Creds.
Some, not all, have iPhones and iPads with correctly configured Exchange Accounts.

I've been researching and testing, this is what I've found;

* Verified our domain lockout policy; &gt;8 badpwds in 1wk = locked out for a week

* Checked RDS's / DC's for Event 4625, some here and there, but it doesn't seem to be appearing enough to lock the users out. The badpwds occur at their usual start / after lunch times and from their usual workstations.

* Checked our Exchange Server for Event 4625, shit tons of them, seems to be causing the lockouts. Both ""w3wp.exe"" and ""MSExchangeFrontendTransport.exe"" as caller proccesses. All Logon type 8's, networkcleartext.
I also see logins from accounts that simply do not exist, however these don't carry IP's or workstation names.

* Checked users' devices in Exchange, they're the iPhones and iPads we've given them. No rogue devices.

* Checked IIS configuration on MX, only anonymous authentication is turned on. Don't know what else to look for here.

* Checked IIS logs; I see login attempts on our OWA and webmail come in here, but there's no entries for the locked users when the actual lockout occurs. Some 401-errors occur, but they're not occurring for the users that are getting locked out. 200's all the way through.

* Checked IIS logs for unknown devices connecting to mailboxes, but the ""DeviceID""-string in the IIS Logs matches the users' device(s).

* Verified remote logins aren't causing it since I don't see login-attempts on the 2FA token application.

I don't know where to go from here. 
We don't run scheduled tasks under user accounts, don't run scripts to connect shares or printers, we log users off after 4h of inactivity or when a new session is connected,  and I don't see any issues with their mobile equipment. I've built scripts to E-mail me when accounts get locked out so I could manually unlock them if they were important enough, but I don't want to automate unlocking in case of possible bruteforce attempts I'm somehow missing...

So I end up here, asking a more experienced crowd; What would a Sysadmin do?

*Edit* Since everyone seems to be hammering on the lockout policy, I am very aware it's shit. Company culture makes it so my boss can decide ""this is safer because the previous admin told me so"". I've got a meeting lined up where I'm going to discuss it with him.

I am looking for feedback from those who have experience working in industry.

I'm a senior developer by experience level, but I've been gradually moving more and more toward the backend over the years. I was a web developer for 3-4 years, then a backend and API engineer for the last 4-5. I am now looking at moving into a data engineer role. It would be more of a lateral move. I would be learning data modeling, batch processing systems, and streaming systems. I have been really interested in this stuff for a while. I even built a computer at home just to play around with data. I have done a bit of this work in my backend engineering roles, but my work to date has been more feature-focused, so I haven't been able to focus on the data work. I do a lot more API development and that means I am rushing to get something done for the web developers.

My hope is that this data engineer role would be more focused on the data problems, and that I would have the time to develop those skills. Long term I think I want to get into ML and AI. I don't think I will ever be good enough to write my own algorithms, but knowing the data ecosystem would be great. I am predicting that in the future there will be a lot more need for developers who know how to work with data on a large scale and having that background will help me have a good work life, even if i don't continue in the data engineer role for my whole career.

Have you worked in a data engineer role? How does it compare to a more traditional software engineer position?

I’ve been having a really difficult time getting into the industry since graduation (May) and am considering either grad school or a boot camp. 

I know that grad school is a huge commitment, but I love learning and pursuing research. That being said, it’s really difficult for me to tell how much grad school will actually expand my job prospects wrt general software engineering (not trying to become a prof). I’m fairly confident I could get into a program with funding, so I’m not worried about debt here.

Boot camps are pricey, and I’d have to save for a while in order to do one (I’m currently working a job completely unrelated to my degree in order to make ends meet), but it seems like many of them guarantee internships at the end, which may well be worth it. However, it seems like most of the boot camps do web dev, which isn’t my area of interest.

The reality is that she is a massive hypocrite with a life I'll never be able to afford. 

Here are some of the situations I am frustrated with. 

-She's not worked for over 20 years, yet she constantly pretends like she understands how the job market works. She says I should leave my full time job with benefits to get an unpaid/low paid internship with the possibility that they might hire me on for a ""better"" job. 

-She hates Obamacare despite the fact she has always freeloaded on my dad's health insurance. Laughable. 

-She serfs the internet and watches TV all day. She has never pursued a paying job EVER in all the years I've known her. Not even part time. I work with women as old as her who work their asses off because they need to, yet my mother complains how ""busy"" she is. She is the definition of a freeloader who does fuck all every day. 

-Her life is one big vacation. She went to the beach on Monday, just for fun. She plans to go to Germany soon. Meanwhile, my dad is busting his ass at 68 so she can maintain this lifestyle. God forbid my dad ever loses his job or retires.

-""Why are you still living in an apartment at age 28?"" Bitch, you have been living rent free for decades with my miserable dad, who she constantly undermines and back talks. When I tell her that the average house in my area goes for $800k-$1.3million she thinks I'm making excuses.

I am sick of her entitlement. At her age I probably will still be working nonstop. If I even live that long. Meanwhile she is oblivious to my dad working his ass off into old age and thinks I'm not working hard enough(!). Everyone is at fault except for her. 

I don't know how to deal with this, but I am becoming resentful of her (which sucks because we used to be close when I was a kid). We have nothing in common. I suppose I could just ignore her and go ""no contact"" but the last three years have been hard because I see how easy her life really is, while I'm busting my ass just for table scraps. I used to be close to her, and the fact I see her in this new light is difficult. "
9lpldz,2,2018-10-05,How I moved from Industrial Engineering to Software Engineering,AnonProxySwitch,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9lpldz/how_i_moved_from_industrial_engineering_to/,"Hello all,

There is a TL;DR at the bottom. Sorry for typos/formatting I'm on mobile. 

So I saw an individual post on here not too long ago about how awesome he was for getting a job. I also see a lot of people asking how to get into programming/software dev roles without an IT background. This is exactly what I did. I'd like to share my story in the hopes that some may find it useful, some may gain hope, and some will decide to just go out and apply instead of second guessing themselves.

I received my bachelor's degree in industrial engineering. It's centered around optimizing processes and heavily focused on manufacturing. The only ""code"" we wrote (if you could call it that) was R scripts for solving unnecessarily complex optimization problems. I learned Matlab in a previous aerospace engineering class before I switched to industrial engineering. I brought it up to my professor in casual conversation and he actually mentioned he needed an undergrad with scripting experience.

So I applied for two undergraduate research positions in the department and got both! On one of the projects a graduate student helped me learn R which we used to scrape web pages and create neural networks to search for patterns in the data we scraped.

I eventually landed an internship as an industrial engineer the following summer. Some engineers were adding values in excel files and sending them to their boss. I figured why not learn python and automate this process, so I did! I wrote some simple scripts to read in the excel files and output a new file with the correct values that the engineers could just email. Saved them almost half an hour a day!

During my last semester I worked on a senior design project that involved modifying a machine learning algorithm a company was using for stock predictions/trading. I applied for 106 full-time positions during the last three months I was in school at the same time I was working on this project. Embedded system design? Fuck yeah. Mathematician for cracking encryption? I can do it. Need a senior dev? Fuck it hire me instead. I applied for ANYTHING that remotely piqued my interest.

At the end of the semester I had an entry level development position in the bag. A year latter I'm working on building automated CI/CD pipelines in AWS and proof of concepts for migrating our existing IT infrastructure to the cloud. I'm happy to say the least. Here is what I learned:

1.) Be vocal about your professional ambitions. It shows you're interested and the right person may overhear you.

2.) Sieze EVERY opportunity. The will to take an opportunity when it arises is crucial. Don't be rash, but don't wait and second guess your ability either

3.) Learn from everyone. Everyone knows something you don't. Learn about what they do right and what they do wrong. Always listen and ask questions, not matter how dumb you think they are.

4.) Leverage previous experience. So I got my job now by having work experience. I got work experience by doing research. I got my research gig by doing small projects in class. Use previous experience to get more, however possible.

5.) Stay positive. I was so sick of being told no by HR employees who wanted someone with a ComSci background (no offense). I have been financially independent since high school and was afraid I'd be on the street after graduating. Don't give up. Keep applying and keep learning.

Happy hunting to all my up and coming developers!

TL;DR If you want to do dev work, just start trying to learn in any/everyway possible. Ask questions and apply as much as you can. "

I'm trying to apply for summer internships (Junior at university studying Information Systems), and want to have my newest job get me above the other candidates.

My job at the MSP is titled ""Help Desk Specialist"", and it mainly consists of trying to support people who are calling in from our company's supported hotels connect to their WiFi network. Most of the time it includes splash page redirects, but we also need to occasionally manually register devices on their servers, confirm DHCP settings on guests devices, and troubleshoot issues with hotel Access points. This also includes us having to remote into a Windows Server desktop that has additional admin privileges for connecting to those hotel's networks.

We also handle our company's PBX support line, which involves us having to create tickets in Oracle for various product distributions (I think you could think of this as a typical T1 help desk at an internal IT team).

I'm wanting some advice on how to word this in my resume. I really don't know enough yet to word it professionally since I haven't been here long, but I need to have it done soon so I can apply for the internships soon. If anyone can think of some decent ways to describe the job, I'd be able to add it and post a redacted version for your critique.

Walking people through how to connect to WiFi networks that are completely technologically illiterate, rude, or just plain stupid really makes me realize I should pursue a SysAdmin or Developer type position when I get my degree so I can be done dealing with end users.

I feel like everyone who applies to top tier CS schools like CMU or Stanford have the same stats as me, if not better. I heard REA doesn't really boost admission chances, and I was thinking of ED to Cornell as I believe I have a better chance of getting accepted.

I can either:

REA to Stanford, but not get in due to their extremely low acceptance rate, and possibly get rejected from Cornell.

ED to Cornell, and live with regret. I will either get accepted ED or go to a state school.

My problem is that I feel that REA to Stanford won't matter as they are already extremely competitive, but if I ED to Cornell I could possibly get in due to the binding agreement."

With the money from my first real college internship I want to finally build a gaming rig.  I've been surviving off my university laptop that is built for engineering purposes, but it has been lacking in the graphics department on new games.  REALLY wanting to get a computer that can run DOOM:Eternal on high settings, as that is the game I am most hype for - so lets use that as a benchmark.  What can I get to run a new game such as that, with graphics reasonably high?  Looking for advice on a build since my experience is more in the mechanical area rather than computers.

QUESTIONS:

- I'm an Intel guy for processors.  What's the difference between the i7 8700k and 8700?  Any compelling reason to go for i7 over i5?  Favoring i7 because I sometimes to light simulation work, but that can be relegated to my laptop so not a big deal.  

- I don't know a lot about GPU's.  What's the difference between GTX 1080 and 1080 Ti?  How much better are these than the 1070 Ti?  Would it be worth purchasing something from a newer series?  I would prefer to stay with NVIDIA cards.  

- No idea what I should do for CPU cooler, what's something that just works? Don't need anything stupidly flashy.

- Also no idea what MOBO I need.  Any good resources on that?  I just picked one from a recommended list.

- PSU.  What wattage should I aim for?  What brands are best to purchase?

- Case: Don't care for anything flashy.  Something that fits my parts, maybe room for upgrades, ok airflow, not too loud?

- SSD: Would love one.  Any reccomendations?

- HD: 2TB seems good to me.  Good brands to buy, or does this even matter?

- Anything else?  Case fans?  What do you guys have in your rig that you like?

I think that covers the critical parts.  I can deal with peripherals on my own, already have a G502 mouse and Cloud 2 HyperX headset.  Do parts like this tend to go on sale around Christmas?  Because I can wait.  I really just need something that'll last me a good few years; I know the idea of ""futureproofing"" is moot because of how fast this industry moves, but I'd like something that'll play new games for a good while.  Don't need any absurdly powerful 4k VR BS tho.  I'm a total noob at this, so any advice is welcome.

For the curious, my engineering laptop has an NVIDIA Quadro M1000M and an i7-6820 @2.70GHz.  Runs most games on low to medium fairly well but I really want something with a bit of beef."
9lszur,4,2018-10-05,Not prepared for software development?,1883456,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9lszur/not_prepared_for_software_development/,"(I also posted this on CSMajors) I had an internship this summer, and I was placed on a team where I needed to read their codebase. Many of the ideas-like the Spring framework and what each file was doing and what tests did what-I took awhile to grasp. My CS education is heavily focused on C and Java, and I know the real world operates using the scrum model-tight deadlines, changing requirements, and multiple technologies, as opposed to the classroom model of having an assignment. In school, I work hard on these assignments and give myself time to complete them, but I fear I will simply not be able to keep up to speed with the deadlines of a real world software development job or to learn what is needed to meaningfully start working quick enough.There is no textbook to refer to study the codebase of a company, and no one will devote their whole day to explaining it to you, or how to run it. Even if given time, without discrete assignments to complete, I feel like I cannot teach myself something just by reading it, and the time it would take me to grasp what is needed-by writing out the control-flow, for example-is too long for a professional team. Is someone who got through school by allocating a ton of time to work on school assignments completely unprepared for actual software development?"

2)I broke up with my guy after approx 4.5 years of on and off dating some 10 months ago.Sort of had a rebound a while ago but that fizzled out.
3)The only three real friends I'd ever made through the last 4 years have all moved back to their home states and the ones I have here are just the kind that you get drunk with for a night and not the kind you can expect to have your back.
4)My dad is a raging alcoholic and about 4 months ago he got into a petty fight with my mom and beat her up.By the end of it she had a black eye and several bruises and he had a cut on his neck that she'd made as she picked up a knife in self defence.I have two younger siblings out of which my brother is only a 7 year old kid.Following this,on my insistence,my mom threw dad out of the house and he was staying at my grandparents for a while.Mom met up lawyers and then they had this meet up with both maternal and paternal grandparents where dad claimed he'll himself give her a divorce if this ever happens again.Then she let him back in the house and he did stay sober for a time..until last week I went home and saw that the heavy drinking has resumed..though devoid of abuses as of now..but its only a matter of time now isnt it?

I feel like my entire support system has been upended.Family was never a strong point and now it has crumbled beyond my reach.I dont know what to think anymore.
Have I been stupid to put so much stock in the people around me that I feel so helpless now without them around?
I've lost all my motivation.I spend all my free time just lying in bed doing nothing.Even as I'm typing this its 9am in the morning and I've shown up at the place I intern even as through the entirety of last night,I didnt get a minute of sleep and just lay in bed with crying spells.I dont want to look like I'm exaggerating but it literally feels like a part of me has died.
Every once in a while I try to take charge.I clean my room,go out for a jog and fall asleep on time.This only lasts for a maximum of 6-7 days and then I crash hard..all over again..I tried therapy and it seemed to be working too but I lost heart when my therapist left town 6 months ago..the entire process of opening up and finding a good therapist again just seems so so tedious..
I'm just putting this up here coz I dont have anyone to talk to and just wanted to let someone know that I'm not well but I'm trying..thank you for reading.."

Third year college student here in So-Cal. As my title states, I am pretty damn behind compared to my peers. Recently switched over into a CS-related major before the summer. I'm still taking the last two lower-divs before heading into my upper divs (then I'll be equal to my peers?) 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a career fair this weekend and Monday. My resume blows, I dabbled with Swift over the summer and I should've taken it more seriously along with doing DS&amp;A problems. I am particularly interested in iOS dev - it's been pretty cool to me. To breakdown my resume real quick:

Third year in college

CS-related major

Two apps - Ones a timer that's convenient in the gym, and an app that loads a map to find your specific interests.

Swift &amp; C++

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. My resume does not even cover 3/4 of the page. I hate being this negative and comparing myself to others, it sucks. I don't like it - but it's a reality. I feel like I wouldn't be able to contribute as much as these other people around me would be able to.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I approach the men and women at the fair and tell them my situation briefly when we get the chance to talk? I also have the option of not going and going to the next one next year and hopefully land an internship then.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate any input. I'm already looking at older posts and such. Thanks everyone."
9lugtv,14,2018-10-06,I don’t know why I’m in CS anymore. I lost motivation and I can’t get an internship but I have a 4.0.,propositional_help,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/9lugtv/i_dont_know_why_im_in_cs_anymore_i_lost/,"Okay just to preface this, I’m a Sophomore. Some of you might think it’s too early for me to get worried, but a lot of my Sophomore friends got contacted for interviews, but I was passed up on multiple times.


My motivation is dwindling. What’s the point of trying so hard in school when employers won’t care? Recently I’ve been really questioning why I want to be a CS major. And the only reasons I can think of is money (comfort and job security), the ability to create, and honesty because I’m proficient at it. But every day I feel as if I’m fighting an uphill battle. 


I want to do something creative with my life, like animation or writing, art, or music composition. I want to touch hearts with storytelling, or work in film or television. I know, it’s dumb because I don’t have talent for it. At least CS is stable. CS is safe, and I will have enough money to support myself. Plus it’s something I have some proficiency towards unlike premed or something. However, I’m not some sort of CS savant or prodigy, I still have to work fairly hard towards it.

But here I’m stuck studying CS. I mean, it IS interesting and I like learning it. But all throughout last year, I convinced myself to push through it and study my ass off because it will be worth it for the future I’ll get. But then I hear that it never gets better. I was told that work will be more stressful, and I’ll have even LESS free time. 

Okay, I’ll admit. I like coding. It’s oddly calming to me to sit at a computer and just drone away a whole day solving a mildly difficult problem. When I do class assignments, I love just working on a project nonstop. But when I was tasked with completing a personal project, I *panicked* , I couldn’t stick with it til the end because it was too hard.

Also it seems that employers don’t even care about my GPA. I’m not doing enough projects, experiences, internships, etc. I’m already overloading myself with work i can’t handle. I TA and do research, and am part of all the big CS clubs at my university.  And YET no company wants me for an internship.  Every post I see, there are students worried about their “subpar” GPAs, but they get internships. At least in my experience, GPA means jack shit. Employers only use it as a filter, but even then, they expect you to be some sort of God  candidate who can maintain a near perfect GPA AND have a lot of Experience AND know like 20 different languages.

And even if I get an internship, corporate life seems so... boring, and so life less. I can feel my soul being sucked out of me. 


What was the point of crying and obsessing over the smallest change in my grades? Why did I spend so much time pulling out my hair staying up to study and complete my homework? Is there any point to maintaining my grades anymore anyways? My accomplishments as of now  are not enough for an internship, they’re not enough for Grad School.

I really feel that all stats show is how book smart you are, whereas in the real world being street smart is really what matters. I think that you can only get to a certain point in life by being book smart unless you are in a field that is solely based on intellect and no personal skills. ECs shows commitment and is a place where you can show your interest in certain passions where you can build interpersonal skills which I feel is more important in the real world than being book smart. During my internship at a bank over the summer I can't tell you how many people there didn't come from top unis have have said they didn't have the best grades in highschool. The same was true the year prior when I did a medical internship where the people there said that what is more important in highschool is developing a passion and pursing it rather than just being focused about GPA and Testing since in the real world you getting an A in AP Bio won't help you in your job at all if you are working at a bank.

9lveg0,4,2018-10-06,Got kicked out of college due to Bipolar,aliengirl365,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9lveg0/got_kicked_out_of_college_due_to_bipolar/,"Hey reddit. Thought I’d word vomit on here to help process feelings and potentially get advice/reassurance. Posting from a throwaway. 

TLDR: Life got the better of me, skipped classes because I was either on too much of a high or too much of a low to go. Got dropped because of it. 

I have no idea what I want to do with my life, and don’t think I ever will. I have such a tremendous amount of anxiety surrounding the future: What if I pick something I don’t like? What if sea-levels rise and kill us all? What if none of this actually matters? My therapist has always told me that it’s okay to think these things, and that everyone does. But does it really effect people to the extent of such crippling anxiety that they can’t even choose a major? I don’t know. 

The first time this happened, I was 16. Everyone was getting excited for college and starting to think about their applications. I had decent grades at the time, averaging about a B in each class. Was doing extracurriculars like Theater and Cheerleading. I had everything going for me. But then everyone started asking the big question. What do you plan on doing after graduation? I had no fucking clue. I knew no matter what I would say, something would be wrong with it. Wanna be a teacher? Don’t get paid well. Wanna continue cheer or theater? Hard to get a job. Wanna be a therapist? Too much expensive school. I was being bombarded from all sides - but mainly my mom. She wanted me to be a nurse. Because she was a nurse. I didn’t want to be a nurse. 

So, did what any *sane* person would do and started cutting class and anything else related to school. Whether I was on a high or low - stay home in bed because I was sad or go to the mall and steal everything I could because I was on top of the world. I just didn’t want to be at school. That’s where all the anxiety was.  And of course my grades slipped, almost got kicked out of cheer and theater. Parents were understandably upset and took me to the family doctor who diagnosed me. I was NOT taken to therapy or put on meds though because my mom doesn’t believe in ‘mental health.’ My doctor and parents worked with the school to get me in better standing. Luckily, it was high school so it was easy enough. Did summer and online classes to make up my grades and did community service to get back in cheer and theater. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to. Graduated like any average high schooler and got into a state school. Everything seemed fine again. 

Freshman and sophomore year of college were fun. I was going to school for nursing - even though I didn’t want to. I went to school for nursing because I had no other ideas, but more importantly did not want to upset my parents ever again. (No one should have to see the wrath of a white-suburban middle-aged Christian mom who’s daughter ‘isn’t doing the best’). It was no big deal though, nothing serious happens with your major until your junior year anyway, I had time to figure it out. Guess what? I didn’t figure it out. I spent my time either partying or sleeping all day. Good ol’ untreated bipolar. And with my parents at an arms-length away, I didn’t really care it was happening. I was discovering my self in ways I never thought possible in middle-of-nowhere’s-ville where I grew up. I discovered my own sexuality! I discovered I liked psychedelics! I discovered I like women better than men! I discovered I like psychology! Etc. 

I decided to start seeing a therapist to help me figure things out until I could tell my parents what was going on behind their back. She convinced me it was time I switch my major to psychology (what I actually wanted to do) and to come out of the closet to my family (what I didn’t want to do at all). I hesitantly agreed, but she’s my therapist and ultimately wants wants best for me. This time last year, I flew home to see my family. They excitedly asked when I was graduating, have I gotten a boyfriend yet, any new internships... I decided to play along until dinner. 

The questions came up again, as they do. I chose to start things out easy - I’m switching majors to psychology mom and dad! They quiet their eating and mumble something along the lines of, “Oh great...” They go off on how my new ‘libtard’ state has changed me and that I don’t know what I’m doing. Psychology is not a viable major, you’ll never be taken seriously, you’re going crazy again, etc. with most of the aggression coming from my moms side of the table. I sort of black out at this moment not really knowing what to say or do. I have a lot on my mind, and for some fucking dumb reason decide - NOW. I blurt out, “I’m gay.” Conversation is over. 

My mom silently picks up her and my dad’s dishes and goes to the kitchen. My dad walks upstairs and go to bed. I sat at the table until my mom followed my dad upstairs. I went to bed. 

My mom wakes me up in the middle of the night, surprisingly calm. In my groggy state she tells me that she and my father are going to forget what I said at dinner if I don’t ever bring it up again. She goes on to blame my new therapist for filling my head with ‘nonsense’ and says she’s going to call her in the morning. Okay. 

So, I’m fucked. I fly home defeated. Knowing fully well how fucked I am, I try to continue the solid C-grades I’ve somehow managed to maintain up to this point. I saw my therapist, she continued to tell me everything was going to be okay. I knew that wasn’t true. 

Cue 3 months later. Self-medicating with alcohol, practically blacking out every single weekend. Not giving a single shit about my future. I end up dating a boy for a bit to prove to myself I wasn’t gay and actually had sex with him a few times. I broke up with him soon after for obvious reasons. 

A little while later, I found myself throwing up in the mornings even when I wasn’t drinking the night before. Took a pregnancy test - came up positive. Went to planned parenthood, test came up positive again. I’m fucking pregnant. 
I’m 5 weeks pregnant to be exact. My life is in shambles. I text my ex, he says he’ll help me. He’s so sweet. I feel so bad for roping him into my life that’s falling apart. We decide to split the bill on a medical abortion. Thank god he was there for me. I don’t think I could’ve done it alone. It is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life. 

After that, I fell into the same hole I did when I was 16, but much worse this time. I wasn’t going to class. I wasn’t emailing my professors. Stopped going to work. Only barely talked to my therapist. I would either be too depressed to even shower or going to bars and spending what little money I had. I did this for an entire year. 

For some reason, a small part of me thought I could get out of this the same way I did back in high school. But of course I couldn’t. This is college, I’m a 21-year-old adult know. I didn’t even bother to sign up for classes this term. Its hard to do anything when almost 100% of your energy is dedicated to not causing harm to yourself. 

I just got the email today, I’ve been dropped from University State of X. I feel numb, stupid, angry, sad, everything and nothing all at the same time. I don’t know how I’m supposed to tell my parents. The same parents who couldn’t even cope with me switching majors. What the fuck do you do in a fucked up situation like this? I can’t blame anyone but myself, but of course I blame my parents. Maybe if they had been supportive this wouldn’t have happened? Maybe if they put me on meds the first time around I would be normal? Maybe if I could be myself I would feel happy? So many maybes. 

I think I might voluntarily check myself into the local psychiatric hospital. My therapist said she could write me a referral. 

If you made it this far, thank you for listening.

So I'm at a top 10 uni for CompSci in the UK doing a BSc and the time for applying for grad jobs is now. I've already got an offer for a grad job in software dev but am probably going to apply to other places like the big 4 etc. 


I figure if I'm going to do a masters I'd want to do it at Oxbridge/Imperial (totally for the name :D) but on the other hand there is a part of me that realised during my internship I don't think I can be arsed with studying anymore. I thought a masters was more research into a topic of your choice I would probably enjoy that but I'm really not a fan of Theory of Computation or any of the theory really. Of course there is also the fact that if I do a Masters I can then hold out on working for another year and enjoy somewhat of a life. Don't get me wrong I can put up with the theory but it is a slight drag. 


I had the idea of working for a year or two then going back to my masters but I feel like I'll be backtracking if I do that or I won't actually do my masters. I've read some people do a masters while they work or their company pays to do their masters. From what I've looked up I'm not seeing much of that on offer in the UK or you need to be working there for some time already. 


I've also had the idea of trying to get a grad job in the US (feel like it would be somewhat exciting). But I don't even know where to start i.e. should I just apply for programs making it clear I am British and hope if I pass interviews they will help me sort out visas and things? It's way more expensive to do a masters in the US so I don't think I'd be willing to do that. 


I suppose I'm just looking for something different to do. I don't really want to do a masters at my current uni or get a mediocre grad job.

I make a decent living as a healthcare professional.

My career isn’t sustainable or a satisfying fit.

I’m great at and love Math, Physics, Programming, Chem, etc.

I’ve been more interested in tech and math than my PA major. 

After a lot of thinking, I’ve decided to go into: CS/Engineering/Math/Data/etc.

I have enough saved up to last me through 5 years of schooling without working at all.

I want to end up in software/data/analytics/etc. maybe even in healthcare if possible.

I love Math, Physics, and Coding. I’m good at it as well.

My options are:

1. A less prestigious state-college 10 minutes away for an Applied Math / Comp Sci BS and then an MS at another, more prestigious, state-college 40 minutes away.

2. Do an ECE BS/MS at a good state school by moving 200-500 miles.

3. An online CS degree program.

4. Self-study and work part-time for 5 years until I break through into a desired job. Basically, go Hikikomori into CS/coding via the vast learning tools available online.



Part of the reason I’m considering school again is that I regret not getting a more math-based or engineering degree. I know I can do good at it.

The thing that scares me about option 4 is the possibility of not being taken seriously when I apply for jobs or internships. 

I know I’m getting old and that starting a tech job at 35 could be mean that I’m already too old to hire.
But, I’m doing this for personal reasons and passion rather than money or respect.

Moving would be hard and little more expensive but I’m willing to do it.

Any commentary is welcome."

How should I be preparing for this? Will they be asking me actual coding questions (should I brush up on Data Structures)?

Now I'm wondering what the next steps should be. I have about a year worth of help desk experience from two internships, one for a giant hospital system and another one for a small comic store and then this position I got let go from.

I got this job through a friend, felt a bit guilty it's networking, and things have been great for a 1.5 years. I'm a student, and he is very flexible and understanding (this is a major factor as I can work from home).

My boss has always had a few communication issues, such as not telling me when the office is open or going on vacations with some to zero notice. Sometimes, it's because he's swamped (it's a small business). Other times, he forgets or something. My laptop died a little over a month ago, and I haven't been able to work since. His laptop also died. I just got a new one and was going to install the stack, but recently learned he's run off on a cross country road trip without saying anything (found out from my friend). I have no idea when he'll be back. I'll still install the stack, but these communication issues are getting to be too much.

Maybe it's been like this because I couldn't work at all due to having no laptop. The running off and sometimes never knowing if the office is open probably won't stop. I don't want to leave and possibly burn a bridge (what if he faults me or overreacts? I'll need to maintain some lie, like my interests have changed or something), and the flexibility of this is invaluable as a student (CS student if it helps). I want some consistency if I can get it. 

Should I wait and see if having the new laptop fixes things? If things get back to normal, should I still look for a new job or try to keep this one until Summer break?"

I'm only just a student, but the past year my grades have been slumping, and now my GPA is quite low. It's not that I don't enjoy my classes, I find them challenging, but in a good way.

I just have really bad prework anxiety, if that's even a term. Especially in regards to programming. Everything hinges on my ability to programme. My grades, future job prospects even the degree itself. I get worried and afraid. What if I really can't program, what If I won't be able to understand this crucial concept? It's quite amusing looking back when I first started the degree, and being introduced to object and class orientated programming. I was in such panic since this is all quite foundation - but also something that's completely new to people. Some peers taking the class as an elective struggled to grasp it. But I couldn't afford that. I'm a CS student! I have to understand this. If I can't, I won't ever become something I've wanted.

It's really paradoxical. I've thought about switching or dropping out, but I find myself directionless or uninterested in regards to any other discipline - I really do feel CS is my degree. When i'm in my discrete maths class, I find it so enjoyable the different puzzles we solve to prove/disprove something. I like it when we get to design UI as well. But it also causes me such anguish. Seeing the progression of my friends especially, and also their ventures into internships and the like has only exasperated these inadequacies I might have.

Has anyone else dealt with this issue? How did you overcome it as well, and what can I do to better myself.

Are the resume templates in the above article really the new norm, or am I correct in thinking these resumes could cause problems for someone trying to get a job in the tech field?"

I really would prefer the BA and to explore humanities, but my family's inclined to push me into a BsC as they feel it gives a lot more job opportunities. Few things to consider:

1. I intend to pursue a master's and possibly PhD in a CS specialisation anyway

2. I will need a decently paying job after my undergrad

3. I am extremely interested purely in Cs and have slowly started to dislike chemistry and physics in high school, math is fine, but I don't enjoy it like I do with cs

4. I have a good amount of experience in cs already: done cs50, Web dev internship, published websites, github projects, doing a machine learning course now

5. I will build a strong cs resume with plenty of projects and experience during my undergrad.

Will campus recruiters really care if I get a cs degree as a BA? Also, the colleges of my choice offer the same exact coursework within Cs for both degrees: the only difference is a lot more math throughout the four years and more physics and chemistry in the first year for the BsC. Any advice is appreciated. "

9m5oow,5,2018-10-07,A Series of Struggles,thatUsrname_isTaken,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9m5oow/a_series_of_struggles/,"I have been having a rough time so I am using this as an outlet of sorts...

I ran out of Adderall about a month ago and I have been struggling to get a refill. I attend University and have been getting prescriptions from an on campus health service. In order to get a refill, they have been setting up appointments to see me first I suppose since I am newly diagnosed and they want to check up on everything. This has been fine, however between my last appointment and summer break, they did not schedule me a new appointment. I kept telling myself I'd schedule a new appointment myself by calling them but responsibilities kept piling up and I forgot to until my Adderall ran out. I don't know how to get a refill without scheduling a new appointment, which is needed because not only did I forget my doctor's name, but the health service also does not have any open appointments for the next 3 weeks or so (according to the online appointment scheduling service). This is something I'm sure is easily handled, but I just haven't had time because everything in my life came crashing down on me,  perhaps because I am an engineering student with ADHD and no meds, perhaps because I am just in over my head. 

So here is my life without Adderall: 
Since being off my meds, I have had 2 exams. The first one was Calculus 3 and I actually did very well with a 93%. This is great and all but I owe my 93 to the fact that I did nothing but study 3 days prior to the exam. As a result, I got a zero on 2 homeworks and forgot to study enough for my Physics 2 exam. 
So a day before my Physics 2 exam, I realize I need to cram. I try to study but keep losing focus, and as a result getting discouraged, which makes me zone out more. I decide it's best to at least make sure my testing arrangements are in order so I check the exam schedule with the Disability Resource Center to ensure that I will be allowed extra time on this test. With my luck, my name was not listed on the schedule at all. I emailed my TA to see why, and he said that he sent all of the information and it should be fine. I tell him to double check with them and he does, and comes back saying they done have a place for me to have extra time and I will just have to take the exam on regular time. So now not only have I not studied enough, but now I won't have extra time. I go and take the test the next day, doing the high point value open responses first, then I the professor says I have 10 minutes left, so I tear through the multiple choice. 10 minutes after I get out if the exam, the DRC emails me and says they finally have a spot for me to have extra time, but its too late, I've already taken the test. I get my exam score back and I got a 43%. I got almost all of the open response right, but as expected, almost none of the multiple choice right. 

On top of all of this, I have other responsibilities I have been failing at. I was hired to do some fairly important online work on my own time, but have been so busy that I haven't been able to do it and I feel so bad for now being able to do it and don't know what to say to the guy that hired me because I feel like he will be pissed at me. 
I have been very busy and forgetful and haven't been able to follow through with things I told my girlfriend I would do so she gets mad at me and makes me feel even worse about myself than I already do.
I have been too busy drowning in resposinibilities so I have not been able to hang out with my friends nearly as much as I'd like to so I am beginning to feel lonely.
I have 2 exams coming up this week and I have been struggling to do anything to prepare. Any time I sit down to study I just get discouraged. It takes me like 3 hours to do something that should take 30 minutes. I still need to schedule an appointment for Adderall and I need to call back about an internship opportunity (it's probably too late to respond by now tbh and it's not like I'll even get it with my GPA being below 3.0)

So there's my wall of text describing my struggles of the last month as an engineering student that ran out of meds. I'm sure not many will read all of this since it's so long, but I'm posting it always as I need an outlet."

The only problem is that I would be obliged to take 4 classes the summer 2019 otherwise I would have to delay my graduation of 1 year. My question for you people is if it's wise to mix my first semester with one or two classes from the second semester. For instance my first semester could be with COMP 232 , COMP 248 and, ENCS 282 and  COMP 233 . Considering that I have already done 3 general electives prior to  my entrance, . Then I would have to only take two summer classes instead of four  in order to respect the course sequence. What do you think of this plan is it doable?  What are your thoughts about this and furthermore is the coop program worth it ? I know it may delay my graduation and it is also really demanding, can I get good internships on my own without doing coop, just by networking and involving myself in few projets there and there ?"
9m7n47,2,2018-10-07,[Ask OMSCS] Questions about Specializations,LexaIsNotDead,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/9m7n47/ask_omscs_questions_about_specializations/,"Hi all,

I just got accepted for Spring 2019 and I have a couple of questions about specializations and whatnot. Originally, I applied to the program thinking that I would go in the Interactive Intelligence route (mostly because of my background in healthcare and ""big data""), but I'm starting to doubt that's the right path for me. To give some context, here's my background:

* Minimal programming experience in the professional setting, which involved coding a small feature within an application and helping out with code reviews for our junior devs

* Took two CS classes during my undergraduate years at Georgia Tech (I was a biomedical engineer major)

* Two weeks away from completing a full-stack development bootcamp (I've basically been building websites as side projects non-stop for the past three months)

* Two weeks away from starting my two-month internship as a data engineer with a fast-growing marketing startup

Here's what I want to accomplish in the near future:

* Land a full-time job offer as a data engineer with the company I'll be interning for

* Become well-versed in back-end development, particularly with data management and database design

* Get a better grasp of advanced computing algorithms and whatnot

* Create a SaaS startup and become the technical co-owner of the startup due to my programming skills

Basically, I get the gist of the core values for computer science components, but I'm thinking it would make sense for me to go in the Computing Systems path so that I can learn how to be a better developer and have a foundational understanding of best practices within the industry that can be leveraged when it comes to starting my own SaaS company. Based on this, it seems like I could go about this in two ways:

* Do the Computing Systems path and take a class or two in Interactive Intelligence that are actually relevant to my background

* Do the Interactive Intelligence path and take core classes (and remaining credits) that help me become a better developer

Any thoughts?"
9m81di,0,2018-10-07,Applying for 6 month coops; can I turn an offer down?,OliveSweatshirt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9m81di/applying_for_6_month_coops_can_i_turn_an_offer/,"For background - I'm taking Sophomore level Comp Sci classes at my four-year university (I have an Associates degree already, so I'll graduate in 2020). I've taken two classes in C, am currently taking a class in C++ along with MIPS Assembly language, and taught myself the basics of Python over a tech internship last Summer.

I understand the importance of graduating with real world work experience, so I applied to my school's co-op program and got in. Right now I'm applying to different positions and have heard back from three companies. No offers yet, but I'm interviewing. 

For one interview, after I completed an online technical assessment, I talked with a senior software engineer at the company and discussed my thought process over one of the coding problems I did. He liked what I had to say and said I'm off to round two, the final round, ""soon"", and should teach myself the basics of Java and SQL in the meantime. I like how I got to talk shop in the interview, as learning technical skills is the whole reason I'm applying for co-ops. This particular company is kind of like PayPal in the sense that they deal with handling financial transactions, lots of them, daily. It sounds like it requires serious technical knowledge and skills to have everything working smoothly. 

The other interview I've had with a different company was with a recruiter from HR. We talked about my resume and a *little* about my technical skills, but she stressed that that didn't really matter too much. We also talked about the culture at the company, which she said she loved. By all accounts, it's a soft place to work. You're given as much time as you need for tasks (which is nice) and you're supported by your friendly peers (which is also nice). When I asked her what a typical day would look like at the four positions the company was offering me, she said since she's from HR she didn't really know, and that it would primarily be scripting. What type of scripting, I'm not entirely clear. 

To be clear, I have gotten offers from neither company. My point is this: am I in any position at all to turn down certain offers I get? I n-e-e-d work experience. It sounds like at the latter company that a) expectations are low, and b) I would be very bored and not learning much. However, it *is* better than nothing, which is what I currently have. 

The second company said that the next round of interviews would happen this week and that it would be another non-technical interview for about an hour. The interviewer said she would reach out to me to schedule that. I am honestly leaning towards telling them that it would be best if we both moved on as I don't think I would grow sufficiently there. I would just hate to turn them down and then not find anything else.

I want to work at a place that will challenge me to grow, learn valuable skills, and to be my best self. However, *having* *work* itself is more important. Am I in a position as a CS undergraduate with a *little* work experience to turn down an offer that I'm not excited about, or do I have to take what I can get?"

Just because you got an 800 in math II doesn’t mean it’s “easy” for everyone else. 

I let people read my essays and I felt like people were judging me for what I was writing. The truth is, I’m going into this process cold turkey. I don’t have parents who have ANY idea what this whole college process is about. I go to a school which doesn’t send people to good colleges and probably has a higher poverty rate than most other schools. My school couldn’t fit me in a precalculus class because it was full. So while everyone in your school scores 800s on Math II, kids in my school don’t know what a subject test isn’t is. There are so many kids who just don’t have all the resources as you do and it’s not fair to assume that they do. Not everything is as easy for everyone else as it is for you.

Then two years ago, I moved to Australia to study my Master degree to have a fresh start in a country where nobody knows me. 

At the beginning, I did well. I talked to people and socialised by pretending that I am actually a social person. During this time, I met my first boyfriend and for the first time, I have a small group of friends that I have met through group assignments in uni. 

However, my anxiety never really left me. I am constantly afraid that if I am underperforming in class, I believed that my friends will hate me and would not be my friend anymore. I was scared all the time that my boyfriend will found out how useless I actually am and would leave me. I am so terrified to be left alone again.

The thing is, I do not really enjoy my course that much and whenever I need to start my assignment, I am constantly stressed about doing well otherwise everyone will leave me, that I couldn't start anything. I procrastinate a lot to forget about my fear and because of that it kept getting worse.

Currently I am in my final year and one of my friend of the same intake as me has already got an internship. Heck, even my boyfriend has already working full time now. On the other hand, I am failing my final year project and haven't gotten any internship yet. While I did well on one other subject (I worked really hard on that because I was  afraid of disappointing that same group of friends), I am actually still lagging behind everyone in life.

I hate the constant fear that I am feeling. In the past, I had cut everyone off my life because I hate having that constant fear in my mind that everyone sees me as a failure and only putting up with me. I have decided prior to starting my course that I would not cut anyone from my life anymore and I will make an effort to keep in touch. However, due to this stress and anxiety, I literally have chest pain and stomach pain every day. Because of the recent event, I became clingy towards my boyfriend because I am insecure about my ability to live like a normal functional person and ended up projecting my fear to him (I kept hinting that if he don't want me around, then I would meet him less often).

I hate that I am mostly pushed in life because of fear (of being dumb, of getting old, of being alone) and I can't handle this emotional state anymore. Please help!"

I just transferred to a university after graduating from community college in May. Originally my major was Art and now it's Computer Science because I like math and coding interests me.

This semester I'm learning **Python**, taking **Calculus 1**, and have **two other demanding classes** and require a lot of reading and taking notes (a Lit class and Human Biology focusing mainly on the brain and its functions.)

I recently also just lost my grandpa and it was really hard on my family so my life has been a mess since this semester began. I failed my first Programming test (lowest grade drops) and I failed my first Calc 1 exam last week.

My Calculus class is also a mess. My professor has an extremely strong accent who is hard to understand and the way he teaches has no structure. His quizzes are a joke but his exams are a complete 180 and not on the same level as his quizzes. He's also not teaching EVERYTHING I should know, and he's just trying to get the whole class to pass. He said to practice harder questions on your own if you have to take Calc 2 and 3 (which I have to.)

I'm wondering, should I quit my job?

I only work 15 hours but I feel like those 15 hours would make a difference in my life. I don't need the job to pay for anything except maybe gas but even then my parents would help me. I also want to focus on myself. I struggle with depression and want to exercise a lot more. I feel like my life would be great if it was just me and school.

But my problem is, my boss is a very kind person. He is so nice and he's young and pretty successful. He used to work at my current university and has a lot of connections. He is also the assistant director of EOF at the community college I graduated from, which is where I'm working part-time right now. I feel like working with him would be really helpful in the future when I need to find internships. He really likes me and I would feel awful if I quit. I know I would just get replaced but there's also a lot of pressure from other people who always tell me ""You work and go to school? That's incredible.""

But I feel like my life would be improved ten-fold if I could just focus on improving myself and studying. I'm also afraid of failing my Calculus class and I know I have to study a lot since I have to do Calc 2 AND 3 and programming is going to be my CAREER.

tl;dr: School and life are overwhelming me and even though I only work 15 hours, I feel like I should quit. The pressure of working for someone very kind with high expectations of me and the perception others have of me for doing both work and school is making it very hard for me to quit.

While I was away from school I took some online CS courses and I really liked them, so much that I decided to change one of my minors to a CS minor (I would have loved to try to get into the major but I honestly don't have enough money to pay the retroactive fees). I'm really enjoying CS so I was wondering if you guys think it would it be possible for me to find a job anywhere in the future with just a CS minor from U of T? Are there any specific courses that you would recommend me to take and what advice would you give to a CS minor who would like to apply to CS related jobs in the future? Do you think I would be a able to land any internships at all with a low cGPA? Is there any hope for me at all???"

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently offered a Systems Analyst Internship at a private company. I went there and spoke with the founder and he was incredibly knowledgeable and had HR give write me an offer letter right after our interview. It would pay $13.50/hr compared to the $10.10/hr I'm getting at my current Help Desk position but I am conflicted on whether I should take this position or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work at my community college's help desk and while it isn't something I want to make a career out of, there are a range of benefits:

\-there is a lot of down time so I can do homework

\-free food typically once every week

\-only one commute a day since I go to school and work at the same place (\~30 minute drive)

\-the VP of Tech. at the college said she would give me a letter of rec. to the college I want to transfer to. She told me this on Friday and I would have to put in my two weeks notice TOMORROW (Monday).

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I can do my homework and not deal with traffic (and spend less money on gas) by working at this help desk position, while also learning some basic technical skills. But, I would rather go into software development than IT Support so...I'm just very conflicted.

&amp;#x200B;

This would be my first internship ever (I'm 19) and it gets my foot in the door and this company is respected, even though it is on the smaller side. My major issue, however, is that I am taking 4 classes at community college and I am starting up the transfer process now. I would be working the same amount of hours as I did at the help desk (\~25/week), however, this job would be much more difficult at first since I do not have much experience and there won't be nearly as much downtime. I am concerned that I may slip in school, but I want to take the risk because experience is a HUGE asset. The drive from the school to the company would be about 20 minutes and from home to the company would be about 30 minutes. My family says not to take it and that there will be other opportunities but I just feel that the earlier I can get actual experience, the better. Please, please, please give me advice. Thanks."

LET'S FIX IT. alternatively: if you can't answer ""why us,"" you might be better off looking elsewhere.",bntrll,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9maheh/your_college_list_sucks_lets_fix_it_alternatively/,"What's going on, a2c? I don't post here often, but lurking here upwards of an hour a day has helped me more than anything else in this admissions process. special shoutout to /u/scholargrade /u/va_network_nerd and /u/admissionsmom particularly, I'd be lost without you.


*My objective here is to help you build a list of schools that are right for you.* Sorry for the clickbait title, and sorry in advance for sounding like a self-righteous twat. Before you get your pitchforks (or at least passive-aggressively mutter something trite about the blind leading the blind in the comments), yeah, I'm also an 18 year old. That said, I'd say I'm well-versed with personal finance, and I have real-world insight (wow sorry for the buzzwords) on the hiring process, at least for engineers-- my dad is in management at a company that hires engineers, chemists, biologists, and some CS dudes too, and he's recruiting and interviewing these college graduates. Please think about what I'm saying and judge it on its own merit.


So, I bet you're the typical a2c kid and you have a list of 1-2 safeties (instate publics or OOS you're getting good merit money for), 2-4 matches, and a good few reaches that are most likely in the top 30. These were found by looking at the US News rankings and picking what sounded cool. Your list might be good, but chances are, you've got a good few schools that you probably don't want to be attending, because *US News does not rank schools based on what's best for you.* Let's find up where you should be at.

------------

Before I get started, let me preface this with *DO NOT MAKE STUPID FINANCIAL DECISIONS. ALWAYS RUN THE NPC. NEVER GRADUATE WITH MORE DEBT THAN YOUR FIRST-YEAR SALARY. DEBT IS SLAVERY AND YOU *WILL* HATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE TAKING HOME ZERO MONEY AFTER YOUR PAYCHECK. MINIMISE IT. oh, by the way, taking a plane from home to college every time costs money. Caveat: rich schools are cheap for kids who aren't rich. Run the NPC always.*

1. *What do you want to do with your life?* You don't need to know a specific career, but you should hopefully have a field (that pays the bills) narrowed down based on what you hate the least in school. (for instance, if you like logic and math, you should consider computer science. if physics was your thing, maybe engineering. statistics? finance. art? well, maybe pick up an art minor while studying something you don't hate that pays the bills so you can pursue your passions afterwards.) *Pick a program that will support that (I won't insult your intelligence here) and research which schools are prestigious in that field.* For example, I know Illinois goes hard and they're in the middle of some corn fields, but they have a top-10 computer science program. My state flagship, Delaware, is also known for going hard but our Chemical Engineering is similarly prestigious due to companies like DuPont and Astrazeneca having their main facilities 20 minutes away from campus. Co-ops on your resume are a trump card-- it's real-world work experience, summer internships on steroids. Do you see why Northeastern is a good school now? Look at Drexel and Stevens too.

2. *Where do you want to end up? America stretches the distance of the UK to the middle east. You need a combination of job market and personal preference. MIT will open doors anywhere, but most schools are prestigious regionally.* I know you know about the Stanford and Cal CS circlejerks, but did you know that Google and other Silicon Valley companies recruit from San Jose State and UC Santa Cruz as well? That in the southeast, University of Florida might as well be Princeton? Yeah, we all know Wall Street targets ivy+, but Baruch kids get looks just because they're right there in Manhattan. As for personal preference, this is on you. Some people can't see themselves anywhere other than sunny southern California. If you're a CS kid who likes Bernie Sanders, Subaru station wagons, Nirvana, and flannel, you shouldn't say anything other than Seattle. Personally, I have SAD (I get seasonal depression in the winter. It sucks.) and I enjoy lifted pickups, packing fat lips, social conservatism, and beaches, so I will be hightailing it to the Carolinas, Georgia, or Florida. 

3. Exception to the rule! If you're applying to medical school, or a PhD, or anything like that, throw out what I said about regional and program-specific prestige. Apply to BS/MD/DO programs. Your version of program-specific prestige is liberal arts colleges. I won't go into this but they are practically designed to prepare undergrads for professional school- even ignoring their advisors telling ill-suited kids not to bother applying, their acceptance rates to med school are astronomical for a reason. You have options like SWAMP that are just as prestigious (to anyone that matters) as ivy+, to safeties like the Colleges That Change Lives. 

4. So, by now, you know what your major is and what your region is. Make an arbitrary cut off for the standard of school you're comfortable with attending (for me- 34, 4.15, it's US News T150 and T50 LAC's) and start from the bottom, ticking off schools that have your program (*STOP! If you're going for engineering your school must have ABET accredition.*) and are in a region you like. They'll naturally sort themselves into safety, match, and reach. 
5. Now's where the fun begins. Now, you research schools for fit. I'd recommend your ""school personalities"" posts on this sub (stereotypes and whatnot) as well as Niche reviews. Just focus on a school's students' reputations-- Tulane goes hard but is full of nerdy WASPS from Jersey and NY. Penn goes hard, as does MIT. Eliminate schools you don't like and be honest with yourself. If you hate work, maybe don't go for Columbia and UChicago. If you hate Greek life and the people inside of it, maybe don't go for Dartmouth or Dubyanell. If you're a pink-haired polyamorous lesbian transgender Muslim communist activist from Mars-- well, I won't police you, I imagine you get that enough already, but maybe look at Reed and Brown and stay away from BYU and Notre Dame.

----------------

Few more thoughts and I'll leave you to write your app. 

- Don't apply to schools that you can't afford. Personal example: Dartmouth is my dream school, but after running the NPC my parents and I have determined that it's too goddamn expensive. Why bother applying? Sad but that's life.

- Apply to schools that are like your dream school that you can get into and afford. Personal example: I like that Dartmouth is a wholesome, undergrad-focused education in an idyllic, pastoral setting, with students that still want to have a good time. Colgate has that, and I have a better chance of getting in. We're getting closer, but they still cost too much though, due to their lack of merit aid. Lehigh and Lafayette, though-- not impossible to get into, and give out good money, and they're also in the woods with good Greek life. Ding ding ding. 

Thanks for listening to my soapbox rant TED talk. This has been a good way to procrastinate. Love you all and I genuinely hope you end up where you belong.

TL;DR: Don't shotgun based on USNWR. Find a mix of schools that do your program well, will send you where you want to go, and you will fit into. FIT FIT FIT. If you're going to shotgun, shotgun matches for merit aid."

I have to pick one last 400+ level elective. The only one related to game development that I haven't done is one in multimedia.

I've been programming for about 10 years (but seriously about five), and using Linux as my primary desktop OS for that long.  I've always been an IT and programming hobbyist but I have zero work or education experience in the field.  I DO have a Comptia Net+ and Comptia Sec+ certificate, so that's something.  I am completely fluent in Python and have messed around with C, C++, SQL, Bash, HTML, CSS..random frameworks and things.  I have a github with multiple projects in it and am working on other projects with online friends who are programmers.  I do example exercises like hackerrank.com.  I think it's pretty accurate I have a passion for both IT and programming, but programming specifically.
 
I want to change careers, but I don't know how to.  Bootcamp, freelancing, recruiters, internship, helpdesk, more certs...I'm getting all this advice that other people tell me is rubbish advice.  I do not know how to look for a job, what sorts of jobs to look for, how my resume should look, what to do *after* I apply to a job, what things I should work on before I even start looking, etc.  I just get vague and contradictory advice!
 
So maybe this is a bit much to ask for but...can someone be my *mentor*, or guidance counselor?  I need someone to be able to look at where I am and tell me what exactly I need to be doing right now.  I need to be given homework assignments like ""Do this cert, learn this language, study this technology, rewrite yoru resume like this, go to this website, apply to this many jobs this week, follow up after this much time"", etc.  If you want, I can provide links to my resume and github (although I know there are threads for that).  But I'm so racked with indecision and self-doubt that I've done basically nothing the past six months to change my career except write more code.  
 
Thank you very much!"

9mcr0t,3,2018-10-08,Made the mistake of looking at her Facebook profile... she's doing SO much better than me.,hsphoenix_95,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9mcr0t/made_the_mistake_of_looking_at_her_facebook/," (Long post alert) 

It's  almost been two years (!) but it still stings when I see her face or  hear her name. Today, I made the mistake of checking out her Facebook  profile for the first time in more than a year or so.

Well,  let's just say that she's far, far from the screaming, abusive,  narcissist person who I left all that time back. She's living in Paris  and really living it up, as they say. Fancy, glamorous pictures (with  the guy she cheated on me, btw), win even fancier locations all over the  France and Europe. Money was never a problem for her (her dad's a  Fortune 500 CEO) but it seems like she's really starting to spend it  lol. The reason I mention this is that she's technically still a student  (as was I) so it seems a little strange to me.

In  addition, she's also doing great professionally. She's got an  internship at one of the biggest banks of the city (something which  virtually guarantees you a job when you graduate). She also started a  new college group at her university and passed the CFA level 1 exam with  flying colors.

Look,  I know that life is not a competition and it's silly to get worked up  over this. Yet, it's just that for all the progress that I've (seemingly) made, it seems like I have nothing to show for it. I am so  much more fitter, happier, and mature than I was two years back. But I'm  not the type to brag about it on social media or make my posts public  (as she's done, she's not my FB friend). I also did a long internship in  Copenhagen and got great reviews from my boss(es). Granted, it's not as  glamorous as Paris and I look like a moron in pictures, but it was a  great experience. I also completed a few certifications in a number of different fields, and that was the highlight of my time in Denmark. I've come back home now, since I only had a temporary  contract.

This is where the problem lies  for me... I know I didn't fail, but coming back to my hometown while she gallivants around  Europe with her fancy job and boyfriend make me feel  like crap.

In addition , what bothers me is that she often used to say stuff like this when we were together in university -

1. ""you're one of the stupidest people I've ever met""
2. ""you do nothing all day but sit on your ass""
3. ""your parents are old and don't know shit about how they should raise their children, and hence they raised a moron like you""

Objectively,  it wasn't true.  It seemed like she had a superiority complex over me  or something like that. I had better grades, more achievements, awards,  you name it. I played sports, was in the orchestra, had my own band,  etc. Yet, all these thing REALLY hurt. They still do.

Now,  because of her 'other worldly' achievements, it seems like her words  were true, you know? Maybe I wasn't 'good enough' for her. She often  used to joke saying that she only dated me for my looks but now it seems  like that's what it was. Trust me, that's not a good feeling at all.

I  just feel like shit, honestly. Coming back home has been like the  biggest anti-climax of my life and this shit doesn't help. Would you  guys have any advice for me? Other than to not check her profile (lol)   


Even if it's extremely harsh, I could do with it, trust me. I would really, really appreciate it. Thank you."

9md6g4,0,2018-10-08,I'm in college now with middling grades. I've applied to several internships and either got outright rejected or never heard back. What do I do?,EnglishMobster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9md6g4/im_in_college_now_with_middling_grades_ive/,"I spent a long time in college trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I wanted to study computer science, but I'm bad at math and I was afraid of the math classes. I wound up switching majors 3 times before I finally realized that I needed to go with what I really wanted to do and study computer science.

I switched majors about 2 years ago. When it comes to computer-related classes, I do great. But all the Calculus and math that has to do with down my GPA something awful (I'm retaking Calculus for the third time this semester).

Right now, I have a job working at a major theme park, which is a really cool job to have, but it's not exactly a job that's in my field. I've been there for years now, and it's gotten to the point where it's time to move on. My dream is to get into game development, and I live literally down the road from Blizzard's HQ. I applied for multiple internships there last year and got denied about 6 months later. I'm planning to try again once they post their internships, but I'm expecting similar results.

I've also tried applying internally within my company, both for open tech-related positions and for internships. Both times, I got turned down. I've heard that old adage ""It's not what you know, but *who* you know,"" and the issue is I don't really know anyone. The closest thing I have to a contact is my ex-girlfriend's brother. He worked as QA for Infinity Ward back when they were a thing, and hooked me up with a recruiter (who turned me down because I was literally a teenager).

Talking with a recruiter was a cool experience for teenage me, but I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in years, let alone her brother. I have the recruiter's Infinity Ward email address, but I don't even know if she still works at what's left of Infinity Ward or if the email even works.

I do have a LinkedIn, and I was using it for a time to search for jobs. I even had a recruiter add me to her network, although she's based in Texas and hasn't mentioned any jobs in the California area.

I applied for an internship at the Google offices down the road from me, but they asked for my GPA and pretty much weeded me out right away when I didn't have a 4.0. It's really exhausting tailoring a separate resume for every position, spending an hour crafting a cover letter, only to get a form email a couple months later stating about how they're going after someone with better qualifications (assuming I'm lucky enough to even get an email back).

I'm at a loss as to what to do. My goal is to hopefully get an internship in a game development job next summer, so I can get some actual experience on my resume rather than just hobby projects, and I can get away from my theme park job and start following my passion.

What am I supposed to do to get actual replies? Where am I supposed to find recruiters? How am I supposed to get internships within my field? My college has a career day coming up, but it's for all STEM majors and most of the vendors are for the engineering guys -- not us computer science nerds.

My current plan is to keep applying for all the game development jobs semi-close to me, but I'm getting really frustrated constantly being rejected or ignored, and I don't know what to do. I haven't even had an interview with a company yet after applying for ~25 different jobs. Any help?"

9mfc2b,1,2018-10-08,How do you deal with language-to-learn indecisiveness when you do know the fundamentals?,666lumberjack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9mfc2b/how_do_you_deal_with_languagetolearn/,"(Apologies in advance for the wall of text)

There are lots of posts cautioning against hopping from language to language without settling on one long enough to pick up the fundamentals, but my issue is a little different - I've learned Javascript through an internship that I'm on until the end of the year and have most of the programming fundamentals down (I think) through working with that, but I want to learn another language to broaden my skillset and improve my CV. 

Right now I'm doing mostly front-end work, but long term I'm more interested in a back-end sort of role - I don't have much of an eye for design, and I'd like to work on interesting technical problems.

My problem is that I'm finding it really hard to decide which language I want to focus on next. I want to learn something I find interesting (given than I'll be doing so on my own time), but as I see it there's a trendy-versus-employable spectrum to navigate. 

At one end you have Scala or Go, where there are a solid number of job postings including explicitly junior positions (in London where I'm looking), and at the other end of the spectrum is Elixir, Clojure, Haskell, F# or Rust. 

I have learned a bit of Haskell already, but I have reservations about how long it'd take me to gain sufficient skill for a significant personal project. I'm self-taught and have only my current internship and some basic scripts for visible experience, so I think I could really use some other personal projects to fill out my resume by the end of the year. 

For all of my 'trendy' language picks there are only double-digit job postings which is another concern, but I don't know how feasible it is to use competence in one FP language to find a role using another? 

The smart choice is probably Go, but knowing it's smart doesn't help my brain stick with it. Any help?"

9mh473,5,2018-10-08,I may be beginning to understand why I don't want to let go of my abusive boyfriend. What do I do now?,CaliBounded,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9mh473/i_may_be_beginning_to_understand_why_i_dont_want/,"**This is going to be long, but I genuinely need advice on this.**

So to make a long story very short, my boyfriend is possibly one of the most emotionally abusive people I've ever been with. I ideate with suicide whenever there's an argument, because he's fantastic at making me feel like literally everything that he does is my fault (gaslighting -- he is an enormous narcissist) and that I'm not worth as much as any person around me (constantly picks the feelings of others over me). I'm having a weird moment of clarity right now because of remembering something that happened during my breakup with the other abusive ex that I've had: I remember the extremely anxiety I had that he would never change. That he would go on to hurt another woman, and that to him and his family, I would be the bad guy of our story, even though he physically, sexually and emotionally abused me. It hurt me too that I'd gotten to attached to his family, and that I would also be the bad guy to them. When you're around people a ton for a year and a half, you begin to become invested in their stories and lives.

I remembered all of that. And then I remembered that now, I couldn't care any less than I already do about him. It was a long 3 months of me almost not being functional at all and having constant panic attacks when passing anywhere that was an old haunt of ours (when he dumped me, I had to live in a homeless shelter even though he played a part in me becoming homeless -- I was 18. I am 21 now). But then I moved away from that city (Houston) and lived somewhere else and it helped in me getting over it. I met someone new, and I cried here and there, but 3 years later, it doesn't hurt at all anymore.

Today, I'm in a program for software development that really does everything for the people that enter. For 6 months you learn something tech related (I'd already had some web dev experience before coming in) and then for 6 months after that, they send you on an internship with a Fortune 500 company -- 90% of students that finished are hired either on their internship or during the 4 months of job placement help they give you after you graduate. I'm receiving a stipend while I attend that isn't much, but it covers my half of rent and a bit more. Something I've been considering lately is relocation... for those that are willing and that do particularly well, some companies are willing to make an offer and pay for your relocation if the location they're at doesn't have the space to hire someone for your role, but an out of state location does. I'm genuinely considering doing this, because I am actually financially dependent on my boyfriend (this is part of why he's able to abuse me) and this would kind of... force me to leave him. I also got hit by a car while on my moped 2 months ago, and as a mixed blessing, it should result in me getting a check through my lawyer from the case. I'm hoping it'll be alot so it'll give me a safety cushion. As a narcissist, he's fantastic at convincing me that he's going to change when he never does. I recognize that I'm really bad at recognizing when people are genuine or when they aren't. And he's mad some changes here and there since we've gotten together, but I'm just seriously doubting it'll ever be at the rate it needs to be or that he'll ever completely change. He's great at roping me back in, and if he keeps doing this, I'll end up marrying this guy, I know it.

I'm terrified of being alone. I have no parents, and no family really (Mom was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive. My father was never present). I'm not that great at making friends because people my own age don't have remotely the level of responsibility I do (taking care of bills, not spending my money or time drinking because I don't have anyone to come get me and help me if I go overboard, etc.) and I can't relate to a lot of older people either... so I have problems being alone. It'll be just me. I was a serial monogamist (something I DON'T want to do again) before I met my SO because that's usually the only kind of re-enforcing touch/emotional re-assurance I can get from anyone. I'm scared, too, because as a woman, I know we get targeted a lot for burglaries and that sort of thing.  I've also felt bad because he's given me a lot (to lots of moaning and bitching and groaning about how he does sooo much for me and would rather not be) and the plan was for me to pay the almost 5k back to him. But I'm feeling like that will 1.) break me financially to do, and 2.) he's never worked on paying me back emotionally in the fact that I've been his emotional punching bag and have been carrying this relationship for the last 2 years. I pointed this out to him, and he's pretty much let me know without saying it directly that that's not nearly as important as tangible money.

But my point is... I know that this (this relationship) is wrong. I know that I can't keep this up. How do you all deal with being alone (and for the ladies, living alone), and how do I deal with these feelings of guilt I'm having? Of leaving his family too (his nieces have been around me for 2 years now since they were both 2 years old and refer to me as their aunt)?"

And now as I move closer towards the end of what I set out to learn, I'm worried that I won't get a job since I won't have an actual CS degree.",knkjnkjnkjn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9mi8nh/ive_selftaught_myself_a_sizable_chunk_of_a_cs/,"I graduated college with a liberal arts degree with a pre-law track back in 2014. Not that it matters in this industry, but it was from one of the ivy league schools.

I ended up losing all my interest in law by my senior year though and didn't bother applying to law school since I didn't want to take on even more debt for a career I didn't want.

After some soul searching, I decided I wanted to focus on computer science despite absolutely zero background. The only STEM course I took in college was a blow-off astronomy course and the last time I touched math was in high school.

I tried looking for programs to enter, but I was in this awkward limbo where I couldn't get a masters because I didn't have any of the undergraduate coursework. But I couldn't take undergraduate courses because I already had a bachelor's degree.

I ended up applying as a non-matriculating student at my only local university where I had last pick on classes when available. After 1.5 years, they only put me into 1 course (the intro cs course) taught over the summer. It wasn't helpful. They then told me to wait around until the spring semester and they might be able to get me into another class.

I said screw it and started teaching myself using a combination of free online courses from edx, Udacity, coursera, uDemy, MIT courseware, and random youtube channels. I also asked one of my friends with a CS degree to share with me his course materials from college and worked on completing all of the assignments, exams, and projects that he completed for each course to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

I made relatively consistent (ok, sometimes infrequent) commits to my private bitbucket repository as a pseudo-portfolio of undergraduate coursework.

In order, I have taken:

- Intro to CS and Programming (Python)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
- Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (C++)
- Two computer architecture courses starting with binary/logic gates, MIPS assembler, C, x86, etc etc.

I also decided to take a Discrete Math course at the local community college while I was teaching myself Data Structures since they offered it one semester and as opposed to CS courses, I couldn't come up with an efficient way to prove I've taken it without actually getting credit for it somehow.

I'm currently working on Design Patterns, then plan on taking another Algorithms course and a course on Operating Systems.

After that, I'm not sure. I might call it quits and focus exclusively on side projects and interview prep, or maybe teach myself additional material in a more specialized scope.

I really have no idea where to go from here though in terms of career. I don't know if I'm even allowed to apply for internships since I'm not a ""current student."" And my project experience until this point is exclusively stuff I've done for these classes I'm teaching myself.

What should my next step be and what can I expect for a career? The more I think about this, the more defeated I feel as if all my hard work was in vain since I didn't learn this stuff while enrolled in a program."

I grew up really overweight, and I was very depressed and emotional and irritable all the time, and my feelings were constantly invalidated and belittled by my family. It was hard for me to make friends, and I hated myself. I let my feelings about my body (actual body, acne, etc.) rule my life, and I used my inability to make friends and be comfortable with myself as evidence of my lack of worth. I also always felt like I was too boring to be friends with. I always felt like I was truly, inherently a lesser person than anyone and everyone around me, regardless of their intelligence or attractiveness. No matter what, I was awkward and ugly and boring, more so than anyone else.

I was always the smart one, and my grades/aptitude at school were all I had. I was poor so I threw everything I could into getting into a top school that would give me a lot of money. I did. It was really hard, but I did well.

I had an ugly duckling to swan transformation, and it was nice, but as I was a late bloomer, I got caught in a cycle of looking to men for validation. I constantly used sex as a means to get guys to like me. But for guys, they'd just be one night stand type things, so they really made me feel like crap. The amount of time I spent crying over that kind of rejection...oh god, it really fucked me up. I can't even put it into words. Even though the same things were happening to every girl I knew, I would internalize this kind of male behavior as reflective of my worth and attractiveness. I've definitely grown in that area, and I don't take that stuff as personally anymore, but I'm still a mess.

I graduated this past May, and everything that's come after that—trying to be an adult—has made me realize despite my physical blossoming/much improved appearance, I have no confidence or self-esteem, and it's keeping me from moving on with my life. Since I always figured looks = confidence, I thought I'd feel better by now. But I don't, at all.

I wanted to stay in my college city after graduation but since I didn't get a job immediately before graduating and my mom didn't have the money to give me to stay, I had to come home and consequently have the worst summer of my life. Alone, more depressed than ever, no way imaginable of getting back to where I wanted to be. I'm still a disaster.

The only way to really get out is getting a job and saving money, but no one will hire me because I have a degree and won't stay around long, and the few times employers for part-time jobs do call me back, I don't get the jobs, which makes me feel like more of a failure than ever. High schoolers, for god's sake, can get these jobs, so it really validates my feelings that I'm a socially awkward martian whom no one actually likes and is incapable of functioning in society. These feelings are further validated by the fact I basically got fired from my second internship for having a permanent bitchface. Yeah. The worst part about that is that I was actually trying to adjust my face because it's a 'complaint' I've gotten my whole life, and I thought I was actually succeeding at it. But I wasn't at all, and it makes me feel like some delusional idiot who has to constantly fix herself to be acceptable to other people, and even then, I'm still not acceptable to other people because it doesn't work.

I've gotten a ton of interviews since I graduated, literally probably 40+ since I graduated, but since I'm out of state they won't go anywhere. It's hard to accept the fact that I have to be here even longer than I already have because of my lack of money, especially since it feels like getting this money is impossible.

The worst part about this is that every time I do get a phone interview, anyway, my day is ruined. I am so consumed by stress and feelings of inadequacy, and I feel like an imposter, and someone incapable of doing jobs that anyone else my age can do. These feelings are crippling. Sometimes I can barely pick up the phone and almost don't. Often if it's a job I'm not absolutely crazy about, I find a way out of the interviews or cancel them. For example, I had one today, and when she called ten minutes late, I was going to use that as an excuse to not pick up the phone. I have three tomorrow (lol...they're all somewhere else so it's pretty pointless, I'm gonna stop applying now I think), and I don't know what I'm gonna do.

I even feel like I'm not capable of working at Starbucks. I have no confidence going into job interviews; I feel like failure is inevitable, even if they're just part-time jobs at retail stores. I don't feel like most people do. I'm constantly in a state of self-surveillance to make sure that I don't look MEAN (when I say I've gotten this from every person imaginable during every year of life, I'm not exaggerating), and I also don't feel capable of learning and making coffee drinks for some reason. I literally went to an Ivy League school and still feel like trash. What is wrong with me? How do I stop this? Why do I feel like I can't do things that 99% of people can do and do without hesitation?

My depression and just general current lot in life (I can't do anything because I don't have money and no parent to give it to me and no one will hire me) just solidifies my idea that I deserve to do nothing with my life and won't do anything with my life. I've always been deficient.

I have a 4.0 GPA overall, so I've been doing well in my classes. I don't have a resume written up yet (I plan to write one up tomorrow). I don't have any side projects under my belt, only those that I have done in class. I have an idea for an Android app I want to build, so I have a Java and Android book currently being shipped to me. I plan to get that built by the time an internship would start in the summer. I'm not really sure if I should put that on my resume or not since it's not built yet. I'm programming in C++ for my course work, and I know a little bit of Python and some basic Linux commands. I'm currently taking OOP, Comp Architecture, and Linear Algebra in college. I plan to take Database Management &amp; Discrete Math next semester. It seems like from what I read that employers stress knowledge in algorithms and data structures. I haven't taken a class on that yet (next one is offered next fall), so I only have a basic understanding of those things. Do you think I have a chance at an internship? The main thing I am afraid of is putting things on my resume that I can't vouch for. I'm not sure how soon after you submit an application that these companies get back to you. If they ask me questions about Java, my Android app, and database management, I wouldn't be able to answer their questions, but by the time my school year is over, I would. And I also feel nervous that some of these jobs that I've been looking at may have their job application deadline coming up very soon, so I feel like I scrambling a little bit here..."

The policies here including education, medical and immigration, are insecure and we feel very uneasy about it. Meanwhile, the gradually declining political situation in Hong Kong give us no choice but leaving.

We choose Germany mostly because of its economy, social welfare and industrial / academic opportunities. Our major are both Biophysics. My wife works in experiment while I am doing computational. My wife speaks fair German and we are confident to master the language after 5 years by the time we graduate. We understand it is necessary to unite into the culture and we have the time to do it.

Ironically, our major concern with Germany is also its culture. We heard stories about hierarchy in Germany. My friend told me a professor intended to open a bank account. After knowing his status, the bank sent a manager and treated him  as a prominent customer. Another friend told me the importance of networking in Germany in order to find a job. We cannot imagine how the business and academic circles would be. However, we are still planning an internship to Germany and get subsidy from EU / DAAD.

We are still open to other options, such as Netherlands and Nordic countries. We are more worried with the limited opportunities in Netherlands though hierarchy is less of a problem I heard. Same for Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The problem with Nordic countries is the darkness in winter.

The balance between social pressure and opportunities is a headache. I hope someone can describe the general career and culture in Germany and Netherlands, and also possibly other countries.

Thanks in advance."

THANK YOU!!!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I'm not certain this is the correct subreddit to show-case my beginner project -- if not, I don't wanna spam here, and I'd like to know of a place to get some feedback. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys, I'm really excited to write a post here. I wanna share with you a new (beginner) project I made, a few weeks after starting to learn Python.

This is my (short) story of getting into Python; if you'd like to skip it, just start reading from the heading.

I have been programming on and off for years now, and I'm about to start my second year as CS major. Unfortunately, during the first year, we didn't get enough hands-on practice; all programs, algorithms, applications and mini-games I wrote, were all out-of-textbooks-ish, not enough creative or complicated, and the worst -- we were given specific instructions on how we should do them! Yucks.

During my first year, I only studied Java and C; both languages have taught me quite a lot about how computers parse and manipulate different kinds of information, which was, I guess, vital for first-year CS undergrad courses. But I felt they were more of the same; I spent a lot of time write very simple programs, which gave me a feeling like I did not achieve a thing. Looking back at it, those courses were indeed important, and time was not spent for nothing, and I'd recommend everyone to check these languages out to get just the feeling of how Java and C (and others) are different from Python.

I got to Python for the first time for an internship I got this summer (right after my first year). They required me to study Python, as they work pretty much only with it. Python got me hooked quite quickly, and I started making my own projects (which can all be seen on my GitHub page; but I guess this project is the most complex and well-organized so far).

I've been a lurker in this sub for the past month or so, and enjoy reading through posts here. I learned Python mostly through /r/learnpython (the top posts have amazing value!!) and the book Dive into Python 3 (which assumes some general background in programming, but is doable).

# My trivia game

So, I'd like to share with you my super-simple-stupid CLI game. As a big geography nerd, I love all the online quizzes about countries; what is the capital city of Georgia, name all of the U.S states, state which of the following are a part of Asia, etc etc. But, those games were usually quite repetitive, and (I think) most relied on the same old data sources, that did not update; thus leading to false information sometimes, and worse - got me bored quite quickly.

So, as said over and over (in this sub and in others), I tried to figure out a way to solve me own problem (itch my own itch, I guess?). I thought -- which new features to these games would get me hooked again, **and** contain only true, relevant, updated information about the countries?

I answered both questions mostly through trial and error, and browsing through different geography-related websites from obscure parts of the internet, and the implementation is described in the project's web page on GitHub. Moreover, to give something back to the community, I made sure all my code was heavily-documented and commented out, and I described my usage in all the libraries used in the code in the README file.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading up to here! I'd love to get your feedback on the code, structure of the project, my idea, my implementation and whatever is it you can think about."

I'm an ME student with an internship working with chemical looping technologies. Long story short, my boss asked me to run simulations using MFiX to compare with data that her PhD student has from Barracuda. The problem, though, is that I don't have any experience using software like this. I'm doing my best to learn it, but starting from pretty much scratch makes it very difficult.

So, could anyone point me in the right direction as far as resources I can use to help me get off the ground with my simulations? I've read through tutorials/guides, watched videos, etc., but a lot of my problem simply comes from just not understanding what certain things mean/do. A lot of what I have seems like it assumes you have experience with similar software which I am unfortunately lacking.

9mltvs,1,2018-10-08,I Suck at Life,JPlugaru,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9mltvs/i_suck_at_life/," 

I don't know how to begin this thread, but I will just do my best and talk about everything that is on my mind and hopefully it makes some kind of sense. I am a soon to be 25 year old man and feel as if I have nothing going for me. And before anyone thinks that I am some snowflake millennial who is looking for cushion and comfort because they are pussy should think again. I am a real person with my head on straight (as I think) who thinks they are not like the rest of the crowd and needs help.

I have had a trouble childhood with an abusive father who drank too much and took out all his anger on my mom, brother and I, and even himself. He never had time for us, never took us out to the park as kids, never bothered to put us into sports, teach us how to swim, etc. He always blamed my mom for everything despite the fact that she cooked meals from scratch, took care of things around the house, and put up with my dad's abusiveness for 25 years. This is a guy who let my brother do drugs and ruin his life while my mom and I were at the nearest hospital trying to get him help via intervention. I am sure you get the idea.

Growing up I never really had friends. I believe this is related to the troubled childhood. I always had issues with kids who lived in the same neighborhood as I did. In middle and high school, I never had friends. People always made fun of me and mocked me for all sorts of ridiculous things. Girls always disregarded me because they did not want to be caught dead talking to ""that kid who is friends with that loser/antisocial who doesn't talk to anyone"" or ""that kid who built a scale model of the high school."" So I never went out to social events with any groups of friends. I only had one friend who was that ""loser"" friend. I longed to go to college at this point where I could restart everything and reinvent myself.

Upon going to college, I had all these expectations. I presumed that I would gain a group of friends like I never had in high school, get a girlfriend, do well in school, and enjoy my college life. Nothing couldn't be further from the truth. I had roommates who constructively criticized me for who I was (as least they weren't dismissive about it). They told me everything I was doing wrong from the types of sentences I was using, word choice, clothes I was wearing, and that my interests were uncool. I didn't know that apparently I was putting emphasis on words (as if I had an accent), wearing boat shoes was uncool, and that by choosing to not drink that I would alienate myself. My time in classes was not any better as I tried to connect with people and everything was just superficial. I would hear people all the time talking about what they would do over the weekend or they would invite classmates to hang out with them to be introduced to their friends. I tried to do all that but people seemed to make excuses as to why they could not hang out with me or that they did not wan to invite me. This shit continued for 5 years while I was in school. I went in as a civil engineering major and switched to management information systems (MIS) halfway through my third year because I could not get through the calculus and physics.

Switched majors, focused on school, faced trials and tribulations in my major since there were a few weed-out courses as all majors do. Met new people, tried to make new friends, only remained classmates/acquaintances, etc. So now when the time came to look for an internship before I went into my final year, I applied to hundreds of jobs. Went to the school's career fair, spoke with recruiters, went to my school's MIS department and spoke to the associate director where he basically insulted my intelligence when I asked for help to get an internship. I eventually landed an internship at a utility company where there was nobody my age in my department (information services). Tried to make friends there with other kids my age in other departments but I felt as if it was all for nothing since there was no success with anyone. I spent a year and a half at this company interning before they let me go as I have now stayed for 6 months past my graduation and they could not keep interns more than 6 months after they graduate. So in the midst of all of this, applying to over 1,000 jobs on many mediums I finally got a job as a car salesman.

Here at work, I notice the same shit going on. There are only 2 other sales people my age and they talk amongst themselves a lot and never reach out to me or invite me to join them with anything. I asked one of these friends what they were doing over the weekend and they responded by saying that they were not doing much. The other one said that he was hanging out with a friend who was about to go away to college. Monday morning when we are moving cars the first friend asked about why the second couldn't play golf with him and the second responded by saying that he was busy with his girlfriend. So then I just sit there and absorb the information and don't say anything. There was nothing to be said and I did not want to bring anything up to dig myself into a hole. I pretty much accepted defeat so to speak. There is a girl that I expressed interest in and after taking the advice of the friend mentioned earlier to approach her and be blunt and ask if I am wasting my time with her, she told me that I indeed was wasting my time and that nothing between her and her boyfriend is going to change. Meanwhile my friend who advised me was in a relationship with another girl at work for a couple of months before realizing that she is not as bright as he thought she was and all she wanted to do was have sex. Days after leaving her he got into a new relationship with a girl that was one of his customers, making it all look so easy.

The bottom line with all of this here is that I feel like I'm useless and good for nothing. I don't have a good family, don't have any friends, had all these expectations as far as a social life goes when I got to college and got out 100% exactly the same way as I went in, got a job that I could have gotten out of high school and am constantly pondering what could have gone so wrong to trigger all of these events. Is this a ripple effect of my childhood upbringing? Why is it that I could not get a job with my degree despite the fact that that the school falsely advertised that students in this field have a 100% job placement rating and that the average salary of a Bachelor's degree graduate is about $56,000 annually. What went wrong? Why is it that I got nothing out of college from a degree to friends to experience with girls and am here literally banging my head on walls for why I can't get anything right? All the girls I meet now are taken and can smell the inexperience from 100 miles away and are instantly turned off by that. Well how is a guy supposed to learn if he is never given a chance? I have been using several dating apps for the last 4 years with nothing to report on. I joined clubs in school to make friends and nothing resulted from that. Why do I suck at life? People told me before that I am to over-analytical but how could I be so bad at this? Is the answer really in front of me so easily? I feel like I have no value to offer people and that is why everyone looks past me. I feel like a loser and that it is quite obvious why nobody gives a shit but why is this the case now and not before? I am not a happy individual by any means and do not understand why other people can get whatever they want in their life at a small if any expense. I had friends who I thought were friends for life but eventually they cut me loose as they no longer would answer the phone or express interest in hanging out. It is as if they gave up on me. Sorry if all of this seems a bit of a mess but I have a lot to speak for and am looking for lasting answers to my issues"

9mlz3m,1,2018-10-09,Fuck My Family,AAAAAAGHFUCK,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/9mlz3m/fuck_my_family/,"So I'm 15 and a Junior in highschool and my family is fucked up. I'll continue by saying that I don't live with my parents after they split up after 20 years of physically abusive marriage and them being split up from my siblings and me a couple years ago due to them being addicted to heroin. They were on the streets for a bit, went to jail, went to rehab, and got back together for a bit while my sister and I were living with my (thankfully normal) grandma. So they came back to my city and after years the gang was all back together (minus my oldest sister, living on her own). So my sister and I move back in with my parents and were reminded after years of maturing and forgetting their shittiness of just how shitty they *really* are. My dad is a narcissist and believes that he does no wrong and whenever someone makes him angry or goes against his wishes he will yell at the top of his lungs and if you dont stop he will get physical. My mom, having lived with him for years, is an emotionally broken mess who os so wrapped around his finger that she cant function normally without him. 

On the actual parenting side they dont really give a shit about us as they wouldnt buy my textbooks or pay for any school fees as well as neglecting to take me to a doctors appointment to get an exclusive internship because they made other plans with their friends at the time. I also slept on a mattress on the floor with just one dresser and little clothes that were constantly dirty because nobody ever wanted to go to the laundrymat and I never had money to pay to wash my clothes (nor should I be the one doing that as that responsibility lies in the parents fucking duties but its whatever). They are also just scummy people, leaving their trash and belongs strewn about everywhere-(though this gets worse as Ill reveal later). We were also pretty poor because my dad kept blowing money on stupid shit like computers and (no joke) SWTOR cartel coins. Just stupid shit like that. Additionally, they had 2 dogs that they didnt know how to take care of that they let shit and piss everywhere but didnt want to get rid of them because they were too cute (as if havin dogs lay in their own piss and shit all day is nice and healthy for anyone)

 Now after a few months of living with his freakouts and the feel that im tiptoing around a ticking time bomb I decide to saw fuck it and I just left one day in February of this year. He sent me a whole bunch of angry texts which I ignored and threatened to call the police on me if I dont return. I told my sister (who was living with us) to pass along the message that if he calls the police on me that I'll tell them that he is selling weed out of our house because he gets shipments in big ass boxes from california, literal pounds of weed that he doles out as our only source of income (very illegal in my state). So I leave and and couchhopping for the first week or two, jumping between friends houses, my aunts house, and the hospital (where my grandma was for a bit because she fell ill). I carried in my bookbag my schoolwork, my pair or two of clothes, and a shit ton of dnd books and dice with me wherever I went. Nothing but a bus card to keepme traveling. I thankfully found somewhere safe and familiar to sleep every one of those nights, but it was always tense watching the sun go down and frantically asking friends (of which I had 2 that I was close enough with to sleep over) if I could crash. At the time I was also balls deep in a school musical I had to commit to every day for hourse after school and on weekends. After about 2 weeks after leaving, I was able to move in to my (former) best friends house. Now he is pretty well off though his dad is pretty strict so I wasnt sure if he'd let me move in-but he did and I was ecstatic. 

That month or two was great. Easily the highlight of my year. Good to come home to a normal, clean household with actual food in the cupboards. An actual nice family full of people who actually care for each other. They seriously are a better family to me than my own family (mostly) is to me and each other. Its a shame him and I arent friends anymore because I do love them. Anyways, after a month or two of living stable, my actual household was pretty much crumbling. My dad out with a kind, parting fight in telling my mom and sister that he never loved them and he goes on his merry way (taking half our shit and my can of expensive tomatoes that I was gonna use for a recipie that he will NEVER open anyways).

My friends dad constantly asked how my mom was doing (because you know i was living at his house and I dont blame him for wanting me to gtfo, like its his house and he is not obligated to let me stay there) so as I got the information that my dad was out of the picture I felt it would be weird to try and stay at my friends house for any longer (even though I desperately wanted to stay) and I rejoined my mom and sister.

I move back to our house and my mom has little money and no job (as my dad was taking care of all that). Our house also hadnt had rent or utilities paid so we were kinda just waiting for eviction day til we had to migrate somewhere else. (Which we had already done once since they came back, this was our second place in like 4 months). By this time it was May. Probably. Anyways our utilities are shut off like electricity and what not and we subsisted on donated food until the day came. I fucking dreaded coming home every day and usually spent my time away, at friends houses or riding around on my bike. Additionally, my mom kept both the dogs I mentioned earlier and always had them penned up in the kitchen where the floor became covered in piss and shit. Basically it was a fuckin crackhouse and we let the clock tick until we were evicted because my mom never wanted to go and get a job. (Seriously. Its not like she had a bad break or anything, she was just lazy.)  

So we are evicted and the only place there is to go is my insane aunts house (that already had 11 people in it). 3 people and 2 dogs move in, though my uncle kicks the dogs out and my mom with them and my mom and the dogs go to stay with her friend. After about a week or so my sister also goes to live at my mom's friends. Im pretty much just chillin at my aunts house waiting for summer so I can dorm at a local college during the weekdays (part of this program im in) when my sister moves back in to my aunts and mom moves to god knows where. I seriously dont know where she went in the time until july rolled around. Finally school ends and I get to move into my college during the summer, staying at the the college during the week and staying at friends houses over the weekends (beause my aunts house is horrid though ill get to that). The program finally ends though and I have to come back to my aunts. While I was gone my mom moved in with her boyfriend somewhere out of the city and my sister got an apartment with her friend. Also while I was gone, I come back to find that my bike tires were slashed because I didn't let my cousin ride it. So begins the part where I explained how fucking terrible my aunts house is.

I live at my aunts house (currently) with my Aunt B (the actual matriarch of the house who i reference when i say ""aunts house"") my uncle-her husband- who is almost never here because I can only imagine he dislikes it here as I do. My 3 cousins, 1 of which is in 5th grade and the other two who are out of high school. My Aunt L whos room I sleep in and is actually pleasant. Finally, my grandma, who is in poor health and is always in her recliner, tethered to an oxygen machine (At 62!). I sleep on the floor on a blanket in Aunt L's room because it is the cleanest spot in the house, though it is next to the smelly-ass cat food bowls and I am often covered in litter and cat food bits in the morning. I am almost always in her room because the rest of the house is disgusting. NOBODY cleans up ANYTHING after themselves. Be it food, clothing, trash, spills-NOTHING. The house smells and the kitchen sink is perpetually full. The floor is covered in dirt, crumbs, liquids, and whatever the hell else they track around. The counters are full of spilled food, abandoned dishes half filled with buffets of uneaten for the large population of flies, and containers of fresh food left open for said flies also eat. The living room is full of trash and the couches and old and smelly, covered in stains and food, having been pissed on, sweated on, spilled on, and countless more *ons* that I cannot be bothered to list. Whats worse is that even though we have large amounts of food, my Aunt B flips out at anyone trying to eat anything because she'd rather let the food sit and rot while she orders delivery for herself every day. She is also always on drugs. Dont know what kind, possibly opiates. She has recently taken to staying in the bathroom for 6 hour intervals. This house is absolutely disgusting and the only ones who will clean are my Aunt L and I so she hounds us to clean after 10 other peoples messes. And we have plenty of times, though if all your progress is completely reveresed after just a day then its extremely disheartening to continue. We never have laundry detergent so my clothing is always dirty. She flips out at me for leaving though when I try to contact her she doesnt respond. She has been promising to buy me a new bike tire (because her son slashed the current one) since august so I can actually get myself places though she has yet to deliver. She also refuses to pay any of the fees that I have for school. And yet she is trying to get custody of me and food stamps in my name (which she would not use to buy food). As a cherry on top, she and my cousins are thieves and will take anything they want provided nobody is looking so I have to always keep what little money I have hidden away with my Aunt L. 

I fucking hate all of them. I hate this household. I really just want to leave. I don't deserve this. It's worse than what I write but articulating the immeasurable scumminess and injustice of my situation is a herculean task. I am currently in the talks of moving in with my other friend.

I want to change careers, but I dont think I will be hired anywhere since I only got a minor. I am trying to improve my resume by participating in a hackathon and collaborating in a student organization. Yet even with that, I still feel that is not enough since I dont have internship experience under the belt. I looked into the masters program in computer science (MPCS) at the University of Chicago, and it seems to be an excellent program for technical training within their quarter system, but the only drawback is their price (50 to 60k) for 1.5 years. I am also want to apply to my university; but as it looks like, the program is way too competitive to get in. Luckily, I have no debt to pay off 'cause im too poor to pay for college (FASFA has been a great help). Here are my thoughts to keep moving forward: 1) get a job in biotech, 2) try to get a job in a local tech company, 3) apply to chicago and get in debt (with a potential job prospect), 3) wait a year and take graduate courses at my university.

9mn37v,2,2018-10-09,Any advice on how to get out of a third world country with IT?,kvng_stunner,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9mn37v/any_advice_on_how_to_get_out_of_a_third_world/,"Right now, I'm 22, and I'll be graduating college next year. Im studying Agricultural Engineering, but I know for a fact that I want to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer screen. I just got my CCNA a few weeks ago and I have a couple internships under my belt (I worked at the NOC of a small ISP). The problem is that in my country, I have very few opportunities for a career in networking. Most companies are stuck in the dark ages tech wise and here's like 7 ISPs in the whole country.

Beyond that, this country is absolute dogshit and I can't imagine living in these conditions for much longer (at best I have electricity 8 hours a day).

I'd honestly rather not have to go back to school once I get this degree, but I'm not totally against it. My question is, is there any chance I could get an entry level position in the EU or North America that would even consider a potential immigrant? Or should I just suck it up and learn to fix tractors?"
9mnxvr,2,2018-10-09,I feel like i'm using my feelings as leverage...,WafflerCraft,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9mnxvr/i_feel_like_im_using_my_feelings_as_leverage/,"Does anyone else feel like this?

For context: A few years ago I got diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety after a major depressive episode where I attempted suicide and got very close to dying but didnt. I had other attempts in the past but they weren't serious and otherwise just extreme thoughts. I also somehow got PTSD from a fear of feeling the way I did before when I did make up my mind and attempt suicide. Weird? But from my multiple sessions with the psychiatrist and the medication i've been taking they say that it's generally probably another factor in my anxiety. 

Regardless this happened at the very end of my school year and I never really graduated in terms of doing my HSC(Final Exams) but I did receive a mark/ATAR and got into a good uni because my marks beforehand were great.

Now I've been in uni for 2 years and I have fun but I always felt like I've become dumber. It's harder to work on things than when I previously didn't know my condition. I feel a lot slower, more stressed (somehow) and became someone who was just happy by passing my courses, when in the past I did better and was able to keep on top of things (Like volunteering, but that's overcome me and I spend more time doing that, than actual work) 

I still hand things in on time and whatnot but I skip class if I dont feel well and ask my psychiatrists for documents that allow me to be known as a ""disabled"" student on campus. Which allows me to skip class. 

I dont put in special applications to get my deadline increased or anything like that because I feel like it's unfair to everyone else. But the internship I'm in now (A Subject that contains an internship) has a project that has changed its deliverable about 4 times over 11 weeks meaning the work the team and I have done has been worthless for the most part. 

But here's the thing because I can't go to work all the time I've missed a few days. I've made some up. But not all. This has kinda led to my co-workers (rightly) becoming sick of me I think. I was put in charge of the presentation we have to do while they finish off our client work and as I left the room I could hear them talking about how I had the easy job. The only reason for that was because I had a mishap and didn't come for 2 work days and was completely behind for last week. Something that I felt was completely out of my control. My other co-worker posted some of his medicine (anti-biotics) in the group chat and everyone was worried for him. I was kinda wondering where's my comfort but then I realized they probably think I'm a lazy cunt. During work I'm accused (i dont know if he says this jokingly or not) of not doing anything/not touching my work even though I have been. I dont think anyone there likes me that much. But we finish in 2(?) weeks so I can manage.

It's just that I have work tommorow and I hate it. I think they're nice people and if i came out and said i'm heavily suicidal. That's why i've been gone for a spell or here's the meds I take they would understand. But is that just me using my condition as an excuse?

I feel like I do this a lot, even to myself. I'll say to myself, well i've been sick this morning. I'll take a day to myself sometimes. Or i'll just stay in bed. I remember this semester my academic advisor said I might be suspended if i fail a subject because I failed one subject last semester. When i tried to talk about my condition she kinda shrugged it off and said well you need to learn how to deal with it.

Am i being incredibly whiny and not learning how to live with this because it's really hard to even start thinking about how it would work. I can do most things normally. But on some days, in some environments I just shut down and I can't do anything. I feel like I'm a dirty person when I excuse myself and my poor results because of my condition. I read stuff all the time about people rising above their conditions but it's just gotten worse. I'm getting stressed out now by another assignment and the deliverable's I was supposed to do for my work group. I just had my mom come back from overseas after a month so that kinda took me a bit to get my head around. I feel pathetic even writing this. I feel like i'm experiencing what everyone does normally but I just can't deal with it. I've been very suicide the last 2 weeks and even now, even during mid semester break. It didn't feel like a break

I'm always told to go outside, and I do go with my friends but that just leaves me tired on the 100 hour bus home. And they dont go out that much because they're studying or they have society specific events. 

I'm just really lost right now. I want to die and i feel an extreme amount of anxiety towards any work. I feel like I should just quit uni if i'm feeling this way. But I do a lot of stuff around uni and did a lot of work, I've only got 1-2 more years then I can find a job that somehow suits me.

I don't know to be honest I feel like vomiting all the time, and I have involuntarily just out of how my body feels. I've been gaining weight like mad as well. 30+ kilo's since I start on meds and I try to eat healthy and go to the gym but I feel like shit after the gym, like i want to collapse and I can't eat a lot of healthy things because i'm a picky eater. I hate seafood + Any form of sauces like mustard, dressing or mayo. other than that I can eat most things. But i still get sick even if it doesnt taste bad.

I'm kinda in tatters, not that bad compared to a lot of people but I feel like i've been excusing all of my behaviour as a 2 year long ""depression"" festival. I haven't been able to do what I want to do a lot of the time, I've learnt how to go out a lot more lately though because I work at the university for mental health (haha) because I take it very seriously and I have fun there. But when i do work at that workplace I feel like shit. I don't like shouting (dont know why, i usually cry if someone (like a teacher/supervisor) shouts at me or the group) and I'm 20 as of now. I'm a disgrace.

If you can't tell I'm very conscious of what people think of me.

I don't know. I've written way too much but I feel like getting this off my chest. I dont even know if this goes here. I just feel like I use my depression as some form of leverage.

I'll finish off with another example in case you guys empathize with me and dont think i'm an utter scumbag who uses his disability as leverage. 

I was playing a game of league about a year ago, it was a bad game. After many bad games one of my good friends got really mad at my ""build"" and my ""items"" and it frustrated me and i told him to ""Shut the fuck up, if this game is so important to you, you might as well kill yourself"". I mean it was the heat of the moment , I was mad/ashamed/embarrased/etc at my game skills and how he talked about it.

When I said it I instantly got banned from the discord. Now when this happened I was kinda amused because I thought my comeback line was kinda snappy even though I told someone to kill them self. Something I should be very much against I guess. I defended myself by saying it was between friends and you usually do have these over the top criticisms between friends. Like us all being racist to each other. And the fact that I did have depression and did attempt suicide.

This kinda led to me talking to people who were still on that discord chat on fb and arguing my point when some of them were saying you just shouldn't say that. Certain news arose of what problems they've had in the past and I feel like I gatekeeped that, even though i didnt say it to anyone (I think) because I felt like, my suffering trumps yours because i'm medically diagnosed. Which is a dick move but whatever, I felt like it was brought up because there was really nothing to use against my depression statement (even though i was being a dick). 

This led to the friend saying I abuse my depression to get people  to like me, and thats kinda been on my head the last year or so. I kinda broke out crying because I kinda remember my parents crying and especially my dad who never cried (at least that i would see) and them not admitting me to the psych ward and taking me to a psychiatrist instead, staying outside my room kinda weeping. I hate those memories and I kinda went ape shit to the point where i got the police called on me because another friend thought I was in danger. lol. But after that I wrote an apology to him because I didn't want to talk to him. And we never talked again. With that a lot of my friends left. I kinda had no other friends left after that. Because he plays with my high school friends. some of who were against me from the start telling me to come into the discord again and tell whatever argument i was saying to them, to my friends. And obviously no one would do that because you'd be going into a chat with like 4-6 other people against you, just slamming you so there wasn't much point in that. 

After that i guess deservedly. More and more bad things happened to me. In terms of just focus and finding friends. I get stressed out more easily. If i ever see them i get scared. I'm a real piece of shit I really deserve to die. I just use a lot of excuses at the end of the day. This post could be a huge excuse, something to make myself feel better about myself. 

I wish I could just die and just stop all this nonsense. I've got way too much to deal with and too much stress and I can't deal with any of it normally. Usually it'd be as easy as dividing it up, dot pointing it and then doing said tasks but I can't even get myself to do anything like that.

I just want to sleep, but I can't cause I feel like vomiting all the time. Just fucking kill me right now. I meet no ones expectations I get shit on by my friends, academic advisor, that one thing I applied for and got in but couldn't do because I had tests on the day and the person said you shouldn't apply for things if there is a 50% chance of not doing it because of how competitive this is. I dont care how easy the fucking work is, how easy it is to do a powerpoint and to do content I'm not a 4th year law student sorry. I'm just a stupid 2nd year who somehow lucked my way through life and got into good positions. What the fuck is going on in my life. If I stop I'll feel the ultimate shame and humiliation but if i dont i'm overwhelmed. Either way I'm gonna want to die. Why can't I.

Fucking hell I'm pretty stupid aren't I. just a little whinger.  "

I am also currently studying to get my Security+ cert in a month or so. Currently, I have an offer from a smaller company in the area for an IT security job and another offer for a DevOps job at a much larger and upcoming company. Security is my passion, however, working at the larger company would be a great experience with the possibility to move into a security role down the road. Getting security job offers with little full-time experience has been difficult so I am wondering If I should take the security job at a smaller company for a few years or go for a larger company and work my way into one. In your experience is it possible to transition into security roles or should I gain experience now and apply years down the road?

In high school I was an total loser and ate my lunch in the toilet room (seriously). After high school I was done with myself and started an daily habit of alcohol, tabbaco, cannabis and somtimes hard drugs. I still had extreme social anxiety but I also managed to find other drug abusers/addicts with who I could connect so it didn't matter for me that I was weird. After high school I started college and i managed to get my degree. However the first years of my college I was always stoned in class, talked about hard drugs and was extremely drunk during some college related trips.

I am now  almost an year clean and sober. I don't drink, smoke anything or take hard drugs. And i'm on an low dose dexedrine for ADHD. I even managed to get accepted for an prestigious traineeship with an extremely good job. However I am extremly scared for starting the job this week. During my internships I never ate lunch or talked because I was scared.

Big part of the traineeship is socializing during dinner or network events. And I don't drink so that's weird during dinners and stuff. But I also have to talk a lot. And I have to take lunch breaks.

More worse is that an collegue was in the same class as me during college. And she hated me for being stoned, lazy and stuff. I am extremly sober right now but my social anxiety is peaking. Do you have any advice?"
9mq64o,1,2018-10-09,How do you chart a path through an industry this complex?,Mummelpuffin,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9mq64o/how_do_you_chart_a_path_through_an_industry_this/,"I went to a technical high school.  They had an IT shop, which I spent half of those four years at.  Unfortunatly, three of those four years were spent with incompetent teachers (old electrical guy who can't discipline students and thinks A+ / Net+ is relevant, a programmer who was somehow hired to teach us CCNA and spent his time learning the certs himself... we successfully peritioned to fire him).


That was four years ago, and I failed ever cert related test I attempted.  I was totally to blame of course, but it was hard to be professional in a class full of unprofessional HS kids who chose IT because they wanted to be the memelords in the basement (we *were* in the basement, fun sense of humor.)


I got a co-op job at a little PC store in my last year of HS in which I babysat machines installing windows or windows updates for hours on end, and rarely helped troubleshoot hardware problems / purge viruses.  A year or so later I randomly called some other repair shop and got an unpaid ""internship"" for about a year.  By that time most of my prior knowledge, which wasn't much anyways, was gone, especially anthing networking-related.  The owner liked me though so he kept me around and I stayed for ""experience"" even though I never felt as if I was learning anything.  I even babysat their sister store as it closed down, which involved being the only person in a mostly empty building with nothing but a screwdriver and attempting to solve people's problems while explaining that the store's closing, hence the lack of furniture.  Boss finally had me leave because he'd rather I found a paying job.


That was two years ago, and I haven't had a job in IT since.  I briefly went to school for software development before deciding that it's a way too competitive industry for me, so here I am, looking to get back into IT again.

Problem is, ""IT"" means so many things.  I'd like to specialize in some form of cybersecurity eventually and even then supposedly to r/cybersecurity I'd need to specialize somehow.


**TL;DR**
It seems like the IT industry is a mile wide and a mile deep.  How do I figure out what I should be doing to progress down a chosen path from square one when things change too quickly to map?"

(TLDR at end) Taught  high school science for two years in one state, recently moved and my saving went from 10,000 to 1,000 with no steady income. 

I am completing my last quarter of my masters which requires an internship. I was hoping to do the internship over the summer so I could potentially find a full time teaching position in the fall but due to a variety of complications out of my control, I had to settle on doing it in the fall or waiting a whole year for another non guaranteed position. 

Because I am doing my internship, I can only work part time (3 days a week) so I decided subbing would be my best option while I finished up because I loved my job as a high school teacher! 

Well, it took my new state 3 months to process my teaching license (submitted early July) even with me calling them every other week until it was done. When I finally got it, last week, I missed a month of potential pay. And now that I can work I am not even guaranteed a job on my working days.  I am so new to the district that all the positions are taken by people on “preferred sub lists” before they get pushed out to me. And when they do, I have to accept within seconds to  beat someone else out to get the job. 

So far I have been waking up early and sitting on my phone refreshing the application hoping to get a position while also periodically calling the office but haven’t had much luck.

I feel hopeless and am running out of money quick. I had 3,000 that I’d saved specifically for a trip to Europe I had been planning for years but now that dream is crushed and I am heartbroken.  I currently live with my boyfriend who is more the understanding of my position and willing to front all the bills until I find a job but I hate being a ‘free loader’ with every ounce of my being. 

I spent the better half of this morning crying because I felt hopeless. 

I love working with people, especially high school students, but feel at the end of my rope with job options. 

What other jobs are related to teaching or work with children/students that would have supplement my income? Unfortunately they will have to be part time until I finish my masters in December.



TLDR; Running out of money, can’t find subbing jobs. What other jobs are out there for teacher minded folk? 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening to my sob story. I hope everyone is having a good day ❤️"

There is not much talk however for the EU counterpart. My question/proposition is to create a thread(or use this one) where people can post information about the best intern positions in the EU.

Keep in mind, that most people come from countries with not very big cs backgrounds, it is therefore difficult to compete for internships with big European universities. So more mid-range internship positions could be proposed to help people like me.

For example, i am finishing a no name University in Greece, i find it really difficult to land big intern positions abroad (or even here) because people seek big names, even though i have put a lot of hours working on my own.

So my question is, how can someone get into the big league, and in case he cant, which are the best positions and which countries to look for."

The first four are the ones I'm personally applying to.

Disclaimer- I live in NC and I generally wanted to stay within a 4 hour drive of home(Unless I love the city, hence MIT still on my list), so the farther away I got from home, the more my college knowledge narrows. But that's why I made this list! I want others to add on to this and help make a more expansive list for people who might not be rock solid on where they wanna apply for these kind of programs.

Clemson(Specifically the honors program)- new business building just built, honors dorms are beautiful(and some regular students can even get into the honors dorm), great campus, great student life.

Chapel Hill- Obviously a top choice for NC residents, but a great school as Kenan-Flagler business is #7 in undergraduate business and also has a great variety of pre-med programs. Great traditional college town.

MIT- top five business school, little nerdier community, but a great environment for people who genuinely love learning. Small class sizes for business too.

Emory University- Great location as you're super close to Atlanta for internships and connections. Top business school, and great med school on campus as well. Proximity to these things plus a warm environment is a being plus for me.(plus my parents both got their MBAs here)

University of South Carolina- Great international business program, and the honors college isn't impossible to get in to. Personally don't like the campus that much but that's because I like a more traditional college town feel. Great proximity to the state capitol too.

UGA- not much to say here, just a good college. haven't personally toured here but I've heard it's beautiful.

University of Richmond- Good school in virignia, lots of kids from my school applyinng there, but don't know a ton about it.

Georgia Tech- Great college, hard to get in to, but you don't have to do engineering here!

Duke- Business program here is economics and finance, but no management or marketing. 

UVA- Not a management school, but good programs all across the board. Good campus.

Washington and Lee- Small school(1800 undergrad), but everyone who goes there seems to love it. Great variety of business programs as well as programs outside the business school.

Let me know what else you guys have in mind for this general area, and what you guys think about these colleges. Thanks!

I go to a top US university with a good CS program. I've pretty much struggled and gotten awful grades my entire time here. I was supposed to graduate last semester, but couldn't due to failing a required class for the second time. I decided to try to give it another try this semester, but I've continued to struggle. I have around a 1.5 CS GPA (I need a 2 to graduate), I'm doing poorly for a third time in my required class (if I fail it a third time, I'm suspended for a year), and I'm starting to see less and less of a chance for me to graduate at all.

I'm going to wait until after my midterm, but it's looking increasingly likely that the best option for me is to cut my losses and drop out. I don't have any internships or projects (outside of ones I did for class), so I have no clue what kind of a job I could possibly get with part of a college education. I'm clearly not equipped for software development, so my first thought was something in IT, but even those jobs seem to require things that I don't have (BS, certain clearances, certificates, 3+ years experience, etc.) so I don't even know where to begin. I'm pretty clueless and terrified right now, but I need to find a job to start paying my parents back for the 4+ years of time and money I wasted. Is there anybody who has experienced a similar situation who can give me some direction or advice on getting started in IT or some similar field?"

So how do I get professional experience that is enough for an internship position? I have done personal projects solo or with teams up to 15 people. Are projects not enough? This is so contradicting that I think they just used an excuse because they didn't need me anymore to save face.

Its at about 2.8 right now and most every position I have seen has required at least a 3.0. I think by the end of this ongoing semester I will be at or around 3.0 but application season is right now. I think I am a good programmer and have gotten really good grades in all of my math and CS courses, but my freshman year was rough as I just did not care and ended up getting C's and D's in a lot of core classes. Has anyone here been in a similar situations, but still had companies take a chance on you for an internship? Should I show my GPA in my resume and explain that my CS GPA is a lot better?

-Money, I want to make money in the summer, be it as a developer or in retail.

-Foreign Experience, I won't stay in Spain to work, pay is low and long work days.

Here is the experience I will have:

-2 year course of multiplatform apps (Java, C, VBA, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, Android and some business related formation).
-Some projects in C, Java and C#
-C1 level in English
-I will have 6 months of experience working as a programmer by September of next year

Here is what I will work on before college:

-Programming (Java), I am working with some books (Java Core, Efficient Java) to expand what I learn in class.
-Good practices with some resources like Clean Code.
-Other stuff like Git, etc.

Then in college, I will work a lot on Algorithms and Data Structures.

I have no preference about where the job would be (preferably south because of the weather), so i would be open to applying everywhere.

I am mostly worried about how hard people say it is to get a 1st year internship and I have the added difficulty of being foreign so I would like if you could tell me if I am just being delusional, how hard is it if I already have experience at programming?

Thanks a lot in advance!"

Despite this, I feel hopelessly behind and have no idea what to do.

I've never had an internship (never applied out of fear of failure), and I don't work on any personal projects. I have, however, taken a wide range courses and have a ton projects from these courses under my belt. My resume consists of these class projects, and the languages I've learned. Under experience, I have listed my position in a student group, a research opportunity from many summers back, and a tutoring service I've created.

I'm confident in my peoples skills, and I've been told I'm very charming, I just always doubted my coding abilities and assumed a fixed growth mindset for a large period of time. This past summer consisted of me doing absolutely nothing, just three months living in a torn state of wanting to do so much and severe depression/apathy.  Now I'm at this point in my college career where all my previous decisions  and lifestyle choices have come to haunt me, and I have no idea what to do to rectify them. I've been trying so hard to change my habits for the better, to manage my time to the T, and doing everything I could to be the best possible version of myself (classes, working out, extracurriculars, applying to jobs) .

There are many career fairs taking place, and I'm not sure what the next step I should take is. Should I be applying to internship positions even though I'm graduating? Should I be applying to full time positions even though I feel like my resume is lacking? I've even considered skipping this upcoming career fair (so I don't make a bad impression), working hardcore on a complete project/tiny startup for the next month to add something to my experience, and applying in the next career fair?

If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I feel so lost and alone. Everyone I know has had internships or has already graduated and are working full time in these big name companies, and I don't really have anyone to ask for advice without being judged. Thanks in advance."

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that the first offer I received with company A only had a deadline of one week and that deadline is this Friday (10/12). However, there are still two on-sites I'm scheduled for (and my flights have already been booked for both) on 10/19 and 11/2 for company B and C respectively. I would accept company A straight up as the offer is awesome, but I've read some things about bad work-life balance and some scathing reviews on r/cscareerquestions (although their Glassdoor ratings are awesome).

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try to get company A to extend the offer? I feel like asking them to extend it to the 10/19 onsite is reasonable, but 11/2 is pushing it. If I do get them to try to extend it, how should I word it? I was thinking of mentioning that company B (and maybe company C?) has already paid for my flight and set up my onsite and I would at least like to see that through to really evaluate all my options. I'm worried asking them to extend the deadline to 11/2 or even 10/19 might make them rescind the offer though.

&amp;#x200B;

Would there be a difference in response from company A if I asked them to extend the offer and later reneged than if I didn't ask them to extend the offer and later reneged? I feel like either way I would get blacklisted and they're a pretty big, well paying company that I would like to maybe have the option of working for in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry my text is all over the place, I'm just freaking out trying to figure out how to pick the best internship while pissing off as few companies as possible. If anyone has any advice please help :)

&amp;#x200B;
Also, would it be worth contacting company C and asking if it's possible at all to do a bunch of video interviews instead of on-site interviews so I can get a result earlier? I don't want company C to know that I might renege on another company's offer however, as it might look bad on me and I really love company C also. And if company C says they can't do the earlier video interviews and I say I'll still come to the onsite, it'll look like I'm willing to renege on another company right?

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t been happy at current company for over a year and am currently exploring a similar position at a rival company. I enjoy what I do, just not where I currently do it.

Some background: I have been working at current company (CC) for almost 10 years and had been an intern before that. It is the only professional job I’ve ever known. Beginning 2017, a medical condition I’m afflicted with – of which CC is aware of – starting acting up. It’s the type of disease that’s “invisible” to everyone accept the one suffering. Long story short, it caused problems for me with CC leading to trust issues, invasion of privacy, and discussions among all my superiors about the issue with each other but not directly discussing anything with me - until I called someone out for literally spying on me. There were bad feelings all around after this (I assume… definitely bad feelings on my end) that everyone else has seemed to move on from. I still feel like an episode of Big Brother every day when I go to work and it has caused me an insane amount of anxiety.

CC says they want to help me continue to grow and develop, yet they also act as if they want/need to control every aspect of my life between 8-6 M-F. I feel restricted in what I’m able to do professionally outside of work and as if I’m just another cog in their machine required to put out 40 hours of pure billable time every week (at a minimum).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been approached by recruiters and sent my resume to a rival company where I would be able to do the same work, but in a different environment (others from CC have quit to move to rival company and love it). From the outside, rival company – assuming further interviewing, an offer, etc meet expectations – is a no brainer move. What I’m struggling with is how to handle a move like this – I’ve only ever worked for CC. I don’t know how to negotiate favorable terms with rival company or how to “break up” with CC. In a way I feel bad that I’m even considering leaving CC after all the good things they’ve done for my career. I feel like I’m letting down the people I still like who work there and completely screwing everyone over.

I know that a move is probably the best thing I can do for myself health wise and professionally, but it’s going to be extremely difficult for me to deal with the conflict of quitting CC. Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies in advance for the rant. I don't really care if anyone reads this but I just need to vent. Maybe someone can learn something from this. And I'd also like to say in the grand scheme of things I have zero real things to complain about--- people would fucking kill to life the life I'm leading--- I recognize that. This isn't intended to come off as bragging. I know it does. Whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years ago I was in your shoes----college app season browsing A2C. I played the high school game---great grades, testing, stellar ECs. Like all of you I had I dreams of going to all the top colleges. I sacrificed my high school social life (and life in general really) in the name of getting into a great college----I came from a high school full of demotivating students that typically went to schools that were all means fine but far from what this sub would consider top---""mediocre"" if you will. I worked my ass off writing essays and jumping through all the hoops. I keep telling myself that I would finally enjoy myself and have fun in college. But like many of you right now, I felt as if my entire life depended on getting that magical acceptance letter.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what? I succeeded. I got into a T20 university---T10 for engineering, which I now attend and study. Looking back, the last semester of my high school career was the time of my life---- I put little effort into my classes, hung out with friends everyday, and went to parties and even drank---something just a few years prior I thought I would never do.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: for the love of fucking god, no matter what kind of nerd or loser or study or whatever you are---- enjoy your senior year and have a god damn beer if you haven't already. Everyone----I mean \*\*everyone\*\* parties in college. It's best you have your first experience with alcohol while you're still at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come college time---everything went to shit. No just kidding I kept working hard. Because guess what the thing is with top colleges/STEM/college in general? You're going to be surrounded with people just like you. Sure, your first semester or year might be easy. But eventually your classes are going to hit you like a brick. I probably study 50 hours a week outside of class. It's fucking hell. It can kill the interest you have in any subject. There are times where I want to say fuck it and give up. Some nights are truly miserable. There are times when you keep going just because you know that the alternative is far worse---be it switching into something you know you'll hate more or just failing out. Last week I had 4 midterms in 1 week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lucky that I've always had my work pay off-- I'm a second year now. Last week I landed a dream internship that people would literally kill to have. It's at a company that tens of thousands of people apply to intern at. People's faces light the fuck up when you mention the name. This place is literally harder to get a job at than getting into fucking Harvard. I'm going to be making more money this summer as an intern than the majority of US makes.

&amp;#x200B;

My social life is also fucking great. I'm in a fraternity. I get to go to insane parties. I have lots of friends and plenty of interactions with the opposite sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds great right? Yeah on paper. it does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I still feel like I'm wasting my life in the name of ""later"". Just like I did in high school. Since middle school ended, I've never had a regular amount of substantial free time. As a result I don't have any fucking hobbies that I just like to do for fun. Something that relieves stress. I feel like I'm living my life to work. I feel like I'm track to burn out. I haven't yet. I still have discipline to get my shit done---something that I've been programmed to do like a fucking robot since middle school. I feel like I don't even know how to have fun or enjoy myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not depressed or sucidial. Honestly, I'm just having a bad night and need to vent. In general, I'm happy with where I am. But this night has made me look back and contemplate life a bit. I don't know where this post is going. I guess the message is to stop and enjoy yourself for a while. Take time for yourself. You're living at home right now and this is probably the last time you'll ever have true freedom. Shit's going to start hitting you like a brick slowly but surely. Life isn't getting easier and a college acceptance won't make you happy in the long term. Interpret as you will. Remember to live.

Is this really true? Seems to me that it's false, at least for tech lately.

I'm a typical CS fresh grad with a few internships on my CV that recently got rejected from 2 big-X companies, once at online interview, second at onsite. Reasons? \~ 'We were expecting better technical skills'. Is this BS or not? 

My CV is impeccable (according to other people) and tailored to the positions. At all the interviews we ended up casually chatting. All the technical problems/questions I answered correctly, with efficient solutions, and within the allocated time. It is true that in both cases have received 1-2 hints but am I seriously expected to directly spit out best solutions?

What do I even work on from the above feedback? They wouldn't go into specifics (which would hint it's a company-fit problem?). In my area there aren't many tech firms so a few rejections actually means a high percentage of positions gone.

So are soft skills truly more important in pure tech positions?"
9mxnwh,42,2018-10-10,6th year in engineering :(,sachinssakri,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/9mxnwh/6th_year_in_engineering/,I have joined course in 2013 and its 2018 now I will be hopefully completing my engineering in 2020 so it will be like 7 years of bachelors. When I see my juniors I feel left out and I still try to mix up with them and studying is getting hard with every passing day. I feel left out in class and project classes are harder to get by. Getting judged by teachers as well as fellow students is getting to me and I failed a mid term today and I have never been so depressed in my entire life. I don't know what to do my current batch mates are making it to nice internships and I have been rejected by everyone I don't know how depressing its going to get. But with every day passing away I feel like giving up everything and walking out of college and kill myself. Only reason I am still alive is because I have already wasted 5 years of my life and if I don't succeed in it my life will be worth nothing.

I'm 19 years old, web development college student and currently on academic probation and failing most of my classes. Im lazy/unorganized/unmotivated. I don't have a job (much to the disappointment of my parents) but my college is paid for through a trust fund from my grandfather. If I fail out this semester, I think I'm going to kill myself.

  
My parents (mainly my mom, I don't see dad much) are constantly criticizing me. Telling me I need a job, that I need to do internships or I won't be able to get a job after college. I have tried to get a job, but I haven't been able to so I'm frankly kind of discouraged from trying at this point. She has no place to give life advice for a lot pf reasons, so theres a part of ke that wants to kill myself to spite her.

  
All I want to do is get a decent paying office job and build some sort of life for myself after college. If I fail out, I don't see that ever happening. I don't know what I'd do with my life, and whatever I would do I'd probably do so poorly at that it wouldn't work out.

  
I don't know how I'd do it. If i could afford a gun that'd be my first choice, but probably more likely is id mix alcohol with a bunch of xanax and go like that.

  
I'm not sure what my point is with this post. Life advice or suicide advice I guess.

However I have had recruiters present opportunities as high as $40/hr or $85,000 while some gasping at the idea of my asking price telling me my expectation for entry level is too high, wanting me to put in for positions that are $18/hr or $40,000.

Posted last week -“I’m in my 2nd year pursuing a civil engineering degree however I am the first one to do so in my family so I have no prior knowledge of anything and what to do and whatever. My dad wanted me to choose civil so I did (save your “do your passion” speeches”) and my first year was just all the normal core classes like English and math but this semester I’m taking computer science which I have no prior knowledge at all of, chem calc and a civil engineering site planning class, and it’s kicking my ass. I got tasked with in my site planning class to write out a timeline of my life basically of what I want to work as and where, however I am completely clueless on this subject. My dad said he wants me to work under someone for a few years then be my own person, but what the hell does that mean if I’m working at a engineering firm? Like when I graduate then I work at a firm for a bit then become my own person in that firm? Also, for the CEs out there how effective was school in teaching you the concept that you use in your everyday work life. For ex I ask upper classmen a question about the class I’m taking right now and they said “idk I forgot” like how are you supposed to become a engineer like that if school fosters you to learn something for a semester or two then just throw that knowledge out? I’m really at a crossroads in life right now, debating what my future is going to be. Like I don’t know anything about internships or anything like that, am I supposed to be doing it during school? I know older people in school who aren’t? Anything would help I know it’s a lot thanks.”

I'm taking three courses this semester: Operating Systems, Programming Languages, and Computer Organization 2. I'm thinking about dropping computer organization 2, and I'm looking for some insight on how valuable the course may be. I find the material to be uninteresting and monotonous, and I'm feeling unmotivated to study the material (this is not the case with my other two classes, I can study rigorously for those). The course is mainly hardware based.

Syllabus for the course: [http://octweb.emich.edu/\~lizhang/courses/cosc321/cosc321schedule.html](http://octweb.emich.edu/~lizhang/courses/cosc321/cosc321schedule.html)

I wonder if the material is valuable to me at all? It's mainly all circuits/hardware. I feel like I will never need to use this material again.

The course is not required for me to graduate. My idea behind taking the course was that it would make me a better engineer. But I really want to put all of my effort into OS and languages. I know 12 credits is a normal course load, but I do a lot of things outside of school (martial arts instructor/practitioner, english tutor, studying intermediate level Korean). Not to mention I have to start applying for internships and prepping for interviews. I feel I could use the extra time to work harder in these other areas.

I don't like giving up, but I feel like something has got to go, and I've already cut back on my *hobbies* significantly. I'm unsure of what I should do. Thanks for reading.

TLDR;

Link to syllabus is above. Is this material vital to my career in CS?"

So, I'm 27, and already established in a low paying, but high demand, career that is destroying my mental and physical health. I'm already at the top of my pay grade, and I've been doing this for 5 years. I feel trapped, and I'm done. It's veterinary medicine, if anyone's curious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go back to my original career plan, computer science, programming to be exact. I changed majors in college, 10 years ago, after 1 class because I didn't like the professor. I took computer science in high school as well, and loved it, hence making it my original major all those years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking into going back to school for it. My plan is 2 years at the local community college for an AS in CS, then transfer to the local university for a BS in CS with a focus in software engineering. I have half a BA in english under my belt, and an AAS in veterinary technology (im licensed) from the same local community college. Thankfully no student loan debt, as my parents were very generous and paid for my schooling went i was younger. However, I know I will need to take out some loans this time around, especially for the university part (est cost is $11,000 a year!) I'm meeting with an adviser at the community college to look over my transcripts and see what classes I already have covered from my previous education. Thankfully, the university and the community college have a guaranteed admissions program set up. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm looking at jobs on Indeed, just to get a feel for the requirements. Many require experience in addition to the degree. I see internships open (not that i'm going to apply or anything, just browsing) and they're either not paid, or like $23,000 a year. I currently make $50,000 a year and that's barely enough to stay afloat in this area. I have a mortgage, and car payments, and adult expenses. I would need to work full time while in school. I'm fine with stretching out my education, and taking classes in the summer as well. I know I don't focus well with online classes, so on campus would  be my only option (thankfully the vet hospital i work at is 24/7, and can work around my school schedule.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no doubt that I will be in my 30s by the time my education is done, with at least $22,000 in student loans + interest, assuming I can't get a scholarships. From what I can find careers START at $55k a year (as opposed to top out at, like my current one) which makes me think I'll be ok in the long run. I'm just freaking out about getting my foot in the door when I really wont be able to afford to not have a job. I have a small emergency fund saved up (6k and growing) but when you own a home, a broken HVAC or something will just empty that. "

I have a BA in English. It took me 10 years to complete it for mental health reasons, so throughout my 20s I worked all kinds of random jobs: retail, call centres, farm, restaurant, parking booth, etc. Finally around age 27 I felt stable and mature enough to handle school properly, so I finished my degree and jumped into a one-year multi-disciplinary journalism program. Learned how to produce video. Got an internship at a highly-respected news outlet, then a paid part-time reporting job with them. When those hours started to dry up, I started part-time at a small marketing firm making promotional videos.

Really enjoyed this, but then was offered a full-time, big-bucks job as a social/digital media specialist with a nearby municipal government. I went for it, but it wasn't a good fit: turns out the job was about 80% website maintenance and graphic design, neither of which are strongsuits for me.

So I got fired. Been out of work now since June. Since about 1 week into this period I've been depressed. I rarely leave home and I find it takes herculean discipline to do really basic self-care tasks, like pay a bill or do some laundry or call about an appointment. (I'm putting off calling about an appointment right now.)

Anyway here's what I'm good at: I can write, I can produce video content (shooting &amp; editing, and much more toward a documentary style than motion graphics/vfx) and I'm an empathetic person who's good at talking and listening to others. I know I'd be a good teacher.

Speaking of which, here are the careers on my radar and where they stand for me. **What I'm hoping for out of this post** is to be corrected on any misunderstandings regarding the following, and/or to get some recommendations that are not on this list.

* **Teaching**: Dream job #1. Here in Ontario, this is a highly-paid job with a pension that's second to none. Unfortunately, my grades from my 10-year undergrad are abysmal. No idea what my GPA is but in regular terms I know my average is in the 50s. Not good enough for any reputable teacher's college, so I'd have to essentially do a 2nd undergrad, *then* teacher's college, *then* try to get a job, but the market's currently over-saturated. Every teacher I know has to cut their teeth with either years as supply, or in remote northern communities that can only be accessed by seaplane.
* **News reporter/editor/producer:** Dream job #2. Would basically do anything in the news industry. I do have a good entry on my resume for this. Unfortunately, the Canadian industry is in free-fall, shrinking rapidly and super competitive. Could get an entry-level job if I was willing to move to the middle of nowhere, or maybe just to Toronto, but I'm anchored to where I live right now because my girlfriend is here and she loves her job. I've applied to my local places, but no luck.
* **Filmmaker/documentarian:** Dream job #3. The impossible dream. Don't think I need to explain this. But I'll say here, on the topic of **freelancing and entrepreneurship:** yes I know I could freelance, but I don't want to do this. I don't have the hustle. I need a boss standing behind me expecting me to do shit. I need a set routine. I'm not good with my own personal finances. Just don't think that path is a good fit. It's not even worth it for me to do some small jobs right now because I'd be violating the conditions of my unemployment insurance.
* **Social worker:** Would be good at it, but it's a lot of school and not even great pay afterwards.
* **Speech language pathologist:** Too much school, and don't even know 100% if I'd like it or be good at it, but it's something in the all-powerful medical field that I actually think is neat.
* **Sales:** Done it, liked the talking to people aspect, but not the selling aspect. I'd be terrible in a commission-based sales position because I can't bring myself to convince someone to buy something if I suspect they shouldn't spend their money on it, or if it's not the perfect thing for them. I'm too much of an altruist for this line of work.
* **Lawyer:** Too many exams and shit, too much school. Would probably be good at it though.
* **Some kind of medical machine technician/operator (X-Ray, MRI, etc.)**  Don't know anything about this, but apparently some of the diploma programs for learning these machines are short, and the job pays decently, and these guys are apparently in demand. (In the city where I live, medical is the biggest employer.) Have no idea if I'd enjoy or have any aptitude for a job like this.
* **Some kind of political aide:** Don't know anything about this either, but I know there are programs out there that are supposed to train people to work in government specifically: as aides, managers, etc. Similar to this, I'm interested in working on political campaigns, either on the marketing side or policy development/research.
* **Politician:** Semi-serious about this one...maybe one day. If I were to run in my local election right now I'd rightly be eviscerated as a loser who just needs a job.
* **Technical Writer:** I know absolutely nothing about this but it sounds depressing. I'm sure I could do it, but I wouldn't want to if it makes me dislike writing in general.
* **Non-profit work/grant proposal writing:** I know next to nothing about this. I think making grant proposal *videos* should be a thing. Could be my thing.

Anyway as you can see, my interests are all over the map. I wrote up this huge post partially just for myself, so I could organize all these thoughts spinning in my head. It would be cool if someone looked at this list and said, you know what, I know just the thing that you haven't thought of! But I appreciate anyone who even reads this, honestly. It's cathartic just to get this stuff out of my head."
9n3giy,7,2018-10-10,Conflicted on Career Path,conflictedEngineer7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9n3giy/conflicted_on_career_path/,"Hi everyone,

I've recently been having some conflict over my career path (as I'm sure many of you have felt before). Some background: I graduated with a double major in CS and Music about 3 years ago and have been working for an audio hardware company for almost 4 years (1-ish year intern, 3 years fulltime). At first it was a dream as I was learning software, firmware, DSP and some hardware. Then, they allowed me to work remotely after I decided to move to the bay area. However, I'm now realizing I haven't learned anything/grown as an engineer (probably my fault for not realizing sooner) because:

1. All engineers are hardware/electrical engineers who have no knowledge of software engineering
2. As the only software engineer (hence no senior software engineer to guide me), I pretty much have been blindly working on all my projects. You can imagine how well this goes
3. Stuck on the very esoteric firmware+software tasks that my coworkers have no knowledge on (related to point #2; some projects are still not complete because my coworkers think I'll figure it out even though I've told them countless times it's not worth for me to spend x # of weeks+months researching the topic. They want me to hack a solution together even if it's not efficient/coded horribly; obviously I do not do this and try to engineer a good solution. Hopefully this kind of gives some insight on my coworkers's and boss's mentality). 

Obviously I've been looking for new jobs for the last couple months; I seem to have no problem getting some interviews (although some companies only see the ""audio"" part in my resume even though I downplay it and tell me career changes are hard??). However, each interview has indicated I have very little knowledge in certain basics+not good at leetcode type problems. An example of the basics is asking me Operating Systems questions (I guess due to my ""experience"" in firmware). None of my friends in the field+age group who work at Big N companies can answer these questions and think they are unimportant to being an engineer… but I think there is a definite merit to knowing the answers to these questions.

So I've kind of hit a roadblock; I'm not sure what to do next. I'm really frustrated with my current job and most days I just want to quit. However, I'm equally frustrated that I'm not passing my interviews from other companies as I'm horrible with the leetcode interview mentality (I've gotten feedback from these interviews that I think like an engineer but my code is really weird and full of problems and I've gotten to an onsite portion at a big N company before). Sometimes I wonder if the best path is quitting my job and go full-time with practicing leetcode questions. Or the non-preferred route... going to grad school. Luckily my company is willing to pay for classes/further education so it's not the worst situation. What would you guys suggest I do next?

tl;dr - Worked at a hardware/DSP company for 3 years after graduating and not growing as a software engineer; learned bad coding practices and attempts at job interviews are going poorly. Not sure what to do next (quit job, keep interviewing, or grad school?) and looking to hear some advice from other engineers on how to grow/progress from a less than stellar situation."

First of all - of course I didn't have any experience. This is like chicken-egg problem and anyone resolve it in different ways.

Second one - How to choose right job. As professional you can find a lot of Job posts, thousands of them but how to choose right one? You can work in web agency or enterprise company. In startup or marketing, in logistic company or in security. A lot of opportunities but totally different experience.

Few weeks ago, I decided to make curated list of jobs and internships in AI Industry.  Daily you can see new opportunities and you can choose any of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**It was some kind of short pitch. Here is my problem/question/ask for advices.**

I'm tech guy and don't have any marketings skills. I share this website with my friends and launch on few platforms. I got first reviews and visits. Few people share link in social networks. 

I asked my first users - Is my idea/product bad?- they say no. 

My next question was - but why you didn't share it?

**And their answer brought me here** \- If I found good job/internship - why I should share it with my friends/followers/etc? I do not want much competition.  

I understand them.

But because of this I can't grow organically. Of course one of the way to resolve problem -  spend a lot of money to advertising. But personally I don't like advertising. So I guess a lot of my users don't like advertising too. 

Why I need to grow? Because if my product is helpful for job seekers/intern/juniors then I want to share it with more people. It give me more motivation to work harder on it. Add new features, post more jobs, etc. It can be much more than just job board.

Right now I'm trying to post it in any place where it people can find it useful. And also pitch directly to any single potential users. I found someone who are interesting in AI or already working in this industry and promote my product in private messages, etc. But you know - this way is not good scalable:) and can't bring me any explosive growth.

Do you have any ideas what I can try to do to increase traffic? If people don't want to share it because of much competition and I don't want to spent money on the start for the useless ads?

9n3ztg,2,2018-10-10,New Grad Job: Defense Contractor OR Big Tech Company,csthrowawayf18,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9n3ztg/new_grad_job_defense_contractor_or_big_tech/,"I'm graduating this December with a BSCS from Big10 University, and have been applying to companies since August. I plan to start in Jan. after winter break since I had the luxury of traveling a lot this past summer, and have a lighter 9-credit semester. So far, these are the best offers I have received. I know I still have time to apply elsewhere, but I'm not quite prepared for Big4 interviews and doubt I can be in 2 months (though I will try). I am expected to send a response within the next week or two.

**Offer #1:** mid-size (~1000 employees) defense contractor

**Title: Jr. Software Engineer**

**Salary: $90K**

I would be a software engineer doing ""full stack"" development. They have a formal onboarding plan for Jr. engineers that goes like this:

I would begin with development on the front-end (React, D3.js), then around the 3-month mark I would be introduced to work on the backend of one of their major projects (Springboot, Java) that utilizes said React frontend. Based on my preferences, I could choose which team I'd want to stay on, or be on both. I would also have an option to join the infrastructure/devops team. I would also be assigned ""mentors""; first is a supervisor who is the dev lead on the team, then another senior software engineer who will be an office-mate.

I feel like this would give me a good foundation in development as a fresh grad, and also provide enough lateral exposure to discover what parts/type of development I like. As for the experience as an intern, they had us do real work that was code reviewed. Based on my observation, they were pretty well-organized in terms of workflow and onboarding. The projects they have are mostly cyber related for the IC and military. Most of the people I met during my internship were friendly, smart, and helpful. The company sponsors sports outings and pays for tech conferences like DEFCON and Black Hat. The environment is best described as flexible. People can and do work hard, but the impression I got was that most engineers don’t have to work more than 40 hours per week unless they want to. There is also schedule flexibility (some come in 6am and leave at 2pm, some do 9/80) and depending on team, can do remote work.

**Interview process:**

Low-key Nepotism -&gt; Engineering Manager Phone Interview -&gt; On-Site interview with multiple engineers and PM. (Easy LC-type whiteboard and interpersonal)
-&gt; Offer was received the afternoon of on-site interview.

**Benefits:**

* 24 days PTO (no sick leave), $12K tuition reimbursement up to 8 credits, free snacks, medical insurance premium is ""covered"" by company (probably pre-calculated into compensation), semi-annual bonuses, ts security clearance

* HSA with $500 from company

* Generous 401K matching: (8% automatically vested match to salary- basically $7200 dumped into 401K on hire. Will be distributed quarterly after. Additional contributions are matched 100% up to 3% after 1 year of service.)

* Office location is 25-30min away, could live at home.

**Pros:** the co-founder of the company is a family friend. My mother and uncle went to high school with him and his wife. I probably see him and his family once year. Unfortunately, I will not be working out of the same office location. The PM I will work with is also a fraternity alumni from the same university, he is ~10 years older, but I have met him before at alumni events/games as an active brother, and he seems chill. I also think the emphasis on W/L balance, connection to leadership, and money saved living at home afford me a bit of a safer breathing space as I transition into the 9-5 post-grad life. 

**Cons:**

* Engineering centric, but ""no-name"" as a defense contractor and not a Big-Shiny-N company

* Strict code reviews for certain projects (not necessarily a con)

* If I get lazy or suck, it would reflect badly on nepotism, but so far no one knows.

* Environment and projects are not as cool

-----------------------

**Offer #2:** Large, well known software vendor in analytics

**Title: Solutions Engineer**

**Salary: $110K**

I would be a customer-facing software engineer who works with sales, solution/sales engineers, and support engineers (like FDE at Palantir). They ""build proof of concept demos and design solutions to resolve customer painpoints"". I would be getting and giving feedback from multiple teams that range from Sales/SE, customer, to developers.
From what was described to me, tasks mainly consist of:

- data integration/processing (proficiency in python, bash, SQL, etc. for query and backend API scripts)

- customizing off-the-shelf-software

- frontend development in JS to make visualization dashboards on top of platform and for client-side web-apps with MVC frameworks.

There are a lot of overlapping and new responsibilities involved in this role, and it seems the SE's accept this. I don't know whether or not this is a good route for a new CS grad into development, however I think there is value in being client-facing as its visible and you build relationships outside your organization. I interned as a Technical PM before and liked it, so the skillset is certainly within my ability. I was also told that its a good role for transitioning into a product manager which I would be interested in the future, but also I feel like ""paths"" to those roles are pretty anecdotal.

**Interview Process:**
There was somewhat of an exaggerated vibe of the role. The first interviewer told me it was ""very entrepreneurial"", in that I was selling, and building a MVP to showcase. The team was also young, the senior engineer who interviewed me was 4 years out of college. Its a growing company so idk if that is necessarily bad. The interview process was stretched over the span of 2 months (Aug.-Oct.). 

1. First was an HR screen about the open roles, Solutions Engineer/FDE was suggested

2. Two 1-hour long technical phone interviews, 1 involved 2 easy-medium LC questions on a coding browser. The next involved discussing personal projects and questions about javascript, bash, python, and rest api. 

3. Silence for a month

4. Get call back to another 40-min phone interview with a sales manager. A followup call by a different recruiter wanted me to do the LC coding exercise again, which she then cancelled because she forgot I had already done it. I got the vibe that they were disorganized. Also the LC questions were in Java, which aren't really relevant to do with the job which suggests proficiency in JS, Python, Bash, etc. 

5. ""Assigned"" a project which was building a demo that visualized data. The project took awhile which involved coding/using their platform and spanned about 1 week with followup calls. I know CSCQ gives projects like these a bad rep, and I agree, but I went along with it only because I had some time and was curious to see how far I would get. 

6. Final onsite interview: presented the demo project, had discussions about it, and then an interpersonal interview at the end. 
It went well, and although I liked 3 of the engineers, a sales manager who joined 8 months ago threw a lot curve ball questions about sales rather than development. I felt some were a bit condescending and a bit irrelevant. Nevertheless, I got an offer.

**Benefits:**

* 15 days PTO and 10 days sick leave, potential for commission and quarter bonuses, employee stock, basic tuition reimbursement plan

* Free lunch once a week, free admission to several sponsored tech conferences, and certifications

**Pros:**

* Variety of experience; lots of ""hackathon"" length projects, different clients, teams, and tech

* More people oriented/social and visible role

* Big-N-ish, Reputation/Name recognition

* $20K boost in salary


**Cons:**

* Skills seem to be very platform dependent, lack of depth in development

* Benefits are not as good, longer hours, fewer holidays

* Unclear career path

* Possible disorganization from interview experience as well as recent glassdoor reviews.

* Location/commute is more than 1 hour away due to traffic, would probably need to move closer.

&amp;nbsp;

I would really appreciate any insight on which would be a better choice for a new CS grad who doesn't know exactly what developer role or career path to take. TY!

**TLDR;** 

$90K job with defense contractor with great benefits and good WL balance as a developer

**VS**

$110K job at big name software vendor but as a client-facing solutions engineer writing scripts.

I am looking at cities to focus my  applications on. I was hoping for some recommendations/feedback for  cities (US). I have had two internships, both in developing software for  the Navy in two private companies. I generally prefer stability and  peacefulness over a booming night life, and am generally a boring  person. I'm not terribly concerned about being in a 'tech hub', just in  having a good job with other options nearby should something go wrong.   I'm spending a lot of time researching to try to figure out the best  city for me, and was hoping for other people's insights.

Here are some of my preferred traits, from most important to least:

\-Generally nice to live in

\-Not a huge population (100,000-600,000 range)

\-Decent to great tech scene/job market

\-Good salary/cost of living ratio

\-No further south than North Carolina, no further north than Massachusetts.

\-East coast or no more than 5 hours or so from the east coast (family nearby and have to drive with a cat)

Here are my top picks currently, in order:

Raleigh NC - Everything looks great except it is a bit on the larger side and a bit on the hot side.

Pittsburgh PA - Middle sized, decent tech scene, generally looks like a nice city

Norfolk  VA - Near the water. The area as a whole isn't particularly amazing  though, and I'm worried about flooding/rising waters hurting the area  even more. Also not known for tech jobs, but there seemed to be a lot of  positions last I looked.

Richmond VA - Not known for tech jobs, but in a nice location and a has a good sized population for my tastes.

Hi guys.

I am less than one year away from getting my college degree after 4 exhausting  years of studying but, although I get fairly good grades, I am really worried about the actual possibilities of getting a job.

Basically, I studied political science, a field that has little job offers in my country and, coming from my own experience in internships, it seems to me (and my teachers practically admitted that's the case) that unless you have contacts that can get you inside or a really impressive resume with lot of experience it is hard to get a job no matter how good your grades are or even if you have a master's degree or a doctorate.

I've had made two internships with plenty of acknowledgments and recognition for my work, but so far I feel that my bosses just used me: I designed an entire project for an NGO on my own, they loved it, told me I was getting hired and in the end they just took it and never called me back. They only gave me credit for designing it.

In my other internship, pretty much the same story: spent there for almost one year, gave them my best, used all the documents and projects I made for them, they said I was going to get a job and then... they just sent me home and gave the position to other interns that did far less than me.

I realized this was happening last year and considered studiying something else but, after 3 years of college and a lot of money spent on tuition,  it is too late for me to start over and I pretty much want to get my degree out of respect for my family's help.

The fact that I am also pretty shy and an introvert only makes things worse when the only advice my teachers give me is ""go out there and make a list of contacts that can help you get a job somewhere"".

The only more or less Plan B is get a master's degree in some other country and hope for the best but I'm really worried about my chances of finding a job. 

I was wondering if someone who has gone through something similar could help or if there was any advice you guys could give me."

Ive sent out lots of resumes, and from personal experience, finding flexable entry level part time (PAID*) work in IT with no certifications or relevant experience is really hard. 

I occasionally saw amazing entry level full time offers but full time work while full time student is suicide imo. some can manage it but i cant. I got 2 call backs, one many months ago for being a router installer for a premium internet provider at below nyc minimum wage and unpaid travel time (time to go from client to client as well as no metro reimbursement). and then the one i landed recently many months later after getting no response from over 100 resumes sent out. Best Buy geek squad even rejected me.

my best advice for my fellow struggling students, apply for non summer internships (obviously still try for summer ones), i think they are easier to get since less people can manage the extra workload. if you are not some ivy league student with massive connections, huge projects, gotta aim for the opportunities that others wont."
9n5jr2,3,2018-10-10,When is it time to move on from your first IT job? Another MSP burn out question...,HelpDeskBurnOut,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9n5jr2/when_is_it_time_to_move_on_from_your_first_it_job/,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Working for a MSP as a salaried employee for the past 2.5 years. Our HD (where I work) is a HD of sysadmins. Feeling burnt out. Working too many hours because it's a constant pissing contest of who can work the most. Our clients have either too much process or too little...almost nothing is standardized. No real room for advancement. Paid well below industry standard (NYC metro area). Account management is a joke and HD often picks up the slack for nearly every other department in the org. No work from home opportunities to top it all off.  


This was my first IT job. Entered as an intern without knowing what Active Directory was and now, participating in major infrastructure planning and changes. Dealing with vendors, the whole 9 yards. I am also an escalation point as I am considered an L2. Jumped up the socioeconomic ladder quite a bit too, but still paid under 50k per year.

&amp;#x200B;

The catch: I'm finishing my degree, and then am going to graduate school. Won't be completely done for another 5 years. My current employer is aware of this and allows me to get to my lectures so long as I hit my 40 hours a week.  


I am feeling complacent. I am feeling undervalued. And most of all, I need more money (as we all do). I love this industry. I love helping users, as shitty as they can be at times. I am proud of what I do. I am impressed by my ever growing skill set. And am always aware that there are things I don't know, but know how to either find the person who does, find the resources to assist, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The grass may not always be greener, so this is why I'm reaching out. I don't always feel like I know enough as I should. I want to work in-house somewhere, but am doubting my skills at times and am entirely unsure if I'd be able to stand on my own when the time comes.

&amp;#x200B;

When did you guys decide it was time to move on from the first IT job? 

  
P.S: I'm heading into the infosec route. Looking to head into a CISO role, which is why I have my sights set on finishing a graduate degree."

Nowadays, I prioritize getting 8 hours of sleep and working out to avoid burnout, but that leaves me with only a few hours to fit all my classes, school work, projects, etc minus the self-studying. If I don't get to relax a little throughout the day I feel anxious, stressed, and a bit disoriented with the large amount and variety of work I need to complete for the day (I keep a checklist as well).

Because of this, I've been prioritizing school work and projects but find it hard to do coding problems/self studying consistently. I can always do the bare minimum on my school work to learn more direct programming content, but I'm sure learning the class content thoroughly is more important (GPA). I definitely want to avoid burning out by overworking because there's no point of giving up healthy necessities if I'm going to be coding my whole life anyway. I also go to a school where the cs curriculum is fairly weak (I'm sure most graduates aren't able to compete in the job market without extra work) so learning outside seems pretty significant if I want an internship anytime soon.

The only thing holding me back is that I'm currently 23, but the average age of the company is much higher, like probably mid-thirties. My team over the summer (I interned there) was about 20 people, and I was the only one under the age of, say, 35. There were a couple people my age on other teams, but for the most part this was the nature of the company.

Honestly, having a young culture is important to me, as this is a good way for me to make friends my age, and I feel like I thrive in these kinds of work environments, but to be fair I got along well with my coworkers in my internship, and would have interesting convos with them too. The only thing is I felt hesitant hanging out with them outside work due to the age difference (for example, they're not as willing to go out drinking till 2 am because they have families at home, and a lot of conversational topics gear towards their families, mortgages, home renovations, etc. so I can't relate sometimes).

It would be my first full-time job, and I'm wondering if it sounds like a good opportunity, and to postpone trying for companies with younger vibes once I leave, or if I should make that a priority now since that's the kind of culture I thrive in. I need to decide soon whether to accept or decline the offer- would prefer not to renege. What do y'all think?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in London for an IT internship, and for no reason my M.2 SSD just died. I tried several things to recover it, nothing is working, so I assume it's dead. I do not have the exact reference of this SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, and since I need my computer to work for the next 4 months, I'm looking to buy a M.2 SSD as cheap as possible, + a single DDR3L 8gb or 16gb ( 1600 Mhz max ).

&amp;#x200B;

Since I'm just a student, and as you can guess, I don't have an unlimited wallet, that's why I'm asking you if you have any ideas. And if there's Londonians here able to tell me where to buy little screwdriver to open up my laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have anything that can help, please do not hesitate !

Thanks a lot !

My offers are pretty comparable for the summer. I did an onsite at Palantir and enjoyed seeing the company. I didn't get to tour Facebook but I know a lot more people who interned there and have good things to say about it.

These are my main questions:

1. Did any of you guys really enjoy or really hate your internship experience at one of those companies? Would you say it was representative of working there full time or that it was pretty different?
2. I'm hoping to get a full time offer from my summer internship so I'd like to learn more about returning intern packages. I know a lot of FB interns who got return offers and they get signing bonuses of 100k. What does Palantir's returning offer look like? I like Palantir a lot but it seems crazy not to take the FB offer to get an extra 100k especially since I could work there for a year or two and then work at Palantir after anyway.

All thoughts would be appreciated!"
9nbfqj,1,2018-10-11,"I will quit my current job soon or later, but there is a factor that is making me think about it, so when should I quit?",BarbaAlGhul,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9nbfqj/i_will_quit_my_current_job_soon_or_later_but/,"Hello everybody. So first, a small info about me:, I'm a programmer and I don't have a lot of experience in the area (one year and a half working as a programmer + 6 months doing my bachelor thesis + 2 months working on my current job, where I'm a programmer too). I will leave my current job because I want some changes in my life, basically I want to move from where I live, the city is pretty bad for a lot of reasons (and I think living here for almost 10 years is more than enough).  I want to go back to my hometown.

So, now my problem starts: I will leave here, ok, but I like what I do on my current job. We are working with some pretty cool new technologies and for sure will help me grow as a programmer. The downside is that, although my boss is a nice person (it's a small company, 8 employees counting the owners), my supervisor, the leader of programming area, let's say like that, is a pain in the ass. And for the last month this is really stressing me out. For me, the major problem is not that he isn't a nice person (which he isn't at all, he actually say some mean stuff to our intern guy, which is a nice guy by the way) but is the fact that he thinks he is a great programmer but he isn't. I'm not saying that I'm a genius, because I'm not at all, but since I worked already in the area and in a bigger company, with really good programmers, I know how to identify them. I don't like to talk bad things about people, but I'm really just stating facts. Actually our intern guy already complained to me about him, but since he is my superior in some way, I can't do much (and he isn't a guy that likes to talk at all, he is never open to anyone, he is always right).

I have some options: I could go and talk to our boss, I know, but will it worth? This can backfire on me, because I'm the new guy there, other people already work there for more time. But since I will leave anyway, this could be even worst, like, I'm complaining and than I leave... I don't know, I don't want to create problems for nobody actually.

Another option is leave sooner than expected. I was thinking to work there up to the end of the year, December, so I could have 5 months more of experience in the area(I started working there in the middle of the year). But will it worth it? I'm reallly thinking recently about this, if I should just finish this month and quit, or work until the end of November and quit... thinking now about my carreer but about my mental health too, what would be the best approach? And I have two friends that already offered me some freelance jobs, they say that they always have some freelance jobs income, so, I doubt I would be out of business for a long time, and without any income for a long time, and I could dedicate myself to improve my skills in the current technology I'm working with, which I'm really liking it (and to some personal projects too).

And the last thing, money. Ok, will money be a problem? Not a real problem, because I'm saving some money every month from my salary, because I'm thinking already about moving, and this will cost money. And to survive later, well, actually I will move back to my parents home, so I won't starve or anything, although I want it to be temporary, I won't have problems with surviving, the basics will be granted for me.

Sorry for the long text but I wanted to explain all my situation."

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

First and foremost, audio production. I want to go from producing on a 2012 Macbook Pro to something that will run my DAW with plug ins smoothly and have enough USB ports for my hardware synths/drum machines. I will probably need at least five USB connections besides mouse/keyboard/gaming headset for USB mixer and synths for the time being.

After that, I would use it for amateur/hobbyist level video editing, 3D and motion design. I bought a GoPro and want to edit some videos, do a bit of motion design and work in 3D after a long hiatus (I'm not very advanced though).

I probably will also use the PC for some lighter gaming with friends, think League of Legends, Fortnite, CS:GO, maybe some Civilization and Cities: Skylines.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

1080p, 60fps (might buy a 144Hz monitor, currently don't have one though), Mid/High graphics settings.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I want to be below 1200 euros including OS (Windows 10).

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Germany

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

1. From reading it seems like I should get a good CPU and memory since they would benefit audio production the most, but I opted for a pretty decent graphics card as well for 3D and gaming. Would I benefit from upgrading CPU or is the one I chose enough for my goals?

2. I will be using an external mixer for processing sound (connecting to speakers/headphones when doing music) and probably using the one in the mobo for when I'm gaming so I opted to not add a sound card. Should I add one anyway?

3. Will my USB hub work with the mobo? Is there a better one for the same price/cheaper? I can't really find a lot of information about USB hubs, but I don't want to connect my hardware stuff to any external USB hubs, I have bad experiences with lag/problems with MIDI etc.

4. Is it possible to buy Windows 10 from the US Store where it's $139 instead of almost $168 (€145) in the German one?

Any other suggestions for how to change my build is welcome!"

So I said my range could be lower from 80-85k, expecting them slash it down. She said she had to discuss this, and called me back after 20 minutes and said they wished me the best of luck. I didn't expect them to just retract the offer entirely, and was just stunned.

I’ve got a decade of experience in the corporate world at various levels, so I (possibly quite arrogantly) assumed the internship wouldn’t be necessary for me to land a job. Now, I’m reading more and more about employers wanting *relevant* experience, and viewing a successful internship as a great way to distinguish candidates.

In addition, my uni is pushing the concept of placement years super heavily... But I’m not sure if that’s because they’re truly beneficial, or because the uni charge nearly £3k in ‘admin’ fees for each student that does one.

I guess I’m just having second thoughts about the whole thing. I’d appreciate people’s opinions!!"

Unfortunately for me, this is a government job. The current person in office is at his term limit, and is running for a higher office. I am worried that the CIO will not be in his position by the end of the year, whether that is due to him moving if his current superior wins office or replaced if whoever does get the office wants to put someone else in the position. I am worried that if I wait too long, he will be replaced, but if I email him too soon the position won't technically be open yet for me to move into it. 

Additionally, I have no idea what to say about wanting to accept the job offer. Since it was verbal, I don't have any emails or whatnot to reply to. I really have no idea what to say besides that I am interested in the position and that I am graduating in December, but can't really think of a more articulate way to present wanting the job than saying ""hey, I'm still interested in the job if the position is still going to be open"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my final year at uni and am beginning to consider apply for graduate schemes for when I qualify.

&amp;#x200B;

To provide a bit of background:

\- I have some brief prior experience, having interviewed for a software grad scheme earlier this year - I failed to get the job after not performing well enough with a 'coding challenge' given as part of the interview

\- I had a number of applications which got no further than the CV/video interview stage which I am assuming can be overcome by improving my CV

\- I would say my reason for failing the technical aspect of my one application that went past CV stage was inexperience - my course is a 'conversion masters' meaning it is only 1 year long, and I had only been coding for a couple of months at that point. I only have about 6 months or so under my belt now but feel like I would be much more confident and capable given the same challenge now (a caesar cypher function and detection of numbers in a row from a string)

\- Although I have some basic programming and computer science knowledge, I fear that I fall well short of what companies would need/want from someone they are hiring

\- A disadvantage I'm conscious of is that I don't have any 'projects' to showcase (although I am currently producing my final project for the course, this will likely not be ready in time for job applications) or any internships.

\- Should pass my course with a distinction (top grade achievable at masters level) and have a 2:1 in my Psychology Undergrad degree

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some guidance or a resource on CV's and on how to pass the technical aspects of interviews, which would help me get as many offers as possible from the grad schemes I'm going to apply to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have purchased the 'cracking the coding interview' book, but the book is very very comprehensive and extremely geared towards technical interview questions. It's not the most palatable book I've bought (very thick and the content is so dry). I can't help but think it's perhaps a bit overkill for the type of schemes I'm applying to and seems more geared towards the bigger companies like Facebook, Google, etc. and that there may be other more concise and useful resources out there?

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks"
9ndrzz,0,2018-10-11,"[Canada, 28M] Business job with coding involved?",MrGiggleFiggle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9ndrzz/canada_28m_business_job_with_coding_involved/,"My career so far hasn't panned out the way I wanted and I am desperate for help. I graduated in 2012 with a BBA but due to my lack of internships in finance, all my roles have been mostly admin with a side of analysis (but my titles do not have analyst in them so it doesn't really look good on my resume). I got an offer early February at a small investment firm but it was not what I expected (mostly admin and boss was verbally abusive). I was let go in April.

So after all this time off, I've been learning to code (Python, NumPy, DataFrames) and I'm enjoying it a lot. I was thinking of jobs that require me to analyze big amounts of data and give opinions on the strategic directions of a company. Here is my dilemma: I don't know the difference between Business Analyst and Data Analyst/Engineer nor what steps I would take to reach this goal.

I'm pretty sure that the data analyst/engineer route is not for me since it requires CS, math, PhD etc. so business analyst is the remaining option. What skills are required?

**Resources I have used:**

* Coding tutorials such as Codecademy, DataQuest, DataCamp
* Financial modeling - calculating cash flow, NPV, financial statements

**Resources I know of but have not used (opinions appreciated):**

* Kaggle
* CodeSignal - will have to explore this more to see how it is different from GitHub and if it is only for developers
* GitHub (no projects so far but I do plan on analyzing soccer stats. Any other project ideas?)
* Online courses (MIT, edx, coursera) on Intro to Data Science, Algorithms, Machine Learning, etc.
* R - I will have to learn this after Python. Reason I haven't started R is because I read that you have to focus on one programming language first.

**Soft skills:**

* Critical thinking
* Communication (explaining technical to layman)

**I guess my basic question is:**

tl;dr - What steps do I have to take to get a position where I can analyze data using coding skills and have an input on the strategy?"

Former boss was hands on and seemed to really like me, kind of like a little sister (though I'm not sure, could be reading too much into this.. he is a generally good-natured and friendly guy).

I used to work for a tight knit group of driven sales people that really motivated me in my life (at that time). I learned a lot of valuable lessons, and made a few friends, but had had to move on because it was a summer position. My former manager from that initial sales job contacted me the following summer to offer me a receptionist position, and later helped me to get an internship within the engineering and tech development department of the same company (reception job). 

This manager, let's say Mitch, has done a lot for me. Though we have gone our respective ways, I find myself wanting to ask him for insight into me as an employee. I feel that he and I have a connection where I can ask him an honest question and get an honest answer. I want to talk to Mitch to ask him for words of wisdom I guess. We are Facebook friends though haven't really spoken in over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole life has been a series of unfinished ""things""... I have noticed a pattern with myself that I kind of ""dry up"" (?) and get bored with whatever I'm doing  (after a short time) and look for a new job... only to have the same thing happen.

1. natural introvert with an extrovert patriarch that believed there was something mentally and morally wrong with shy people (wonderful man but very stressful)
2. never played in end of season soccer tournaments as a kid (I really believe that this is significant)
3. changed high schools in third year (gr 11) (poor quality home life; self-mutilation, anxiety)
4. dropped out of high school partway between final year (gr 12) (lazy, anxiety)
5. never had a full time job lasting more than a year; worked seasonal manufacturing/ industrial jobs
6. never had a part time job lasting more than 6 months
7. completed 3 year college diploma in 5 years (Chem Eng Tech) -- took me so long because I was sure I would just drop out and do something else... and basically wrote off one year due to health reasons, somehow I stayed in and finished I honestly don't know how but it is the ONE long term thing that I have stuck with and completed.

I am 29 and working a tedious low reward job that my wonderful family member helped me to get (thank you D!). My contract ends in December and I just find myself going through the motions. I don't see there being room to grow and would like to do something in my field. 

I am seeing this pattern to just get ""impatient"" and leave things unfinished.

Is this a stupid question (how am I as an employee, strengths, weaknesses, frustrations, etc) or is there some legitimacy to this and I am not crazy overthinking things? 

 *I am just looking for general advice and I am wondering if it's appropriate (or weird) to reach out to Mitch.*

(Please note that this is not a romantic relationship, Mitch and my boyfriend got along really well also :) He's like a cool brother type )

I used to go to the 3rd best high school in the state. I tested to get admitted and all that jazz. I was on top of the world, I played my cards right and had a 4.0 GPA and a rising star in the new debate team. Then things headed south because my life is a mess, I had qualified for city championships that year but never went because my partner and I never got along. I left debate because no one was willing to partner up with me. 

Sophomore year came around and I started dealing with (at the time) undiagnosed mental illnesses and was running out of any momentum that I had previously. During the summer between sophomore year and junior year, I did a program at UChicago on renewable energy. It started late in the day so I could succumb to my terrible coping mechanism of oversleeping. However, I met great people, got myself a guaranteed internship at a national laboratory once I'm 18 (if that particular education coordinator is still working there), and learned a lot about the several fields of science. 

At this point, one could say, ""Hey, this doesn't sound that bad."" Well things got worse! I burned out so bad my junior year that I had to leave school. Gasp. I know, some of my friends who don't really get it have a not-so-subtle rancor towards me for leaving, but that's for another subreddit. My parents luckily supported me and over the past year I found new coping mechanisms, I'm on the right medication (yay brain chemical imbalances!), and I am able to function in society. I moved out to the suburbs and transferred to a noncompetitive neighborhood school. My teachers love me now because I raise my hand a lot and use my ability to connect with adults (better than with kids my own age) with them. 
I never had any stable ECs because the past couple of years have been a series of unfortunate events. I do spend a lot of time cooking and trying to perfect my recipe for a ribeye steak and BBQ ribs. People have said I should go to culinary school and open up my own restaurant. 

Anyways, my counselor is advocating that I write about my formerly deteriorated mental health and journey to recovery on my personal statement. However, I read that a senior admissions officer for Barnard (my ED choice) recommends to leave it for the additional information portion and I'm probably just going to do that. 


There are a lot of concerns that I have about doing ED. 

-My ECs are very weak and this places me at a terrible disadvantage. I'm going to shadow a couple of surgeons at UChicago on my days off next month (I wanted to become a cardiothoracic surgeon ever since my grandmother suffered from a heart attack) but that won't be until after the ED deadline. 

-I finally got the chance to take the SAT this past weekend. From what I saw on reddit, I probably did below the 25 percentile of Barnard. For Barnard, one can self-report if a standardized test is taken after ED date, so I am taking another SAT in November. 

-My GPA is still being disputed with my old and new school as the first semester is still counted that I failed the semester. However, we are arguing that it does not reflect the situation correctly, so we are trying to get that solved. Furthermore, I am marked nonattendant for my second semester of junior year on my transcript so being absent did not decrease my GPA. My non-fixed GPA is a 3.08 UW and a 4.5 W (weird scale I don't know), but my fixed GPA is a 3.8 and a significantly higher weighted GPA. 



I will likely do an on-campus interview if I do ED. However, it is imperative to decide now if I'm going to go for ED or not to know what my next steps should be. My counselor is confining me to just go to community college, but I was raised to just give things a shot. For the most part, I need reassurance that I should try and possible advice, fellow applicants and knowledgeable people. Thank you!

(Also, I'm just wondering if I would be considered a first generation student. My stepfather who has a degree does not have any legal custody over me and my mom doesn't finish college. However, my stepbrother attended college.)"
9neqyk,1,2018-10-11,Reneging on a company that will turn up on my background check,throwaway_ovo_xo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9neqyk/reneging_on_a_company_that_will_turn_up_on_my/,"Recently I accepted a full-time offer with a company I interned with over the summer. However, after some deliberation, I've decided it's not my ideal company to start at, and if I can get an offer from a company I'm more interested in, I'd be okay with reneging on my current one, at least just this time.

However, there's a dilemma: the problem is, since I've interned there in the past, reneging on a company that's already on my resume means that any future company that offers me will likely contact them for a background check; this gives them the opportunity to bring up the fact that I reneged on them, or even simply to ask ""would you re-hire this person,"" to which case they would likely say ""no."" I don't know this for sure, but I think if I were the company I'd be reneging on, this would be my response tbh.

My question is this- should I consider applying to new companies keeping this internship off my resume? It may make it harder to get me an interview to hide this experience off my resume, but if I do get one and get the job then it would make the background check/reference process easier after accepting the offer. What do y'all think?"

I did this while working a full time retail job as it could accommodate my changing school schedule and I've managed to attain a supervisor role at my company but it's not IT related.

I'm in the SoCal area and since the beginning of this year I have been applying to any IT related job that I could find but with little success. I want to be a technical systems analyst but every position I see, I need experience. I've had a few classes using SQL, Visio, and Java but none of it really in depth or that I feel comfortable enough putting as a skill on my resume. 

I applied to internships during my last school year but I only got a call back last year from one company and they paid considerably less than what I was making at the time (11hr vs 16hr) and I couldn't afford to quit. I need experience working on projects and with systems to help advance my career while still paying the bills.

I'm now considering getting a comp TIA A+ or CCBA but I don't want to keep spending money on schooling only to find my lack of actual work experience is the bigger factor. I've built a computer twice in my life and I'm pretty good at figuring any technical problems I have come across. I also feel I'm forgetting the stuff I learned in school as I don't use it professionally. I read my old school books and use various websites to refresh on SQL but I'm sure that isn't enough.

I really just want to know any helpful advice that my fellow Redditors might be able to offer.

TLDR; information systems college grad with only retail experience, is looking to be an IT/technical systems analyst."

My partner and I are looking to start planning to move abroad, in 5-7 years. We want to have a family and don't feel comfortable doing so here in the US, and we are both eager to build our life together elsewhere. I'll be visiting Amsterdam and the surrounding areas this month, and we're headed back together next year to confirm our suspicions, but we really think it will feel like home.

My question, like everyone here, is what all do we need to do to prepare/qualify? I am an artist with a small business selling my work and teaching classes, and I'm not sure if the best route to continue that is to start with an artist residency or internship or if I'll need to put the art on hold while we establish ourselves. He is getting his cicerone certification and has a passion for brewing beer and educating others about it. He is a manager in a fine dining restaurant, and I do admin work for another restaurant, we are more than willing to continue that path or redirect and adjust as needed.

We're both currently paying down debts as quickly as we can, and hoping to be debt free by the time we move (my parents are cosigned onto my student loans, and I can't leave them to pay it off), how much should we expect to have saved aside from the obvious moving costs?

Since we have no kids and are flexible on timing and employment, how hard should we expect it to be? Will be it beneficial for us to be married when we start this process, or does it matter? How far ahead should we start looking for jobs, housing, starting paperwork?

Thanks in advance!"

At first, I felt like I was doing well and excelling in the class.  Soon after the first exam, which I did not do that well on (63%), I went to do my lab for the week and I found myself utterly lost and confused. I looked on our online message board (it's an online class) and nobody had asked a single question on this lab.  Everyone got it and understood it but i'm just lost.  It's really taking a toll on my self confidence because I feel like i'm falling behind.


&amp;nbsp;


I haven't taken a lot of my computer science classes yet.  I've only taken/am taking discrete mathematics/logic, a python class, and a C++ class. Next semester I'm taking Data Structures and Algorithms, Architecture and Organization, and Software Design.  


&amp;nbsp;


I really enjoy it when I think of an issue that I or someone else is having and I can go, ""Oh I know how to make that easier!"" and then I can just go and make it in python or whatever, but I still feel behind.  I see a lot of people on here have concerns about their current skill level, but i'm also graduating in a year or so and I haven't even been able to land an internship.  I'm working in I.T at my college but that isn't what I want to do in the future.  I guess what i'm trying to get at is:

&amp;nbsp;


To the people here who are currently working successfully in a programming career, what did you do to get better when you felt yourself falling behind? Is there a boot camp sort of thing you did?  Did finally landing that internship help boost your knowledge and self confidence as a programmer? Are there any resources you can recommend to help me?  I'm willing to spend a little bit of money if there's a book or an online course or something that could help me.  I can get access to Plural Sight and watch their 64 hours of programming videos on C++, which I intend to do.  Is there anything else?  


&amp;nbsp;


Programming is the only thing i'm passionate about that can actually be a career choice for me (as unfortunately professional video game player and guitar player are not options) and I really want to be good at it.  I really don't want to go through life feeling mediocre at the one thing I want to succeed at.  "

Where to begin?

I am fuming right now because I just found out that my dad is $2550 (3 months) behind on rent. He swears he has ""talked"" to our landlord, but she has every right to evict him and I am counting it as a very real option. There are a few things influencing our current situation.

1. I (20 year old) am a full time student (junior) at a university in AZ. My is an lower level employee in HR at my university in AZ, and because of this I depend on him for qualified tuition reduction (QTR). If I make more than 4k a year I lose QTR and will have to take out 13k in loans per school year to make up for it. Also me getting a job is really not an option logistically. I can't drive, and my bf (who lives with us to help with rent) is using my car to get to his internship this semester
2. My bf lives with us to help with rent. He has been paying his share and we just found out that it has not  in fact been going to rent, but instead to fuck knows what. My bf is also a student at my university and he is in his last semester.
3. I have a dog who is really important for my emotional wellbeing (my therapist has said she will write a letter to certify him as an emotional support animal if necessary). We adopted a large dog (pitbull) last semester and I am worried about what will happen to him when my dad gets evicted. I have a family friend who could probably take him for a month or two, but then what???
4. My dad is actually a hoarder. I keep asking him to move, but he doesn't want to downsize and clean up his shit and I guess it's too late for that anyway
5. His car just broke down so he is getting dropped off at work by my bf.
6. I just tore 3 out of 4 ligaments in my knee and I can't really walk and I am just frustrated and scared right now.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my main questions: What do I do to help my dad? What do I do to help myself? How do I keep my dog?"

I am really new to all this (hence the internship). The app is basically a store. There is one page that currently has two UI sliders, one for specifying order quantity, and the second for specifying how often to order. These two values are used to calculate total cost, which is displayed at the top of the screen. This is currently being updated with jQuery, but my project lead wants me to accomplish the same with react. I am quite unfamiliar with React, and know very little about Jinja, so this is definitely an interesting start lol.

The only way I can think of doing this is having three components: One for each slider and one for the total cost calculator. This seems like overkill for such a small page. The issue I have with this is not knowing how to transfer states to sibling components (state from ui slider values to state for total cost component).

I'm very comfortable with Vue and started learning React only a couple days ago, so please forgive me if none of this made sense. I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything, which is kind of overwhelming coming in looking at a large existing code base. Thanks for reading!"

9nlv2b,3,2018-10-12,Transferred from a private university to community college after my junior year and now I have no idea what to do with myself,muchtoouncomfortable,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9nlv2b/transferred_from_a_private_university_to/,"Longtime lurker here. I'm pretty nervous about posting but here goes.

I have a difficult time being concise so bear with me.

I decided to leave my private university right before my senior year because I felt unsure about my degree. I didn't feel right letting my mom pay THAT much tuition money while I was feeling hesitant and not getting everything I could out of that school.

My freshman-year advisor encouraged me to start taking courses for my major from the start. At the time I loved it, but this stacked up the amount of general education credits I still needed, leaving no room in my planned senior year schedule for any interesting or fun classes (drawing/painting, human sexuality, etc.).

I started off with a Criminal Justice Pre-Law major, French minor. After my sophomore year I decided to swap the two and focus more on French with the idea that I could become fluent by the time I graduated, and that if I wanted to go to law school, prior education about the law wouldn't be necessary. 

I'm extremely passionate about those two areas, but have no plans on incorporating the two. I don't want to do anything career-wise with French, it's more of a personal goal to become fluent. As for criminal justice, issues within the system fire me up in a way that nothing else does.

About half way through my third year at the private university, I realized there was no way I was going to become fluent in French by graduation. I'd love to spend a year or two in France, and I believe that is the only way I'll ever become fluent. I studied abroad for a month and learned more there than I have in 15+ years in a classroom. Also, I thought it would be super awkward having a bachelor's in French and not being fluent. Even mentioning that I was majoring in it would provoke ""oh so you're fluent?"" assumptions.

I feel compelled to have a career in a field that targets social justice issues in the U.S. and help vulnerable populations. Specifically,  the prison system (wrongful convictions, compensation laws, reintegrating exonorees and ex-cons back into society, and developing a comprehensive database for sentencing to show what works and what doesn't), public education in Texas (my home-state, it's pretty fucked here), and child and family services/counseling. 

For a while I thought I wanted to go to law school because I'm good at arguing and I love defending people, but I've realized that I'm more interested in administrative/policy sides of institutions. My best friend recently got her bachelor's in social work and when I tell her about those interests, she thinks becoming an advocate through a social work degree would be a good way to go.

I also am extremely interested in starting a business that helps people, probably something health/nutrition or perhaps some kind of counseling. This is with the idea that if I were to take a social work route, the financial side of it would not be very plentiful.

My biggest issue is that when I switched from my private university to a public community college, there is a plethora of general-education credits required by Texas that I need to get. I'm fine with knocking those out for now, and the tuition difference between private university and community college allows me to take my time. I also have about two semesters worth of credits that don't count for anything because of the weird gen-ed requirements at the private school and the useless major-specific credits I have for CRIJ and FREN, which is extremely frustrating.

SO, right now I feel pretty lost and confused. 

I want to start taking courses that will help me with whatever I decide to do in the future (a business course, an early childhood development course, etc.). I'm not focused on a degree title, I just want to have some education that will help me later on. BUT I have no idea what I want to do later on. I've made lists, tried to get more specific about areas I feel drawn toward, but I still feel conflicted. I'm also not sure if I should just get whatever degree as fast as possible with whatever credits I have then dive into an internship or start working and gaining experience.

Any experience, advice, suggestions, or words of encouragement would be GREATLY appreciated."

I have internship experience in Data Science and Software Development. In my last internship, I kind of combined the two by first working on a data science project and then visualizing the results through a web application I developed from scratch. I have experience with the entire Data Science and Software Development pipeline. 

The problem is that this experience in both Data Science and Software Development doesn't help me. I feel like I'm always caught up in between. I don't find any roles online where both these skills are used together. When I go for career fairs and give my pitch, I get dejections because the recruiter is specifically looking for one of these roles and considers me to be an outcast. They think that I'm more of a ""jack of all trades"" kind of a person but a ""master of none"". I've worked very hard to get the skills that I have today. So naturally, I feel bad when something like this happens. 

Can people here make any suggestions on what my pitch should be like? Basically how can I market myself so that the recruiters see that having software development experience with data science can be very beneficial for any team I might work with?"

Two are at large tech companies and the third that I am hoping to get is a big four consulting company that is hiring me for engineering.

Offer 1: previous internship, $83,000 with $3,000 signing. I like the company, but it is significantly larger than offer 2 and might be harder for vertical movement within the company.

Offer 2: my dream company since I started applying, $75,000 with an unknown signing yet. They said they're flexible with payment so I might be able to get more.

Offer 3: $80,000 with $12,500 signing. Consulting company. I like the work that they told me I could be doing and the idea of the travel.

I am mostly looking for advice on how to negotiate my second offer up to around by first offer. I love the second company but $11,000 the first year and $8,000 ever other year assuming no bonus is something I can't turn down easily.

Context: I applied randomly to a few engineering internships, and got interviews for all of them. The interviews went very well, and I am still waiting on feedback from the last company I interviewed for. My GPA is a 3.1, which isn't the greatest, but I do have somewhat relevant job experience, and I'm a rising senior.

I received feedback on one, and he said I was overqualified. I currently work as an IT supervisor and on-call tech support for a small business. I do everything from website maintenance, hardware support, software support, and anything tech related to keep the store going smoothly. I also work as an online educator for a large tutoring subscription service, specializing in electrical engineering topics up to third year material. Both of these jobs are done remotely for the most part, so I can attend classes full time, and I was (of course) willing to drop them to gain real world engineering experience. (I didn't say this, but I would also be taking a major pay cut to get an engineering internship, but I thought experience was more important as I approach graduation.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should I do to improve myself to be appealing to employers? I'm not sure what about my experience would turn them off, so insight into that would be helpful. I'm also not socially awkward or pushy, and we were conversational and got along great.  In a way I'm flattered, but its also extremely weird to hear this feedback from an internship position.

 Since I'm a year away from graduation with some technical work experience, should I not even worry about an internship? Or should I apply to higher caliber jobs? "

I'm a senior in an unrelated major and am looking to get my foot in the door.,bunduk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9nqjjv/anyone_have_experience_with_launch_code/,"Hi all. At the end of the school year, I will be graduating with a BS in Chemical Engineering.  Unfortunately, I decided a little late into my education that CS would be a better fit for me.  For financial reasons, I couldn't change majors, so I did the next best thing and added a minor.   My relevant CS coursework includes:

-Programming 101 (python)
-An introductory data structures and algorithms course (java)
-Discrete mathematics
-A more rigorous data structures and algorithms course (python)

While I'm clearly not starting from ""zero"", I'm obviously at a big disadvantage compared to my CS peers with regard to the job search.  I don't have quite the breadth of knowledge or the practical skills that they acquired during their coursework and internships.  

For this reason, I've taken an interest in companies like Launch Code, Revature, Aston Technologies, etc. The barriers to entry seem lower than typical entry level positions and they seem like great opportunities to gain some practical skills and experience and bridge the gap between myself and my peers.  Based off my own research, Revature and Aston seem like something I should save as a last resort.  I've heard good things about Launch Code, however.

Does anyone here have experience with them?  From my understanding of their application process, you basically do a number of technical/non-technical interviews, a hackerrank test, and then showcase a personal project. From that, they determine if you're skilled enough to work as an apprentice...which could lead to a full time offer.  To those with experience:

1)  How difficult was the technical interview?  I'm pretty comfortable with the ds&amp;a's that I learned in school (linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees, dynamic programming, etc...). I'm also reinforcing this knowledge with some udemy courses and have started solving leetcode problems.  Would this be adequate preparation?  

2)  How involved/advanced were your projects when you applied?  I'm seeing on glassdoor someone's Unity game was deemed ""not good enough"" for an apprenticeship.  I obviously don't know the scope/scale of the game, but this at least shows that they look at these projects with a good deal of scrutiny.

Anyway, thanks in advance for tanking the time to read my post.  "

I have a couple offers for after graduation, and one of them is Northrop Grumman's PDP program.

I am leaning towards it, mostly because the other options would require me to be long distance from my significant other (over 2 yr relationship) for at least 2 years because of grad school.  The long distance would be 2-3 hour flights, or 3 hours driving, each way.  This is manageable, but not ideal.

Also, the main things I like about a job are work life balance (definitely need less than 50 hours a week to stay sane), low or manageable level of stress, and culture where employees are friendly toward each other.  I would also like to be exposed to a lot of different projects, and potentially get a Master's or MBA.  Northrop appears to have these things.

However, it seems common on this thread that Northrop Grumman is viewed as a career-undermining move.  Will it hurt my career to take this job at Northrop for a couple years?  

How much better for my career would it be to take a software engineer role at somewhere like Target or JP Morgan?  And how have people's experiences been overall at Northrop?"

I applied for various internships and was accepted to 2.

One was with a private company hundreds of miles away from my hometown which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The pay is very good. They deadline to accept the offer was last week so I did but there's a clause in the offer that said I could back out at any time for any reason.

The other is with a government agency near my hometown. I received an email saying I will be getting an offer from the hiring department but I don't have anything concrete such as salary. Also, this one if I accept it seems to lock me in for a long term program with a possible paid masters degree. I only heard about this one after accepting the other offer.

My parents are pushing me to back out of the private one and accept the government one. I'm just a sophomore so I feel that I have another summer to intern with the government if I choose not to but I'm not sure.

My questions are is there any long term negative implications if I were to back out of the first one? And which may have a larger positive impact on my resume for the future?

Hopefully sharing my situation can help others on the sub too.

**Background**

I am graduating in Spring 2019 with my Bachelors in CS at an average state university with a 3.6 gpa. I have been working as an intern for \~a year at a notable government research lab working on software design and previously I worked one semester as an undergrad TA. I don't currently have any notable side projects to display I just have my course work on my github (consists of Java and C mostly). I have participated in a few small local coding competitions and placed at one.

I am saying this because I am curious to know where I stand compared to the average cs student and what my employment chances are / where I should look to apply. Currently, my plan is to apply for the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech like many other people and take one class at a time while working full-time.

(For those curious about the program click [here](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/program-info/specializations) for more info)

**Two Options**

1. For one, I could transition to graduate student at my current company for \~$30/hr, or I could work full-time for \~75-80k/yr salary with bachelors that moves to \~105k/yr once I have a masters (Manager told my coworker this and it sounds about right). I would continue living in my home city and my girlfriend of 5 years would move for medical school. While I like this company's great vacation and 401k match benefits and pay for the area, I'm not very passionate about the company's mission and there isn't a lot to do in the city.
2. The second option is to move to another city and apply for full-time positions with a bachelors. I have been looking at jobs in Silicon Valley, Seattle, and Denver, though my girlfriend and I are looking for the same city. I have not studied for tech interviews much but I could focus on my CTCI book and prepare more over winter break.

**Conclusion**

If I'm being honest, I am young and ambitious and my current goal is career development. I would like to gain a lot of professional experience and make good money for a few years. I was very poor before getting my current internship and I am afraid of moving to another city and accepting a job that is not as good as my current company. They have more than 10,000 employees with maybe? 2,000 in software-related areas, but it looks like it is slow to move up. Many people have worked at the company for 20+ years, the job security is high and many of my coworkers are planning on staying until retirement. I feel like the only companies that could move me up would be the Big N companies (though that my not be true). Ultimately, I would like to generate an income from side projects and possibly start a company. What would you do in my situation? What are my chances of getting a job at a Big N company?"

My plan hopefully is to get a bachelors in CS and an associate in SysAdmi/IT/Networking

I digress right now I’m only taking CS courses but I have been interning at an SysAdmin company for a while now. So I’m learning quite a bit. I decided to take a decent laptop I never used before and wiped it and installed windows server 2016 eval edition so I could try to learn some stuff on my own time

When I had time I painstakingly got all the drivers and went to bed and didn’t use it for a while. And somehow I set the password to something I couldn’t remember or figure out! The only account was the administrator account.

Eventually I went to my internship and on a slow day we tried to get into it. And eventually we did! I had the same ISO file on my usb and what we did was start the bios screen and booted from the USB and then hit shift+f10 to open up the admin CMD

then we typed

C:
cd Windows\System32
ren Utilman.exe Utilman.exe.original
copy cmd.exe Utilman.exe
shutdown -r -t 0

Which changed a file in the systems folder and restarted the computer. 

Then we booted it normally to the login menu and opened the command prompt there and typed in

Net user Administrator (insert password of choice here)

And it changed the password and let me log in! Everything worked fine all my files where still there and everything. Then we went back to the system files and changed Utilman.exe back to normal. Windows defender did flag the changes as a possible trojan. But it worked! 

My question is why did it work? And what does utilman.exe do? 


Edit: also is this considered a security vulnerability? You do have to restart the computer so remote controlling wouldn’t work cause you’d be disconnected. And if it was local they’d be caught incredibly easily I’d hope. 

Also cause I’m a college student Microsoft gave me a free key for windows server 2016 on their website I can’t remember what it was called. And I tried it on my eval and it said it wasn’t valid for this type? Which is strange, I might just email/call them and see what they can do.

9nxnow,0,2018-10-13,Sales Engineer question towards growth,PuzzledFinance,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9nxnow/sales_engineer_question_towards_growth/,"Hello all!

Would appreciate some guidance on growing in my career as a Sales Engineer. Not sure if it's the right subreddit for this, if not would appreciate some pointing towards the correct location. Thanks! :D

So, let me start from the top. I did my undergrad as an Electronic Engineer in a south american country and after I was done (I'm a U.S. citizen, born in the states, just life ended up taking me there), I finished a Masters Degree at an Ivy League school as an Telecoms EE and graduated in early 2009 during the economic downturn. Had always been a Linux nerd and had been using linux as an enthusiast since 2004ish (can't remember the date, but do remember red hat and fedora core event happening) as a gentoo user, for quite some time. I wanted to live in NYC when I graduated from my masters, and after searching for opportunities found one as an intern for a Tech Market Research company. I worked there for about 2 years, and got laid off. I stumbled upon a Fiber Optic company that needed a Field Engineer, and I started my IT career officially there in late 2011. :)

I worked Fiber Optic and installed a couple of FO rings for some financial institutions in and around the city, and afterwards the company I worked for got acquired in Jan 2015 due to some Software Defined Networking IP they had. This was where I was thwarted towards Sales Engineering.

Because of SDN, I got curious about programming and did a couple of specializations in Python and Java on Coursera between 2015 and 2016. I originally wanted to understand and hopefully leverage the SDN APIs to showcase to customers. Also finished my CCNA which I had started to work on in 2013 in this span of time. Though I didn't do anything significant with this at this company, it did help me understand how programming fit with SDN, as well as the concept of APIs, HTTP GET/POST, as well as JSON formatting.

I worked there until late 2016 until I found an opportunity to be a Sales Engineer at a SaaS based load balancing company. Life was good here because it was a really interesting concept and got to learn a lot of real interesting things.

At around the time I started this opportunity, I also kicked off a Software Development Bootcamp that wasn't intensive as most that I've seen around. Something around 30 hours a week commitment. Between 2017 and up until early 2018, I was working on a Software Development Program at a well known bootcamp program. This helped with understanding how to code, how to code with someone as a team (a mentor), as well as understanding web development and different technologies surrounding it which complemented my work very well.

I learned that I actually enjoyed writing code a lot more than I thought I would, and even flirted with starting as a Junior dev at a company to work my way as a full time software developer. Life happens, and we (wife and I) were blessed with finding out we were expecting. The lower salary that I would get from starting over as a Junior or starting dev would not be enough to upkeep our new family, so I kind of scrapped that idea.

Going back to the SaaS based load balancing company, I didn't have to deal with being on prem for hardware installs/upgrade POCs during night time hours on weekends when compared to a computer networking hardware company. So this def was a plus. Also, the people I was dealing with at work on a day to day basis with were great.

This SaaS company was acquired earlier this year, and I was fortunate enough to be included in the acquired team. My focus in this much larger company (\~10k employees) has shifted away from an interesting combination of technical work (support tickets, internal efforts towards improving the product) and multiple weekly customer sales meetings to working with an account manager who sets up calls once every other week. The new environs are kinda boring and have no incentive to learn anything new at the current moment since I'm the SE for our acquired platform on the East coast, for however long that lasts.

Now, if money weren't an issue, I'd definitely want to pursue a career in Software Dev or be a Dev ops even though I'm kinda late in the game for that (I'm 37 right now). But currently as things stand, I think my lot is to continue as a Sales Engineer given my career track. Which is OK. Just a bit confused as to what to beef up to move upwards and onwards if salary and career progression is my motivation. I would be find being a Network hardware SE, a SaaS based solution SE, or a Software Services SE.

In terms of certs and further development, I'm not sure what to spend my work and/or personal free time on to learn or reinforce any technical knowledge on in order to maximize my career development as well as income.

As mentioned, I do have a CCNA, a couple of Coursera [Java](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented) and [Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals) specializations, as well as a software development bootcamp under my belt. Oh yea, I always forget my Masters Degree at an Ivy league school because I think due to bad economic timing, only got my foot in the door at different interviews throughout the years. I've got some experience doing SQL queries, dealing with S3 buckets, some Nginx experience in the past and some other cloud related architectural concepts from my current job.

I currently think that it wouldn't be a bad idea to do the CCNP Route or Switch in order to not let the CCNA expire. But my heart would be more interested in doing a Linux cert(s) even if it isn't the RHCSA, that would be *up to par with my current career progression* (9 years work experience + 4 as a Sales Engineer). So, basically doing 2 Linux certs from the Linux foundation, the LFCS and LFSE I feel would be up to par with my career experience. The LFCS alone in my opinion would be to entry level.

Also, wouldn't be sure if going the Cloud Computing specialization route would be better, finding something on Coursera like this, or some other cert on the linux foundation website like this one [here](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/cloud-foundry-certified-developer-cfcd/).

.... ok I didn't think this would be such a long post. But here goes. Thank you for reading if you read til the end. Appreciate the input and help!"

I set out a doodle poll to my committee members that spanned all of Nov and most of Dec and already of those that responded (because some of them haven't yet) there's no time all of them are available. 

Plus my advisor is in another country so we had to find out if it was possible they could skype into the defense. Since more than half the committee wasn't available the one week they were going to be at the school this semester. 

I'm getting nervous I won't be able to defend this semester, which wouldn't be the end of the world but-It sounds like I might be getting a job offer from my internship soon and I imagine they would want me to start sometime Jan or Feb. Plus they know I am suppose to defend this semester. Also my advisor is incredibly persistent I defend this semester and I think they are pretty mad my defense won't be that week they are visiting (which is partly my fault. But they also didn't give me the exact dates they were going to be here until two weeks ago).

I know so many graduates who have been flailing (different from failing) from job to job trying to claw their way into something. I know an education graduate with a teaching license working at a grocery store. I know someone who was in financial sales for 20+ years now working at a declining hardware store. I know a Business graduate working as a glorified secretary, the list goes on. 

Most notably, I know an Aerospace Engineer from a top college in Southern California (UC Irvine) with 20+ years of experience at Boeing &amp; Northrop who was forced into unemployment because after 2008-was never able to get back into engineering ever again (growing gap on the resume, more difficult to find work after being out of work for so long). And another one I know is a BYU law graduate with about 25 years of practicing law in Utah now is under employed as an adjunct professor at a community college. I also know a Rutgers law graduate working as a skydiving instructor (nothing wrong with it, but still vastly under employed).

What is/were/are your under or unemployment stories? Do you have any successes? I've helped one person get into corporate America through family connections and I generally try and do what I can for those around me.

Even the people I know who are recent graduates who have marketable majors still are struggling to find work in their industry (at any level, mind you). 

Everyone who is going to college in this group-like myself-likely knows how hard it is to secure quality work in your field and the job hunt starts well before you graduate from college: internships, part time/full time  work, GPA, etc. What has helped you stay employed in your field after graduating from college and landing your first ""real adult"" job? The things that I can think of are going to college for a marketable major, getting internships and a high GPA, and hoping for the best. 

Conversely, if you have been under employed after graduation, what was your background like and what are your future goals? What sparked this post was my trip to the grocery store today. I spoke with the cashier, of all people, who said that he was a business graduate from Arizona State University and has been working at this particular grocery store (anonymous for obvious reasons) since graduating and has been living at home unable to secure any decent entry level job in his field. Even he said that he was one of the fortunate ones because he's debt free, but others are not as fortunate-graduating with the same job prospects as him, but with massive amounts of debt.

If you faced underemployment or outright unemployment, what did you do to get out of the situation you were in? Hope this post could help anyone out there that are in similar situations or at least provide some direction."

I was happy, smart, eager, motivated, compassionate, and over all... ready to make my parents (and myself) proud of the life I was creating. Now, I am depressed, disengaged, lack motivation, tired all the time, anxious, scared, and I hate who I see in the mirror. I despise her. 

May of last year, I graduated from a state university with my Bachelors in Political Science, with a minor in Business Administration. I THOUGHT, like most bright-eyed children, having that degree would set me up to be highly sought after in the job market. I'd have a career in no time. As could be assumed, this isn't what happened. 

I have applied to +30 places since. Each place has either not called/emailed me back, or told me that I lack the necessary experience for the jobs and/or they do not have the man power necessary to train me successfully. I have offered to take classes, but I can not afford to take on an internship. Being essentially told 'no' so many times... my confidence level, self-esteem, motivation, mental state... they have all taken a significant hit. I no longer feel like myself, and rather feel more like an empty shell. My parents hound me about having not started towards my career, which seeing things from their perspective, I understand. I hate that they are disappointed, because more than anything I want to be better for them. They worked so hard to get me where I am and I am failing them, along with myself. I am terrified of that failure. 

On top of struggling to find a career, I feel abandoned by a majority of my family and friends. They all pushed me to go to college, be successful, etc. but no one wanted to REALLY help me aside from my mother, step father and significant other. In fact, as soon as I graduated, everyone else left me in the dust. With no direction, no idea of what to do next... I really needed them and they just vanished. 

The same month I graduated, my father moved south with my half-brother and step mother. Leaving meant my relationship with my little brother would be virtually non-existent, and little did I know, that entire side of the family would just disappear. They don't return phone calls, they bail on meet-ups, and they make it seem like it's my fault we don't connect... then they post 'family' gatherings on social media. I have tried to reach out to both sides of my family, ask them for help, but the only one's responding are my mother and step father (aside from my SO). They can only do so much, and only give so much advice and time. No career, little family, no friends... I hit a wall of depression and anxiety. I feel incredibly alone, despite knowing how lucky I am to have the people I do have, a place to live, and a job. 

So, I have turned to the reddit community.

I need real help trying to get back to the person I was, or even a better/new version of myself. I want to have a career, something to look forward to. This incredibly sad and lost girl, is no longer who I want to be. Please. If you have any advice, kind word, or experience, I am all ears (or eyes since I'll be reading comments). Any clarification needed can be addressed. To anyone who reads this... thank you for your time. It means so much to me. "

I recently placed at a hackathon and, as a result, received an offer from a major financial institution for a SWE role.

Normally, I’d be really happy because I haven’t really had an internship before. However, this offer came at a bad time. They’re giving me two weeks to either accept or decline the internship, but I haven’t had the opportunity to apply to most major companies (FAANG, for example).

I’ve heard from other people that the company at which I received an offer is either a hit or a miss. Sometimes you can get a good project/team, but other times it can be really dull and bureaucratic.

I have two phone screens lined up for next week, and I’ve already asked the companies to expedite the interview process for me. I’m not sure how they’ll go though; one is Facebook, and the other is for a major cloud storage company in Seattle. But to be honest, technical interviews are not my forte. I would say I’m capable of solving problems around Leetcode medium difficulty.

I am thinking about declining the offer, but at the same time, I’m worried that I won’t get anything better. I haven’t had much practice with recruiting/technical interviews. This company is, at least, a big name in the industry. But if I accept, I might be stuck with a boring and stagnant internship.

TLDR; I’m plagued with indecision and can’t decide whether to accept an ill timed job offer that came VERY early in the recruiting cycle. Please help.

I have people asking me for help on assignments and then somehow my dumbass self ends up having the lowest mark out of the people I know because of some small mistake (i.e off by 1).

It's not that I'm struggling to pass any courses. CS POSt is stressful yes, but I'm pretty confident I can get in. However, it just seems like it's not good enough. It seems like I'll be that guy walking around with a sub 3.0 GPA while everyone else is landing internships left and right with their 4.0s.

I'm not looking to stand out or anything. I don't lose sleep over wanting to work at a big 4 company.  I just want to get by. Graduate and then find a decent paying job is all I'm asking for. Don't care about grad school or research. I still try my hardest (despite my questionable work ethic at times) to get the highest mark I could get. When I get a 75% on an assignment worth 2%, it's really not a big deal. I understood all the material, but made some careless mistakes. However, I can't help but to think everyone around me is getting 90s. Makes me really feel like a dumbass.

My mentality if getting worse and worse these days. Yes there will be people below me that won't make POSt. However, I just feel like I'll be the dumbass after POSt when everyone is landing internships with their perfect GPAs."

I worked my butt off in high school to get in and am so grateful to be here; I love my classes and professors and it has helped me secure great internships and my dream job (!). However, despite all of that, I feel like I have really struggled socially. 

Throughout high school, I had a huge network of friends through different sports and organizations and was always hanging out with different people. I was probably almost too social and out of the house all the time but had such a fun experience. When I got to college, my freshman dorm was REALLY quiet which was a big change for me. It was a hard transition and I struggled to meet people. Freshman spring was sorority rush which I tried in search of finding more like-minded people, and that helped temporarily. Fast forward to sophomore year, I had made a couple of close friends in my sorority house and was feeling better about my school as a whole. I felt more adjusted when I came back from summer break and was looking forward to a hopefully MUCH better year. Then, in October, my closest relative outside of my immediate family was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. He passed away only two months later and it all happened so fast. It hit me HARD and I was miserable and grieving so I pulled back from any social outings and just tried to focus on my classes. Next semester I barely went out or did fun things with friends because I was having a rough time dealing with it, and even worse, my friends in my sorority house weren't supportive and stopped inviting me to things that they were doing.

Junior fall came around and I went abroad for an exchange semester in Europe by myself. Unfortunately before I left, I was diagnosed with some health issues that would make it nearly impossible to eat normally in the country I was going to be living in for the next 5 months (this diagnosis happened literally the night before my flight). That being said, once I got used to living alone in a foreign country, it was amazing for me. I felt truly independent and was so happy to be exploring the world and meeting new people away from my school in the US. Fast forward to junior spring, I was back at school and feeling the worst I've ever felt. I was lonely, sick all the time, stressed/anxious, and dying to go home. Because I went abroad I had a shitty housing situation which made things even worse.

Finally now it's senior year and things are going a little bit better. I solved most of my health problems, have a much better housing situation, I'm finally a little bit less busy than I was in previous years, and I am trying to enjoy my senior year. But I just feel like I'm in such a weird spot. I had many nights out early on in college and even late in high school and I'm over the whole frat party/bar scene at school. Yet those events are the main social outings. I'm still in my sorority but feel like only a few girls are good friends of mine and not just acquaintances that I don't enjoy being around. Although I found my people in high school for sure, I just don't think I ever found them in college. People are so cliquey/cutthroat/competitive and quick to judge here and idk if that's the competitive nature of the school or what. I doubt I'll stay in touch with a lot of people here, yet I want to try to enjoy the rest of my year regardless since you only get to go to college once. I guess feeling restless is the best way to describe it - I haven't enjoyed a decent amount of my time here (despite all the amazing opportunities it's given me) and am trying to consciously make an effort to now, but then when I do try to push myself to do things with people I'm not that close with I get kind of exhausted.

Does this get better post-grad? I've made really close friends abroad and through internships but just not at school. Are there opportunities to meet a lot of new people and make new friends right out of college? Hoping this isn't a stupid question; I'm the oldest of my siblings and find it hard to talk about this with other people. Do you guys have any advice for surviving the rest of the year and trying to be more positive about everything? Thank you so much

I feel guilty as hell— my mom lost her job because my family moved for my sake (she was told she can have it back when she returns, but apparently not). My dad has been doing a labour intensive job that he is getting too old for and had been counting the days to quitting (we expected mom would be able to go back). I have a younger sibling they need to provide for, and they don’t really have retirement figured out or anything.

I am in a good university for a computer science degree but I had decided sometime back that I want to write books not programs. Learning about my family thing literally minutes to 12 on my birthday kind of jolted me. Should I just go back to computer science and get a job that can provide for my family? People are fighting and clawing to get into my comp sci program because of the employability prospects—- I decided I didn’t care for money and was going to leave it to join creative writing instead. I am done the comp sci major, I got good grades although I hated the work and didn’t do any internships yet. However It breaks my heart to see my dad struggle so much, and my mom and  little brother suffer from the family stress. I don’t see myself as a long term worker in tech really but definitely see myself as a writer, so going back to cs for a job would be a sacrifice. 

I could have sustained myself for a few years on little money i get from TAing and such while I work on writing books, but now the stakes have completely changed. 

 Should I go back to computer science (which I have a degree in but don’t want to work in) for the easy money? Should I “follow my heart” and let my parents go through stress? Would appreciate advice on what to do."

I checked most of the qualifications in the posting and I think I have satisfied not all but most of them. I am also unfamiliar too with the job duties/responsibilities but I guess I will learn it even more when I start my internship. So I applied anyway just because of the position/role, the experience and the company name.

I didn’t expect last week that I’d get selected for an interview. I had my interview last week too. I guess it went ok; the interviewer at the beginning said that he’d mention the job duties. But he hadn’t really mentioned anything that’s on the posting and he only mentioned stuff that’s not even on the posting (or I could be wrong that he just re-worded/elaborated what is on the posting with which I am unaware of cause of my unfamiliarity with the job duties/responsibilities).

An hour after the interview, I got a call from HR saying that they’re giving me an offer starting January with decent pay. But I only have over the weekend to make up my mind and give them an answer by Monday next week.

The question is, given my unfamiliarity with the job duties/responsibilities, should I even accept the offer? Plus come to think of it, I haven’t even taken any data science or data analysis course at university. So I’m a little shaky about that. Note that I only applied just because of the position title, the internship experience and the company name. It’s more of I’m a little worried that I might not be able to do the tasks right since I am unfamiliar with how to do the tasks in the job description. I didn’t even expect that I’d make it through and get a position tbh. It’s my first time that I’m gonna be doing an internship so I’m kinda worried. The internship is 8 months long btw.

Any advice for me is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Tldr: I applied for an internship position that I wasn’t too sure of in terms of job duties. But only applied because of position title + internship experience + company name. I didn’t expect to get selected for an interview and even got an offer. I only have a weekend to decide on it. So should I grab the opportunity?"
9o42ju,0,2018-10-14,Prep for UK grad scheme applications?,A1roller,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9o42ju/prep_for_uk_grad_scheme_applications/,"Hi All,

I'm currently doing a conversion masters in computing with the hope of landing a software engineering job when I qualify. I'm coming up to the time now where I'm apply for jobs and am feeling a bit apprehensive and unprepared.

I have some brief prior experience of software job interviews, having interviewed for a software grad scheme earlier this year - I failed to get the job after not performing well enough with a 'coding challenge' given as part of the interview (in hindsight the coding challenge was very easy but I had only been coding for 2 or 3 months so it was perhaps a bit early to be applying for jobs).

Although I have some basic programming and computer science knowledge and I am on track to achieve a 'distinction' in my masters (the equivalent of a first), I feel like the course has not been at that great of a standard and fear that I fall well short of what companies would need/want from someone they are hiring. I don't really have that solid of an understanding of data structures and algorithms which is something I feel is important and that I want to work on.

I've been looking around for courses to learn this stuff independently. I own CTCI but it's not the most palatable book and I feel like I would learn better through an online course. I've checked out the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course which, based on the course details, appears to cover algorithms, data structures etc. in a good bit of depth. I'm wondering whether completion of this course would put me in a position where I would be able to at least have a decent crack at most interviews in the UK (barring the elite jobs like Facebook, Google etc.)?

Also, a disadvantage I'm conscious of is that I don't have any 'projects' to showcase. Although I am currently producing my final project for the course, this will likely not be ready in time for job applications. I also work almost full time hours alongside my job so have very little spare time to build a decent sized project (although if anyone has any suggestions for projects that would not be overly time consuming to build, I'm open to suggestions). I've not done any internships either. I'm wondering how much of an impact I can expect these factors, and my shorter exposure to CS (in comparison to undergrad students with 3-4 year degrees), to have on my chances of securing a job?"

But, not to brag, I'm able to solve LC easy problems in like 5 minutes tops (takes like 10-15 lines of code). Would that be a problem in an interview? I'm legit worried that I'll do it too fast and then they'll give me a really tough question.

I can probably stretch the 5 minutes to 15-20 minutes by going through a few examples at first, writing pseudo code, asking for the function signature, and writing unit tests. But that's it.

If it's a Leetcode medium, I can probably add 5-10 minutes with the brute-force solution. But I still can't see how I'd fill a 45-minute interview.

Any tips on how to deal with this?"

You will get interviews and phone screenings where you don't hear back for days, weeks, or just never. You will  fail on-site interviews due to technical questions or just because the team didn't see you as a fit. People never talk about it on this subreddit, but you will fail.

But remember, the way you persevere through all the failures is what sets you apart. There are so many people that just quit and pack it all up due to a failed interview or being on the job hunt for too long. It's  hard finding a job. It hurts to get rejected. After all the shit you go through, it makes the job you snag feel like it's the best thing that ever happened to you.

I've received an offer for a company, just for them to take it away three days later because ""It was just filled"". I've failed on-site interviews because the team just didn't see me as fit (and that's okay). I've had recruiters from amazing companies hit me up, just to ghost me.

And through all that, I just got my first **real** software engineering job after I **failed** their phone screening. They sent me my notice of failing the phone screening, and I replied with the correct answer I did after the call because I knew I could do it. Five days later they asked me to redo my answer with a different technique, and a week later I got my first software engineering job with them after 2 on-sites. 

It really is a long grind. You will fail, get back up, and fail again. Don't ever forget that your perseverance will pay off in the long run, and don't let other people's success on this subreddit (interns with unicorn companies, people with high six figures salaries, etc) make you feel like you're lesser than anyone else. You got this."
9o4g15,1,2018-10-14,I am very anxious I won't be able to make it out of middle-eastern country in time due to completely out of my hand circumstances,LifeGonnaBeBetter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9o4g15/i_am_very_anxious_i_wont_be_able_to_make_it_out/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a third world middle eastern country, my dream since I was a child is to live abroad in a place where people embrace technology and as many of you here you dream to join a Big N company young and finally make my and my family life better!

I worked on myself yet unfortunately I didn't land any internship abroad to any of the big N companies, however I can see myself excelling (relative to peers of my same age) and many of my peers, professors and people with more experience tell me that.

I also competed at some competitive programming contests and reached a pretty decent stage.

I had an internship opportunity in a very good local software company and I proved myself very well, my mentor and seniors have been telling me they're amazed by my very wide and fine knowledge of stuff and how things works that I exceed many full-time juniors they have.

This made me happy and have gave me a sense of validation that I can make it! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now come the sad part.** 

I am graduating in a year from now, In most middle-eastern countries males are expected to server 1 year in the military, and sometimes they completely randomly pickup some engineers and doctors to serve for 3 years.

3 damn years! they literally abduct you and use you for whatever they want as a sort of \*giving back to the country\*, you will get humiliated, you will get detached from you friend, family and lover. you will get zero experience in your field because they most likely will use you as a labor to do some trivial stuff (literally writing word docs and sending faxes), there is no a single success story for guys who've gone this route and made it out better.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention you will get paid literally 10\~15% of what you would have been paid if you started working after graduating plus you lost 3 years of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagining this worst case-scenario makes me very anxious, I am paralysed right now thinking about that I may have my dreams crushed by something completely out of my hands.

&amp;#x200B;

If this scenario happened I will only be starting at age of 25 with ZERO work experience, and tons of money to earn to sustain my life after 3 years of making no money at all, I will not have time to learn stuff that qualify me to get a job abroad or go to a Big N company for example. **my prime age will be wasted**!

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are, are my feelings valid ? what are your thoughts ? how can I stop worrying about this ?

I imagine if I was caught in this situation I will only read about stuff through books and collect as many knowledge as I can without actually practicing it which for many companies is simply invalid experience, you know how stuff work / should be done but you never actually worked on something before.

9o4ruz,1,2018-10-14,best friend or not?,icecreambutterfly,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9o4ruz/best_friend_or_not/,"I need some help.... with my best friend.

we've known each other for 7 years now and we've been through medical school together and survived and made it to the other side. I've helped her through lots of little things and big things. she was with me when I was wrongly failed in finals and when things at home escalated to levels I'd never faced.

But ever since internship started, she changed. she no longer treats me with the same respect as before. I'm not sure why. she started hanging out with strangers that none of us (friend circle) even knew. At hours way past a safe time. she knows we live in a dangerous city and I would be worried if she came back late to the hostel.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing was those months when I was having suicidal thoughts and suffering at work. I had no one to talk to except her. When I asked her for help, she told me words that forever broke my trust. She said "" If you keep talking negative thoughts about everyone and everything, I'm going to stop talking to you. I can't handle your negativity. I can't be around you. If this continues, we can't be friends anymore.""

After that day I stopped telling her my feelings. Now I just listen to her issues and support her instead. She was never so self centered. What happened?

&amp;#x200B;

She helped me get together with my boyfriend. I told her I didn't want to date him but she set me up on a secret date without telling me. I was stuck in a position where I couldn't say no. He was about to cry when I almost said no. I didn't want to be that heartless girl. I gave him a chance and yes, we are still together but not on the terms I wanted it to be on. She knew I was working up the courage to ask him out myself. She knew that I wanted to be emotionally ready before doing this. If I said no, I wasn't sure if I could ever ask him again. It's my first relationship so bear with me....Why did she do this when I expressed my feelings to her and told her my thoughts?

Sometimes I want to break up with him and take a break for myself and find out what I really want.

&amp;#x200B;

she told him personal secrets about me before I was ready to share it with him. She would meet him secretly multiple times on the excuse of planning dates for me. She still messages him today when she knows I dislike it.

She's known him for like 1yr max but she's known me for so long. Why is her loyalty so weak towards me?

&amp;#x200B;

One of the worst things was learning she told our mutual friend that she thought my boyfriend had a crush on her before we got together. Instead of limiting her interactions with him, she continued to call him and meet him DESPITE knowing/feeling that way. Why would she set me up with him, if she thought that? HOW could she not tell me this so I could ask him directly?

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked him, he told me he thought she had a crush on him. I told him I don't feel comfortable with him talking to her. He limits his messages to her to the bare minimum. Sometimes I feel like I mistrust him a bit because of his friendship with her. I've seen him hide his phone when she messages. But I want to trust him so I haven't taken any more steps besides voicing my thoughts once. He talks very little and very casually about her so i think he understands now.

&amp;#x200B;

Shes getting married in 2 months. I'm really happy for her. I am. With all my heart I know that if her fiance is what she wants, then I support it. I will have her back. I want to be there and be her friend. I don't want to mistrust her but why won't she at least talk to me? I want her to not ignore my messages and choose which ones she wants to reply to. If she doesn't want to be my friend, why can't she say so? I can move on. I just wanted to try fixing this. 7 years is a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

But something ticked me off when instead of calling me and telling me about her engagement, she called my boyfriend the moment it happened and told him. I feel so hurt that she considers him closer than me. After all the secrets I've kept for her? After all the time we spent together, she doesn't even have the decency to tell me?

I don't know what to do...

I really miss her but this feels toxic."

I’m a student at university current beginning/prepping my internship search and having a bit of a career crisis. The companies I am looking at  want me to do either software engineering or product management. I love coding, but I also have a love for creating and organizing and analysis- and I have good experience with both. 

My fear is that if I choose a PM internship over software,and then later realize it isn’t for me, it may be harder to transfer back into a technical role than vice versa. I have heard that PMs do not usually code at most places (not sure how true this is) and I would hate to not have a chance to code and apply my technical knowledge professionally.   

My fear with choosing a software engineering internship is that I will mostly/only code with minimal analysis and a bit of deign in the code (I haven’t really done  professional software/data engineering work yet so forgive me if I am misconstruing this). In addition, I know that with these companies the software engineering internships are more competitive, and technical interviews are not my cup of tea.   

Please let me know if you have any advice and/or experience for me, or your personal career experience in either of these professions or a similar one. Also apologies if I misconstrued anything.   

I know I’m only in unviersity and I don’t need to figure out my life just yet, I just want to make myself the best path without closing any doors.  Thanks!

TLDR: I’m a university student trying to pick between software engineering and product management internships at tech companies, and I just want to know the pros/cons of each or anyone’s personal experience with either of these roles in a full-time setting."

I'm currently a senior at a top university and will be graduating in late May. I worked my butt off in high school to get in and am so grateful to be here; I love my classes and professors and it has helped me secure great internships and my dream job (!). However, despite all of that, I feel like I have really struggled socially.

Throughout high school, I had a huge network of friends through different sports and organizations and was always hanging out with different people. I was probably almost too social and out of the house all the time but had such a fun experience. When I got to college, my freshman dorm was REALLY quiet which was a big change for me. It was a hard transition and I struggled to meet people. Freshman spring was sorority rush which I tried in search of finding more like-minded people, and that helped temporarily. Fast forward to sophomore year, I had made a couple of close friends in my sorority house and was feeling better about my school as a whole. I felt more adjusted when I came back from summer break and was looking forward to a hopefully MUCH better year. Then, in October, my closest relative outside of my immediate family was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. He passed away only two months later and it all happened so fast. It hit me HARD and I was miserable and grieving so I pulled back from any social outings and just tried to focus on my classes. Next semester I barely went out or did fun things with friends because I was having a rough time dealing with it, and even worse, my friends in my sorority house weren't supportive and stopped inviting me to things that they were doing.

Junior fall came around and I went abroad for an exchange semester in Europe by myself. Unfortunately before I left, I was diagnosed with some health issues that would make it nearly impossible to eat normally in the country I was going to be living in for the next 5 months (this diagnosis happened literally the night before my flight). That being said, once I got used to living alone in a foreign country, it was amazing for me. I felt truly independent and was so happy to be exploring the world and meeting new people away from my school in the US. Fast forward to junior spring, I was back at school and feeling the worst I've ever felt. I was lonely, sick all the time, stressed/anxious, and dying to go home. Because I went abroad I had a shitty housing situation which made things even worse.

Finally now it's senior year and things are going a little bit better. I solved most of my health problems, have a much better housing situation, I'm finally a little bit less busy than I was in previous years, and I am trying to enjoy my senior year. But I just feel like I'm in such a weird spot. I had many nights out early on in college and even late in high school and I'm over the whole frat party/bar scene at school. Yet those events are the main social outings. I'm still in my sorority but feel like only a few girls are good friends of mine and not just acquaintances that I don't enjoy being around. Although I found my people in high school for sure, I just don't think I ever found them in college. People are so cliquey/cutthroat/competitive and quick to judge here and idk if that's the competitive nature of the school or what. I doubt I'll stay in touch with a lot of people here, yet I want to try to enjoy the rest of my year regardless since you only get to go to college once. I guess feeling restless is the best way to describe it - I haven't enjoyed a decent amount of my time here (despite all the amazing opportunities it's given me) and am trying to consciously make an effort to now, but then when I do try to push myself to do things with people I'm not that close with I get kind of exhausted.

Does this get better post-grad? I've made really close friends abroad and through internships but just not at school. Are there opportunities to meet a lot of new people and make new friends right out of college? Hoping this isn't a stupid question; I'm the oldest of my siblings and find it hard to talk about this with other people. Do you guys have any advice for surviving the rest of the year and trying to be more positive about everything? Thank you so much"

9o6yf1,10,2018-10-14,About to be fired from my first job after graduation,ijain1996,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9o6yf1/about_to_be_fired_from_my_first_job_after/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 22 year old recent college graduate. I graduated from a top 30 institution with around a 3.0 GPA with a bachelor's in economics and a minor in Political Science. 

Fortunately, I was able to land some decent internships in my college experience. I had worked for Morgan Stanley &amp; Reynolds American throughout my summers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I took an associate consultant position around the area where I completed college. I took the position because I thought it would be a great entry level area role for me and where I could gain experience. However, honestly it has not meshed well with my skills. It has to do with using the Aprimo platform to aid clients who are having problems with the software. My job includes being on a help desk, where clients essentially call you when they need something done for a project they are working on. Because of my own fault, I made some mistakes with some of the changes I was allowed to make for the clients. We are only allowed to make certain edits within operating procedures. However, they changed multiple times within my short time there and I was called out for making mistakes. The person in charge of the account also works remotely so it would be hard to communicate with them and to confirm. Especially, because as I stated earlier, I work on a Help Desk and can get a call from the client anytime. The other members of the team got off the client when I came on board. I have tried to ask them multiple times for support, and they have obviously have helped when they can. However, even they have confusion with the constantly changing operating procedures and what can be done. Especially, because they are no longer on the client. As a result, of my own struggles I had been put on a PIP(Performance Improvement Plan)

&amp;#x200B;

This really rattled me. At first, I became extra meticulous and made sure I was keen as could be. This was fine for the first 2/3 weeks I was on it. However, this last week it started wearing down on me. I started becoming really nervous and anxious whenever I would receive a phone call. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, it all escalated. I am usually one of the first employees in at the office. However, one day this week I overslept and came in a little over an hour later. I lied and said I had car problems because I was in fear of the consequences of my PIP. I stated that I would work through lunch to make up for it. This is where I really messed up. My apartment is about 2-3 minutes from where I work. I asked my coworkers if it would be a big deal if I drove to my apartment to grab some food I had and brought it back. However, on the way there I got into a car accident and suffered a concussion. Obviously, I missed work the rest of the day. I sent in a medical note that night stating that I would not be able to report to work until tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the morning after my accident my boss called me and started questioning me about why I was late. I was still really dazed and relented that I lied about why I was. I was put in Suspension and have a call with both my bosses tomorrow morning. I honestly am assuming I am about to get fired. The questions I have are

&amp;#x200B;

1) Should I tell them, why I lied in a last ditch attempt to save my job?

2) If/once I get fired, how should I ask them I could phrase my time with the company? Do you think they would mind if I listed it as an internship? 

3) Should I even put my time with the company  on my resume?

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a pretty ridiculous situation, but it has honestly mentally worn me down and was not fun to deal with while I was dealing with a severe concussion. I know I've made mistakes, and would really just appreciate any advise."

I am a sophomore CS major that was fortunate enough to receive an internship offer from AMEX at their Phoenix, AZ location. While the past interns and recent grads speaking at an event held for interns last week said it's a great experience, I realize they are biased and I've seen some pretty bad reviews on their culture/work here on CSCQ. This is my only internship offer and I plan on accepting it if I don't get an offer from JP Morgan (which I'm not sure is any better quite frankly) but before I do, I wanted to hear some more opinions. If anyone has ANY information, could they please let me know what they think? I have read all of the previous posts and see it is very mixed. In addition, there seems to be a lack of information on their NYC office. While I am local to the Phoenix area, I saw one post mentioning that cyber-security and data science is done at the NYC office and that seems way more interesting (as well as better resume-wise) so I'm not sure if I should try to intern there despite Phoenix being their ""main tech hub."" Thanks in advance!

Also, regarding teams, I was told that we are matched with a manager in the spring. This means I would have to accept the offer without even seeing my team/what I'll be working on."

Spent a couple years in the work force and last year felt more comfortable with school

I went back (to community college, in a 2 year computer information technology w/ concentratation on programming), and succeeded. My first semester I got 1 C and then it's been A's and B's since. I have a 2.97 overall, and a 3.31 institution gpa, and that'll be going over a 3.0 overall as long as I finish this semester strong (which I should be)

But I cannot graduate this spring, unless I get an internship. My curriculum requires, to graduate, that I get an internship. 

I have been applying since late July, and heard nothing. For spring, or summer 2019. I'm so depressed and I'm thinking about just going and spending another 2 years in trade school, because my other options is to wreck myself financially and spend *3 more years* in college to get a traditional CS degree. I've already spent 3, one of which was a total bust. I'm broke and depressed. 

I really don't know what to do. I've been following advice. I have side projects, I code every day, I'm the chair of our ACM chapter, i attend hackathons, my resume is fucking beautiful. 

But I can't get an internship and I can't graduate. All this fucking money and time just gone to waste. I could still be a fucking bartender taking in $7-800 in tips every weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

White male, upper-class household from NY. Legacy to Harvard (Dad: BA, MBA), Princeton (Mom: BA, also very active in the Alumni Association of Princeton), Penn (Mom: MD), Columbia (Mom, Ph.D.), Duke (Grandfather: BA, Sister: BA), Yale (Grandfather and Sister: JD), and Stanford(Brother: BA).

&amp;#x200B;

**Education/Academics**

I attend one of the top private schools in NYC (Ivy Preparatory School League member). The school sends around 35-40% of its class every year to the Ivy League.

GPA: 4.00 UW/ 4.73 W, 12 APs (all 5's)

Test Scores: 36 ACT, 1590 SAT, 800 Math II, 800 Bio E, 800 US History, 780 Physics

Awards: Pretty standard for the most part (NMSF, AP National Scholar, some community and state leadership awards, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

**Extracurriculars**

While my other stats are pretty normal, I hope to differentiate myself through my (hopefully) sorta unique extracurriculars.

**HS Varsity Lacrosse-** Varsity letter all-four years, large time commitment, was contacted by Cornell's coach but I don't want to play varsity sports in college.

**Republican Club (President)** \- Helped campaign for several Republican candidates city-wide and state-wide. Was chosen to lead the social media team of one candidate.

**Founder and CEO of data-analytics firm** \- The firm is registered under another organization (for legal reasons). Last year, the firm made \~$15m in profits and was awarded contracts from several companies (including a F500 firm). I also hold 2 patents personally on some of the firm's technology.

**UNICEF Club (Founder, President)** \- Raised over $135,000 for UNICEF USA through a charity ball and other school-wide fundraising events.

**Club Yachting** \- I've won several national competitions and finished top-10 at an international competition.

**VA Hospital Volunteering** \- Not a whole lot here. I just volunteer at the local VA hospital (\~500 hrs recorded)

**2016 Campaign Volunteer for President Trump** \- Flew all over the east coast to help coordinate several events. I also got to give speeches at several campaign events as well.

**Senate Page**\- I got to work on the Senate floor as a page last year. I also got to know the Senator who sponsored me very well and he's going to write a rec letter for me as well (more on that below).

**Internship at Global Top-50 Law firm** \- Pretty self-explanatory.

**Published Research at Columbia University -** Got to do some research on public-policy and economics at Columbia University. The research isn't life-changing or anything, BUT my mentor is absolutely insanely smart (Nobel Laureate in 2012 for his research in economics), and he's also writing a rec letter for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other**

**Essays -** Can't really judge these but I've had several peers and teachers read them and they all love the essays. Hopefully the admissions officers will as well.

**Rec Letters** \- Getting one from my AP English Lit teacher who taught me in 11th grade and my other letter from my AP Economics teacher who taught me in tenth grade. They both really like me, but I don't know how their letters will turn out. I'm also getting a letter from the Senator who sponsored me for the page program (I think his letter will be really good since he really got to know me and we still keep in contact) and my research advisor (He's also a family friend and our families get together frequently. Also I hope the fact that he's a Nobel laureate at Columbia gives me a decent boost in my chances at Columbia).

I’m a part time Front End Developer and full time college student.  I’m a senior with 2 semesters following this one to graduate.  It feels like when I’m not doing school work, I’m working.  I do usually take Saturdays off but I work pretty much every other day.

I know that students my age are usually really busy trying to balance a social life, school, and a job, but I feel like I’m a special case because I’m already in the field.  I don’t have much time to socialize, but I still get to see my friends every once in a while.  I like my current job, and would like it way more if I didn’t have school right now but I understand this is just a temporary thing.

Today one of my coworkers called me, and talked about him doing a mix of work and homework today (he’s a student as well).  I told him that it sucks how us student developers are busy but it’ll get better once we graduate.  He got very serious and said at his last internship the senior application developer worked nights and weekends very frequently and that it’s something all people in IT should prepare for.

I brushed it off and said it was just a bad company but he continued to tell me that continuing in IT leads to stressful jobs and being on call pretty much all the time.

I love what I do now, and I think I’m setting myself up to get a good job after graduation since I’m already doing Front End Development.  Although talking to my coworker made me nervous.  I don’t want to be expected to work and breathe code every moment of my life.  I like my job, but I literally can’t do it all the time.

Can anyone tell me what it’s really like to work outside of school?  Is it really true that we’re always expected to be working?  Thanks in advance."
9o8h0n,0,2018-10-14,Subletting in SF is this normal?,poop_on_a_log,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9o8h0n/subletting_in_sf_is_this_normal/,"Not sure if this is the best place for this, but I thought it would be since it concerns a lease agreement and contracts.

So, my wife and I are headed to SF for an internship I have this Nov. It's only going to last 4 months so we decided to get on craigslist and look for a sublet. We found something pretty cheap in a decent part of town that is fully furnished and everything seems legit. He asked us to pay a deposit of $1,100 and first months rent which is $1,500. We had him send us his contract and ID just to make sure it was legit. He sent us the contract and ID and everything looked legit so we sent him the money via PayPal to his CPA and confirmed the receipt so he could send us the key. But then he emailed us and said that his landlord told him we need to pay for the full two months of rent since we are only going to be there for 4 months. We are a little nervous that that we might be getting scammed. I want to trust him, but we are tight on money and I just don't want to get swindled. So, my question I guess is if this is normal? Would a landlord require a two month rent plus a deposit for a sublet like this?

&amp;#x200B;

We also asked him if he could send the key before we sent the money and also if we could get a receipt from his CPA from the money we already gave them. We're just a young couple who doesn't know any better and doesn't want to get swindled. Just want to know if I'm doing this right! Would love any advice help! Thank You!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: We are currently living in LA

Edit: We also signed a sublease contract which would make this legit right? And if this was a scam we could potentially get our money back?

&amp;#x200B;

Update:  Thanks to everyone who confirmed my suspicions. This was in fact a scam. We found the address and unit number and contacted the actual owner of the apartment who confirmed that she owns the place and this is a scam. The guy was still emailing us and he even gave us a phone number to call him. He answered and had I told him to send the money back or I'll go to the authorities. He said he would send it back in the morning through his ""CPA."" But, since obviously I don't believe him I went to PayPal to see if I could do anything. Because I used their secure purchasing feature I was able to report a problem with the transaction and escalate it to a claim. So, the good news is that if the ""seller"" doesn't respond in 10 days then I get my money back! Again thanks to everyone who responded this really helped. I feel really really stupid that I fell for this and I will never believe anything concerning apartments unless I see the place in person. "

First off, I’m full Chinese, first gen, upper-middle class. This might put me at a disadvantage because of affirmative action but I don’t care. I really just want to go to West Point. 

I can do about 40 pushups, run a mile in 6:58, maybe 40 sit-ups, 5 pull ups with correct form at best. I can run 3 miles in 25 minutes. I haven’t tried the shuttle run or the basketball throw yet and the rest are just approximations based on what I know I can do right now. 

I swam from 2nd grade up until the end of 10th grade. About 55-56 second 100 yrd freestyle shortcourse, 57 second 100 free long-course, 25 sec 50 yrd free short course, more or less. Nothing spectacular. This was most Club swimming, but I also did swim team for Freshman and Sophmore year. I got to districts freshman year and the one below that for sophmore year.

I’m also planning on doing school swim team this year, maybe try to become a captain for next year, but I’m not particularly popular. But 3 captains are chosen per year and if I suck up to my coach, maybe I’ll get a better chance. And I’ll need to be funny, maybe pay for people’s dinners after swim meets. Whatever makes me popular, I hope. I’ll also run for student government, whatever position is unopposed. The best thing about swimming is how relaxing it is to not look at a screen and to just sweat and have time to think, but I’m not a great racer.

The sport I really love doing is trapshooting. Right now, I can pretty consistently hit 22/25 clay targets in single trap, but I’m improving. I’m also about this good in continental, but I’ve only been shooting since April 2018. I’m hoping to get good this year so I have something that’s at least somewhat unique and something I’m talented at. 

My extracurricular is an internship at APAPA. Our internship claims to grow leadership. I hope that the West Point admissions officers see it that way too. I thought it sounded good since it’s an internship focusing on civic engagement and leadership. Right now I’m trying to organize a debate between the candidates running in my district. The best thing about being civically engaged is that I get to meet people involved in politics like the mayor of Seattle, people running for state senate, city council, etc. I wonder if this will help when I apply for a recommendation from my US Senator this spring.

I have only taken my PSAT so far, but I’m pretty good at math. I can get a full 800 on the math pretty easily, my best score in a pretest being 1520. Im expecting to study more and score around a 1550. I’m taking Precalc Honors. I’m not a super asian math genius, but it’s what I got.

In terms of classes, I had a 4.0 in Freshman and Sophmore year. In freshman, I took improv drama for the art credit, health for the health credit, Chinese 2 because it was easy and I need a language credit, Early Civs, Honors geometry and Honors Physics/Chemistry. 

In Sophmore year, I took English 10 Honors, Chinese 3,  Honors Algebra 2 and Honors history, along with Drama for the art credit, and normal Biology.

Now in Junior year, I have AP Envi-Sci, AP History and AP English, Honors Precalc, Honors Chemistry/Physics, College-level Chinese 4, and Marketing. I have As and Bs this year so far. 

I’m 16, 150 pounds or so, and I’m about 5 ft 6 inches, 16 yrs old. 

There isn’t a Junior ROTC program at my school, I didn’t go into Boy Scouts, and I’m not doing club swimming, instead opting to only do School team swimming and trapshooting. I’m planning on doing boys state this year and talking to the Military guys who visit my school to recruit every month. I’m a link crew leader but that’s all the authority I have. I don’t have any leadership positions besides that, or any clubs, for that matter. I plan on visiting West Point and US naval academy, and I’m doing boys state this summer. I have a sliver of hope, and I have my passion that drives me to work towards the honor of being accepted into West Point. Please tell me what I can do to get there, or if I stand a chance.

I’ve sense moved to a different department, to a full time permanent position, but the same bs is still happening to my old coworkers. 
For reference I’m in California.

The department in question has one permanent, full time position staffed, but the individual who has that position has been out on family leave for around 2 years now. That person keeps coming back sporadically to make sure they can maintain their benefits as an actual employee, but they get no work done. 

Since the admin can’t (or seem unwilling to) give her the boot, they’ve decided that they can pay for some temporary, part time employees to do the same job. They’re careful not to let them get close to a 40hr week, but as the full time person stays out more and more the part timers are having to leave work undone or leave shifts unstaffed, which just leaves them with more work to do the next time they’re allowed to come in.

This job is for a law enforcement agency in a position that encounters biohazards on a daily bases, and these employees have to buy their own health insurance. Since they’re temp part time and not permanent part time, the union isn’t particularly concerned about them. They’ve gone to fiscal, and their superiors to talk about a raise but nobody cares. 

Is there anything that these two can do? They’re both trying to get other jobs, but that takes time (especially with law enforcement agencies). It just makes me sick that my buddies are still being treated this way, and nobody they’ve gone to seems to care. 

The same kind of conditions are also in place for the unpaid interns in the same department.... it’s all just pretty sleazy."

I'm just sick of this shit. In my mind I know that there is absolutely no reason to fear any of these situations because they don't put my in danger. But my body reacts like I'm about to die and it sucks. I shake, I feel horribly sick to my stomach, I get dizzy, and my mind gets foggy so I can't think clearly.

Where do I start with this? I know I'm capable of getting past it but I'm having such a hard time figuring out how! I just want to relax and be at peace with my words, actions, and decisions but other people seem to get the best of me.

Tl;dr: I'm a complete doormat, and I'm terrified of a lot of things involving interacting with others. How do I get better?"
9oat2e,35,2018-10-15,A quality university does not breed quality people. A rant from a disheartened student.,SupremeSouth,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/9oat2e/a_quality_university_does_not_breed_quality/,"Before I begin, this is not to call out a specific age-group or ethnicity although I will admit that the problems I've had were from the same ethnic group. I will also admit that they were with males, as the women at UCLA have all been quite respectful and courteous to me thus far.

Anyways, I want to give a short breakdown of three encounters I had with UCLA students (or I assume they are or were UCLA students as evident from their UCLA apparel or car accessories/license plate borders, etc.) The first encounter was during the evening in Westwood near Ralph's and Chik-Fil-A. I was driving and minding my own business as I came to a stop because there was a car (a quite expensive car at that too) facing my direction, trying to make the same turn I was (it's hard to explain without a diagram but basically this car was faced the wrong way in a one-way and was trying to turn into an area that I was trying to turn into as well). I saw that he and his 4 other friends in the car were there first so I motioned him to go first. I know they saw me because we made eye contact and then I saw the driver look to his friend and smile and laugh. I thought they weren't leaving so I slowly went to exit and this car literally slams the accelerator and starts violently honking at me. The driver and his friends (I've seen these people on campus so I knew they were UCLA students) started yelling obscenities and howling at me and laughing at me, pointing fingers angrily, probably accusing me that I made the mistake of almost hitting the ""expensive"" car that his parent's bought him. They all each stared at me while smiling as they drove past me. Okay...I guess it was just some kids messing around (although messing around on crowded LA streets in a car shows very poor judgment and a lack of common sense and respect in my opinion) 

Encounter two: I won't disclose the location but I was minding my own business on my phone. Out of nowhere, a group of guys walks by me and starts making inappropriate noises and dropping racial, homosexual and offensive jokes and comments out loud. They would come up right next to me and one even made weird noises right up to my ear and I swear to God his breath reeked of cigarettes. Then they all started laughing (in a very annoying manner). I was the only person within the vicinity so I don't think they were targeting someone else. I did nothing to prompt them to do this. I was NOT wearing anything offensive or did I even look at them. I was on my phone the entire time. I obviously did not retaliate or try and acknowledge their immature actions but inside I was literally on the edge of blowing up. 

Encounter three...I don't want to get into detail because it's pretty much more of the same. Offensive gestures, comments, snickering, coming up to me with their chests puffed, etc. when all I'm doing is studying on my laptop or simply walking to class. 

To be clear, I have done nothing to prompt these people to do any of these things against me. I literally mind my own business, go to class, eat, and serve my community. I don't laugh loudly in public or say jokes in public about race, sexuality, females, etc. I don't make eye contact with many people nor do I actively seek out attention or confrontation.

Perhaps I'm an easy target because I'm a short 5'5 Asian male and I'm not muscular or look intimidating at all. I speak softly and I wear thick glasses. But that can't be the reason as there are MANY asians at UCLA and MANY students who are physically small. Am I to assume this rampant bullying isn't specific to me but others suffer the same trial? 

I don't really know what else to say but firmly say that I am actually so discouraged and disappointed that a top-tier university that abides by the values of cooperation and respect is riddled with students who have no respect for one another. I **understand** that UCLA can't monitor every student and I am NOT saying that just because UCLA is a top university, every student will also hold him or herself on high moral standards 24/7. But to see that we are all young adults at a world-famous university, I'm a little ashamed that my experience at UCLA has been tainted by the actions of these bullies at our campus.

UCLA talks about gay pride, depression, suicide, CAPS which are all GREAT. There is a silent population of suffering people and it's fantastic that UCLA does all it can to be inclusive and non-discriminatory. But college does not mean bullying is over. Bullying is not unique to elementary playgrounds or high school hierarchies. Bullying is part of someone's identity, and this quality can last far beyond college into adulthood as well. 

As someone who grew up in a bullying-infested high school (and I'm sure there are many others who also resonate with this), I found great joy in knowing that I would be surrounded by driven, respectful and friendly Bruins at UCLA. Unfortunately, my experience at UCLA has not only been academically challenging but also a disheartening experience. We are so caught up on judging others by their GPAs, resumes, and internships that we quickly forget to examine one's character. I'm sorry that a few experiences like this has tainted my view of UCLA and I know for a fact that I'm not the only one who has gone through something like this. I'm not looking for pity or sympathy but just wanted to let someone, just anyone, to know that I do not enjoy staying soft-spoken or silent forever. Any form of harassment should never be tolerated anywhere, ever. Bullying kills people. Bullying drives people to suicide. Just because you were raised in a wealthy family or because you're smarter or more athletic than someone else does not make you entitled to a life devoid of repercussions or give you a special pass. At then end of the day, no matter how ""amazing"" you think you are, if you simply refuse to live by the moral standards of society and embrace the innate human capacity to love, respect and cooperate with people of all ages, genders, religions, ethnicities, and backgrounds, I highly urge you to re-evaluate your life. Perhaps you can start by examining your own character and actions and asking yourself, ""Am I willing to become a better person or will I continue to walk down a path of a self-righteous, disrespectful and egocentric lifestyle?""

Thank you for reading this very long rant where you might think I'm salty and act like a victim but yeah clearly it irritated me to a certain extent so my words my have been out-of-line somewhere in this rant so I apologize for that. Anyways, this isn't an everyday thing but just something that I thought about after a while. "

Most people get my school confused with Cal Poly SLO, which is our sister school. Cal Poly SLO is more prestigious than my school. 

However, I am debating if I should transfer to UC Berkeley. 

The main reason why I want to transfer is because of the prestigious value the brand UC Berkeley brings when finding a job or an internship. 

That is why I wanted to ask this community.

First off, I apologize if this is a duplicate, I searched and didn't find what I was looking for.

I am an entry level IT support for a smaller company, 150 users, I was an intern, and was hired on.  There has been a renewed sense of security here due to an incident and we are rolling out 2FA to all users with email addresses.  

I am responsible for enrolling users in 2FA.  My only problem is the level of difficulty that it was to get the main office enrolled, and I believe that the difficulty will increase.  I had to go to each desk in the main office and walk them through on enrollment.  The app passwords have been the most frustrating thing for them, and in turn frustrating for me.  They have a hard time saving the app password to use if they are logged out of their phone, get a new computer, or log into their remote desktop.  

The rest of the users are even worse with technology. Many older people, and people that did not grow up with much technology, and I see this being an uphill battle that will not stop.  I have trialed Duo and that was officially shot down after many revisions to the quote for users. I am trying to make the enrollment as easy as possible, because I know this will be a frustrating process for me and the users. 

Is there a way to enable 2FA through office 365 that will not require the use of an app password?  This is a construction company and the foreman use a generic plant email.  A phone number will be tied to this account, and my concern is if he is sick or gone, how do others log in?  For our lab, they travel around to different labs and log in to the desktop app.  I am at a loss here and any advice is welcome.

Coming out of school I took a job as a software developer making 50k, then after 1 year took a job in tech support making 55k. I had no luck looking for other developer jobs, as my GPA/experience aren’t the greatest (2.86). I also have an obscene amount of debt for my age (~$80k). The company I work for has decent opportunity for advancement and good benefits. I have been with the company for 6 months and am very good at the job. It is also important to note that my life’s ambition is to start my own company, or run one, not be a software developer.

One of my friends has moved into a sales position making 6 figures, and has all but guaranteed me the same job. Hours aren’t great but the earning potential is outrageous.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I had my final round interview for a summer internship position at a big bank (one of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley) a few weeks ago. Walked into the interview confident, and left even more confident. Had an excellent conversation with the VP for 15 minutes longer than scheduled, laughed about our past banking stories, compared our industry interests, and she finished the conversation with ""I would like to let you know that you did excellent and I will certainly be recommending you."" She even responded to my standard thank you email the next morning with ""It was an absolute pleasure meeting you. I hope to see you around the office soon as one of our interns!"".

&amp;#x200B;

This all being said, here I am two weeks after with no offer in my hands (big banks tend to give offers to best candidates either same day or next day). Last week I checked in with the HR recruiter asking for an estimated decision timeline, and she responded simply with ""Thanks for checking in! We will send you an update as soon as possible."".

&amp;#x200B;

So, bringing this back to my main question, what can go wrong after an interview and before a hiring decision? How much of a say does the interviewer have in the process? Is there a standard process?

I have no prior support from my undergraduate faculty and feel like the school just doesn’t want to put up with me.

I earned a 2.48 semester GPA last spring, am in the midst of my last one now and am about dead in the water because I’m so burnt out. My cumulative is a 2.88 right now, and I’m trying to improve on it to strengthen my candidacy. I’m studying Environmental Science, and have applied to grad school at the same institution, where the faculty size is small, and participates in Undergraduate and Graduate coursework/research.

I feel lost at sea. My school impressed the importance of co-ops and internships onto me and I followed through with that. I was an RA for three years with my school, until I was let go because of a poor decision I made in protecting a student’s confidentiality from professional staff. 

I don’t love my program, but I don’t hate it; the content has been just interesting enough to keep me motivated about my coursework. I have 4 years of summer and mid-semester work experience listed on my resume. I worked alongside the general curator for our local zoo on an ongoing genetics study about North American River Otters, and I hope to continue this for my thesis— I want to integrate GIS into my work, in order to do a habitat assessment based on parameters I already started researching last semester. The work is there, I know what I need to do.

I reached out to some of my professors in the program that I built up rapport with, and basically was met with, “But isn’t the minimum GPA requirement a 3.0?” I had been working my ass off to make sure that my low GPA doesn’t withhold me from consideration, so to hear this come back from two people I thought I could have an easy conversation with was, while not surprising, extremely disheartening. This has been my experience in all four years of undergrad. I have worked and worked, put effort into many of my projects and labs, reports, even just my emails. No matter where I have received feedback, whether direct or subliminal, I have felt unsupported. It’s killing me. I consider driving into oncoming traffic pretty frequently— ongoing counseling’s helped, but the thought remains. Considering suicide has been a pretty strong pulse throughout all of this: undergrad, work, applying for grad school. Must be normal.

I’m not looking for a handout, I’m not looking to be spoon fed, I just wanted someone here to fucking believe in me or acknowledge me. Nothing I’ve done is good enough.

I spoke with the chair of my grad program about my low GPA and he said that he wanted my research to be included in the program, the GPA wouldn’t affect his decision— but do I want to work with this faculty? No. No, trusted colleagues, I don’t. I don’t want to be in an environment where I can’t find someone who gives even an inkling of a shit about my success. I need that, and I’m not ashamed to admit it. Doesn’t matter if it’s from a boss, a professor, or a mentor, but I excel when I know someone is looking out for me and sees potential in me. I feel lost, and I’m sick for wanting the validation because god forbid I ask for it in academia— I don’t want to be weak, but here I am. Weak-willed, burnt out, ready to get hit by a car, and without a mentor to speak of. Guess that’s just the way of it, huh?

I'm a junior at university right now, studying Accounting and Economics. I currently have a couple internship offers. One is at a Big 4 accounting firm, while the other is at an up-and-coming startup. I'm torn as to which one to pick; The startup definitely has the culture I'm looking for, and would involve enjoyable hands-on projects that would help build my skillset for a full-time role (potentially at the same company).

On the other hand, the Big 4 would look great on a resume, and will be more recognizable in case I end up moving after graduation. I don't think I would like the day-to-day as much, but I would still gain some valuable financial skills that could be very marketable later on.

I feel like the decision is a win-win. I am leaning toward the startup, but am worried that I'd be an idiot to turn down a role at a big company that could turn heads when applying for full-time roles next year.

I have been unemployed since. Mostly, I want to say the reason I have been unemployed is due to indecisiveness as to which city I wanted to permanently relocate to. Also, my parents wanted me to go on vacation with them the past summer, so I put off my job search. Right now, I have on my resume that I am employed at a company I did an internship at although it is not true and is actually fake. However, my former supervisor at the company vouched for me and sent in references on my behalf. I have been getting a lot of interviews as a result of having this fake job experience on my resume. I have made it to the final round stages with a few companies, but am still waiting to hear back regarding next steps. Is this a good idea since I have been unemployed for quite a while, so filling in the employment gap with a fake job seemed reasonable to show recruiters that I am not a red flag? Do employers verify job history together with degree completion status and am I fucked if so? Thanks for your advice."

9oiwxx,0,2018-10-15,Profile strength and is it too late for me? (Fall 2019 Admissions for Phd in EE),jwigmore,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/9oiwxx/profile_strength_and_is_it_too_late_for_me_fall/,"Hey everyone! So I came to the conclusion that I want to apply to couple Ph.D. programs and would love some honest feedback on my profile and whether or not it's too late to realistically apply for Fall 2019 admissions.  

Currently, I am finishing up my senior year in Electrical Engineering at a moderately ranked college in the United States.  I am part of the Honors College, have a GPA of 3.90, and am finishing up a minor in Computer Science.  

I have had three summer internships: one at a government defense agency, one at a power company, and one at a top aerospace/defense contractor.  I learned a lot from each of these experiences, but they were not really research-related jobs so I am unsure if they will really help me out with applying to graduate school. My last one at the defense contractor was related to radars and made me want to pursue a career in something similar like signal processing, communications, etc.   

I have some research experience, but it’s not the really high-quality research that I think programs are looking for.  From Freshman to Junior year I worked in a lab related to power systems control and optimization, and am listed as a co-author on a published paper.  However, for that paper, I primarily wrote the code to interface the simulation equipment.  I also was awarded an undergraduate research grant during this time and was able to travel to present a poster at a large conference, but the project never progressed as far as we hoped and I realized I wasn’t interested in pursuing this subject area any longer. 

This semester I started working in a Wireless Communications lab, but I will not have any significant work done by the time it’s time to send my grad school applications in. A lot of projects in the lab are related to aerial vehicles, both manned and unmanned.  I have spoken with the professor I am working with and he said he would fund my M.S. if I want to remain at my current university, which is an amazing offer, but I am now thinking I want to apply to some other PhD programs.  

I also have a decent amount of extracurriculars, but I don’t know how relevant they are for graduate school. My greatest role is that of chairman of IEEE on at our university, and during my time as chairman our student branch has gone from borderline inactive to now having ~40 active members.  I have also brought in speakers from major companies, organized workshops, and in general, have made IEEE active for the first time in years at our university.  I am also a part of the ECE and general engineering Honors Societies, a professional engineering fraternity, and was a student representative for a DOE program that aimed to promote renewable energy research.  

I am also currently leading our senior design project which aims to communicate with a UAV using HF frequencies via NVIS propagation. This project is very much research oriented, and our advisor is the same professor I currently work for.  

I am signed up to take the GRE in a few weeks, but honestly don’t have a lot of time to prepare between now and then due to my research position, senior design, and classes.  I was studying for it over the summer and am expecting to get around 160 on both the Quantitative and Verbal section.  

Finally, I am interested in applying to research programs related to communications and signal processing for autonomous systems. I am afraid that even though I have a lot of experience through internships and leadership positions, my research experience is lacking and I won’t be competitive for a lot of programs.  Right now my program list includes only a couple universities:  Duke, NC State, and CU Boulder, but this will probably expand. 

So /gradadmissions, what do you think? Is it too late get everything together for Fall 2019 applications? I feel like there is no way I can get into a top 10 program, but top 25 or 50? One option is to remain at my university and get my M.S. so that I can get more quality research experience under my belt, but I kind am ready to leave and start somewhere else.  

Please let me know what you think, and thanks!

Pay is comparable for all 3. I've heard that all 3 are liberal with return offers and I'm likely to take it if I get one because I hate interviews lol, so this is a big decision. My (uninformed) thoughts so far:

Dropbox: Probably the most ""logical"" of the 3 but I don't find their product that interesting and their stock isn't doing great... I question their future now that they've pivoted to solely enterprise. Biggest benefit of Dropbox to me is that I'll be located in the bay and have more opportunities in the long run; how much of a factor is this?

Hulu: Well-known brand and I think they're doing some interesting stuff with live TV, but I question their long-term prospects with the Disney acquisition. I also wonder how seriously the company is taken as a tech organization, since I could barely find any info about working there. Concerned about not being in SF career-wise although I've visited LA and enjoyed it.

Snap: Probably the most ""hip"" of the bunch but they're tanking hard and I know they've laid people off recently... same concerns about LA too.

I will make it my priority to get my first video as soon as possible (within 2 weeks) even if production quality may not be the best.

Hey guys! I'm an average 2A CS student who has been struggling to find internships with no relevant work experience and few side projects. I've spent much of the past year focusing on remedying mental health issues as well as soul-searching to find out if a career in CS is for me. I still haven't come to a definitive answer but what I have learned is A) I won't ever find out unless I dive into it &amp; B) There are problems in the world that I am passionate about solving even if I may not be enthralled about coding itself.


I've decided over the summer to fully commit myself to software development &amp; began looking at resources to improve myself. While there is an endless amount of technical resources to read through, what I've noticed is that almost all of the advice on Youtube is given through the perspective of someone who has already succeeded. While they can be great mentors and offer practical tips, I've felt that these videos lacked detail and reality about the actual process of making it in software. 


I'm going to create a youtube channel where I document my journey in software from almost zero practical experience to hopefully a ""hero"". I feel this would be a great opportunity to grow alongside viewers, and once I'm well into this journey, I think it would be very cool and helpful to go through the whole string of videos to see genuine progression. I plan to start this channel regardless of interest for the purpose of self-documentation but I will be going about it differently depending on if others are interested. I plan to cover various areas in addition to coding such as growing my network from virtually nothing as well as logging  my interviews. I also plan to have fun with it &amp; give the channel a comedic undertone so that it isn't just dry information. Let me know if you would be interested in watching and thanks for taking the time to read this!

TLDR: Would you be interested in a youtube channel that documents a genuine zero-to-hero progression of a CS student trying to make it in the software industry? "
9okcib,0,2018-10-16,Need some help with Interviews.,dx_diag,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9okcib/need_some_help_with_interviews/,"I'm a Sophomore Civil Engineering major with a solid 3.8 GPA (probably will go down this year) and some mediocre club/project experience. I had a summer internship after my freshman year but looking back I realize it was pretty much handed to me on a silver platter. While my interview for that internship was probably not bad, I realize that it wasn't a very hard job to get and I think I will have to step up my game to move on to bigger and better things, which is what I want to do. I had an interview with Exxon Mobil recently and while I don't think I bombed it, I think I could have performed much better than I did. I did not get an offer. They asked me a lot about projects and general experiences with them, such as a time I motivated a team to get past a problem, problems I encountered in my projects and how I solved them, a time I lead a team to a common goal, etc. One of the biggest things was I simply felt that I didn't have quite enough ""big project"" experience to really answer these questions with a solid answer off the top of my head. I even had to think back to high school for one answer and that just didn't sit well with me. Naturally I am going to try to get involved in Formula SAE or ASCE to get some more project experience, but I think that some of my issues with answering these questions can really go back to simply being better prepared for my interview, I did do some research on their website ahead of time but it didn't really help a whole lot with answering these questions.

I have an online non-live preliminary interview with a large company coming up, and potential for a few more as I shotgun applied to a bunch recently. I want to be as prepared as I can for these upcoming interviews, so my question for you is, 

What do you do to get prepared for interviews and what is your advice to me in this situation? How can I turn those tough questions that I don't have a good answer for to be in my favor?"

9okt10,3,2018-10-16,This is the 289th Time I’ve Written a Post Like This,logicalRadical,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9okt10/this_is_the_289th_time_ive_written_a_post_like/,"I don’t know how else to say this, but this is the 289th time I’ve written a post like this. I’ve been stuck repeating the same day over and over again. I’ve lost track of how many days it’s been. At this point, I look back and it seems like all my life has taken place on this very day.


I remember the first few days I began posting videos online, reaching out to others to try to get out, but so far nothing has worked. Most of the time, no one in my lab believes me, and even when we all get very serious about the issue and try to revert my situation, nothing ever comes of it. The first few times I posted on here, I had included so much detail, I just wanted to get as much as I could out there, but now I just want to stick to the most important aspects of my situation. To some degree I have accepted my fate, but I hope somehow this account can get out there so that you don’t make the same mistakes I did. I’m sitting at work right now as I write this, and most of the time I am at work because I’ve been trying to fix whatever is going on with me. There’s an increasingly boiling fever inside my head and I fear that the whispers are getting louder.


My work involves keeping the temperatures of the research lab’s quantum computers at stable levels. Their processors have to be cooled to near absolute zero to increase the spin lifetime of the electrons, which is apparently crucial for the functioning of these computers’ processing. I wasn’t well read on the subject before coming to work here, since most of my experience had been working in labs focused on maglev, but I have been reading a lot more into quantum mechanics to try to understand my time-fucked situation.


The day when it all happened, which is the day I’m still currently in, was like any other day. Get to work, check the temperature sensors, check emails, and such. I had gotten to work late, but no one really cared. Lately, not much was going on, just a lot of paperwork for the principal investigators concerning the lab’s budget. I distinctly remember the intern choking on some food earlier that day, which gave me and another coworker a good laugh. Usually I kept to myself since I was the temperature guy - nothing like these fancy PhDs who went to fancy schools, but still can’t do shit to fix my time loop - just the temperature guy no one really paid attention to, and I enjoyed this. I enjoyed being alone.


Since I’d gotten to work a bit late, I decided to stay a few extra hours. I was also used to being the last to leave since I had to always make sure the cooling system was left turned on during the night.


I was on my desk listening to dodie on repeat, writing emails to other research labs that wouldn’t make me sit around just managing the temperature of noisy quantum computers. I regretted having taken this job solely because of its flashy “quantum research” title and I missed working in electromagnetics. I wasn’t thinking too much about anything at that point, which is probably why I noticed the sound. I quickly took off my headphones to listen closely. It came on and off, a low-pitched hum. It wasn’t too loud which surprised me because I’d heard it through my noise-cancelling headphones. The fact that I got up from my chair to investigate the sound irritates me to no end. I should have just gone about my emails and left as soon as I could. But for some reason curiosity got the best of me and compelled me to find out what this noise was. There were a lot of machines, sensors, and naturally the lab was a pretty rambunctious environment during the day. But now that everyone was gone, the sounds I had grown used to hearing at night were the constant buzzing coming from the quantum computers and the AC. There was a new little noise in the mix. It was irregular, with seemingly no discernible pattern, yet sounded like the air was speaking very softly.


I slowly began to make my way through a passageway of computers. It was a dim-lit space that would have usually averted my eyes, but for some reason it just drew me in. There were many green flashes coming from the machines, and as soon as I began to pay attention to the army of green light I felt drowsy. The kind of drowsiness that comes from one's fear of death. Before I knew it I was falling head-first into the ground after tripping over some wires.


My head smashed through the ground, time almost instantly slowed to a stop as my head passed through the plastic-like membrane of the ground. Colors turned to white and black. I was seeing a scene that felt so alien, like nothing I’d seen before. It was like space, except the background was this pitch white and the stars were shining with a lustrous black. These black stars were not round balls of plasma but irregular shapes. Some looked like platonic geometric solids, or like the archimedean, catalan, and even kepler solids. One of them stood out in my mind. The black object in front of me was an irregularly-shaped glowing number 1. As I looked at it I felt it staring at me, in fact I knew that all the shimmering points of black were quietly staring at me, frozen in time. I wanted to look away from its gaze, blink and close my eyes to keep my soul away from that ominous shape of gloom standing before my frozen eyes. I felt it prod my mind, and as it touched it I began to hear a whispering inside my brain. I don’t know for how long I listened to the whispering voice, but at some point I understood my situation. It said,


“I am just one as opposed to any more or to none at all. Time will wait for you and the insanity you will acquire will drown you in an everlasting violent eruption. The seeds that came from mine jointed parts that are attached in taller features of reality your fully extent open eyes cannot see will slowly gather in the darkness of your mind for you have laid eyes and have seen a place of perfect forms that never was and never could be. The black water touching its white twin sibling has spilled its heavenly blood on your hands reflecting the black light coming from my brothers’ shadows from the abyss growing petals from the sacred flowers that seek for the sacred water. Our fruit expand the mind beyond anything it can imagine defying all knowledge. The seeds of these fruit will gather in your mind and light shall never more shine within the darkness strangled by the hands of the sinners while the sun shines brightly at midnight. I am the black star in the sky and come to you with a revelation, to revel and rejoice for there is no sin within my shadows that the seeds of the dead cannot forgive. As the clock’s black appendages shining brightest in my kingdom become your only companion then you will meet the fire that decays all that is not forgotten. My dark flames will know the whispers of thine name and they will acquire every part of you that remains after being all that continues to exist in a pitch black dominion of nothing but you.”


Music echoed from my soul as 1’s foul fingers plucked at it. I knew that I would be in, what would appear to be an indefinite loop of time, but is actually something more terrifying. Because I had seen the black and white realm I have been destined to fall forever from one universe to the next in an infinite loop. My particles have been stained by a world populated by perfect geometric forms and all the other pure ideas that exist. The whispering told me all of this as I woke up today. It’s the same every time I wake up, I hear its sweet little voice explaining to me the higher planes of existence so that I can come to terms with my eternal damnation. But I won’t. And it will relish in my torment.


Today I was in your universe, but just as tomorrow seems to unconditionally draw near, I awaken in some other universe right “below” yours. My soul will fall through the multiverse never endingly. Maybe one day you will see me, or rather the me that would have been from my own frame of reference had I not fallen from your universe by the end of the day. There’s always a 50/50 chance of making it to tomorrow. A coin flip. But I have been falling for a very long time now. My coin keeps landing on tails and I feel so alone.


If you ever feel that you’re about to fall, make sure to immediately close your eyes and keep them closed. Don’t look at the stars. Some days after the incident I realized I was no longer able to see things with my mind. If you told me to imagine a tree I simply wouldn’t be able to imagine a picture of it. Aphantasia is a condition where a person cannot consciously visualize imagery. I can still think about ideas and abstract concepts and still hear my mind’s voice, but my mind is now blind to images my eyes can see. When I close my eyes all I see is black. A glowing black that seems to get brighter and brighter as the day draws to its end and I’m about to fall again. And for some reason, I can’t explain it, I also feel that there are seeds burrowing within the darkness in my thoughts that will one day explode in their fruits ripening and my heart’s juices will forever be swallowed by my burning mind."

I’m an international student finishing my undergrad in Systems Engineering at a prestigious school in my country (South America). I’m interested in pursuing a PhD program (with perhaps a masters along the way) in Data Science. Can someone give me tips to increase my chances at these schools?

- UC Davis 
- UC Berkeley
- UC San Diego
- USC
- SJSU

My stats so far (have 1 year left of school):

* I’ve been doing research for 3+ years now, all in the field I want to pursue and all with scholarships, but have only published 1 paper so far at a minor conference (first author). My current work has won a “Academic Relevancy” certificate from my school

* My GPA is competitive for my country’s standards, but not for US schools. I’d be around a 3.3/4.0 or a ~3.7/4.0 (considering only the last 45 units). Should be somewhere between the top 10%~20% of my class, can’t really tell because rankings are not published.

* No GRE yet

* At least 3 good academic LORs from my professors in the field of DS + 2 from my internship, if needed

* Currently doing an internship in the field, with a high prospect of being hired (alongside being a research assistant and doing my classes)

* Not sure if relevant, but had some other experiences during school: helped coordinate a TEDx, lead a study group on minorities and marginalized communities, took 2 summer classes in UC Berkeley (both As, Neuroanatomy and Basic Issues in Cognition), participated in a Microsoft program for software dev (S2B) and won best project, worked part time all along before my internship (unrelated field), finished a Big Data Specialization (UCSD) on Coursera

* I’ll be in Davis all January and want to use some of that time to meet professors/grad students in person. Not sure yet how to approach them tho

Should I consider other schools? What can I do in this last year to have a good chance of landing a funded PhD?

Thank you so much and hope you all have an awesome week!"

They stressed that the hardware/electrical skills would be more important than the, and I quote, ""largely theoretical nature"" of computer science. 

I respect their opinion, and it sounds like it makes sense, but I am still skeptical. I am sure I would enjoy the hardware aspect of it, and I have no doubt it would be useful, but I don't want to miss out on writing software, which I know I enjoy. 

However, I would love to be able to have the skills to work with hardware and software; to be able to build a device physically and then program it. 

So, long story short, I want to know if majoring in computer/electrical engineering will lock me out of pursuing software? I don't know much about either curriculum, and college websites don't explain it very well. Any advice is appreciated! "

I don't have a single coop or internship experience because my school prides itself in being harder than most schools around it and this screws us all over. My GPA is almost a 3.3 and it's killed all my chances of finding a job, and it did kill all my chances to get internships previously. I also happened to get my first controls exam back yesterday and I failed the damn thing. I wish I could say that I could have studied harder but I know I tried my best because half the class got a D or less. At this rate I'm afraid I won't even graduate! This professor is notorious for giving unreasonable exams and even the head of the department knows this because of all the complaints against him. The only other D I have in a class is Dynamics, which was also SUPRISE!, taught by the same guy.  This doesn't even begin to cover how broke I am and how hard it is to find time to work so I can afford to eat some days. I don't want to put my dad through more financial stress so I don't ask him for money. The only reason I'm not seriously contemplating ending it is because I would hate to put my parents through it. I don't even want to live for my sake 😂.

I should have just gone to CS. I've always loved computers and messing around with software and phones. And coincidentally, the most fun I've had in MechE was also while coding. I'm trying to take the GRE so I can switch to CS as a grad student but I've heard that it's hard to do so. At this point, I'm willing to take the chance.

Thank you for reading through if you've gotten this far."

9ootfu,5,2018-10-16,Path to learn functional programming,daredevildas,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9ootfu/path_to_learn_functional_programming/,"Background - After my internship, my supervisor told me that I needed to work on my program design and learning functional programming would be a step in the proper direction as it would force me to think in a particular way.

Steps taken - He suggested learning scala, but since it is not strictly functional I was not really ""forced"" to program in a functional style.

Programming Language Experience - Java, Python, Scala

Most functional programming language tutorials/books out there focus on the language and not ""functional programming"" (The language is always the easy part - It does not take that much time to pick it up).

I would love any suggestions on how to go about learning functional programming. Thanks."

- Of the 38 coding challenges that I received, I didn't do around 10-15 of them (this ultimately meant a rejection as reflected in the diagram).

I recently graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. During my time at Purdue, I have had multiple internship and research positions from which I have been able to attain experiences in an array of CS areas (general software engineering, deep learning, image processing and web dev). I really enjoy programming and I want to help you guys!

 I currently have some time to spare so I thought I'd post here and be an additional resource for anyone who wants to learn programming. I am available for any questions from learning how to code to tips on how to get through college. I'd also love to work with you guys on problems on discord/skype - if you guys want to work through a problem or two with me and learn in that fashion.

I am also planning on starting to write a blog on how to code / more fundamental CS concepts like data structures and algorithms / current projects that I am working on etc. Do you guys want me to blog/learn about anything specific? Please let me know! 

Thanks and I hope to answer all of your questions!

I'm a junior at WGU. I have to study online because my husband is in the Coast Guard, I work full time to pay for school, and so far we've moved three times since I've started college. I'm only 21. I've been going to hackathons (two so far, but three more planned by December) to try and bolster my skills and GitHub. I have mild experience in a lot of things through class or personal curiosity, through I haven't implemented anything in personal projects or apps. Additionally, it's hard to find time to work on this stuff between housework, work work, and sleep. I'm a Junior who can graduate Winter 2019 or Spring 2020 depending on how I orient my classes. I haven't done any CS internships yet and I'm getting pretty worried. I applied to a bunch of internships for next summer, however I've only heard back from Twitter and JPMorgan for coding interviews. I'm very bright and can figure things out well and fast, however my lack of in person interaction (mostly this) to learn from or ask questions to and time are my downfalls. I really have to work hard to make opportunities and projects for myself, and then teach myself to be able to compete. I'd love to land an internship next summer similar to ones offered to sophomores, where you have some experience (more breadth and some depth in one or two areas)  but you aren't an expert and they help you learn how to do things more easily and effectively. What would be the best way to go about this? Is it too late for me? I'd be willing to travel to different parts of the country for the internship."

Instead of having a budget of €1200 (including OS) I decided to go for €1500-ish, so I just want to know if my changes make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

## Build Help/Ready:

&amp;#x200B;

**Have you read the sidebar and \[rules\](**[**http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules**](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)**)? (Please do)**

Yes

&amp;#x200B;

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

First and foremost, audio production. I want to go from producing on a 2011 Macbook Pro to something that will run my DAW with plug ins smoothly and have enough USB ports for my hardware synths/drum machines. I will probably need at least five USB connections besides mouse/keyboard/gaming headset for USB mixer and synths for the time being.

After that, I would use it for amateur/hobbyist level video editing, 3D and motion design.. I probably will also use the PC for some lighter gaming with friends (League of Legends, Fortnite, CS:GO, maybe some Civilization and Cities: Skylines).

&amp;#x200B;

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

1080p, 60fps (might buy a 144Hz monitor, currently don't have one though), Mid/High graphics settings.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I want to be around ~~1200~~ 1450 euros including OS (Windows 10).

&amp;#x200B;

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Germany

&amp;#x200B;

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). \[Consider formatting your parts list.\](**[**http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp**](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

So I am a student who has picked up Python this summer mid July and now is really excited in using it. Until now I have coded a couple of small scripts that connect to databases and process different types of files.  
I have started learning through Automate The Boring Stuff W/ Python and the quit it after it seemed too low level, this is because I have programming experience and I am able to learn faster(I know OOP, PHP, C &amp; C++ as well as some JS/HTML/CSS).

I learned a lot in Python by looking up a lot of things in the internet, so learning through practice. Now I don't have any more projects to work on and the one I want to create just makes me want to add more to it.  
What I am asking is for some projects, well defined that will tell me to x-y-z so I could learn more by doing.  
If you have any good tutorials about using decorators, OOP(mid-level to advanced) and formatting, please drop them bellow as well as you project ideas. Projects for building websites are also welcome but will be put in second place as I am looking for a job or internship in data science or any departament working with API's and databases.

9orjgv,5,2018-10-16,Saint Louis Job market for new developers good or bad?,jcupples,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9orjgv/saint_louis_job_market_for_new_developers_good_or/,"I have a degree. (the degree content was literally bullshit. I was literally told by the director of the program that the semester I enrolled was the 'guinea pigs' of the program. It was highly underdeveloped and the teachers could not teach. It was like they brought in some old rambling homeless man in to teach the core classes). I graduated in 2016 and I'm still struggling with finding some place.

I made tons of mistakes since I was in school (didn't apply for internships, the content of the core courses were bullshit and the tecahers couldn't teach, so I spent most of my time bitching at upper faculty only to get ignored). I also didn't build up a real portfolio. I did projects here and there and read books to help myself understand concepts, but I don't have a real portfolio. Just small projects that show I understand concepts. 

It's been two years. I held a support job for SharePoint last summer but couldn't hack it because I absolutely hated SharePoint.

This Spring after working minimum wages jobs on and off I FINALLY scored a job as a new developer. I was so freaking excited and stoked. The only problem was that it was in Delphi 7 and SQL, which was probably the most use to me. I was brought on to learn from the ground up, they knew I had zero XP. I had the best boss/leader I'd ever had. They gave me a chance, and as I had been convinced of, I learn way better in a real world environment than I ever could on my own or through books.

Unfortunately, last month, only 4 months in, they cut me loose. ""Budget cuts"". It was because the parent company kept buying up competition left and right and didn't have a solid plan to onboard anyone. They decided they couldn't keep me at $45k while they consistently were making hundreds of thousands of dollars every day (They literally sent out an email at the end of the day with sales totals). I was contracted so I had nothing to fall back on. What's worse is that I had a major medical operation done only two days before I got this news, so now I have some crippling medical debt that I have no way to pay at the moment. It has devastated me. It was a really shitty move on their part to not tell me before I threw money down for the medical procedure.

I've been trying to persevere, but I can not get any hits. I've had one interview but because I was working in an old language like Delphi, they passed on me. I'm running out of what little I had saved up and I have no idea what to do. 

I want to work on interesting problems. I don't want to get stuck in some corporate job where all I'm doing is adding to the bottom line for the company. I want to build and contribute to interesting shit. 

Is it that I just lack experience because I have too little to show, skill-wise,  or is it because I live in Saint Louis where the job market for new devs is just trash? Sure, the jobs exist but every single posting they want you to have 30 years experience as a junior dev. I want to bad to move to another city because prospects look way better than in this city. I really don't know if it's a case of 'the grass is always greener' or if it is worth the risk.

I'm stuck and don't know how to proceed. I turn 30 in two weeks and have nothing in my life.

My mistakes have caught up with me and the walls are closing in. I'm willing to learn anything and halfway willing to be undercut on salary jsut so I can get some sort of income. 

Before anyone says it, Launch code has not been helpful and Revature looks like a scam. 

As you can see, i'm pretty upset and my thoughts are scattered, I apologize if the post is scattered and unintelligible. I just needed to get my thoughts out and hope that somebody can help either put me at ease or give me some advice.

I remember playing with spaceships in elementary school saying I wanted to be an astronaut, making potions out of dish soap wanting to be a chemist (or really a wizard lol), or even take apart electronics and mess with them pretending to build something. This tapped into a big part of me and inspired me to become comfortable in the unknown, to always try new things, and to challenge myself.

Now fast forward 15-20+ years and I am a in debt/broke college student who has been going to uni for almost 7 years to get my BS. I am procrastinating on every ounce of homework I have, I go to therapy for depression and anxiety, and I am living life miserably. I never work on my craft as a programmer unless I am slightly inspired OR I have to for school. I spend most of my days sleeping in my bed, playing video games, watching YouTube videos, or lounging around in a paralyzed state. Something I know about myself is that I have this inside fear of success. I have passed opportunities to apply for internships at tech companies, I don't push 100% on my projects, I usually give up any diet that I go on, and my life is almost empty because I allow this fear to control me.

&amp;nbsp;

First, I'm currently taking a year off from uni somewhat for family reasons and to get additional work experience. I have a fair bit of experience in IT, but never past helpdesk and some management. I have a passion for networking, security, and just tinkering with computers whether that means setting up personal cloud servers, or making projects with a raspberry pi, but long story short I want to progress a bit past my prior experience.


As for my work experience already, I started as an intern and became a Computer Repair Technician for my school district totaling about 3 years of experience here put together from summers and high school years. After this last summer ended they didn't have enough work to justify keeping me for the whole year so I was dismissed and I saw this as an opportunity to step into a bigger role in which I felt more fulfilled.

My sophomore year (this past year) in college I worked as a helpdesk consultant at a pilot program at my university to replace the in-house grad student computer help, and for the last semester I was promoted to a team lead for that program and was expected to continue this year before I decided to take a year off.

I am going to school for Computer Science in the system track in a well-ranked university, and ultimately wanted to go into cybersecurity upon graduation, but am very interested in the possibility of becoming a system administrator as a stepping stone. My grades weren't fantastic, and were part of the reason for my hiatus, but I have taken several relevant classes that make for good resume material in addition to my work experience.

My hesitation is this: I will only be here until next September before leaving for uni out of state again, and I wanted to consult with this sub to see if that was disrespectful to any company that apply to, to use them for a year to gain experience and resume material before leaving them for at least two years if I ever came back period. I feel uncomfortable applying to these positions knowing that I don't intend to stay there for very long. If this isn't immediately an issue, at what point should I inform them that I intend to leave in less than a year, during the interview?

Thank you all in advance for taking the time to read this, and for any help you're able to give. I really appreciate it.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I have a passion for computers and want to apply for a sysadmin job, but I'm unsure of how it would be received if I only plan to stay for 10-11 months at the job before returning to school."

What exactly are these people getting at? Obviously I know it’s supposed to be derogatory but for instance are we not “supposed” to utilize connections, is it frowned upon in some way? Are we supposed to only go through the career fair to find a job?

As a result, I'm thinking of pursuing for a co-op instead to improve my skill set if searching for full time jobs don't work out. Some worries I have for this is:

&amp;#x200B;

How was your co-op experience?

Is it too late to search for a co-op for Spring '19? 

How would I explain my situation to recruiters when looking for a co-op? Will it look bad on me to tell them that I'm willing to delay my graduation for a co-op since I cannot find a full-time offer?

This is my first post on this subreddit so bear with me lol.

I am a sophomore at a big 4 (not IT big 4 ... Deloitte/PWC/KPMG/EY) target school in Virginia, and I was offered an Software Test Engineering (QA) intern position at a very fast-growing mobile application dev firm in Charlottesville, VA.

The pay is pretty good for the cost of living in Cville ($21/hr + $2000 housing stipend and meals). The catch is that I am in the 2nd round of an IT internship at Google and I am still applying to other internships that may potentially pay more.  The issue here is that I will need to give a confirmation by the end of this month. However, I am pretty sure the process  for the other companies that I applied to will take longer that the end of this month. Should I just go for it? I am ware that the place I got offered an internship for is a great place to start, but should I explore my options?

To be **brutally** honest, I am pretty much new to coding, but I am a quick learner so I was able to somehow apply concepts that I learned in 2-3 weeks in Python/Java to answer the interview questions asked, and somehow finessed an internship. That being said, I should expect myself to be proficient or somewhat good at Java/Python and maybe a front-end language by the end of the Spring semester. 

**TLDR: Was offered a good internship, should I take it or wait for other potential offers. However, I am pretty new to coding but somewhat capable. Should I take a gamble?**"

I understand that everyone may not agree, but that is the beauty of forums such as this one.

Start the day off by waking up earlier than [nature intended.](https://www.cdc.gov/features/school-start-times/index.html)


Go to school for 6-7 hours, which involves completing assignments, taking exams, participating in class,and juggling other tasks for several courses. You must excel at all of this, or else your chances of getting into a good school that will determine the quality of your life (money and career prospects) will decrease.


Then, spend another two hours playing a sport, or doing some other sort of extracurricular.


Once you’ve arrived home, you must start on homework for your several classes, while also being expected to master new material by studying. 


With whatever time you have left, you are expected to volunteer, or perhaps intern somewhere. 


Hopefully, you are at least able to eat something, and maybe take a shower.


You also need to be getting enough sleep and exercise. Don’t forget to socialize! Your ability to network and charm others will become very important in the near future. 
 

It should be no surprise that depression, anxiety, and substance abuse are increasing among adolescents in America.


Just be grateful that you are here, which probably means you are smart and fortunate enough to win this cruel game.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a sophomore CS major and had an internship this past summer. This week will be my last week of hope as the fall career season wraps up. Most of my friends have gotten their offers or at the very least done onsite interviews in NY/Cali and I have been rejected from every application I sent in. In total, I'd say I have applied to 75 companies this past month alone, 150 last year (fall + spring) and nothing seems to be working. The internship I did have last summer I attribute to luck alone. They posted it super late in the game (I was on summer break when I applied) and it was their first year doing the program so not many people applied anyway. I don't even have a return offer yet from that company but I really don't want to go back because that means I am not making any progress (of course, I would if I didn't have any other offers).

&amp;#x200B;

So far this career season, I have done several phone interviews and have moved on to the technical interviews/live coding challenges which is an improvement from last year. Maybe my problem is the live coding sessions but I am getting through the problems fine and the interviewer comments on how the solution is correct/says its a good answer. After that and a couple days, I get the reject email and proceed to find another internship to apply to. Many of the interviews I go through I feel like I did really well in so I am struggle to find where everything's going wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to that, some companies I applied to as a freshman and got an interview with didn't even send me an email this time around so that definitely makes me feel like I am going backwards.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have heard stories from my friends who get an easy technical and then an offers the next day from going to the GHC. It boggles my mind because these are my friends and some of them switched into computer science from their previous major this semester! They are not dumb by any means but how can companies be willing to take on people who don't understand data structures? (they have told me that they didn't know data structures going into the interview and still don't because they just started their intro class). To me, that means there are companies with a low barrier of entry but, I can't even get past that as a second-year CS major so that only adds to my doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's not because I am not passionate about computer science - I have been programming since I was in middle school. Took CS classes in high school and worked on building myself up in my down time before college. In general, I like problem solving with code. I don't really know why but, if I did, I'd probably make a better psychologist than I would a programmer. I am your typical nerd who works on CS problems during lunch and goes to Hackathons - and I am proud about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like everywhere I go to, people are saying that a CS career isn't suited for me. I am not giving up just yet but, I am getting tired of going through pages of applications and risking my GPA for interviews (and not going to class) when they just reject me in the end. I can't figure out what it is that is setting me back from being an ideal candidate when there are people who, when quantified, don't have much experience/CS knowledge yet. "

I'm relatively new here and this is my first ever post. I wanted to know if I could get some help and perhaps hear your stories. I'm 23 years old and I'm fresh out of college with a humanities degree. I thought I wanted to go to law school but after graduating, I realized that school wasn't really for me. I spent the following months learning data science and computer programming because I wanted to learn a lucrative and marketable skill. I did an internship for a tech start up over the summer as a data analyst and they were so impressed with my work that they asked me if I was open to extending that internship to a higher pay. Now as I'm two months into my internship, I've grown bored as well as seen my work as unfulfilling. I've come to the realization that I dislike programming and I feel stuck in a rut because I'm not sure what's even out there for me. I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice with regards to what career paths might be aligned with my interests.

As a kid, I really enjoyed building things such as Legos and Bionicles. In addition, I was fond of arts, particularly animations such as Gundam and Pokémon. Upon reflection, I've come to the realization that I love building things with my hands and I have an eye for artistic stuff. In my free time, I'm learning languages such as Chinese and German, playing video games, building plastic models or moving my body through some physical activity. I'm not sure if it helps but I consider myself as a typical INTJ. I hope some of this gives you an insight as to who I am and my interests and perhaps you might have some suggestions for me to explore."

I accepted that proposition, I also never tried and never saw a 'real' programming before. I liked it, started to understand the whole essence of programming.

I enjoy the job, and its in an area I'm interested in (Data Science/Machine Learning).

About a month ago a friend recommended me for a Software Dev job at IBM. I wasn't looking for a new job, because I liked my current one, but I knew he was paid well, and he said it would only be an interview so I thought why not.

Fast forward to now, I did the interview and got an offer. I've been thinking about it for a week now, so time is running thin and I'm still just as unsure as when I received the offer. I've actually never been so conflicted about anything in my life.

To give the full details, accepting the offer would mean going from £25K to £30K (I work in Belfast, so 30K is a really good salary for a graduate) and the pension at IBM is a lot better. The job itself is a more standard Software Development role for web apps. I actually did an internship doing the same thing, and I did really enjoy it, but the thought of leaving the Data Science/Machine Learning behind has me conflicted. I told my boss about it, who in turn told his boss about it, and we all chatted about it together; they mentioned the possibility of increasing my salary to encourage me to stay, but I get the feeling that they won't, and its been long enough now, and I need to make a decision.

When I talk to my contact at IBM, he likes the stress that with IBM I will have so much more opportunity, to move around, both role wise and physically. My friend that works there also says he really likes it, on the account that they don't really care about you leaving early or coming in late etc. as long as you get your work done.

Its difficult to put all my thoughts about this into a Reddit post, but would it be silly for me to leave a job after only working here for 4 months? Will I get similar opportunities like this in the future, or is this too good to pass up?

Some background on me: graduated from a liberal arts college, did software sales for 6 years, hated it, took a 9 month IT course at a vocational school (classes included prep for A+ and N+, some SQL, Windows Server 2008 + 2012, Cisco), and have been an IT Intern for the past 6 months while taking classes. I can basically do everything an entry level IT professional should be able to do - level 1 helpdesk, imaging, desk setup, inventory, and creating/resetting accounts in AD.

Company A is a large (3000+ employee) research facility for a well known academic institution. My title would be ""Service Desk Analyst"" It is a very typical helpdesk job - I was told that 50% of time is spent sitting at a walk up desk, 25% is new employee setup (they have tons of ""new"" employees because so many people go there to work for short periods of time), and 25% working on tickets.

Company B is a small (\~100 employee) insurance company. My title would be ""IT Analyst"". I would be the help desk person, but since there is only so much to do on the help desk in such a small company, I would also be involved in more high level stuff such as software installation, some server and backup administration, new vendor evaluation and some IT planning and architecture strategy. I was also told that they are opening two new offices soon and I would be involved in the build outs.

My short term goal is to become a system administrator and I'm thinking Company B would be a better choice. I'd basically be skipping the typical help desk period and would be exposed to more ""sysadmin"" stuff right off the bat.

Where would you say is a better place to start your career? A larger company with a bigger IT team? Or a smaller company where you would be exposed to ""all things IT""?

When school started this August, i decided; maybe i don’t really want to commit another 7 years working 60+ hours a week and graduating with $250,000 of debt. The main problem for me is: I’m a junior. I don’t really have enough credits to switch majors. But what I DO have enough space for is to be a computational biology major and a CS minor. 

My only fear is; I have absolutely no CS background excluding CS1110 which I’m currently taking. I have no internships. No experience. Never did anything CS related in high school. I was told by Arts and Sciences career services center to apply for internships for the summer on handshake, but I only know one language from an intro class so I don’t have much confidence in an offer. My only redeeming factor is that my GPA is decent (3.5)

I guess my question is: what should my next steps be? For context, I’m taking 2800 and 2110 next semester so I will eventually know *something* by the summer. I just don’t have that great of a resume in the meanwhile. I also think I’ll just be behind my peers who are engineering students with incredible GPAs and are actually majoring in CS.

I'm a new grad that recently scored a junior position with a pretty small startup. I'm due to begin in November, and just my luck after I signed and returned the offer letter I got contacted by a much larger, well-known company interested in me for a 2019 summer internship.

While my initial thought was to simply stay with the startup, given that the internship will be in the summer I'll be able to accrue some months experience as a junior SWE before leaving. I also know for a fact that the internship will pay better on an hrly basis than the startup but the internship would only be for 3 months.

If I end up quitting the junior position at the startup to go for the internship will that reflect badly on my resumé? I also would have to search for a second job after the internship but the job hunt would be easier due to having more experience right?"

When I graduated, I wanted to work in software development/engineering. I quickly realized that my programming skills weren't where they needed to be for this, as I felt I couldn't build anything substantial from scratch. To remedy this, I have gone through some online courses covering Java, Python, and Git. While I do feel I have learned from the time I've spent with these courses, I'm afraid that they were too guided and I'm still in a place where I haven't bridged the gap between knowledge and being able to build something from scratch, even If a company were to hire me for one of the aforementioned roles. I have one internship under my belt, a QA intern position in my junior year. However, because the team I was with was moving buildings and setting up new stations in this new facility, most of my time was spent doing physical work rather than getting testing experience. While I was in school I had hoped there would be more companies looking for fresh grads with minimal skills and experience wanting to train them, but I see now this was very wishful thinking. Recently I've been working through CTCI to some success, and have started building a connect four clone to try and bolster my skills in a way those aforementioned classes might not have been able to. I have a simple version of the game working(though my classes structure needs some work and my logic to check the diagonals for a winner are sort of hacky) and plan on adding a computer opponent and a GUI to transform the game from text based to graphics based. Unfortunately, these realizations have come late and being a year out of school I need work to pay the bills. Are there any jobs related to my degree that are less rigorous to get into at the entry level or are more lax on skill requirements and are willing to train?Something I could work my way to a developer/SWE role eventually? Please be brutally honest, I am open to any and all advice on where to go/how to proceed. I know I've made a mess for myself here and it's going to take a lot to work my way out of it."

I've applied to about 80 jobs online so far and went to career fair and handed my resume to 14 companies there. I have had about 5 companies give an interview from both online applications + career fair combined. My resume looks pretty decent I think and I've had 1 internship experience and 1 project worth talking about. I even sent my resume to the company I interned at and they haven't gotten back to me yet (although they are a bit slow I suppose).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of losing hope, I live in a mid-sized city (300k population) and there aren't much jobs here so I've been applying to nearby cities which are much much larger. Ideally I wanted to start working January (since I graduate in December)  but as each day goes by and I don't get a response to my resume, I'm starting to lose hope. There aren't much networking events in my town either.

I've been applying to only software engineering/developer jobs (entry level/junior) because I don't wanna go into a QA role or anything other than SWE.

&amp;#x200B;

The interviews I've had:

\- One company about a75 min drive away where I went past two phone interviews and then a third onsite interview with senior managers, didn't get the offer from there.

\- One consulting company which takes up software dev work for gov agencies, they're very small, had an interview with HR, and then the CTO, and they ghosted me after.

\-A staffing company for big banks - made it to the third round of interviews and went in-person, didn't get an offer from there either

\- Another company which was about ""Scientific software development"", didn't move me forward because they have a 3.5 GPA requirement

\- Big and well known corporation, stopped contact with me after HR interview

9p0jfn,4,2018-10-17,Final coop and onwards; what to do?,osapThrowA,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9p0jfn/final_coop_and_onwards_what_to_do/,"Like every other student, I've been looking to get a good coop placement that'll set me up for the future. Unfortunately, all my previous coop placement have been at unexceptional places; mainly just dev jobs at banks and other ""boring"" places. 

I was planning applying to all the big places for my final coop, but I fucked up and missed the deadline to for first round. It's more than likely that I'll still get a job, but it won't be places I originally had in mind; just another old ""boring"" place. Typical office environment with big gray cubicles or something. Not necessarily in the tech industry, just that they need tech people. 

It'll be my final coop and I'll be graduating the term after. The plan was to find a full time, ideally just piggybacking from my last coop place, but now I'm not so sure I want to do that. 

Once I do graduate, I'm not so sure that I'll be able to impress the places I want to work at with my qualifications. As a bit of background, I'm graduating from math, not cs (I didn't have the grades for it). I'll have worked a couple of dev jobs, but I'll be lacking in some cs knowledge. 

I'm trying to decide what to do and after giving it some thought and looking up information online, I've narrowed it down to 3 possibilities:


1. Just proceed as is. Graduate and then try to apply with what I already have. I'm not sure if this is enough to land me at places I want to go to, given that I wasn't able to get coops at them during all my years. 

2.  Delay graduation by a bit for more internship opportunities. They won't be coop placements as I won't be able to use school resources, but I'd do some searching on my own. I'd have to delay graduation to still be considered ""in school"" to qualify for these placements, but probably not by much. 

3. This one is probably the craziest of them and will require some explanation; graduate, then apply for a CS degree at another school that has the Dev Degree from Shopify. I'm not even sure if it's possible to do this, but assuming it is, it achieves a couple of things:

* It'll fill in those gaps in CS knowledge

* I'll have a little more work experience, and it'll be ""tech"" place

* It might position myself for full-time as well

The CS degree from that school certainly won't be worth all that much, but that probably the least valuable thing I'll be getting from that option. The down side is that it's the longest and most expensive option; even if I can transfer credits (would it even be possible to transfer credits from a degree after graduating?) it'll add at least 2 or so years before I finish. Would that be more valuable then 2 years of dev work at a ""boring"" place? And this is all assuming I would even be allowed/ accepted for the program, considering I'm not coming from high school and I've already finished a degree. On top of all of that, I might not even have the marks to get in (they're pretty bad)?

Which of these options make the most sense? I've still got some time to make a decision, but I should probably plan ahead."
9p0k4v,4,2018-10-17,What specific recourse do I have with this unjust situation with my employer?,PrimaryVoice,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9p0k4v/what_specific_recourse_do_i_have_with_this_unjust/,"This is in Indiana. For the past 2 years I've been working at a marketing company in my first ever career-specific job as a Web and Graphic Designer. This marketing company, is Christian and for profit. Started with two partners and is now one owner. All employees are Christian. Most unpaid interns are, but there are some exceptions.

At the start of my contract, things were fine, but within the first year my boss fired half the design staff. I was saved only because I had some skills they didn't possess. These employees were given no notice. They were permitted to show their work in their portfolio, and released from their non-compete.

Fast forward to this year, things got bad for me really quick. With low staff, and high turnover, I was left as the only one who could do web and other certain things. I was known as the ""fixer"" in the office, my employer praised my abilities, and it is because of this (and I believe latent discrimination about being atheist) that they started to dump on me.

I was given impossible tasks. I used to design 5 page websites in 2 weeks like the senior designers when I started. They started giving me 30-40 page websites with triple the content and less than two weeks to complete. I was given tasks that were IT and Networking related, despite having no experience at all here. I was a designer, not a developer. They wouldn't allow me to say the simple phrase ""I don't know"". They started giving me assignments that weren't even formed or ready and they counted that against my productivity. They even started throwing assignments my way were the clear responsibilities of other newer employees.

I communicated grievances, but was told to stop being so negative, ""having feelings"" and told to ""talk about it"". Every time I talked about it, I was chastised for not talking about it. It was a completely awful experience for me. With certain people, if I mentioned that something wasn't my department and attempted to (kindly) articulate a boundary I was dismissed and blatantly lied to. I was gaslit.

This all wore on me. I was overworked. There was no such thing as a internal complaint or conflict resolution process. And on top of this, people started organizing prayer. When things got really tense because problems were never addressed, my employer would call us together to say ""We're a family."" and ""God called us to do x"". It was clear they thought their own version of HR was God because every valid complaint was not taken seriously, I can't count the number of times I tried bettering my situation only to have my issues reduced to ""satan"" having control over my agency and causing my ""feelings"".

Work became a church. I was vocal about being staunchly against the christian perspective (for my life) but I was constantly proselytized by my superiors. Despite being my own department, I was not included in productivity meetings. There developed a work click where people started openly harassing me, which only added to the problems. One coworker would start an argument with me, that she decided I was the sociopath of the office and she was unrelenting about forcing me to accept her assessment. Despite me Kindly objecting, she continued and bandied the rest of the employees together in laughing about this blatant abuse.

The more stressed I got the more my health declined. I was diagnosed earlier this year as having ""silent migraines"" but it's now been confirmed that I actually have TBI from a past injury. The neurologists say there are two notable diagnosed deficiencies as a result of this injury. One is, my brain can't ""turn down"" sensory input which is a natural function of a healthy brain. This causes head pain and drunk symptoms. Another is, my brain can't turn off the sympathic nervous system. So stress stays until my therapy and rehabilitation can make a difference.

I've been vocal about these medical issues. They don't yet affect my work, but they affect my stress threshold. Increasingly, they're dismissed as annoying ""headaches"". In the office, we have a few people (all christian) with debilitating health issues. They work a fraction of their hours, are given gift basket when they seek medical help such as surgery, and all around they're fully supported in their health.

My employer said this of my ongoing medical issues after I reiterated the state of my brain, exact quote:

""No, Chelsea. There's nothing deficient with you. You need to speak words (pray) to this. My perspective, that's just satan telling you that and having a hold over you.""

I quit a few days ago in a fit of frustration and despair when there was a meeting where everyone dumped on me as being the problem. I can't be without a job, but I reached a breaking point. I'm actually scared shitless, because I don't have any family and it was difficult for me to find a job in my field. But, I boiled over.

Since then, I've gathered my things and had some closing email communication with my employer. Remember I said the last 3 people fired were all Christian, and were released of their non-compete and all permitted to show their design work in their portfolios? Well, my employer tells me I can't use anything. Yep. She tells me I'm not allowed to talk about working with any of the company's clients (there was no agreement anywhere signed to this affect), which includes pointing to a website and saying ""I designed this while at x company"".

She started processing the last paycheck, but completely neglected to reimburse me for paid time off—which was a clear guaranteed condition of the employment. It's stated on the contract. There's a lot I would be entitled to there, because I feared retaliation for taking the days I was entitled to, in the way of extra work or as ammo for their excuses offered up in light of my ongoing complaints, so I never did.

**I'm entitled to that paid time off, right?** It's a condition of the contract, it's a key bullet point of the job offer, there are no contract clauses that say that right is surrendered in any case.

**Can I file for unemployment?** I quit, but I was harassed so intensely, my job was becoming impossible, intolerable, and out of mine and even their expertise, and there was no complaint process for resolution—everything was deferred to me and ""satan"" and sometimes ""god"" despite my constant insistence that I do not and will never subscribed to those beliefs.

**Can I do anything about how I suffered and ultimately lost because this place began to run like a church?** This whole experience feels like the most unjust experience. It won't be easy for me to find another job already, and they've intentionally tried to make it more difficult to just me.

**Can I do anything about the retaliation with blocks and threats placed my work there as it relates to my ability to get a job?** In my field, if you can't demonstrate any work you did at a company, that experience doesn't measure up. By blocking me from showing work she blocks me from my field. Also before one of the partners of the company left and it came down to just one owner, that partner advised and instructed me on how I could use my work in my portfolio."

BSc and MSc under my belt. I find the job market tough going and can only get a few contracts. Maybe it's my ASD, maybe it's something else.

A few months back I did a 'talk', not an interview, for a few hours with a recruiting officer of a big company. We got along really well and he seemed honestly impressed. He said that if there were any open positions in the future there, he might offer me an interview.

A few months more pass, and at the start of last month, I get an internship. It's a good job and a nice environment, though I feel like I could be doing a lot more. While I'm an intern, there's an unspoken agreement that my contract will be extended. 

I think that's great; not only do I enjoy helping this company, but I figure I might be able to get a promotion here if I work for a year or so - or at least have enough experience to get over that bump that kills most graduate positions.

Skip to present day. A friend working there says that there are openings for a proper software engineer, and people should poke him if they're interested. I know I'd have a good time there, and while I might not get the job offer, that I have what it takes and could do a good interview. 

*But* I'm afraid that taking the time to interview, etc. could hurt my current position. Even more, if I did the interview and got the offer, I'm not 100% certain I'd accept it. Frankly, I'm an utter newbie when it comes to career choices like these in IT.

TL;DR Chance an interview with a big company for a real role, or stay with my internship for now without trying?

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I'd appreciate an opinion or a bit of insight"

Getting a 1050ti because of the price, planning on upgrading once I start my full-time job after graduating from college in May. The games I mainly play include CS:GO, Gmod, Civilization VI, XCOM 2, and Insurgency, all games that are not too terribly intensive. The most intensive games I plan on playing will probably be HITMAN 2 or DOOM 2.

All of my internships in college were with this company as well. The problem is, I have learned over the past year that I HATE OUTSIDE SALES. I put my resume together and have been applying to other jobs for a while now. From entry level positions that better compliment my major as an Industrial engineer, to applications engineering jobs within my current industry (HVAC). I got close to getting a job offer from a company after four rounds of interviews, however they ended up choosing the candidate with industry experience. The only things I hear back from people are rejections due to lack of relevant experience.

Out of naive loyalty, I told my managers how unhappy I am and asked for another role. They've made a job posting for my position but haven't given me any indication after a month of meetings if there is anything for me here. So I am losing accounts every week with no promise that I can even stay with the company in any capacity.

I am constantly reached out to by recruiters for sales positions. When I tell them I do not want a career in sales any more, they have nothing for me.

I am willing to take a pay cut. I'm a fast learner who's driven and has gained tremendous experience the past two years. Why is this proving so difficult??

9p1ru1,1,2018-10-17,"Misdiagnosed with Depression, Not Sure What to Do",leweeese,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9p1ru1/misdiagnosed_with_depression_not_sure_what_to_do/,"I'm writing this post because I'm lost and seeking medical help doesn't seem to be helping me. I'm at my last straw  and I know many of you have been there before. I also included a TL;DR: at the end of this post.

After putting it off for years, I finally went to the doctor to get help. I knew I had some sort of mental/behavioral issue going on but wasn't sure what. I've been through depression before in high school, but it went away with excercise when I did sports.

I started to suspect I had adult ADHD. When I looked into it more, everything in my life made sense. Doing bad in high school, I did community college. I managed community college ok (after retaking failed classes) by quitting my full time job and being fully commited to school. I was really organized (something that people with ADHD need) and I sat in the library for hours studying what my classmates could do in a fraction of the time. Despite the insanse amount of time I'd put in, I'd do ""ok"" with B's and high C's.

Didn't think much of it, until I transferred (miraculously) to a prestigious university in my state. Fast forward, and I'm doing horrible. I thought I had depression so I began doing rigourous excercise to combat it, and managed to lose 20-30 pounds of fat and put on muscle. I'd wake up early to be productive but still couldn't manage to get my school work done.

Reading self help books, I began to do what many of you guys call ""productivity porn"" where you feel like you are being productive, but in reality you're not. I'd do all my hw last min, which wasn't the best idea in my STEM field of study because it'd show on exams. This has put me on my last chance of probation before I'm kicked out of my department of study. When I did study, I couldn't for more than a few minutes before I'd get impatient unless it was right before an exam. I'm a senor.

Landing a prestigious internship in my field, I was **let go** because I *constantly* put off doing work, responding to emails, and ultimately failed to follow through when it was a work from home job. The weird thing is, I don't have an explanation for my extreme procrastination. I'd literally do *anything* to avoid doing school/internship work. I'd clean my place, cook food, impusively buy things, and get lost in youtube videos or anything else. I had that incurable ADHD 'itch' and would seek any stimulus aside from school work to itch it. The gym, videogames, movies, etc.

When I went to the doctor and told them everything, they told me I had depression and prescribed wellbutrin, trazedone, and clonidine. I'm surpised they could just prescribe me 3 medications like that after 20 min of talking to me without further looking into my concern of adult ADHD. I admit, I'm really dissapointed in myself for letting my symptoms get this out of control and not seeking help earlier, but I don't feel completely depressed.

I met with the doctor again after bumping up the wellbutrin to the max dose of 450 mg. It was helping with my low energy, but nothing else. I waited a few months for the follow up appointment with the doctor. He finally sent me to a psychiatrist who asked me a list of questions. I told him everything and told him its likely both my parents have ADHD. 

The psychiatrist said I likely have depression and that its causing ADHD symptoms which makes no sense to me. He's drug testing me every week for a month before he does an actual ADHD screening. During the screening he wants to call my mom (someone who knew me as a kid) to interview them about symptoms I had as a kid. After this, he will screen me and make the choice from there. 

My worry is my mom wasn't around me much as a kid so she won't give them accurate answers and my dad is in process of returning to his country. I wasn't diagnosed as a kid is because my family's culture strongly disagrees with medication.

I fear the psychiatrist is just going to wave me off as depressed and prescribe me antidepressants. Is this entire process for an ADHD screening normal? What do you guys suggest I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Doc likely misdiagnosed me with depression when I'm pretty sure I have adult ADHD (I've had depression before). Prescribed trazedone, wellbutrin, and clonidine. Waited a few months to be sent to a psychiatrist, psychiatrist said depression is likely causing ADHD symptoms. Have to do a drug test every week for a month before I get an actual ADHD screening. During the screening, they have to call a family member who can verify ADHD symptoms as a child. Is this normal? What should I do, wait another month?"

Tips?,Sonyeo2841,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9p2bvr/recently_graduated_from_university_having/,"I graduated with a degree in English Literature in March, but I continued to attend university to complete my teaching certificate. While I was in the process of completing my certificate, I came to a realization that teaching was never meant for me and my mental health has been suffering due to my teaching internship. So long story short I decided to quit the internship at the end of September and immediately started to find a job.

I didn't realize finding a job would be so difficult.

I've been applying to a lot of writing/editing jobs and I keep getting rejections. My friends and family have assured me that finding a job can take up to a year, but I keep feeling like I'm a failure even though it hasn't even been a month.

I am passionate about writing and don't want to give up on it, but there aren't many jobs in my state that I want to do that are related to writing and editing. The closest thing I can find is a job as a technical writer (which I am interested in), but I'm not familiar with the codes and don't have the experience as a technical writer. The only experience I have are the classes I took to get my degree, and my two work-study jobs (mostly office jobs) while I attended university.

I did think about working as a freelance writer while I get an actual job, but I'm a bit iffy about it since I'm not familiar with the freelancing field.

Does anyone have any tips that can help me? Or some reassuring words so that I know I'm not the only one stuck with this problem?"
9p2inf,10,2018-10-17,Sleep paralysis,Alcho_Duck,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9p2inf/sleep_paralysis/,"I'm a longtime suffere of sleep paralysis, which is basicly a full body paralysis that usually happens either when You're waking up or are falling asleep, it's anoying but never actually terrified me.. my dad told me when i was a kid, that he used to experience the same thing for many years, so theres nothing to worry about.. 

To explain a little further, usually it feels alot like being held down by an iron carpet, you can't move anything but your eyes, and your breath is labored, like something is pushing against you.. 

Something allways bothered me about it though, it always felt... Unsafe? I have read a ton of articles and studies about it, and there should be nothing to worry about.. but something just feels off..

Anyways, a couple of weeks ago i was out drinking with a few friends, and we kind of merged with another group who was out celebrating.. some kind of raise? Maybe a new job? I don't remember.. we ended up at a quiet pub and started talking, and for some reason the topic landed on sleep paralysis, aparently one of the girls was an intern at a sleep analysation center in the local hospital.. intruiged about my experiences she began asking questions, i happily obliged, since this girl was rather cute. 

So, she told me there's actually alot of folklore world wide about this, (which i was aware of) but she told me something i didn't know.. aparently the word ""Nightmare"" originated here in Denmark (or maybe in norway, since the use the same word) in danish ""nightmare"" is ""Mareridt"" which roughly translate into ""Ridden by a mare"" A mare is an old pagan demon who would come at night and ride the chest of a sleeping man, squezing the air out of his chest. (aparently women are rarely affected by it?) According to the legend, they are spawned from either stillborn female babies, or virgins who has died a tragic death.. they are seen as a beautiful woman with dark hair, ghoulish white skin, and black eyes.. 

Besides the feeling of being unsafe i've never seen anything close to that, maybe a few shadows in the night but never beem worried about it, we continue to talk for abit and she asks me if i wanted to come by the sleep lab and let her analyse me, and ofcourse i agree..  

Then i went home and straight to bed, i was kinda drunk and it was late so i practicly blacked out.. i usually experience the paralysis when i go to sleep, so it was a good thing..

Since thay night though my sleep has been very troubled, a few night after our night out, the paralysis got worse.. alot worse.. everynight before going to sleep i would feel it set in, followed by that feeling of being unsafe, but i also began feeling like someone was watching me, i would hear foot steps in the hall leading to my bedroom, deep breaths close to my ear before falling asleep..

The other night was the worst.. i got into bed about to fall asleep when i felt it set in, my whole body stopped responding, my eyes was still open.. i felt a breeze run down my neck and over my shoulder and i turned my eyes as far left as possible.. that was when i saw a white hand on my shoulder, and i felt my body tilt to the left, my breathing began to feel labored and then everything went dark.. the rest of the night was a blur, i know i dreamed something, and i'm sure it was bad.. i keep seing these flashes of a flowing black on a white contrast.. 

I called up sofie (the girl from the bar) earlier today and set up a time at the sleep lab in a few days..

I don't know what i should do until then, i must admit i'm scared to find out what happened last night.. i'm not supersticious at all, my fear is irrationale.. but still it all feels so real.. 

anyone dealt with anything simulair? Could really use some advice..

9p322m,1,2018-10-17,My (22M) girlfriend (20F) broke up after nearly four years right after we moved in together... Not sure how to move on...,Maybe_Joel,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9p322m/my_22m_girlfriend_20f_broke_up_after_nearly_four/,"I'll try to make this short but I apologize if I become too detail-oriented, sometimes I tend to do that.

When I was a senior in high school, I finally got to know a girl named Katie a little better, before she was just an acquaintance. She was a year younger than me so we never really shared classes or anything. But we quickly starting going on dates and we became very close, very quickly. We started our relationship on Feb. 14th 2015 (cheesy, I know.)

We did everything together. I even grew very close to her parents and they would have me over their house quite often for dinner. She was an only child so I guess her parents really loved having someone else in the house. Anyway, I became part of their family pretty quickly.

Fast forward till when I graduated from high school, my parents wanted to send me to a university but the money just wasn't there at the time. So I went to my local community college. No big deal, it was nice to be close to home to hang out with Katie.

A year from then, when she was deciding on a college to attend, she was thinking of going to a university near our city or somewhere about 3 hours away. It was a hard decision, but she chose the far school. I remember being stressed out because I was worried about long-distance. But when she toured the school, I went with her, and I really enjoyed it. I ended up transferring there with her so we could stay together. My parents were doing much better financially at this point so thankfully it was possible.

For the past two years at college, we've spent nearly all of our free time together. Of course we have the occasional spat, but who doesn't? Even though we had separate dorms, we basically lived together because we were always in each others' rooms. We were best friends and really, everything was amazing. She's pretty smart, so to save money, she planned to graduate in three years so we'd end up graduating at the same time. We planned to spend our senior year living together and we couldn't be more excited. We planned on renting a house with one of her friends so we could split the rent three-ways. Ironically, she really wanted to share a room, which I said no to because we were young and we need space. It ended up being a fight but she eventually gave in.

At the end of our junior year, last year, she planned to study abroad in Peru for the summer. I was really excited for her and I knew it'd be a great experience. When she left, however, I definitely didn't do well. I just felt very depressed and it was hard because I knew I missed her a ton and it felt like she was too busy having the time of her life to think about me (not that I blame her.)

Two months later when she got back, I was overjoyed. We spent the rest of the summer together, mostly me over her house hanging out with her and her parents. It was great. But then one day, she randomly mentioned she wanted to go to Peru for an internship for 6 months after she graduates. It was shocking, but I was okay with it and I told her I was willing to be patient for her. A few days from then, she started to get very distant and it was definitely confusing. When I was finally able to get some answers, she said how she's ""scared that I'm the only person she's really dated"" and similar stuff. It was hard to hear, but I told her we should figure this out before we move in so it's not a disaster. She agreed and told me she loved me, wanted a future with me, and that we'd figure it out. I know guys in Peru were all over her, but I didn't think the attention would matter that much. But whatever. I tried my best to push past it.

After we moved in, things were good for a little while until the same thing happened again. She started to get distant to the point where she said me touching her made her ""extremely uncomfortable."" It was hard to hear but I just felt bad for her because I was worried about her mental health. I told her I was willing to be patient with her until we could figure things out. Eventually though, she said she wanted to take a break. We tried that, it was awkward. She then came back and said how she still loved me and didn't want to be distant. So we tried being back together, but things didn't change. The distance was still there.

We broke up on Oct. 1st, a week after stopping the break. She told me ""she loves me but she needs these experiences (dating other guys) before she can settle down and that right now she wants to be alone to 'find herself.'

At first, I was just in shock so I didn't know what to say. But for the next week and half, I couldn't help myself around her and I would just beg and plead for her to come back and ask her questions like ""Why do you want to break up?"" ""How can you stop loving me?"" I honestly just felt pathetic the whole time but I was suffering a lot and I just can't understand her reasons. Every time I approached her, she would put up a wall and came off as very cold. It was hard to witness because I felt like she was now just a complete stranger.

Last Thursday, I lost it and I needed an answer. We talked for a while and she was finally empathetic and showed some emotion when we talked. It helped me see that she's in pain too and that I just need to let her be free. It helped me understand a little better and I tried my best to accept it. I even woke up Friday feeling pretty good. But Friday evening, she mentioned she was going out with a ""friend"" and it was very clear that she was lying. After she got dressed nicely to head out, I sat down with her and told her ""Thanks again for opening up to be yesterday and leveling with me. It helped a lot and I want to learn to be okay with just being your friend. Hell, maybe in the future whenever you do go on a date, I think I'll be comfortable hearing about it so I can check up on you if you're gone for a really long time.""

She said ""Oh, are you sure you'd be comfortable with hearing that? In that case, I'm going on a date tonight.""

I was just in shock because I didn't know what to say. She'd apparently made a tinder only a week after we broke-up and she's already getting ready to date new people. I didn't know how to react so I just told her ""have a good time I guess"" and then she went outside and got in his car, and she was off, just like that.

I felt like total shit and my other roommate was gone so I was just alone for the night. After a few hours, I tried to be productive and and clean my room. When breaking down a cardboard box, I couldn't find my scissors. ""Oh, I know Katie has some."" I went into her room, and with no intention of snooping, I went through her desk drawers and found an empty 3-pack of condoms. It freaked me out and I didn't know what to do. It just hurt so much.

When she got home, I tried my best to be nice and ask about the date normally. I then mentioned how I had no intention of snooping, but I found the box. I just asked her if she was okay because I was worried about her. She assured me she was. I asked if it was just about sex, and she said no, that ""she always enjoyed having sex with me.""

We couldn't come to a conclusion so we just went to bed. I couldn't sleep at all. Maybe got two hours of sleep. I called my mom in the morning and she just said to come home for the weekend, which I did. I ended up posting on facebook asking ""Friends at school, is anyone in need of a roommate?""

She sent me a text saying ""Look, if you wanna move out, that's fine, I'm just trying to find my happiness."" I got upset and wrote a long text telling her how she was selfish and that she is completely inconsiderate of my feelings and that she only cares about making herself happy. Like, you couldn't give me at least a month to calm down before you started dating again? And did our relationship seriously mean that little to you?

She then responded with a few long texts apologizing saying ""I fucked up I'm sorry"" and ""you're my best friend and I can't imagine you not being in my life"" and stuff like that.

I got back on Monday and we talked a little bit, but I still just feel like shit. She told me she deleted tinder and that she's willing to give me time to heal. I'm able to forgive her but I can't let her go. I still love her so much. I had no doubt that I was going to marry this girl. It's so hard to see her and know I'll never be able to touch her again and that she would rather hop in bed with some random dude. I don't know if I can live here any longer but I don't have anywhere else to go at the moment.

Sorry for the long post. Probably way too long. I'm just so lost and I don't know how to move on. Can anyone offer some advice?

TLDR; Girlfriend and I dated for nearly four years, moved in together, and then she dumps me. A week afterward, she makes a tinder and buys condoms and starts going on dates. I'm stuck and I don't know how to move on...."

\- Apply for Software Engineering entry level positions. The problem is that I don't have the background in Computer Science. I could start learning Frontend/Backend since these jobs are very demanded but I don't know how long would it take to me until I could be competent to pass an interview

\- Apply for Analyst or Consultant roles. These positions don't really require programming skills. If I get a job in this field, I could continue working on side projects for Data Science on my own and try to move to Data Science in the company or change search for junior positions

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I will get a position in the 3 weeks I have left, so once I finish the internship I decided to dedicate my full time to continue applying for jobs and to working on side projects. I was thinking about learning Javascript, or improving SQL and Excel since they are too in high demand. As you can see, I don't have a clear focus on what do I want to do.

I am searching for jobs in UK, but I have freedom to move anywhere so I thought about applying to other parts of Europe as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you give me any advice for my situation? I would prefer not to do an internship since I have already done 2 of them. Thank you very much!"

I’m about 5 months into a 12 month cap (I did not get this internship through a school career center). I want to leave for several reasons.

1) not learning anything - I’m doing technical work, but not software engineering related for the past several months

2) while embedded system development is interesting. It’s not directly what I want to do with my career. (Maybe this would change when I’m no longer an intern and get more in depth experience) 

I recently got a call for an interview with a company more in line with what I want to do (Web dev, mobile apps, desktop applications, etc), and it’s also a company I’ve wanted to work for, for a while, and possibly have a career there. 

In the scenario they extend an internship offer to me. Is it deeply frowned upon to quit my current internship? Would I be burning bridges?

I already speak incredibly quickly in my normal life and being nervous doesn’t help. That speed leads to stuttering and fumbling and then I look unconfident and like an all around nervous wreck. 

This is a government job that is a golden ticket opportunity for the career path I plan on following in the future and I really don’t want to mess it up.

I'll have 5 CS courses under my belt by the end of the semester and so far I've gotten good grades in all of them.  I enjoy coding and have experience with frontend and backend software design as well as a basic understanding of many of the tools used in large-scale projects (Maven, Git, Spark servers, SQL databases, JS, CSS, websockets, and various Java/Python libraries useful in backend development) from a software engineering course I took, which included a fairly large-scale (as large a scale as is reasonable for a one-semester course) and open-ended group project as the final.  However, I've never really had any inspiration to work on an independent project.  It seems unlikely I'll get any internships with nothing other than coursework in my github, but I've just never had any idea of what sorts of projects I'd like to work on.  For those of you who do spend a lot of time on independent projects, where did you get your ideas and how would you recommend getting started with personal projects?  A lot of my peers seem to code in their leisure time, and while I enjoy my coursework and think I'm pretty good at it, it's never been an activity I've ever focused much of my free time on.

As a side note, I'm not all that interested in software as a career path (most likely academia for either CS or Philosophy, I'm more interested in the theoretical parts of CS as I've really enjoyed a Logic for Systems course and a PL course).  However, I realize that coursework can only go so far to approximate what real software development is like, and even if I don't go into industry I'll still need to have built up a skillset that can't requires experience on real, large-scale projects which seems like it could only come from side projects or internships.

I guess my question is sort of open-ended, so any advice or discussion is welcome.  Thank you!"

I recently scored an internship with one of the big four accounting firms as a tech consultant and was super relieved as I hadn’t heard back from anywhere else I had applied to.

That is until I get an email from Google saying they want to start my interview process. I’d much rather have an internship there than an accounting firm but am nervous that the process might take longer than the time I have to give the firm a yes or no. Figured it’d work out in the end and notified my recruiter about the competing deadline.

Then today I got an email from Facebook saying they wanted to set up an interview in about two weeks time. It dawned on me that maybe I hadn’t gotten rejected from all the tech companies I applied to like I had initially thought, but rather they just hired their interns later than accounting firms. So I’m kind of caught at a crossroads.

The accounting firm internship pays 39 dollars an hour plus pay and half for any overtime, and would be a fantastic resume booster. Plus it’s definite, unlike the other companies I’ve been approached by, which I’m still just interviewing with.

So reddit should I take the gamble and hope to land an internship at a big tech company or if I don’t get another offer by November 1st(the accounting firms deadline), should I just accept the original internship?"

I bother the lead dev 1-3 times a day with questions. But the good thing is it takes us both 1-2 hours to solve them sometimes which means it wasn't something easy and it was probably worth the time.

Either you went to a target school and got recruited in college or you decided on IB early on in college and had the experience to get these IB internships before graduating. The summer IB analyst internships seem like the only way to break into IB at a BB

I have a pending interview for a technology(analyst or engineer) internship at a BB for next summer.  I have 2 Questions:

1.) Would a back office role like this at a respected BB allow me a chance to ever break into investment banking in the future? What sorts of things would I need to do since I wouldn't be able to join IB through the main ""feeder"" programs like the summer IB internships?

2.) What's your Opinion on Tech careers at Bloomberg v. Goldman v. JP Morgan? For instance, would you take a high salary internship at Bloomberg or a lower salary role at Goldman which might have better name reputation (Please don't just say working in tech at a BB is all the same. I'm sure some BB's are better in tech and exit opportunities than others).

Finding people interested in DevOps that are actually good at it is becoming a nightmare of mine, as there seem to be very little offer and of mediocre quality, at least in Italy.

So I was wondering, what am I doing wrong? Here what I tried so far:

\- published vacancy looking for DevOps Engineers, advertised on major platforms, both in English and Italian (think LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, plus some national platform).

\- advertised on universities boards, both as full-time and internships (as to not discourage people with basic skills but lots of potential).

I'm also going to do some active search on LinkedIn, but before proceeding I wanted to double check I'm doing everything right.

\*\* My question is: 

\- is there any forum / board / slack channel where DevOps hide that I should know about in order to advertise the vacancy? \[other than /r/devopsjobs**,** which I'm hitting next :) \]

\- is the title I'm using even appropriate, or should I also try something along the lines of Cloud Engineer or Server &amp; Infrastructure?

Is there anything else I can do right now to help myself with this position?  Currently this is my top choice for summer employment, and I would like to better my chances of getting this position without being thoroughly annoying.

I believe I remember the recruiter saying that they start hiring in March, so it might just be early, but I would like to do anything to let them know I am still interested in the position!


Thank you in advance!"

I'm looking to apply for a few internship positions at big companies.

After I finished high school, I spent a semester pursuing a civil engineering degree, then switched to physics when that didn't work out. The year after, I spent a year doing a high school level technical education. Then I spent 3 semesters studying game design in college which I had to give up because I didn't manage to pass the art classes.

After all that, I moved to a different country (where I live now), worked in a preschool for a while before finally landing an apprenticeship as a software developer. I finished that four year (high school level) education in three years. Since then, I have been working as a part time software developer for the company I did my apprenticeship at and pursuing my CS degree full time.

I regret that it took me so long to find my way and frankly, I don't have a good explanation for it. I had a lot of opportunities and I squandered them all. However, I am I've grown as a person since, as is evidenced by the excellent grades I've been getting ever since I've restarted my education.

As I mentioned in the title, my question is: what (if anything) should I write about that time in my life in my résumé?"

I am currently applying for IB in different major firms for a 3/6 months internship (Off-Cycle, to be precise).

I want to prepare for the upcoming application process, especially interviews and assessment centres. My case is pretty particular as I come from a **Computer Science** background (BSc. Hons from a quite well-know UK uni), and want to start digging into what I will be asked during the selection process, in terms of financial/ IB knowledge. From what I've seen, it's framed around Accounting and Global Markets, and just the current situation on the markets.

**Do you recommend any sources -books, online courses, lectures- that could**

* help me catch up on all of the financial knowledge I want to incorporate, **or**
* help me prepare for the IB selection process as a whole

to give me a shot at theses internships ?"

I want to apply for Masters program in UC Berkley, NYU, UofMichigan and Carnegie Mellon University. I don't think I qualify for any of these Universities. I'll also need some financial support or a scholarship.

My GRE is on 11th of December, 2018. 

I don't think I even qualify the minimum requirements. 

My grades in Mathematics courses are all Bs (3.0) and in CS Related courses, they vary from C to B+. Mostly C+(2.5) and Bs(3.0).   
I have done two internships, one in a university lab and the other in Teradata(Multinational Company for Providing Database and Analytics related solutions). I also held a Research Assistant Position for 8 months (Work Related to Speech Recognition).  

By the end of this year or in January 2019. I'll have a publication related to Conversational Agents and by the end of my Final year (May, 2019), I'll have publication(s) related to my Final Year Project (R&amp;D) which is Online Privacy Protection using Generative Adversarial Networks.

&amp;#x200B;

My Question is should I even bother applying to these universities as I don't meet the minimum requirements or should I apply? Or should I wait for a year or two and get some job experience and they apply? (I really want to apply this year and start my masters by next because I want to become Research Scientist and). "

(Relevant because they are what caused me to lose motivation. I'm feeling like the only reason to go to school is to get a job, and since I have one already school is becoming a drag and pointless.)  Including my current semester, I still have 3 semesters left of school left. I'm losing motivation to do well in my current classes, especially one about processors, assembly, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have any advice? I feel like this class is taught very poorly (there are three instructors and they alternate every few weeks), it's uninteresting, and the fact that I feel the material from this class will be completely forgotten and useless to me in the future are the three main reasons why I am feeling this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps, not every class is meant to be enjoyable?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Many people have gotten the idea that I was considering on dropping out. I would not go that route unless I started a very successful company. I'm more tempted to just major in data science to take fewer CS classes or do worse in some of my current classes.

Edit 2: I've never actually posted on reddit for advice because I didn't think I would get anything useful, but I'm glad I did because my motivation has now been spurred. Thanks all!"

I haven't ever got a job in the traditional sense, i've done freelance housework and stuff over summers, but never had to apply for anything so I'm clueless in that regard, but I've also never even tried to apply for anything CMPS related, internships or not. 

I figure it's about time for me to stop procrastinating and figure out what I want to do, and get an internship for the coming summer or something.

However, I still haven't gotten into any concentration classes or even decided on any of that, and I feel like without any experience i'm not really sure what I'd even want to do. 

I've kind of eliminated Computer engineering related stuff, because let's just say the one class I took in that had me forever hating breadboards ;p. 

As for information systems, data entry I guess satisfies the OCD part of my brain, but otherwise it's not really something i find that interesting.

So I guess I want to at least do something on the coding side of things, but I really have no ideas what that could entail. I don't think I'd be one to enjoy something that gets too repetitious, but like where do I even start there's so many options.

I even thought about doing something working at game related programming, but I only have limited experience working with any game creation software and so I wonder if I would enjoy that, since just because I enjoy playing games obviously doesn't mean I'd enjoy making them. (not that I wouldn't I suppose)

I guess I just feel like I lack experience of what really any CMPS related job would be like, and it's not that I don't enjoy coding, infact, I've learned to appreciate it and enjoy it more recently after I got over the hurdle of being frustrated with my inability to find silly mistakes(the amount of times I call the wrong variable in a place or have a 1 off error is suprising...) and realized that i'm still learning. 

So, to not make this too wordy, tl;dr, I want to get an internship/job in CMPS or something related I can get with a CMPS BA, but I'm not entirely sure where to start, help appreciated!

*The Setting:*

An Industrial Printing Company, serving about 200 users across 5 buildings and around 450 computer things all networked together.  IT team of 4.5 (including the intern.)

&amp;#x200B;

*The Cast:*

$me - me! Cultvignette!  Network Manager for the IT dept.  All three of us under the SysAdmin share the same title.  We have different areas of expertise.  My specialty among the network managers is ""been there the longest.""

$Logs - Our trusted SysAdmin, a career electrician by trade and avid outdoors-man.  Loves chopping wood and reading system error logs.

$Pepper - Fellow Network Manager, always has a stash of carbonation in her desk with at least 23 flavors per can.

$Link - Fellow Network Manager, avid gamer, Triforce tattoo.

$Rec - Receiving dock worker that appreciates a clean work space.

$AVP - Accounting VP.

$AP - Various accountants and purchasing data fillers.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Event:*

Over the past year we just finished a new building on our campus, which allowed us to spread out.  Since then, every department has taken their turn uprooting all their desks to the greener side while IT furiously makes sure all lines are run and ends are capped.  This week, we just finished moving everyone from Purchasing across campus in a flurry.  Everything went smoothly.

Cut to last evening, and $Logs get a call at dinner that a QA remotely working cannot access their email.  $Logs dutifully remotes in, restarts exchange, confirms its working and calls it a night.

This morning, $AVP calls bright and early to report the same thing.

I get to work half an hour after waking up, finally recovering from the local pass of the flu, and find $Logs computer on, unlocked, and no $Logs present at his desk.  Odd...  He usually strolls in just a few minutes after I do.  Just so happens today is the day the window in my office is getting replaced, so my desk isn't even connected to the wall.  My office looks like it was just hit by a truck, and will for a couple hours.

Lovely.

On my way to get coffee I check in with $Pepper in the neighboring office.

$me: ""Morning $Pepper, what's up?""

$Pepper: ""Absolute chaos.  $Logs has been here for hours freaking out about our fiber in the new building.  I think he is in one of the server closets.""

I happen to glance at her screen, and our Hyper-V monitor is all red.  Everything is offline.  Panic level rises about 3 pips.  I cannot even process this yet, I can't access my computer right now, and there is only one set of keys to the server closets and $Logs has them.  I get some coffee.

By the time I get back there are already various $APs asking when they can start using email, when they can start making phone calls, ~~and when they can start playing candy crush~~.  I help hold back the horde with $Pepper for a few moments when I see $Logs sprinting down the hallway to his office.  We briefly make eye contact, and he has that look, you know the look..  its the look that people in IT networking and people who diffuse bombs share.  That cannot be good.  Before I can find out what he has done so I can jump in, a que has formed outside of $Pepper's office.

$AP: ""something something email is important.""

$AP: ""something something we need our phones.""

$AP: ""something something send my team home?""

$AVP: ""something something time estimate?""

So $Pepper and I keep answering these types of questions for a while.  Once it dies down, $Logs has disappeared again, and my computer is still not accessible, so $Pepper and I start shooting at the basics.

$Pepper: ""$Logs was able to get our OWA working, and our door systems still work, but so far nothing internal is connecting.""

$me: ""Can you ping our default gateway?""

$Pepper attempts this with no result.  What the?!

While we are troubleshooting, $Rec walks in to the office and proudly proclaims:

$Rec: ""It was my fault!  I did it!""  \*wink and a smile\*

$me and $Pepper: *hu bu wha?*

$Rec:  ""I'm just kidding, haha.  When everyone was moving around I rearranged my desk.  I only moved my phone around and I think I got everything plugged back in, but I wasn't sure, then I heard everything was down and just wanted to make sure you knew.""

$Pepper: ""Oh we're sure that's not it..  something took out our router.""

$me: ""Ya maybe someone hit the fiber connecting to the new building.  We're checking it out.  Don't worry about it!""

$Rec seems much calmer after this and leaves.

After a few more head scratches and systems checks our system comes up and goes down in random ways.  First, phones work.  Then they suddenly don't.  Then email comes back.  Then it leaves us again.  This is becoming much more confusing.

At this point, $Logs catches up with us in a huff.

$Logs: ""Ok, I have replaced the G-bix connections on the back of 4 of our switches, changed the pairs out on the fiber leading to the new building, reset the switches, the router, and the servers hosting our VMs.  So far...nothing.  Some systems come back, and some don't, and those that come back lock up or shut down again.  I think it's Swith B in our main closet.""

$me: ""Well, shit.  We have a spare we could swap in, right?""

$Logs: ""We do, but it isn't PoE.  We'd have to rewire everyone's desk in two buildings, with power.""

While we let the gravity of that settle in, $Logs goes back to his desk to further troubleshoot.  We start going into the realm of ""what if someone hacked us"" tin foil hatting before I'm called away to fix a printer.  Of course there is a printer that is still working, and of course it is broken, because printer.

After clearing the offending paper jam on the local usb printer, I return and $Logs has started an impromptu meeting with $Pepper in her office.  $Link shows up by now in time for his shift, and the team is assembled.

$Logs: ""So, I've checked and rechecked every connection.  I've got our systems up and running, and I've isolated the first floor of the new building.  We weren't hacked or anything.  The router and the switches here are fine.  Best I can figure, it's some kind of network storm bringing down the network.  Every time Switch C in the new building connects, systems start coming down.  I want you three to double check all the desk moves we did the last couple days and make sure everything was plugged in right.""

Uh no.  It clicks, and I suddenly know exactly what the problem is.  $Pepper and I exchange a knowing glance, a nod, and I take off sprinting to the new building's receiving area.  I pass $AVP in the parking lot on her way to have a smoke, mid question upon seeing me.  My speed halts her inquiry.  It was super effective!

I reach the receiving dock and find a small 8 port switch connecting the workstation's computer, phone, and multiple printers together.  It is very clean and organized, except for the two cords coming from the phone and back into the switch.  $Pepper catches up to me by now and with both of us under the desk, we rip out all the connections and trace every line back to where it should go.

We report to $Logs, who, always the skeptic, has $Link and myself double check every office and workstation in the new building, eyes on to make sure it is all connected the way it should be.  In our search we find nothing else has been touched, including all the recent desk moves.

$Logs throws the switch and puts the building back online with the rest of our network.  Everything comes back online as it should as if nothing happened, all servers quietly chirping about their business.

I'm making this post because I'm pretty much fresh out of college, in my first big job, and moving into my first place. To say my world has turned upside down in the last 6 months would be quite an understatement. Due to this, as well as some anxiety and introspection issues I deal with daily, I've come across a lot of feelings that I'm lost in my own little corner of the world, and that moving forward with any momentum is a big risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started learning web development related stuff halfway through college, landed some internships, got really good grades and accolades, and ended up landing a competitive internship that resulted in a job. I'm currently a front end developer, though I guess my role really is more of a junior front end role, and I semi-specialize with Angular. Being the position I'm in, surrounded by incredibly talented and knowledgeable developers and engineers, the imposter syndrome really has spiked with me. I've gotten it mainly under control, but still a bit of it lingers due to my inability to really gauge my progress.

&amp;#x200B;

My job means the world to me, and losing it would literally mean being unable to pay rent after a few months and life falling apart. Not even a place I want to start thinking about. I feel both that I've made substantial progress since I started (began picking up more complex work, reviewing others' pull requests, being involved in sprint events, and taking up points / hours not that much lower than other developers on the team), but at the same time I do frequently feel lost or uncertain of myself, my ideas, my strategies, and my place. It makes it feel like at any moment I could be, for lack of better words, up shit creek without a paddle. It has made moving into my own place into a fit of anxiety and stress, though I am still pretty excited. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure some amount of this is more on the mental health side than the actual career side, but I want to gather thoughts from other people that may have been in a similar position. How can I gain confidence in my skills, my value to my workplace / team, and my financial footing so that I can move through life without constantly worrying about that 'what if's?"
9petge,49,2018-10-18,Convocation Campaign,elmoosetache,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/9petge/convocation_campaign/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student in computer science (lol, yes, I know that's played out enough on this subreddit). I'm not sure how many of you have heard, but there is currently a campaign to get an option for cs to graduate together. I'm going to give a little spiel about the campaign. Even if you don't really care, please share it with others if you think they might care or wish to hear about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The campaign is called **Let CS Graduate Together! - ₚₗₑₐₛₑ**

Currently, there is a review board (a part of the Office of the Governing Council) going through all the convocations at UofT. This happens rarely, and they are considering everyone's thoughts on everything related to graduation. Some upper year students in CS banded together and started a campaign that I too eventually joined and support. *To try and convince the board that students in computer science should be offered the option to graduate together as a class, much like Rotman Commerce students do.* We are simply campaigning for the students in CS to have the option to do so, not be forcibly part of something they do not want to be. Ideally people could graduate with fellow CS students or with their college. There are many reasons we would love to be able to have this option and I will go through some them.

&amp;#x200B;

* A lot of students in CS (I don't think I can say most because I don't have the specific number) participate in Professional Experience Year (PEY) after second or third year. This involves taking a year off for an internship. So we end up graduating a year later when we come back, technically in our college, but with a younger (unfamiliar) year, and often without any people we know from CS. 
* We pay thousands of dollars in deregulated fees. While the thousands of dollars that we pay more than other students serve a purpose and are not necessarily a reason we should *afford* our own convocation, they certainly support the argument that we are a unique community with important distinctions, and it may be a healthy move for students to be able to acknowledge our common VESTED interest by graduating together.
* We have 24 hour access to BAHEN, where we stay up late, code for DAAAAYZ, and even more so, form strong, and integrally cs material related bonds with our friends.
* CS POSt is super difficult to get into. I know there are probably harder POSts to get into out there, but this past year the cutoff grades were 83% and 86%, in courses that are extremely difficult like CSC165. I knew at least for myself, there was a constant stress because I knew literally missing a question on a problem set could be the difference, and I still know people who didn't make it by less than a percent! This common hardship should be respected, and further bonds us.
* Lastly, at least for my own reasons to support this campaign, is the grinddd. This program is integrally linked to internships, work, and hackathons. We are always spending crazy amounts of time outside of class working on CS sideprojects, meeting people, and getting to work. We all talk to each other about technical interviews, workplace culture etc. I know this is probably true for a lot of other majors as well, but if you know a CS student or an engineer, then you probably know that for us its almost like we are in a massive sports team all the time.

I just came off my internship at AMD where I had a great time. It seems they liked me too, because they are extending a return offer to me in the main Santa Clara office (even though I was working at a satellite office). I am very grateful for the opportunity, but don't think AMD would be my top choice.

Short reasoning: I took the AMD internship mainly to get a view into the hardware world. I enjoyed what I saw, but it also showed me that I would likely like software more. Additionally, to me, I would rather have more of a design role in a company. I was in a ""timing closure/synthesis"" team at AMD and am not sure what kind of growth I would have in such a role. Are these reasons silly/shortsighted?

The problem is, I have not yet secured other options and AMD is beginning to process my return-offer (could be finalized in two weeks). I have already been rejected by two of the big 4 and a few start-ups, but have a few more interviews in the pipeline.

What should my play here be? It is likely AMD will want a response before I can have options to weight it against. Is it unethical to accept the offer knowing I may very well turn it down later? Do you think I should just go with the offer (it is in silicon valley after all)? The bottom line is I'd hate to be kicking myself in 8 months if I turn down the offer and don't get any other opportunities (my parents would be kicking me too, haha).

Thanks!"

My experiences are java, C, python, html, css, php and some Java script. I want to be backend Dev. I tried front end but I didn't like it. I like working with algorithms and love to code in Java. I am planning to look for a summer internship as a backend intern or a software engineer intern. 

Recently some of my friends started looking for front end developer internships and their experiences scare me. They told me that they felt very dumb at the job interviews, all other people who they were competing with were elites from better Universities. 

I am also worried abt this problem now. I am wondering if there any tips like what skills can I learn to upgrade myself or what kind of things companies look for in new interns etc.

My front end skills are html css3, php and java script. I have only dabbled a bit in php and java script but am able to use basic concepts in them. 

My back end skills are java, c and python. I know OOP in Java and have finished my University's java courses. 

So guys my question is, are there any tips and advice for me to so that it can help me land a internship. Any help is appreciated.  Thank You."

I have narrowed my interests down to working in either hardware design, embedded system development, or something similar. I have 2 internship experiences and have an offer waiting for another one this coming summer. One of them was at a chemical plant doing Electrical and Instrumentation where I realized that is not the type of work I would like to be doing. The other one is in robotics and I loved this one. I got to design hardware and software for autonomous robotic vehicles and l really enjoyed doing this. My upcoming internship is at a large company doing hardware design.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how important is my first job after graduation in terms of not pigeonholing myself into a job specialization that I am not fond of? I ask this because my girlfriend graduates in May and is likely taking a good job offer in Memphis, TN. I plan to follow her after graduation and that means I should probably start looking for jobs in Memphis during Spring '19 semester. From my light research, there doesn't seem to be too many opportunities for hardware design or embedded system design in Memphis. So, I may have to settle for another type of job that wouldn't be my favorite. I plan to marry this girl and it doesn't seem like she wants to settle down in Memphis forever, so I think we would both hold our initial jobs for a few years then maybe wait until I can find something else in another location.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have multiple internships, research experience, am a coauthor on an academic paper, have a good GPA, and am team leader for senior design so I am confident that my qualifications are pretty good for most entry level positions. But, I am concerned with the transition from my first real job, which I suspect will not be in hardware design or embedded systems, to something I am more fond of. Will it be possible to switch to a different specialty later down the line if I take, lets say, a role as an E&amp;I engineer at a plant like my internship was? How difficult will this be? Am I just overthinking things and should wait until the time comes to start worrying about this? Are there any companies I should look out for in the Memphis area that may have a role that suits my desired job?

Or improve my portfolio for UI/UX design internships?,lamey-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9phbi3/should_i_focus_on_improving_and_building_my_tech/,"Hi everyone, finally decided to stop lurking this sub and post here! I'm currently in my third year of computer science at a big state college with a pretty decent computer science department. A couple months back I started learning more about what UI/UX is and found that this would be a much more fulfilling career field for myself than SWE. Now don't get me wrong, I still enjoy coding to some extent. But personally, I don't think I'm a great programmer - I'm very average at best. My main interest in programming is front-end development, but unfortunately I haven't been able to make any time to just sit down and grind out a side project, or even a portfolio website. I wanted to build something this past summer, but working 40 hours a week and taking an online class was just too much for me to handle during that time. This semester is also pretty stressful as well, what with my classes and the clubs I help organize.   


I've been applying to both SWE and UX internships for the past few months. I've had three interviews for SWE positions; so far, one of them is currently still in the process and the rest I was rejected or ghosted. For UX, I've had no luck landing any interviews, just rejection emails. I hope to get a few projects done during winter break as that's the only ""free time"" I have this year. That being said, I'm not sure whether it's more worth it to just work on improving my programming skills in the hopes of getting a good front-end dev position, or if I should just go all-in to building up my portfolio and focus more on prototyping and designing. There are definitely a lot more internships for software developers than UX designers, but I also don't want to give up on a field that I can really see myself enjoying. Any advice/suggestions are welcome. Thanks! :)"
9phkrl,2,2018-10-19,Dropping out of Masters?,johnathanseagull,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9phkrl/dropping_out_of_masters/,"I recently started a masters program in another country (Netherlands) . The course(MSc agri engineering) is a divergence from my background (CS degree) working as a software engineer for a number of years.

I chose the course as it was different and an area i'm interested in (vertical, urban, automated, sustainable farming*, small scale &amp; not commercial).*

The course is two years, **year 1** is a series of compulsory courses with some optional and **year 2** is a 6 months *thesis* project and 4 month internship.

However, the material is proving to be very theoretical and focused on large scale agriculture and intensive farming methods which is not what i'm really interested in - there is no material on my interests as stated above as it is the opposite of intensive. From what i'v been told the thesis project is usually determined by PhD students who need some research for their work and I don't feel like an internship with a corporate company will benefit me.

**My goal is set up my own business in the future.**

I feel like i'm wasting time with this masters and can get closer to my goals by working with companies in my field of interest. Or by experimenting with my own ideas during this time and putting myself out there.

The course is very intensive and I am still holding down a job. I do not really have time to think at the moment but don't feel this is the right path. It would be easier to go with the flow and stick the program out but it feels like there's better ways to approach my goal.

​

The reasons for staying:

*Credibility (If I pitched to investors)*

*Networking (The University is renowned and may open up doors?)*

*Access to industry (Exposure to various companies)*

​

I am conflicted at the moment, should I drop out and face the unknown again or stay and hope for the best.

It was a big decision for me to leave my girlfriend in my previous city and move to NL to pursue this masters.

​

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you

You've helped me before and I could sure use your solid advice now. (Note: I totally know some of the following is subjective based upon what kind of student I am/how well I can manage my time, but I'd still love to hear your .02, especially if you're in a similar situation).

&amp;#x200B;

I finished an internship over the summer and (somehow) managed to receive a full time offer (Very good) to start next summer. Now initially, this was for after I graduated. After meeting with an advisor, my timeline for graduation has been pushed back a bit and so I immediately reached out to the hiring group to inform them of this, let them know that I'd like to plan ahead if this changes anything in regards to the offer (look for another internship for next summer or whatever) and presented them with the idea of me working while taking night classes til I finish the degree. I in fact, took a math class over the summer during the internship and was pretty successful.

&amp;#x200B;

After about a week, it seems although the company would prefer me graduating prior to starting, they are fine with me taking classes at night. I know I'd never do a full load of classes if/when I start with the company, and I'm comfortable with that based upon the fact that I'd be fairly close to graduating and a few classes per semester wouldn't affect much in my/my family's life.

&amp;#x200B;

All this being said, TLDR: Working full time while still finishing up CS degree. To those who have been there/are there..how is it? Would love to hear your stories.

Cheers!"

It's internship time, and there appears to be a quite a bit of companies who are offering jobs. I was so excited to see the postings, until I realized there wasn't enough jobs for everyone. The number of jobs vs. the number of students was huge. Later on, I also realized it all came down to grades because who the heck has 5 years of coding experience in over 10 programming languages with frameworks and libraries unless that's your hobby. 

I went into tech knowing nothing. I'm struggling to keep up with the workload and I'm angry that my profs said that there would be jobs in this field. They should have said there would be jobs only if you have a 90 average. I no longer enjoy coding, because it's a competition. I especially hate the classes where they overload us with projects knowing that we have other courses and jobs to apply to. This degree means nothing to me if I can't get a job.

I'm wondering what are some tricks I can do to level up the playing field. Should I cheat and 'fake it until I make it?' At this point, everything comes down to grades and there's really no time to do anything on the side. If I do, I'll end up missing an assignment or failing a quiz. "

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24. I attended a small liberal arts university in the Midwest from 2013 until the end of 2017, studying CS for about half of that time (switched my junior year). I probably finished around 50% of my degree. At the beginning of 2017, I started working at a tiny startup as an intern. I only had 1 semester of CS under my belt at that point, and could only code at a very basic level. I learned a lot on the job, including C#, vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, some SQL, etc. Standard MS development stack. They hired me as an employee in September of 2017, at which point I decided to take a semester off to work full time and consider transferring universities.

&amp;#x200B;

Mental health issues resulted in me resigning in February, and then my wife got a job in Pittsburgh, PA, so we moved here in May. After dozens of applications and a few interviews, I was hired in August as a full-time Software Engineer at an big (from my point of view. 10 employees to 1000 employees is a big jump for me) international company in the biotech/medical services field. At this job, I'm using much of the same technologies I learned during my time at the startup. I was headhunted by a recruiter for this position, and the interview process was pretty quick, didn't have a technical portion, and I've already formed a mentoring relationship with a couple of the more senior developers. I really like this job, but with my relative lack of experience it really feels like a fluke. When we moved to Pittsburgh, I did not expect to find a development job. I thought my lack of degree and experience would keep me sequestered to basic tech support or non-tech jobs. I guess my manager saw something in me though, because he's been very encouraging and complementary of my skills.

&amp;#x200B;

The company I'm working for offers a very generous tuition reimbursement policy, and my manager recommended I finish my degree soon to avoid getting asked questions about it for the rest of my career. My plan was to work full time until next Fall and then start working toward that.  The way I see it, I have 4 options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start working toward my Bachelor's again at one of the many universities in Pittsburgh or online. Asking for fewer hours or quitting and getting a part time job while going to school is not really financially feasible for my wife and me right now. I will probably be able to transfer some of my credits from my previous university, but this is still likely a minimum 2 year commitment while working full time.
2. Attend our local community college and earn my Associate's. This option would take less time than the Bachelor's, and I would likely still be able to transfer some credits. Another bonus of this option is that I would be able to continue on and complete a Bachelor's if I wanted to.
3. Attend some sort of bootcamp. This option doesn't really appeal to me because in my purely anecdotal research I found that A) they tend to focus more on specific technologies than general knowledge, C) I'm not an absolute beginner, which these programs tend to cater toward, and B) the credential/certificate from such a program probably won't carry as much value long term as a degree or even just pure work experience.
4. Not go back and get any kind of credential, and just rely on my resume experience to push my forward in my future career.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing: I have minuscule student loan debt right now because I had the benefit of attending a university at which my father taught, so as far as finances for continuing university goes, I'm not under a lot of stress.

&amp;#x200B;

Which of these options do you recommend? As far as long-term career goals, I don't have anything nailed down, but I know I don't want to do web development forever. I'm interested in game development and blending STEM with more soft fields like history and psychology. I feel like I may want to teach some day (in which case getting the degree is obvious). I also want to own my own business some day (not necessarily tech related though), and I also think I'd be willing to transition from a developer into a more managerial role some day.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading!

today I have got a problem with my internet connection, specificly the consistency. While gaming, watching youtube or just doing a simple ""ping"", the connection is stable with 20ms being the norm for the pings. Random, the connection will just drop to zero, I get the timeout message, and after 2 pings of no connection at all, it just resumes as if nothing happened. This time tho is enough to kick me out of most multiplayer games. After some time observing the pings and trying to find a pattern in the timeouts, I have concluded that there is none. They happen every few minutes, in LAN and W-Lan, Windows and Android and on all devices in the network. They just arrived one day, so I can not even say that we changed anything. The problem happens regardless of internet usage and has no timing to trigger. Its a complete random internet timeout that just was there one day and jesus motherfucking christ, it is one thing when the internet isnt working. But when it WORKS and drops you when you need it, it is borderline crazy. The mood in the house has dropped and I just want this fixed.

What I have tried:

Basicly everything possible. I reset the router, I took of the LAN switch, reconnected all cables, including the coxial cable going from my wall to the router. Kabel Deutschland wants to send me a new coxial cable in the next days, cause they say it is the cables fault. (he of course knew that after a 2 minute phone call). The Router (FRITZ!Box 6490, newest firmware and drivers) doesnt even show the timeouts in its intern log, or in other words, the router does not loose internet connection. 

What I havent done: 

Nothing I can think of. For real, I was on every website that sounded like it was even close to my problem, but just nothing. I am a tech loving guy, but here my knowledge ends.

Pls help

1) Education

2) Skills

3) Academic project

4) Can put up the online MOOCs certifications at best.

Only these 4 things are making my resume look very small, and will look very uninviting to the recruiter.

I am working on a personal project as well right now, but that will take some time to finish, and I am under the pressure of starting to apply for jobs.

Any help with some more headings will be really appreciated. Headings that can be put to basically just fill up the resume but also not make the resume bad with irrelevant information? Basically some middle ground. 

Also any templates that use bullets more than paragraphs, or any kind of template basically that can make my resume a little more filled up, that will also do wonders.

9pkult,8,2018-10-19,Philosophy and coping with ADHD,BobsonGDugnutt,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9pkult/philosophy_and_coping_with_adhd/,"Hi, 

I’m wondering if anyone has read or studied any philosophy (specific books or general ideas) that has helped them cope with their ADHD. 

Some background: I was diagnosed and began treatment for ADHD a year and a half ago. It’s improved my life immensely and helped me get through grad school despite the rest of my life imploding at that time.

In school I found myself suddenly interested in (and capable of) work in research and social science. I experienced so much growth and pride in my work and capabilities. I felt like I was really impressing the shit out of those around me and that brought me great pride. 

Now that I am transitioning from student and intern to contractor (and hopefully to employee v soon), I’m finding that all of the confidence in myself, motivation, drive and even sense of meaning in my work is disappearing. I constantly feel like I am fucking up, becoming disorganized and wearing on the patience of my colleagues even though that may or may not be true. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

While I have some things to work on in therapy, no doubt (techniques to cope with social anxiety, intrusive thoughts, insecurity) I’m also looking for meaning in all of this. 

Any suggestions, thoughts or discussion would be immensely helpful. Thank you. "
9pkyw8,1,2018-10-19,How do I deal with a miserable job and oppressive work environment?,originalname0123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9pkyw8/how_do_i_deal_with_a_miserable_job_and_oppressive/,"So some background to start:

I graduated from college in December of 2017 after a 2 year stint in Engineering, realized I didn't want to do that, transferred to Business and specialized in Accounting. 4.5 years later I had 153 credits which makes me CPA eligible after I also gain 1 cumulative year experience under a CPA. I have had 2 jobs since I got my license at 17, one at a grocery store and one with Geek Squad (I'm a tech nerd who loves to help people). I stuck with Geek Squad after graduation as I had risen through the ranks and pay grade, knowing I could sustain there while looking for an Accounting job.

In the beginning of March, a family friend said he knew someone at a small firm that was looking to hire. They told me its a younger environment as they hire recent graduates primarily (which I now know should be a red flag), and they paid very well, I started at 50k/yr plus overtime. It sounded perfect to me as a foot in the door to the world of Accounting, which is what he described it to me as. The only other thing he said it be prepared to work a lot, but its a good start. I couldn't ask for more, interviewed and was hired on the spot.

The firms structure is currently this: 4 managing partners and 25 basic staff accountants.

The issues:

The work is copy pasting pre-written lines, checking if numbers exceed thresholds, and matching numbers between a handful of documents. I am beyond bored all day long.

It didn't take long for me to start to see the flaws here. 2.5 weeks into the job the person seated across from me got fired. At the time it seemed like they let this person go because they weren't grasping the work, which in all honesty was true. But within a week of the termination, the managing partner began making jokes/comments about this person, how stupid they were, how they wont find work anywhere, and at one time how terrible their taste in food was (like seriously?). The striking thing was people didn't seem phased by this. After getting more acquainted with people they asked me why I chose to work here, and I explained the above mentioned. They asked me if I had even looked on [glassdoor.com](https://glassdoor.com). I hadn't. The reviews on there are atrocious, it chronicles much of the same sentiment I just spoke about. Only 2 out of the 14 reviews were more than 1 star rated. As someone who worked in customer service so long I know that reviews aren't always 100% telling, most of the time reviews are only done by those who had an above exceptional experience or those who had the worst experience ever, and usually you see more of the latter. I brushed it off, until it came out that the Interns (who are family friends of the owners) were forced to write those 2 positive reviews, so those aren't even true.

Then it got worse. Policy here is beyond childish IMO. 0 tolerance policy for cellphones, people have been terminated over (you'll see why this is dumb later), 30 minute lunch period is our only break allotted for the day regardless of how long we are here and any time over the 30 minutes (up to 1 hour) must be made up by the end of the week, absolutely no flex hours (8:30-5pm minimum shift) people have been screamed at for leaving mid-day for a family emergency even when they still made up the time. Additionally, they have instituted a policy of not being allowed to take vacation time during overtime periods. For reference, some people have been in mandatory overtime (depending on the contract they are assigned) for 2+ YEARS.

The firm has a massive employee turnover issue, no one is happy and almost nobody so far has left on good terms. They used to be a firm of 50+ staff now approaching 20, and begging us to refer friends for jobs here.

Now for the ridiculous:

1. The partners of the firm are having a new house built, they routinely have interior decorators show up all day to discuss the house, make phone calls about the house, leave early for the house, online shop for the house. This has been for 4-5 months now. For context I have been through this with my family and none of us missed as much work as they have, nor did we take car of personal matters at work.
2. They rarely show up, and when they do its never on time and they always leave early.
3. They constantly scream and curse to/at/about employees for even the most minute mistakes, or if we try to explain our selves (they're right, we're wrong always). They recently tried to change policy to hold back our overtime pay for 5 months as insurance to make sure we stay for a new contact they took on (they said it would be paid at time and a half, then last minute changed that and no one agreed to sign the agreement sheet) so this caused a massive screaming blow up telling us we are all replaceable (see above for why this is funny), unprofessional, morons, shouldn't be in this field. Only to change policy without us signing the agreement because ""they're the bosses and they can do what they want.""
4. They are constantly receiving and making personal phone calls on their cellphones all day, while we cant have any personal calls except to our desk phones for emergencies ONLY.
5. See number 3 for policy change, because we were understandably upset about having our pay withheld, knowing we would be working 60+ hours per week, they changed mandatory business hours to 6 days a week 61 hours, stopped providing lunch for us on Thursdays, and stopped supplying any food items or drinks aside from the water cooler. They walked back on the mandatory 6 days a week after a few people quit, the rest is still in effect.
6. Missing mandatory monthly hour requirements by any amount, even 30 minutes to an hour, is met with more screaming and being spoken down to.
7. It is frowned upon to take a sick day at all, at any point
8. There's a feeling of fear in being seen talking to a coworker rampant around the office
9. At this point most days are 11-12 hour days with a 6+ hour Saturday.

Now I know some of these things seem silly or are occasionally occurrences in the business world, but all of this complied together is overbearing. I know ""real-world"" jobs are not cake walk social parties and I am more than OK with that, I enjoy working and performing well and getting things done.

I feel broken by this job. I feel no drive to work for these people. I hate waking up in the morning, I need to be somewhere better.

Because of all of this I am having trouble setting up interviews and taking call-backs from new potential jobs so I fear I am ""stuck"" here unless I quit and stay unemployed until I find a new job, which is something I prefer not to do. Any advice or alternatives?

TL/DR: Got my first job in my career field, the bosses are terrible, mean, the environment feels like prison more than a job. I want out but basically don't have time to do interviews. I don't want to quit and be unemployed looking for a new job, what do I do?"
9pl8ya,1,2018-10-19,Double major worth it?,jessiebears,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9pl8ya/double_major_worth_it/,"Hey guys, I'm a second-year engineering student majoring in Systems &amp; Information Engineering (pretty flexible major that focuses a lot on decision making, working with data, modeling/probability etc.).

Anyway, I have a lot of flexibility in the curriculum and was going to get a CS minor, but then I realized I could actually complete all the CS reqs to get a double major in Systems &amp; CS while still taking a normal courseload of 15-16 credits each semester for the rest of my time here. I don't necessarily want to work in tech (interested in tech consulting, maybe law school to do patent law down the line) as a software developer/programmer, but I figured it would probably look good and be useful in the future. Also if it's relevant, I'm interviewing for software dev internships this summer b/c they're pretty easily available to 2nd years and have some offers lined up, but not from big tech companies.

The only things really holding me back are the fact that some of these classes in both Systems and CS are pretty hard, and given that I'm interested in consulting or law school (after working a few years to save the money), I know my GPA is going to be hugely important. I'm currently at above a 3.9 but this is after some pretty easy first-year intro classes.

Also, the CS major is huge, so there's a lot of red tape to get into CS classes.. at my school, you can't declare a CS major until after you take a certain class, which I won't take until next semester - the problem then being I also need to take 2 other cs major-only classes that semester in order to graduate on time. (My bad for not taking that class this semester, I honestly wasn't thinking about a cs major at all, lol - I took a bunch of classes in different areas to see what I liked before deciding it wold be better to just specialize)

Just wondering what you guys think! Is the double major worth it?"
9ple5s,1,2018-10-19,To get an internship or continue to learn on my own?,downrightcriminal,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/9ple5s/to_get_an_internship_or_continue_to_learn_on_my/,"I have been learning programming in general, and web development in particular (JS, React &amp; Node; little bit of Vue, python and C#) for about the last 6 months. (In terms of FreeCodeCamp curriculum, I am about halfway there). I started this because I wanted to acquire a tangible skill, and switch into a career more interesting to me, before I immigrate to a new country next year. Plus, I work in a utility company as an Electrical Engineer in the Distribution function, a career I do not fancy pursuing for the rest of my life. Looking for a field with a mix of creativity, logical &amp; analytical thinking and problem solving, and having to start afresh in the new country anyways, I decided to, (fortunately or unfortunately) focus on web development.

I will be moving to the new country in the first quarter of next year, so I have about 4-5 months during which I can hone my skills. I have quit my current job and October 31 will be the last day. Then, I will have the freedom to dedicate myself to learn this stuff 24/7, OR to find a small internship/job in a local company, where I may be able to work on latest techs like React. I have a software engineer friend who says he can find me a short stint. My only requirement is that I should be able to work on latest stack (i.e. not jquery, php), and the company be kind enough to give me a certificate at the end of the internship. I do not care about the pay (Nobody hates a free resource I think, so I say chances are high that I find an opportunity).

The pros of getting an internship will be:

1. Hands on experience of working in a developer role.
2. Something to put on my CV.
3. Networking.
4. Working in teams.
5. Learning how day to day work is carried out by dev teams, which I do not think I can ever learn at home.

The cons for me will be:

1. Not getting enough time to work on my personal portfolio.
2. Not learning stuff on job as well as maybe what I can achieve at home.
3. Possible long commute (1.5 - 2.5 hrs per day).
4. Not having something to show at the end for the time spent (like some project or certificate).
5. Whether the experience gained or the network made will be of any worth in the new country.

So, what do you guys think I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: To get or not to get an internship (rather than learning at home).

Basically I have not been focused on courses the best I possible could've. And a large part of that is due to taking a lot of time outside of class to do research instead of doing hw and studying.

I really love doing research and although I am still uncertain if staying in academia is even something I want to do, I really want to pursue a career in research.

I have two publications (in high performance computing and PL theory) at good conferences (one of which I'm first author) and I'm working on my third. I would ascribe my horrible grades to the amount of time I spend in the research office, but that's not 100% true.

I go to a top CS school (though I am only minoring in CS) in the US and had a pretty cool internship last summer. This summer I may potentially be in a research-y internship role. Buuuutttt..... **I have a 2.7 GPA.**

**Is a PhD a good route for me to take to become a CS researcher (ie. are there other paths)? And if it is, is there any way I could get into a good program with a 2.7 GPA?**

&amp;#x200B;

Please send help.

Thanks!"

9ppclr,25,2018-10-19,Why influencer marketing is probably a bad idea for your startup…and how to make it work when you decide to do it anyway.,Sim_Strategy,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9ppclr/why_influencer_marketing_is_probably_a_bad_idea/,"As mentioned in previous posts, I’m an eCommerce consultant / digital strategist. I work with a lot of early stage companies to help them figure out strategies to help achieve exponential growth for their businesses. This is another blog post in progress but figured I’d share here first, so tuck in for a fairly long one.

My advice below includes several assumptions. The first is that you’re a startup. The second is that you haven’t been through a major funding round, and are either bootstrapping or don’t have bottomless pools of disposable marketing dollars. 

Over the past couple of years almost every client I’ve worked with has the same innovative plan to become the next billion dollar eCommerce startup using influencer Marketing.

They’ve done their research. Read the case studies about all the brands that made it big through influencer campaigns. They’ve crunched some numbers and are confident it’s the right approach for them.

 “InstaBro has 1 million Instagram followers and they’re all in my target demographic. Even if I pay him $10,000 and just 10% of his audience buys from me, that’s 100,000 sales. I’m making out like a bandit. I can find tons of people like that. Its win win.”

Or

“I’m smarter than those guys, I’m just going to go for the small fish influencers. They don’t cost much other than free product, What do I have to lose?”.

Unfortunately, its not so easy anymore. Influencer marketing is no longer the guaranteed golden-goose secret weapon wielded by only the savviest millennial entrepreneurs. The secret is out, and the magic of the foolproof low-cost, mass-market revenue source is gone.

The term “Influencer” is very broad. Technically its anybody who has the power to influence the actions of others. It could be an actor, a model, an industry expert…even the popular kid at school is an influencer.

The Influencer I’m referring to is specifically anybody leveraging some level of “internet fame” to encourage followers to engage with a product or brand via online media channels. These people may have legitimate success within their areas of focus. Often they’re influencers simply because they’ve somehow managed to convince enough people that they’re influential. Welcome to 2018.

Influencer marketing as an advertising channel has exploded over the last 3-5 years or so. Companies of all sizes shell out thousands of dollars for sponsored posts, Youtube videos, photos, podcasts…anything to get their name in front of that coveted Gen Z / Millennial demo. And every other teenager dreams of making it big, living easy blowing vape clouds and unboxing lip kits on Youtube or Instagram. 

In response, an entire sub sector within the digital marketing industry has grown to support this wave. “Influencer marketing agencies” and consultants are popping up left and right. They sign kids &amp; mommy bloggers up by the dozen, convincing them they can make thousands per post if they hustle hard enough. At the same time, influence marketers woo unwitting companies to shell out thousands with the promise of big returns by flaunting big follower counts.

If you’re not careful you’ll end up like the many other businesses drawn in by the gold rush, left wondering why your sales are stagnant despite engaging with the supposedly biggest influencers in your industry. 

The unfortunate reality is that my clients who come to me after already experimenting with influencer campaigns often have 0 idea about the actual effectiveness of these campaigns.  It doesn’t take a lot of complicated analysis before I have to break the bad news that the campaign was a failure. Sometimes the loss is nothing more than some free product and a few hours of the founders’ time, other cases its in the tune of many thousands of dollars.

After analyzing countless influencer campaigns, the fact I’ve found is that these days the traditional influencer marketing model is rarely is worth the time &amp; money for your average startup.

Estimating the effectiveness of an influencer campaign to a bootstrapping startup comes down to fairly simple math. The inputs are a mix of known numbers and educated guesses. How much will it cost? How many impressions will be generated? What percentage of those impressions are going to actively seek out your website or product? Of those visitors, how many of them will actually buy from you at some point in the future?

Unfortunately the average entrepreneur might not be that savvy with marketing math, while many people along the road have motivations to inflate numbers. The influencer will try to impress you with big follower &amp; subscriber counts. And your marketing guy will convince you they’re doing a good job with inflated result figures. 

The hungry entrepreneur may be quick to forget that 1 million followers does not equal 1 million impressions…and 1 million views definitely does not equal 1 million conversions.

Maybe a single one of InstaBro’s posts is only seen by 10% of his 1 million followers. That’s just 100,000 impressions. Of those 100k impressions, if you’re lucky 5% of those will actually make it to your website. Now you’re at just 5,000 visits for your campaign (at $10k for the post, that’s almost $2 per click….a high amount to pay if this were a CPC campaign.) Influencer sourced visits are typically low converting. Generously maybe you’ll see a 1% conversion rate…or 50 purchases. 

So that’s the question, is 50 purchases worth $10,000 for you? Are non converting impressions worth anything to you at this stage?

In reality, the actual percentages end up far lower than my example, with visit &amp; conversion rates well under 1%. And more often than not, these campaigns don’t generate enough revenue to justify the time or expense.

_____________________

So why are Influencer marketing campaigns increasingly failing? Heres some of the big reasons:

- **Reason #1: Theres a massive price bubble. **

 In the beginning influencers didn’t know how much they’re worth. At the same times, companies new to the channel had no idea what to pay them. This was the time when you heard the magical tales of companies spending $5k on their entire influencer channels, going viral and raking in millions in revenue. But as Influencers caught on, naturally their worth became tied to their follower counts, and an arms race ensued for the best engagers. As those big guys become priced out of reach, companies flocked to the next tier down in search of a “bargain”…and so on. Well funded companies who didn’t want to miss out on the gold rush, and who don’t care about short term return….paid whatever these kids asked. 


 All of this has lead to a steadily increasing price demanded by influencers at every quality tier. Since their cost per post are linked to their follower counts and not conversion rates, there is little correlation between the high prices demanded and the actual potential value of results for you.

 Put simply, the best influencers are often more expensive than they’re worth.

- **Reason #2: There are a lot of terrible influencers out there, and identifying them isn’t always easy.**

 Objectively gauging the true quality of an influencer pre-campaign has become extremely difficult. 

 Once upon a time, followers or subscriber counts was in fact a good gauge of popularity…and thus, what a post or campaign by an influencer might be worth. Of course, it didn’t take long for people to start buying followers or using bots to boost numbers. 

 Then marketers got smart and started looking at “engagement” instead as a metric of worth. But wannabe influencers gamed system again with “like for like” or “comment for comment” schemes, sometimes backed by sophisticated engagement-pumping botnets. 

 But even if the person has tons of legitimate views, likes, &amp; followers, its still almost impossible to answer “how receptive are this influencer’s followers to actually being influenced”?  If they have a bunch of followers who like their posts but don’t really care about purchasing what they’re peddling, they don’t have real influence at all. 

- **Reason #3: Over saturation and no staying power.**

 Many of these serial “influencers” are pushing products all day every day.  If you’re hiring “the widget guy”, he might be promoting a new widget every day. This pretty much kills the whole “it works because his followers think you’re special” potential, and seriously limits potential efficacy. . There is such a thing as consumer marketing fatigue.

 At the same time, using mediums like Instagram, your post will become buried within 48 hours, and is undiscoverable via search engines. So if you don’t generate results in that time period, you post you spent $5k on is essentially dead in the water.

Not too long ago I advised clients to use the strategy of “the big guys are overpriced…find the smaller ‘diamond in the rough’ influencers…don’t pay them much, or just give them free product. That’s how you’ll beat the system.” But over time I learned the time it takes to manage such campaigns is rarely worth the actual result. I’ve seen plenty of cases where an influencer with 50k-100k followers only manages to generate one or two sales from a post at the cost of $500-$100+.

_____________________________________

Of course, Influencer Campaigns can work…as proven by plenty of high profile examples. However, effective execution typically relies on serious money, and returns may not be immediate. Some effective strategies that probably pay off in the long run

**1. Major Celebrity endorsement.**

 As mentioned one of the difficulties of successful influencer marketing is quantifying their true power of influence.  1 follower of the random guy with 1000 followers may not be equal to 1 follower of the next guy with 1000 followers. The power of influence on an individual is based on many highly subjective factors.  

 Celebrity endorsements are a way around this problem. Well known celebs tend to have massive fanbases who don’t hesitate to buy whatever they’re selling…wearing…promoting.  These campaigns can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars…but they’ve been proven effective pretty much since the dawn of modern advertising. Just look at what Kylie Jenner has done making a billion dollars essentially selling fancy lip gloss.

**2. Carpet bombing.**

 This is my own term for the strategy which entails hiring every influencer you can possibly land, of all tiers &amp; regardless of cost. The aim is to get your brand in front of as many potential customer eyes as possible. It’s a proven fact that people are more likely to buy a product they encounter over and over again. If somebody sees one influencer post about your brand, they’ll probably ignore it. If they start seeing their entire feeds fill up with posts about your brand…they’re going to take notice.

 However, this is a brand awareness strategy more than a conversion driver. Which means investing a lot of time &amp; money now, for a return you might not make back for a long time. This puts it out of reach for many bootstrapping startups

**3. Review Posts**

 Paying for legitimate reviews of your product is a great use of influencer marketing dollars. Online shoppers not only look for reviews before purchasing a product…many wont’ buy a product without them. Review posts are great because often they cost little more than some free product, and they’re search engine discoverable for a long time. But not just any review is a good one. They should be of high quality, posted on Youtube or a permanent blog, and SEO optimized.  Reviews provide long lasting value through last-touch SEO impact

Other than those instances and maybe a handful of others, Influencer Campaigns are rarely worth running for most businesses.  And when you crunch the math, your bootstrapped marketing dollar is probably better spent on other digital channels.

_____________________________

But I understand at this point some of you still reading probably think I’m full of crap, I must not have been doing it right, your friend Mike did it and it worked…if everyone is doing it, there must be something to it…you’re smart enough to make Influencer Marketing work for you. 

So when you ignore my advice t are some good rules to follow if you’re going to experiment with this channel.

1. Influencer content should ideally be both permanent and high quality.  A single Instagram post that’s buried in 2 days and not searchable on Google is worth a lot less than a video product review on Youtube that will stay at the top of the SERP indefinitely. 


2. Do the right math, and focus on the right numbers to analyze real value of an influencer before engaging them. Strong analytics is the cornerstone to any successful digital marketing push. 


 Influencers try to throw the biggest numbers they can squeeze out. Often it becomes evident the numbers that matter don’t stack up. They may try to woo you with their 1 million followers…100,000 person email list….90% return rate of past clients. But whats their real engagement? How often do they post? Whats their real conversion rate?  Do they even know these things? Even if all you give them is free stuff…your time is money.

If you can’t do this yourself, it may be worth it to hire someone to do it for you.

 2b.  Make sure you do the right math after the campaign to determine if it was actually effective at all. This sounds obvious, but too many marketers are looking at all the wrong benchmarks, and make bad decisions as a result.

3. Influencer marketing works for some industries better than others. Take into consideration how your customers are actually buying. A fashion brand is much more likely to have success with this channel than say, selling some SAAS business.

4. Of course its also imperative to learn how to spot the fakers. Influencers on every media channels use sophisticated techniques intended to make themselves look more popular than they really are. These techniques are constantly changing. You need to be smarter than they are. 

5. Be prepared to dedicate the manpower. An effective influencer strategy is time consuming.  Recruiting new influencers, monitoring performance, keeping your brand ambassadors active is an ongoing effort. Often too much effort for a founding business operator to handle on their own during a time when they have bigger fish to fry. If you don’t have a marketing director on board…get an intern, or table this idea for later. 

6. Friends &amp; family are still king. The best “influencer” for anyone isn’t some internet celebrity, but rather word of mouth from people they know. Referral campaigns are still one of the best ways to effectively generate sales without marginal spend.
In summation, can Influencer Marketing work for you? Sure it could. But the real question you should be asking is if Influencer Marketing is the best way to put your precious dollars to work over other digital marketing channels.  

Anyway, I could go on all day about Influencer Marketing, and this post was certainly not exhaustive, but hopefully will give you some things to think about before adding it into your marketing mix. If you still have doubts, go ahead and experiment. Just be smart. At the end of the day, regardless of what I say…if its working for you, keep doing what you’re doing.

Filipino American, grew up in Thailand. Lived in MA for the past 3 years.

**SAT 1550 (750 ERW, 800 Math)**

GPA: 3.89 UW. Our school doesn't do class rank or show weighted GPA. So far in senior year, I have all A's except for a B+ in English. Taking BC Calc, AP Computer Science, Advanced Spanish 5, English 12, AP Physics, Orchestra.

Subject Tests: 800 Math 2, 700 Physics. (Ik physics isn't so good, but my school is quite weak at science subject tests because our honors sciences don't cover a lot of the topics on the SAT subject tests, but goes into more depth in certain topics).

AP's: Spanish Language and Culture: 5. English Lang: 4.

**Extracurriculars:**

\- Varsity Squash Captain. I started playing squash in 10th grade, when I moved to MA, and have gotten good enough to be one of two captains on the team out of a team of 14.

\- Entrepreneurship Club Vice President. We teach the basics of entrepreneurship to members and help them develop ideas to pitch at competitions against other schools in the Boston-Cambridge Area.

\- Orchestra Trumpet player. I am the only trumpet in our orchestra, which is quite small. I was an international honors band trumpet player in 8th grade, but I am not as passionate for orchestra as I once was. Not planning on submitting a supplement.

\- JV Soccer Captain: Not a sport I'm particularly good at, but I enjoy.

\- Harvard Coding Academy, June 2018. Week long coding course at Harvard using Python. (wish it were in java because it would have helped a lot more with AP Computer Science lol)

\- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Engineering Exploration Program June 2018: Week long engineering summer program at RPI.

\- Internship at Mavrck, an influencer marketing start up in Boston. Two week internship from July-August 2018. I got this internship from a competition I won for entrepreneurship.

**Awards:**

\- 1st Place Entrepreneurship Competition in Cambridge in June 2018 against other schools in the boston-cambridge area.

\- Runner up Entrepreneurship Competition in Cambridge in June 2017.

\- 9th grade High Honor Roll at my old school in Thailand. GPA 3.9+. (My new school doesn't do awards).

**Community Service:**

\- Treasurer of my old school's dog shelter club. We walked, fed, cleaned and took dogs for veterinarian check ups from a local dog shelter. 40 hours

\- Boys and Girl's club Swimming Teaching Assistant. 40 hours.

\- In Thailand, I volunteered at a local orphanage where I help around like painting, repairing, or entertaining children. This was over the summer so I don't know my hours

**Recommendations:** Very good. I was close to my Math teacher, and am very close to my physics and Spanish teacher (MIT required one math/science and one humanities/language rec).

**Essays:** Also pretty good. MIT doesn't do the common app, but I talk about my experiences adjusting to high school in the US from being an American citizen in Thailand, as I felt foreign in both Thailand and in the US. I also talk about my experience volunteering at the orphanage over the summer, where I recently visited again.

**About my high school:** (Private School) My high school has good connections to MIT, and usually gets around 3 students in the university per year out of a class of \~120. In the past 10 years, 20% of the students applying from my school got into MIT.

**About my connections to MIT:** I have very strong connections to MIT, but MIT says publicly they don't care about legacy (but most college counselors I've asked and even people that used to work at MIT said that isn't true). Both my parents graduated from MIT. My grandpa also graduated from MIT and donated a lounge to the MIT Sloan school of management. My aunt also graduated from MIT. (MIT doesn't specifically ask for legacy on their application. How do I let the school know of my legacy?)

Send help pls,BeffBezos,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9ppurz/losing_sleep_over_this_ms_interview_question_send/,"So a buddy of mine got this question for an INTERNSHIP at microsoft and its absolutely killing us.

This is supposed to have an O(n) solution. Here's the question:

&amp;#x200B;

You're given an array of x and y coordinates representing trees (the whole Cartesian plane is a forest where you are standing at the origin) and you are also given an angle representing the field of view. Find the best direction to look into given your field of view to see the greatest number of trees at once. Assuming the trees have negligible width (so no tree blocks a tree behind it). Also, the Trees represented by the X and Y coordinates are not ordered in any specific way .

&amp;#x200B;

So the best solution my friend and I could think of was 1) create an array of angles representing each tree (the angle from the tree to the origin) 2) sort the array (because the Trees were given in an arbitrary order) 3) walk through the array in a sliding window fashion (representing the field of view) to keep track of the maximum number of trees. This was N\*logN because of the sort. My friend remembers the interviewer mentioning there exists an o(N) solution (but maybe he misspoke?).

&amp;#x200B;

I've added a diagram [here](https://imgur.com/a/kScDB2F)to help explain the question. Remember, the field of view is arbitrary but a set number and we're looking to find the best direction to point the field of view in order to observe the most trees at once.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. my buddy did not get the internship. pls press f

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you to /u/dig-up-stupid and /u/lightcloud5 for mentioning that bucket sort can run in O(N+K)  which would bring our time complexity down to O(N) if the number of trees was greater than the number of significant figures in the tree angles"

Schools I'm applying to: Stanford, Duke, Cornell, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Emory, UMitch, UCSB, UC Davis, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Arizona


Background: Chinese female (Malaysia)


Intended Major: Microbiology


SAT: 1500 normal score, 1540 superscore (750 english, 790 math), 19/24 essay


Subject tests: Math 2 -- 750 (lmao), Bio E -- 770



IBDP Subjects (no APs offered around here): HL Math Bio Chem, SL EnglishL&amp;L ChineseB Econs


Scores: 40/42 + 2 or 3 bonus points. RIP Biology EE.


I'm taking the entire IB diploma program so there's no exact GPA, but I'd estimate it at 4.6 to 4.8 weighted.


IGCSEs: 8 A* 1 A



ECs:

1. Represented Malaysia in 2018 FPSPI conference (internationally recognised but pretty low-key critical thinking program)

2. World Scholar's Cup - team was top 3 in regionals and top 25 in globals, going for Tournament of Champions in Yale this November

3. 6-week neuroscience research internship -- research results will be published as part of my supervisor's research paper

4. Handball -- played to national level invitation stage but had to decline (RIP)

5. Taekwondo 1st dan black belt, taking 2nd dan now

6. Prefectorial board of 2 years in old school

7. Student council vice president in current school -- I'm in pioneering batch, so we're working on establishing foundations for next generations

8. Secretary of Entrepreneur club (2 years) -- raised &gt;10k profits in personal fundraising projects, helped a bunch of others as well

I have a couple other ECs but currently choosing which to include. I worked a part-time job in my previous tuition center that I became Ambassador for, does that belong under ECs?


Honors:

1. Academic colours (award given to academic excellence over 3 years)

2. Student excellence award

3. Merit scholarship award holder in current school

4. I have a couple more mini honors, gotta go dig them up because I didn't know they were a thing until about two weeks ago.



LoR: 

My english and biology teacher. I've only known them for about 1 year. I've worked really closely with my biology teacher for my microbiology thesis, she knows my passion in biology. English went from being my worst subject to best, its a subject I worked my ass off for so hopefully it'll shine through in the letter. While I did have some past misunderstandings with my english teacher (see number 3 in additional info) that's cleared up now so I hope it doesn't affect my letters too much.




Essays:

Probably the the part where I’ll be banking on the most, and will be devoting a ton of time and effort into. I’ll be talking about my decision of switching my intended major to microbiology from marine biology, which was something I was dead set on since I was 9. In a nutshell, I couldn’t bring myself to pursue my passion at the expense of family welfare, which means a lot to me. It catalysed the discovery of an entire new field of interest, so it isn’t to say I ditched my passion entirely.



Additional info:

1. As mentioned briefly before, internships and jobs are extremely hard to find around my area. I know many US students get the chance to do these things during their summer holidays, but here you’ll need connections, luck or an excellent academic profile to get jobs or internships.

2. I also completed my IGCSEs in 3.5 years before moving to a new schools for my last 2 years, which is why most school-based ECs didn’t run through all 4 years of grade 9-12. My current school is new as well, so they’re starting any extracurricular activity from scratch. It also means that student-teacher interactions won’t be that strong, which may affect letter of recommendations.

3. I was diagnosed with ADHD a month ago —  cultural stigma and being (relatively) high-functioning made it hard to diagnose at young. I’ve been able to cope throughout middle and high school but was forced to take action recently as my grades were at the risk of taking a nose dive (taking IBDP in itself doesn’t really help either). I was that one kid in school who would score in top 10% but struggle with deadlines, my teachers thought I was a perfectionist and it wasn’t until I disclosed it to my IBDP coordinator (english teacher) that they realised I was just trying to get by. I’ll be disclosing this in my UC applications, but not in CommonApp."

I interned at JPMorgan Chase this past summer and although, I got a return offer, I'm very reluctant to take it. I didn't have a great time and I definitely didn't learn as much as I would have hoped. They basically held my hand throughout the entire project. My deadline to accept the offer is in a few weeks and I've applied to over 45 companies - not hearing back from a single one of them. I've had my resume reviewed by about 10 people (various recruiters from industry, peers, family members) so I know that that's not the problem. All of this feels really hopeless and it's gotten to the point where even if I did get an interview, I don't know how well I would do. It gives me so much anxiety to even think about an interview that I can literally picture myself breaking down before or during the interview. Needless to say, this job search has diminished any last shred of confidence that I had. I honestly don't know what to do now. Any advice would be great. Thank."

9pqjqc,8,2018-10-19,Chance a Malaysian pleb for T20s. The international applicant status is messing my perception up and I need to gain some clarity.,LightningWolf150,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/9pqjqc/chance_a_malaysian_pleb_for_t20s_the/,"I have previously posted this on the ChanceMe subreddit, but previous replies have told me that what could have been a good application is affected by the international applicant status. As of what I'm hearing it seems like I can throw my application into the trash for being an international student, I need some help determining how much of that is truth and how much is a result of my own paranoia and anxiety. Along with my circumstances (additional info no. 3), I'm struggling to juggle the two question marks in my application profile. I do know that there's no 100% way of knowing, but at this point I just need some straws to grasp onto for the sake of my own sanity. 


Schools I'm applying to: Stanford, Duke, Cornell, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Emory, UMitch, UCSB, UC Davis, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Arizona


Background: Chinese female (Malaysia)


Intended Major: Microbiology


SAT: 1500 normal score, 1540 superscore (750 english, 790 math), 19/24 essay


Subject tests: Math 2 -- 750 (lmao), Bio E -- 770


IBDP Subjects (no APs offered around here): HL Math Bio Chem, SL EnglishL&amp;L ChineseB Econs


Scores: 40/42 + 2 or 3 bonus points. RIP Biology EE.


I'm taking the entire IB diploma program so there's no exact GPA, but I'd estimate it at 4.6 to 4.8 weighted.


IGCSEs: 8 A* 1 A


ECs:

1. Represented Malaysia in 2018 FPSPI conference (internationally recognised but pretty low-key critical thinking program)

2. World Scholar's Cup - team was top 3 in regionals and top 25 in globals, going for Tournament of Champions in Yale this November

3. 6-week neuroscience research internship -- research results will be published as part of my supervisor's research paper

4. Handball -- played to national level invitation stage but had to decline (RIP)

5. Taekwondo 1st dan black belt, taking 2nd dan now

6. Prefectorial board of 2 years in old school

7. Student council vice president in current school -- I'm in pioneering batch, so we're working on establishing foundations for next generations

8. Secretary of Entrepreneur club (2 years) -- raised &gt;10k profits in personal fundraising projects, helped a bunch of others as well

I have a couple other ECs but currently choosing which to include. I worked a part-time job in my previous tuition center that I became Ambassador for, does that belong under ECs?


Honors:

1. Academic colours (award given to academic excellence over 3 years)

2. Student excellence award

3. Merit scholarship award holder in current school

I have a couple more mini honors, gotta go dig them up because I didn't know they were a thing until about two weeks ago.


LoR:

My english and biology teacher. I've only known them for about 1 year. I've worked really closely with my biology teacher for my microbiology thesis, she knows my passion in biology. English went from being my worst subject to best, its a subject I worked my ass off for so hopefully it'll shine through in the letter. While I did have some past misunderstandings with my english teacher (see number 3 in additional info) that's cleared up now so I hope it doesn't affect my letters too much.


Essays:

Probably the the part where I’ll be banking on the most, and will be devoting a ton of time and effort into. I’ll be talking about my decision of switching my intended major to microbiology from marine biology, which was something I was dead set on since I was 9. In a nutshell, I couldn’t bring myself to pursue my passion at the expense of family welfare, which means a lot to me. It catalysed the discovery of an entire new field of interest, so it isn’t to say I ditched my passion entirely.


I’m not applying for financial aid, though I will pursue merit scholarships if possible.


Additional info:

1. As mentioned briefly before, internships and jobs are extremely hard to find around my area. I know many US students get the chance to do these things during their summer holidays, but here you’ll need connections, luck or an excellent academic profile to get jobs or internships.

2. I also completed my IGCSEs in 3.5 years before moving to a new schools for my last 2 years, which is why most school-based ECs didn’t run through all 4 years of grade 9-12. My current school is new as well, so they’re starting any extracurricular activity from scratch. It also means that student-teacher interactions won’t be that strong, which may affect letter of recommendations.

3. I was diagnosed with ADHD a month ago — cultural stigma and being (relatively) high-functioning made it hard to diagnose at young. I’ve been able to cope throughout middle and high school but was forced to take action recently as my grades were at the risk of taking a nose dive (taking IBDP in itself doesn’t really help either). I was that one kid in school who would score in top 10% but struggle with deadlines, my teachers thought I was a perfectionist and it wasn’t until I disclosed it to my IBDP coordinator (english teacher) that they realised I was just trying to get by. I’ll be disclosing this in my UC applications, but not in CommonApp."

I am the guy with sort of enough experience, the right degree but a little bit too late and kind of the wrong nationality. My background is in business administration and the problem is that I graduated 2 years ago which makes it hard to get into graduate schemes.

The rough breakdown of my work history

I got my first ""real"" job at age 19, started working as a quality analyst for a big FMCG chain. after 2 years I was even in charge of the 7 people strong quality department in the Netherlands for 3 years. While I was doing this all I also went to university and interned for an EU PM in Brussels for 5 months (best internship I ever had). Also worked for 5 different city councils doing various internships focusing general data analytics, researching graduate mobility behavior, prep negotiations files, and tons of really interesting projects for university.

After finishing university I decided to go traveling instead of diving into the workforce straight away. This is also where the 2-year resume gap comes from. Although I hate it to really call it a resume gap because it's not like I did not work or learn anything in those 2 years. I have seen over 40 countries and talked to so many professionals in 100 different industries about their jobs. Also did an enormous amount of freelance web development work building dozens of websites and applications while traveling. So now we have reached 2018 and I decided that I really wanted to move over to the UK before Brexit kicks in to gain some solid work experience and stay at least for the coming 4 years.

Got into the country and started working a tech support role to gain some exposure to the UK market and a few weeks ago I resigned from my tech support job after 4 months because there was nothing to gain for me by staying there. I am done with not learning anything the last months and honestly just being incredibly bored with the kind of work I was doing.

So now I want to change this up and get into an IT/PM consultancy role in the UK within the finance sector. The obvious answer would be to get started with a graduate scheme. The problem is  me not really being a recent grad anymore, having the Dutch nationality (Brexit) and also feel I got more to offer than spend the first 3 years pushing papers. I am already doing all the obvious applying by going to all kinds of events, writing letters etc.

So how would you deal with this situation?"
9pt0wc,76,2018-10-20,"I just had my Georgetown interview, here's some thoughts (and AMA too)",saltedfishies,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9pt0wc/i_just_had_my_georgetown_interview_heres_some/,"Sup everyone, saltedfishies here. Time to contribute back to the community that's making all my dreams possible. Feel free to ask me anything, I just had the interview so it's fresh in my mind. Here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit about me:**

International Asian female, applying EA. Also applying to Notre Dame EA. Grades quite below average, SAT slightly above average, extra curriculars okay. Interviews are my strong suit. The interview was held at a Starbucks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-interview things:** 

Georgetown expects you to contact your interviewer on your own to set things up. I dropped my interviewer an email and left my handphone number. I'll drop the email template in the comments, because I sure as heck would've like a reference when I was crafting that first email.

All other conversation was over SMS. My interviewer was fresh out of school (graduated 4 months prior) and was a very very very chill guy. I did google him (it isn't as creepy as it sounds I swear) and I knew a bit about which particular school he graduated from and was able to tailor some questions to his experience. I was more interested in SFS and the General College, studying Political Economy. Looking through google, I prepared some very good answers (if I can toot my own horn) to some of the more commonly asked questions. I barely had a chance to bring my answers up, for reasons that will be apparent later. 

These are the questions I prepared answers to: 

1. Why Georgetown? (Focused on both academic and social aspects, and talked about things I was interested in from online research) 
2. Why should Georgetown choose you? (Insert humble brag here) 
3. Why do you want to study \[your choice of major\] (I wrote up a chunk about why Economics) 
4. What are some extra curriculars that you have done? (A quick listing so I remember to mention impressive things) 
5. Is there anything that you want to mention that is difficult to mention in your Application? (I talked a bit about tenacity, the never give up spirit and how I try to give back whenever I can and help others \[case in point hehe\]) 

These are the questions I wanted to ask the interviewer: 

1. What class do you like/ recommend taking?
2. How is the school/life balance? Is it competitive? 
3. How is the campus spirit?
4. Are you able to assimilate to the weather? (Yes, this is a serious question I wanted to know. I am scared of the cold)

 I expected it to be a QnA session, where he would ask questions, and I will do my best to elaborate and hit all the points I wanted to talk about, as it seemed to be for others

&amp;#x200B;

**The interview:** 

I texted him that I had arrived (I was about 5 minutes early) and he said to give him a little wave if I see a guy in a grey shirt. Unfortunately, there were many guys wearing grey today, so I made a fool out of myself waving to a random guy in a grey shirt. Facepalm. But he managed to find me in the end, so all's good.

&amp;#x200B;

It started off with him introducing himself, and saying that it was a very casual conversation about Georgetown and you (the applicant). He said that he graduated from the business school, but he would try his best to answer about whichever school I was going to apply to. I think he really did not know anything about me other than my name, email, hp number and school (only because I used the school email to email him). If you have bad grades (like me), try not to bring them up because you only serve to shoot yourself in the foot.  

Now the interview starts proper. I won't be able to list it out neatly, because there wasn't one big question followed by my answer. The flow was more 'question from him &gt; I answer &gt; he will pick up on my answer and share his experience &gt; I ask him something based on what he shared &gt; he answers &gt; I ask him another question &gt; cycle repeats with him asking me questions in between'.

Even so, here are the 'big questions' that he asked me that got the ball rolling.

 

Q: Georgetown isn't a very well known school locally, so how did you find out about Georgetown?

A: I was a bit caught off guard since I didn't prepare an answer and I honestly forgot how I even found out about them, so I talked about the general research process and how Georgetown was well respected. 

Q: What extra curriculars were you involved in? 

A: Gave my prepared answer 

Q: What other schools are you applying to? 

A: Listed 2 or 3 other schools

Q: Is what state the school is in important to you?

 A: I told him I had never been in the US, and what I hear is from others. Each state has it's own benefits but I have a preference for more cosmopolitan states as I like the city more than the country side.  I tried to make my answer as balanced as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The list is honestly very short because, and I say this with the most seriousness, my interviewer talked more than I did. During the interview I was worried that I wouldn't be able to show my best side as there weren't direct questions asking me to talk more about myself. Therefore I had to listen very carefully and try to interject some of my enthusiasm/ prepared answers into our conversation.

For example, he would talk about the Georgetown spirit which is very strong and very close and that was what he enjoyed about Georgetown, and I would pipe in and say that it was reassuring to hear, because I value a close community spirit due to my time in my school where everyone was very close and supportive. Things like that. 

The benefit of this kind of interview is that I learned a lot about Georgetown from a recent grad's perspective. While at times it felt like he was trying to sell me the school more than I was trying to sell myself to them, I had a lot of my (good) impressions confirmed and that made me even more hype to attend Georgetown (and conversely more sad if they reject me). I also was able to ask a lot of questions, and had to make some up on the spot to keep the conversation going.

 Here are the questions and some answers he gave (in case anyone was wondering too!) (answers paraphrased but meaning is still there)

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How's the weather like?

 A: DC is relatively south, so warmer than half the country. 

Q: I heard that conflicting things about greek life at Georgetown, what was your experience like?

A: No strong frat presence as the school does not fund or support frat activities. there are student initiated frat groups though (3 or 4 only and no frat houses). Lots of other clubs and societies too, and those are easy to join 

Q: Is the place competitive? 

A: Not quite. Internships are competitive as banking/ finance internships are hard to come by and are naturally competitive, but students and professors are chill. He mentioned that Georgetown isn't ranked highly due to the fact that rankings are based on the amount of research the school puts out in addition to undergrad teaching stats. Georgetown profs are really much more passionate about teaching that writing papers, hence teachers always welcome students to go look for them to further their knowledge 

Q: I heard about the core curriculum, and that you have to take a theology class? 

A: Problem of God and Bible Lit are popular (he took both - you can choose to take any 2 classes from a long list). The classes there aren't very Christian/ Jesus religious even though the school is Jesuit. All sorts of religions are discussed, and depending on which prof's class you take, you will study different religious beings and texts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked many other more small, prompt like questions to get him to keep talking, which he answered and continue to expand upon, hence giving me the weird impression that I was interviewing him LOL. All in all, a very chill interview, where I had to listen more than talk (which is okay, I think).

At the end, he mentioned, almost a bit pessimistically, that this interview won't cause Georgetown to insta accept me or insta reject me, it's just a conversation for me to find out more about Georgetown so I know what I'm getting in to. He offered to put me in contact with other alumni who studied what I want to study, and also made himself available to me if I had any questions about the finance world, Georgetown, or other US uni applications. And that was it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some final thoughts:** 

\-Perhaps I had over prepared, so I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't give my prepared answers, but that's okay because I demonstrated my interest and abilities throughout the convo in other ways. In the end, they have to write a report, so try to give them something to write about. 

\-As I was doing a lot of the listening, it was important that my body language doesn't convey boredom or I'm just there stoning, or it would give a very bad impression as he was genuinely sharing his experiences.

\-Georgetown still seems to have a very low local acceptance rate. Only 4-5 in his batch were locals. Either no one applies, or everyone's rejected (hopefully the former). 

\-There was nothing on current affairs or anything too personal. He was young, so I found it easier to talk to him 

&amp;#x200B;

Anything I didn't cover, even small things like the etiquette of a cafe interview, feel free to ask. I'll answer as best I can.

I did a ton of neural network-related courses, but I highly doubt there are jobs out there where I can spend all day working with CNNs etc.

I also have 5 internships (which means roughly 2 years of full-time employment) with 2 research companies, 2 software firms, and 1 data science unit. Two or three of these companies have names you will have heard before. 

Additionally, I worked as a software engineer for about a year during which I was also the go-to guy for ETL things. Before that I had some odd gigs as a developer and I had a level 1/2 support job in my teenage years, which I did until about 22 or so.  I also was involved in a botched start-up with a couple of friends, but that was four years ago. 

I'm about to enter the job market again and there are a ton of younger people with the same degree who did not finish with the delay of years. The only edge I have is more experience.

So I’m kinda realizing CS isn’t exactly what I want to do, but I don’t know how Info sci is since it’s fairly new. Anyone mind answering some questions / DMing me? 

1) is there a limit to how many courses you can take in one semester? Like with CS you can only take 2, maybe 3. Would it be possible to take like 4-5 of the Info Sci courses?

2) How are the courses? Professors / Content solid? 

3) Job employability / internship opportunities? How have Info sci grads and majors been faring?

4) If I’m transferring from CS, what classes can I place out of? I’ve finished 131,132,Stat400, Math240

9pup4t,2,2018-10-20,What should I do?,exeoud,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9pup4t/what_should_i_do/,"Hello r/findapath,

Currently, I am attending a mid-sized midwestern school and I am not really enjoying it. I am a first semester sophomore, so this is my 3rd semester here. As of now, I am majoring in Civil Engineering. I have had internships the past 2 summers, and coursework in the major, so my belief that I wouldn't like the field based on this is not without substance. 

My current school is about an hour away from home, which isn't bad. However, these past 3 semesters have been really tough. I have suffered from chronic depression (dysthymia) and really missed my home support system that allowed me to succeed in my earlier years. The whole dorm life and college life is just not for me, as I have found out. I have made some friends, but there isn't really anyone that I click with here. The school is in a rural area, and is a big agricultural school, which probably isn't the greatest fit for someone who came from a large-ish city. This isn't to say I haven't done well academically. In my first year, I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA and should be able to get at least a 3.5 this semester. I'm just not enjoying my classes or my time at this school.

And so I have been looking at transferring to a school in my hometown. Because the school is a small, liberal arts college, it doesn't have a ton of major options to choose from. The majors that I have been looking at are either Applied Mathematics or Computer Science. It is conceivable that I could double major in these subjects, and still be able to graduate in 5 semesters, as I would normally at my current school. I have taken most of the Calculus sequence (I, II, and DiffEq) and have gotten A's in all of these classes, so I don't think the math portion would be too difficult for me. I am just worried about making this move and finding out that I also don't like this. 

I have not had much prior programming experience, which is also something that worries me. Both of the majors I am looking at have a strong base in computer science, and I am worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up. I also feel that I would be selling myself short by picking a major just because it would have the most transferable credits, and not something that I would actually like. The small programming that I have done, I enjoyed it when it actually worked, but it was frustrating when I couldn't figure it out. I wouldn't consider myself technologically illiterate, but I'm also someone who has not had much exposure to advanced computer functions and whatnot.

If it works out, and I find my true path, then great. But there are multiple things that are keeping me from committing to doing this, and I just want others' thoughts on it. Thank you."

I am a frequent user of this subreddit, but needed to make a throwaway (admittedly out of embarrassment). I am very happy for everyone on this forum that has met their goals or is even in a position to push themselves harder than others think they should. I am coming here on this throwaway account to introduce a new kind of student profile, although I am late to the party.

&amp;#x200B;

# Student Profile

* Race: White
* State: New York
* Major of choice: **Computer Science** or **Computer Engineering**
   * I chose this major not for the money or the great job outlook, but rather for the history that I have with computers. I built my first computer when I was only 12, and I have been fascinated with computers ever since.
* Class population: \~100
* Class rank: 7
* GPA (Cumulative on a 100 point scale): 97
* Class rigor: Took the heaviest classes that my school offers. This year I am taking three math courses: Statistics, Calculus, and an independent study in accounting. I am in Advanced Placement Biology. I have a class for every period of the day.
* APs: School only really offers community college classes. I took AP Lit (I strongly disliked the course, scored a 2 on the test). And am currently in AP Biology.
* SATs: 1260 (630+630) and 1270 (650 R + 620 M) \[OCTOBER SAT\]
   * I did not expect the English to go up, as I was solely preparing for the math. The math section I got 5 less incorrect, yet scored lower. This will super-score to a 1280 though..
* Regents Scores: 
   * Algebra 1: 86
   * Earth Science: 94
   * Geometry: 80
   * Chemistry: 80
   * Algebra 2: 84
   * English: 99
   * United States History: 99
   * Global History: 98
   * Physics: 84
* Extracurriculars: 
   * Future Business Leaders of America (10-12)
      * This club is my pride and joy. I was a founding member of the club during my sophomore year. I competed at the state level. This year I will compete again at the state level and hopefully go on to compete at nationals. I hope to put my school on the map, bringing others with me.
   * National Honor Society (10-12)
      * Event coordinator for many events. Overall, pretty inactive other then that.
   * Counselor for a large leadership conference (11)
      * Served as a counselor for kids in 10th grade to learn leadership and tolerance skills. Was asked to return this year to aid with computers, cameras, and microphones.  
   * Class President (9-10)
      * Developed a website with HTML and CSS development (used a repository for Javascript functions). Created fundraising opportunities (Including an event for pediatric cancer).
   * Baseball (10-12)
      * Played baseball my entire life. Dominated my freshman year on Junior Varsity. Got called up to varsity during tenth grade and remained there. I am a pitcher and a third baseman. Don't really think I am good enough for it to impact my college decision.
   * Technology Internship (11) 
      * During my summer between my junior and senior year of highschool I partook in a technology internship with my school. I worked in an office environment, as well as with the equipment that the students use. Closest thing I could get to computer science... Even though it is really IT. Was pretty cool though. 
   * Indoor Track (9,10,12)
      * I throw shotput and sprint. I was mediocre but should be a lot better this year after lifting for a while.
   * Student Council Member (9,10,11)
      * Organized events, helped with fundraising. Not super active here either.
   * Student Representative for District Safety Council (12)
      * My district picked one student to represent the student body on issues dealing with safety. I am that student. I attend meetings dealing with sensitive matters for our school.  

# My colleges of Choice (Ranked in order):

1. Stony Brook University
   1. Absolutely LOVE SBU. I visited recently and it is everything I could hope for. I talked with a major figure at the university about my grades, this person said that I should have a 1330 with a 700+ SAT... I am worried sick. I am sitting in an Artificial Intelligence lecture in November.
2. Binghamton University
   1. Right up there with SBU. Not as in love with it, but it is at the top of the SUNY food chain. 
3. Rochester Institute of Technology
   1. This is a great choice for me too. A great school, but is pretty expensive.
4. University at Buffalo
   1. The school really grew on me. I would certainly consider going here.

&amp;#x200B;

# My Concerns:

* I took the October SAT. This really destroyed my confidence, as I really thought I had the math section down. I just wanted to increase my math score towards 700+ territory, but my English went up instead.. **Should I retake and pay the late fee for November?**
* My regents scores in the math area are low, combined with my SAT. I really, really love math. I have always enjoyed it. These scores definitely make it look like my small-school life has been inflated in terms of grades. I feel like an awfully small fish in a large pond.
* Computer science is becoming *the* major to go into.. I have always had a passion for learning about computing and its applications, now I will probably be seen as a liability to programs due to my standardized scores."

I’m currently a junior BME trying to break into the medical device industry. Problem is, most of my previous experience is in molecular bio / tissue engineering with a bit of actual device design.

I received an internship offer from a pharma company last week, but I’m not sure if I want to take it. During the past months I found out how hard it is to land a position at a company. It feels like I either have to be a perfect match or know someone on the inside, so I don’t want to go down the wrong career path because it’s difficult to get a job in the first place.

So, should I take this pharma internship even though I don’t want to go into the pharma industry in the long run, or should I decline the offer and hope that I land a medical device job? Any advice would be really appreciated!"

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Have a bad job history, jobs won't give me a chance. I want to right my wrongs and get consistency. Formatting is off in resume because I copied and paste it.  Link to resume [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAoEpx2jfoGixJA6pv0SzzZ8IebaPBMHmcgUGm7gdBc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAoEpx2jfoGixJA6pv0SzzZ8IebaPBMHmcgUGm7gdBc/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a long post...just want to send a proper warning. I have been working since I was 16 years of age. I am now 25 and I have job hopped so many times that I am kicking myself in the butt. I have had unfortunate events and unfortunately I was always raised to just leave jobs if it is not ideal. I grew up in poverty, and my mom never held consistent jobs. Now that I am in graduate school and married, I am realizing that life does not work that way. I am interested in the field of public health. I do have minimal experience in research and about two years in administrative experience. I am open to administrative positions, but when they see my resume, I am sure they are overwhelmed. I even had recruiters who told me I would be hard to place. I had an amazing job offer in Sept but that was retracted due to the boss not needing me anymore.

So now here I am in the job search again. I tend to either make it to final candidate, or do not get jobs at all. I want to mention that I do have chronic health issues, and tried to look for remote work but I never make it as final candidate. I also want to erase jobs from my resume, but I am afraid of getting called out as a liar.  Below I will list the jobs I had over the years BUT I will not list specifics, that can be found on my resume. I just want you all to know why I left and how long I worked there..some jobs I will omit (such as fast food), because it was about 8 years ago. I will be starting from 2013.  I will also list my education and post my resume. This resume was written with advice and assistance from a recruiter, but since she edited it, its been more difficult to get jobs. Its sad that I edit resumes for all my friends and they are successful and yet here I am and I can't manage to edit my own. Thank you all so much in advance.

Education: Bachelors in Human Services Administration. Currently seeking Masters in Public Health and Certification in Health and Promotion.

Future goals: Be a health care administrator or a program manager.

Youth Mentor (Summer 2013)- Was only an internship

Assistant at Student Affairs (June 2014-July 2015)- Left because I was also interning. I wanted to explore advising when I thought I was interested in Higher Education

Peer Advising Creator/Assistant (May 2015-Oct 2015)- Was having severe chronic health flare ups and left

Residential Counselor and Teacher Assistant  (March 2016-May 2016)- Unethical place that was being investigated. Left due to danger to me and students..place eventually closed a few months later. I was also injured there and could not walk

**(Omitted Job from Resume)** Office Help (May 2016)- They needed help with a closing office, my services wasn't needed after a week. It was  a temporary position.

&amp;#x200B;

**Transitioned and Moved to another State**

Night Time Residential  Counselor Supervisor (June 2016-July 2016) Was an amazing internship that I really enjoyed.

Administrative Assistant/Receptionist (Aug 2016-Dec 2016)- I was late because bus routes changed.  Job was racist and treated me and the other African american woman terribly. Boss tried to insist I wasn't happy at the job, but I tried my best to remain positive but I kept being late due to the bus change (public transit was terrible there) and I also lost 3 close people in my life back to back. I interviewed for another position, and posted my job up. I quit before she could fire me. Everyone was shocked because I was a good employee, it was too many things going in life. She  had favorites, but I also couldn't manage traveling 2 hours back and forth. During the winters the  main road closed and it made my commute more difficult.

**(Position Omitted)** Verification Specialist (Dec 2017)- I was still severely ill and depressed and could not  manage to make it to work after two weeks there.

HR Generalist (Jan 2017). Still was severely ill and I had to pay rent and support myself, so I kept working, but eventually my chronic and mental health got the best of me.

**(Position Omitted)** Billing Specialist Remote (Don't remember the date 2017). Was only there for one week, the company ended up being a scam and I was  taunting people to pay their bills and the hard stories I was hearing was difficult.

Childcare ( June or July 2017)-Was having severe flare ups at work and the place was not a good fit.

**MOVED AGAIN**

Bunch of temp jobs that did not work out due to not being a good fit, severe health issues, and distance. These jobs included being a data analyst (had constant panic attacks), human resource assistant (got fired because I had an asthma attack during the first week of training), and recruiting coordinator (left due to unethical practices), and another child care job that was in shambles. These jobs all ranged from the dates of Oct 2017-Jan 2018.

Client Service Specialist Feb 2018-Due to depression gained up to 300 pounds (I am now close to 40 pounds less) but it took a toll on me. I had debilitating back pain and couldn't make it to my first week of work. My first day a woman also made a weird racial remark against me, and it made me uneasy.

Membership Coordinator May 2018-June 2018- Office drama, hospitalizations, and sexual harassment chased me away.

Aug 2018 Short term recruiting Didn't last one day.

Sept 2018- Had a job retracted from me.

I need some advice concerning my computer science degree. Currently, I'm taking 4 classes (and a seminar) and am planning on taking the remaining math courses (2 more) for my requirements over the summer so I can focus on them. Thing is that I came in with 20/120 credits and have to take 27 courses in total. If I'm taking 4 this semester 2 over the summer, I can take 3 classes a semester starting next semester if I take 8 semesters in total to graduate. To put 3 classes (11 or 12 credits)/semester into perspective at my school, I would easily be able to fit my classes into three days of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

Regularly at school, people take 4 classes, but many STEM majors end up taking more. If I took 4/semester, then I could graduate a year early. Another idea is taking 4/semester for three more semesters and take an internship (or semester abroad?) in the fall of my senior year to graduate in the Spring with the rest of my class.

&amp;#x200B;

Last, I could double major, too. The most applicable double major would probably be math, but I am trying to get my math classes done ASAP because I'm not a fan of math. I don't really have any passions either... Not sure how helpful minors/majors are in addition to a CS major in getting a job.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:

7 more semesters at 3 classes/semester

6 more at 3-4 classes/semester (+ internship?)

5 more at 4 classes/semester

or double major?

I'm a junior pursuing a double major in CS/Philosophy. I just recently started looking into internships and after looking through this sub a bit I'm feeling a bit worried I'm not on the right path.

I'm finishing the first half of our DS/A class this semester, as well as a mySQL DB class. So far I don't really have any substantial projects under my belt, besides a Galaga game clone (well, my crappy attempt at one) coded with a C++ library. 

The class for this semester is using c# and so far we've completed a maze solving algorithm and other small things to learn about stacks, queues, etc., but nothing big enough for a project.

So I have experience in C++, C#, and I used Java in a high school AP CS class, but it's been years since I've done that.  I feel as though I'm not knowledgeable enough for an internship yet, although it sounds like I should start applying for them.

Unfortunately, I work full-time outside of school to pay for housing, bills, etc. so I don't really have any clubs to put on my resume either.

Would I still be able to get an internship at a smaller local company with this experience? If not, what exactly should I change to make sure my CS career is in the right track? 

Apologies in advance if this is more suited for r/csmajors, I wasn't sure which to post in."

Anyways, when I tell them, if they decide to not keep me on. What is the best option for me to continue in my career in CS? As I have no degree I know it'll be hard but what are some things I can do now to help alleviate concerns future companies will have of hiring me."

When I wanted to apply, my main interest was AI, so I wanted to do stuff like Python, but due to shortage (better to say non-existence) of people who could mentor me I did Java. I learned a lot of things my studies didn't provide me and in few months I could land full-time job here. Although I like stuff I do, I feel like I could do even more doing AI. I love the stuff, loved it before my studies began, and I did few minor projects on my own. 

While I had my reviews and talks about future in company we talked about how there is a plan to do AI in this branch (in bigger branches there are some very interesting projects already being done) and if I have determination I could be made a big part of that plan.

I guess this is just my situation, and this could apply to any other combination of CS fields.
What would be best for me to focus on to show I am determined, and, when the time comes, to show I could work in different position that suits me better?"
9pyjmz,1,2018-10-20,Help manage new grad return offer,ngrng,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9pyjmz/help_manage_new_grad_return_offer/,"Hi all,

I have the fortunate dilemma of having a return offer from my internship really early on. The offer is very reasonable as I am from a fairly low-medium cost of living area. A luxury studio will not go for more than 1.5k and a cheaper not as nice studio will go for 800. The total compensation for my first year is around 85k. I got along very well with my team and the team is in a field I have interest in.

However, it is still not my dream job (salary growth is low, tech does not come first, etc.) or location (away from the city and my friends/family) so I would like to see if I can get anything else better.

A couple questions:

1. Do I have any reasonable way of negotiating a return offer with no competing offers? I am in the early interviewing stages with several companies but the offer deadline is too close. Even if I get a 2 week extension I am not sure if I can close out some interview loops.

2. How should I bring up the points for negotiation if I do choose to negotiate? Should I bring them up all at once since there are multiple? (Salary, Deadline Extension, etc.)

3. Is negotiating over phone or e-mail more effective? I am not the best on-the-spot talker but I am not terrible either. I am a strong communicator through e-mail though.

4. If accepting and potentially reneging is the way to go, how bad would it be of me to ask the company to match my negotiation needs AND renege on them afterwards? Honestly I'd feel pretty bad given how well the team and manager treated me, and my manager has kept his word every time in terms of giving me interesting work, giving me mentorship, and getting me a return offer. I would hate for my renege to reflect badly on him.


Any advice would be appreciated."

Any time I reference myself its just as anecdotal evidence

My background: Im an Indian American student with a masters degree in progress (top 10-15 program). Ive got two internships under my belt directly in software with a pretty good company. My bachelors was in engineering but not comp sci, my masters is in comp sci. My resume formatting and everything is pretty good, *however I have to break an arm and a leg to get responses.* My luck has largely been with small companies scattered in some of the tech cities (bay area, denver, seattle, Washington DC). I apply to 400 companies and will get less than 5 of any form of positive response (HR interview or something). However when I start contacting recruiters, or classmates working in the companies for referrals my luck goes up. Bottom line is I have to do the leg work

&amp;#x200B;

Friend A: Guy with just an undergrad degree computer science, two projects, starts applying sophomore year for internships gets one with a small tech company, graduates with one internship , gets a job at Cisco at around 90k. After one year he applies to a bunch of companies, fails every single code challenge sent via email (Facebook , Google, Palantir), he applies to Apple for a position requiring 5 years experience with his 1 year and gets the job. 

\-Side question, how does this happen? Arent there enough senior'ish developers who are thirsty for these kinds of jobs at apple, why did they settle for 1 year of experience? (No I dont think my friend is some prodigy, he may be decent but probably not a prodigy) 

&amp;#x200B;

Friend B: Guy just an undergrad degree, computer science, one project, sophomore year of college, no prior internships, hackathons, etc. His resume is basically College name, degree, project, and skills, he gets *every Big N coding challenge and onsite* and ends up at google. This guy graduates college 2017, decides he wants to travel around Europe from July to basically some time in winter, gets a job for some level of experienced position at apple as well. (Not entry level), with one internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend C: Some hybrid of friend a and B

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1) Is apple lowering their hiring standards????

2) All 3 friends are white, is there a benefit to this? 

3) My other thought is, Masters students, am I being held to a much higher standard resume wise because Im a masters student applying vs my sophomore friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Context, Im Indian-American (yeah with the dot turban and all that jazz), I have two SWE internships, I have 4 pretty intensive projects, quite a few skills, an undergrad degree from the same school as friends A, B, C (Santa Clara uni) , my masters from a prestigious program, references for all Big N's except google, a**nd I keep getting, ""sorry we decided to go another way),** actually awkward thing is Google offered me a coding challenge . Ive tried to apply for 1 year level of experience positions at pretty small low paying companies (70 k for positions in Seattle) and get nothing.

I am looking for some advice from students/alumni who have found success in passing their classes while also participating in an internship. 

I am currently a senior level finance major with roughly half of my classes including difficult senior level finance courses, and half of my classes being filler gen ed classes that aren't an issue for me.

I am also interning 25 hours weekly at my company that extended my internship after a 10 week summer internship.

But I want to tear my hair out and drop out of school. I am absolutely swamped in either my course work or career work, and have no chance to breathe. Its work, class, study repeat. It's even gotten so bad that I had to withdraw from a class due to failing the quizzes and midterm, even though I studied roughly ~30 hours for it.

Any tips, tricks or advice would be greatly appreciated. My graduation date is may 2019, so the end is close, but my spring semester is going to be brutal. Thanks!

I am going to be graduating with my undergrad in Accounting in December, and know that I want to get a master's degree. I have a few different options as to what I have been thinking to do for the Spring 2019 semester, as that semester would be my 1st semester as a grad student (admitted into the fast-track program recently). This is what I am currently thinking:

1. MS Accounting degree then get my CPA
2. MS ITM with the accounting electives i need for my CPA then go and get my CPA. With this I not only have an accounting background, but will also hopefully be proficient in IT stuff. 
3. MS Accounting &amp; ITM Double Masters. This is another route I have been considering as it would give me a strong comprehensive skillset for the workplace in the 21st century and will hopefully set me up for a decent career.

What do you guys think/have heard about both these grad programs in terms of competitiveness, job placement, internship placements, and overall quality? I would really like to do something in either field (although I am much better at Accounting stuff than I am with IT, i still very much enjoy and want to really get good at programming/coding/SAP and stuff. 

Job placement after graduation is the biggest thing for me/my top priority. I want to knock out my MS before I full enter the 9-5 grind. I have enough savings to support myself, and I also work part time. I am simply looking for advice as to what the best option is, or if there is another degree that I should also consider. 

Thanks

Apologies!!]

Chance me for some T20-30 schools.

So... back in November of my senior year I decided to take a gap year.  While some reasons are personal, in general I hadn’t taken the time to consider college and hadn’t started planning until fall of my senior year.  I took my first sat in October of that same year.  I was unsure where I wanted to go.  I also wanted a little time to focus on my personal hobbies (astrophotography, music composition, computer programming, mathematics, studying particle and relativistic physics, and drum corps).  In addition, some of the time I had planned was suddenly overtaken by the sudden death of my father, whom I am next of kin for and have decided to undertake the responsibility of dealing with everything relating to his death as a good learning experience in the sense of business as well as to honor his wishes (parents are divorced, he was an alcoholic).

UW GPA: 3.59 (top 10%)
W    GPA: 4.08
SAT:
      October 2017 - 1380 (660RW, 720M)
      May 2018 - 1420 (650RW, 770M)
      June 2018 - 1330 (640RW, 690M) (sadness)
Subject Tests:
      Math II: 800
      Physics 720
AP: 12 taken (maths and sciences + music theory are higher, English and history is lower)
      2: 5’s
      6: 4’s
      3: 3’s
      1:  2

My EC’s + Awards are not bad, but not super outstanding I think:
     -NHS
     -Marching band
     -Jazz Band
     -Astronomy club
     -District Band member for 4 years plus 2 years of all state audition eligibility (in other words a top chair)
     -College honor band member for 3 years
     -Software development internship
     -Great Computer Challenge 1st place (1st in school history)
     -NASA Opspark, placed top 5 nationally
     

At the end of my senior year I realized I had been taking my approach to the SAT wrong and began to study; however, I was / am (working on it now) rather poor at maintaining good study habits in high school and had to teach myself how to study.  Thus, I intend to take the SAT one more time and my current efforts have left me with a super scored 1520 (720RW, 800M) so far on practice tests, but I am working on improving that metric and have been studying to do such.

I am applying to CalTech, MIT, Princeton, UCB, Swarthmore, Lehigh, UVA, Virginia Tech, George Mason University, and some others. (Computer science and/or astrophysics/physics major).

I do not intend to apply early, unless I can get my with a 1430 at like MIT, although I know I can submit a score after I’ve applied for ED.

I also understand how important essay(s) are and are focusing one essay (the primary common app essay) on my involvement with the Eclipse Mega Movie citizen science project for the 2017 solar eclipse including the experience of the eclipse (all of totality was blocked by a single cloud which moved away afterwards lol) and the public outreach I performed regarding the eclipse with peers and individuals at the eclipse event.  Advice or suggestions / if you think it is a good idea would be wonderful.  I feel it reflects me as a person.

I know this is a long post with a lot of info and questions.  Thanks :)

So, one option for me is to do MS in Data Science in Germany. I am not sure, if I will get admission, I scored average of 71% marks in bachelors degree till now. Maybe, I have 40% chance to get admission in a university with low fees, and 70% chance to get admission in a university with high fees, and 30% chance to not get admission at all. 

Is there anything else I can do, to Learn and get a job in Machine learning? Maybe learn from Internet? Diploma?

I completed Andrew NG's machine learning course from coursera. He says, if you completed this course you can call yourself ""expert"" in machine learning. But he made that course like 6 years ago, and other things.

1.) What should I do next year? 

\-Go for MS? If yes from where?

They told me to come here for advice. It is a wall of text but I needed to make sure I had all the important information.**

Hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. Also, I apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

Forgot TL:DR

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

So 5 years ago I graduated college and was applying to PA programs. I unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so I decided to move to a big city on the west coast. I applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. I then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so I got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

The job I get was entry level but it paid well and I was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. I loved my job because I was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

I was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year I asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. I worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

After my first year there I still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. But a leadership position on afternoons opened up and I applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

I and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. I was told by the panel the only reason I wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe I would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

I agreed that I wasn't the most assertive person, but I would do my best to lead by action and speak up when I needed to. The panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

After a few weeks I got a call and was told I got the promotion I to the lead position. A few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" I told my manager and she said she would handle it.

We had what I thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

About 6 months after I took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. I was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. This took around 4 months. At that time I was accepted into a local PA program and would start the following spring.

I continued working when school started but much less than what I was before because of school. During this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. The only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job I was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff I was still able to manage all the work.

I finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after I started. At that point I needed a break from all work as I was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. I requested all of my PTO to be used to go back home as I hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. My PTO was approved by HR and I took off, I had 2 full months off.

During my time off I got a call from the Emergency Department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma PA, I was also called by our stroke unit where I did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. I was ecstatic because both the Emergency Department and Stroke Unit were places I wanted to work. I talked it over with my family and decided to work for the Emergency Department.

I called my boss and told her that I was putting in my 2 weeks and since I had a month and a half left on my vacation I figured I would be fine starting in the ED when I returned. I told her I was offered a full time PA position and she seemed really excited for me. I notified the ED that I would be graciously accepting their offer, and that I could start as soon as I got back.

My friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid I was quitting but I didn't think much of it. I said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

I left it at that, I was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. However, when I returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, HR did transfer me to the ED as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. My first day, my badge stopped working I couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. I went into HR and they said my previous manager said I wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

Odd but I told them I was now a PA in the ED and showed them my new credentials. They reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

The next week, I am pulled aside by my new boss. He asks me how everything is going and if I can swing by his office after my shift. I tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

My shift ends and I go to my new bosses office. He asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. I ask him what he means and he tells me I have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. I ask him if I can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. The first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. I ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. The third complaint was a HIPPA violation claim.

I was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when I was in my original department. The third complaint was when I went to clean out my previous locker and I was verbatim, ""Throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" It was the break room that doubled as out locker room, I was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

I went to HR because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. I was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing I can do. HR conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

A few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until I am fired."" And, ""He is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

I went to HR to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. HR told me they are unable to file my complaint because I am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so I should just drop it while I am ahead.

About a week later I passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, I'm surprised you're still here, I wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

I tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough I would be ""where I belong, out the doors""

I heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

I don't know what I should do because, I have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place I try and move to. Is there any action I should be taking right now? I feel like I should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

Edit: for u/commonWerewolf

Firstly, my manager was well aware 2 1/2 years before I left that as soon as I was done with school I would be moving on fairly quickly. She was very supportive at that time and understood because there are a lot of college kids who work in the department while they are in school.

My last full year in school we (my manager, myself, the other afternoon leader, the 2 night time shift leaders and the weekend leaders) sat down to choose another lead. One of the night time people wanted my position which my manager agreed to. We also took applications from department workers to fill the now open night time lead position and filled it a full year before I would be done with school.

My 2 months were approved by HR and then by my manager, we have to have double approval. She said, this was wonderful because she could rotate her new crew in as I HAD been reeling back my duties. The new night time leader was originally on my shift and he had gradually been picking up my work per my managers request to train in the leadership role, which he's excelled at.

My manager knew I hadn't been home in almost 5 years and that I really needed a break because in those 5 years I had a full week off for sickness, and a handful of random days here and there. Most of the time I was at work, didn't have a social life, that's ok I was a grad student didn't really need one. I missed out on a lot of things because I was willing to put in 60+ hours a week.

When I went on my vacation I was not expecting to get a new position but my manager was aware that my application was out and that I could get a call that I could not turn down.

Also, when I did put in my 30 day notice, I did call and I talked with her. I told her I was more than willing to start my 30 days when I returned but was told we already have the replacements inline and that they are working out well so it wasn't necessary to delay my transfer.

I have done everything professionally and by the books. I always conducted myself in the most professional manner I could while improving patient care. We had replacements picked out a whole year before I left. The two who took over are both in school and will be there for an extended period of time because the department works incredibly well with school schedules, that is why I stayed so long.

And yes I said that to my friend because I genuinely didn't care at that point because I had multiple okays from my manager to transfer. So I wasn't so beat up about her being upset after I had the go ahead to leave.

I would love you to respond again because I do agree with what you have to say and any insight is perfectly valid and wanted!"
9q37sl,3,2018-10-21,What is my chance?,RadiantMathematics,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/9q37sl/what_is_my_chance/,"Hello r/chanceme!

International student here.

So I'm applying Early Action soon to one of the 4 universities: Stanford, Princeton, MIT or Harvard. No where else.

and here is my basic profile:

* Year: G12, IB2
* Nationality: Canadian &amp; Belgian
* Ethnicity: Chinese
* SAT:
   * 1450 in May 2018: 660 EBRW and 790 Math
   * 1430 in Oct 2018(yeah I score decreased a bit damn it) : 630 EBRW, 800 Math
   * SAT Subject Test:
      * Math II: 800
      * Physics: 770(retaking in November)
* IB predicted: 38/45
* GPA: 4.13/4.8 (don't know why our school has max GPA 4.8)
* College essay: working on it, I'm going to see my ""counselor"" about it.
* Recommendation letter:
   * One from my Math teacher, she **loves** me.
   * One from my Economics HL teacher: definitely not my favorite teacher, but I need a socialscience subject. Apparently he is funny and kind to everyone, but he don't like me as much asmy math teacher.
* Scholarship: pending, probably not.
* Extra curricular:
   * leader of school project called Refugee Center Service
   * had internship at British Petroleum (BP oil) during summer between G11 and G12.
   * CAS 45 hours of service in G11
   * play piano since G1

What makes me different from all others:

Here are my advantages. I'm great at math.

* I took IB Further Math HL in **grade 10** and finished in grade 11 (IB1) with a 7 as the final grade. Only 200-300 students take that course each year and even less get a 7. This course have a higher level than Math HL, where everyone is struggling to get a 6 or 7.
* I also joined a small international competition for 3 years (4 if I'm going this year). More than 200 people from around 38 schools join it and last year I got two first places in the competition, individually (against the other 200 candidates) and also the team rounds (against 1 or 2 teams from each of the 38 schools).
* I have also done 3 online courses offered by MIT on edX with certificates of reaching a passing grade. Currently doing a 4th one. All these courses are at university level, and I actually got 100% on them, according to the system of edX (but there is no such ranking of getting perfect).

Back in G9, I got school champion and top 25% in Pascal Competition, and also top1% in AMC8.

Basically I'm a math person.

By the way, I'm 16. Yeah I skipped a grade cuz my math. Just so you know.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think I should go for EA/REA in the four universities given, and what will be my chance?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys so much!"
9q3cy3,1,2018-10-21,How easy it is to transition from survey statistics to data science?,malasi,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9q3cy3/how_easy_it_is_to_transition_from_survey/,"I'm a first year Msc survey statistics student, and enrolled into this programme because I saw it as an opportunity to move into data science (DS), which I find very interesting. I have another MA degree in political philosophy and five years experience in social policy analysis. My quant. skills and programming (R, and minimal Python) are self-taught, but I expect that the two year survey stats programme will help me get equipped with the necessary quant. skills. The programme consists of some math subjects (linear algebra, analysis, probability), statistics, and some programming (R, Python). 

Recently a researcher from a well-reputed research company in our region came into our class and invited the students to participate in a research project, where they would analyse non-response rates in household surveys. They say there is plenty of opportunity for research in the project because they have a huge database, and we could of course use that for our thesis as well. 

I like the idea, but my only concern is that I went into this programme with the goal so that I can transition from qualitative research into data science, and I am not sure how much such an internship and thesis would predestine my career opportunities. I already know, for example, that I would not like to work for the Statistical Office or a similar public agency in the future. (I am currently a researcher at a public research institute, and as much as I like research, I find the work-morale is horrible.) My dream is to freelance as a data analyst, or work for a private company where I can keep learning new things and which pays well.

On stats forums what I usually see with regard to switching to DS is that allegedly it can be relatively easily done, and the most important part of DS is math/stats anyway. There is also some tendency to present DS as something that is still evolving, multifaceted (and perhaps a bit over-hyped). In our programme, we are being told the same, and that irrespective of all the fuss about big data and stuff, the foundation of ""all of it"" is survey statistics (they say so:-).

So I was wondering what do ppl who actually work in the field think about this? Would you agree that if someone has a solid understanding of math/stats they can easily switch to DS?  "

As a matter of fact I know MOOCs do not hold much value in a resume, some recruiters even dislike them, but I have no internship or any relevant experience, so I kind of need to put these in my resume, and also because they are related to the jobs I will be looking for, so why not?

&amp;#x200B;

I am basically confused with what **heading** should I be using in the resume as to show the employer that I have taken this course online, because all recruiters do not understand the term MOOC and any kind of ambiguity in the resume will only be harmful.

Some points that I came across while I was looking for tips online are : 

1. Create a separate section named ""Professional Development"" or ""Distance Learning"" or ""Career advancement""
2. List them under the education section (this I feel is not a good idea because the idea of MOOC is relatively new in India and will thus confuse the employer)

Any headings, tips on how to post these MOOCs in my resume will be greatly appreciated. Thank you! "

I achieved **7A+ 2A 1A-** in **SPM** and the following grades in AS / A-Levels (scores in brackets):

**Economics**: A / A\* (91 / 91)

**Physics**: B / B (76 / 76)

**Mathematics**: A / C (86 / 68)

**Chemistry**: A / C (82 / 68)

\*I **retook** two **AS** subjects as my initial grade was **C (60)** for **Economics** and **B (78)** for **Mathematics**.

My overall results for **AS** will be **2A 2B** and for **A-Levels** will be **1A\* 1B 2C** .

I have also just received a rather average score of **1360** on the **SAT** in my first try (**670** for **R&amp;W** and **690**for **Math**).

\***My grades were not reported in GPA though.**

The change in my performance had been mainly due to my father's retrenchment and unemployment from March 2017 till March 2018 which caused me to take up a full-time job and discontinue school during my last semester in high school to ease the increasing financial burdens of my family. As a result, I had to prepare for A-Levels on my own whilst working full-time.

Moreover, my poor health condition due to severe Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) had also affected my performance throughout A-Levels. OH is a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down which had lead to me fainting and falling accidentally alongside a deterioration in my general health.

For extracurriculars, I have been actively involved in my high school's Leo Club, a volunteering club in which I organised and participated a variety of social, environmental and fundraising projects. I also held the post of secretary in the aforementioned club and received international recognition for my efforts in an international Leo forum.

I was also a an active member of my school's editorial board. I was the Head of the English Department and contributed a couple of writings. I wasn't able to do much while attending another school to pursue my A-Levels due to the existing financial burdens. I only managed to join the Editorial Board of the school and wrote an article as well. However, I was able to work in 3 demanding tech startups so far as a project associate, operations intern and operations executive.

I'm applying to the 22 LACs below for RD and **Williams** as my **ED** choice as I want to apply for need-based financial aid and hoping to secure a more comprehensive package:

\-Amherst

\-Bates

\-Carleton

\-Colby

\-Colgate Uni

\-Connecticut

\-Grinnell

\-Hamilton

\-Haverford

\-Kenyon

\-Lafayette

\-Middlebury

\-Oberlin

\-Skidmore

\-Swarthmore

\-Trinity

\-Vassar

\-Washington &amp; Lee Uni (W &amp; L)

\-Wesleyan Uni

I was able to waive almost all the fees applying to the above colleges by getting in touch with the colleges. So I have no financial constraints by applying to all of them. And I also realised all these colleges either provide full ride scholarships or meet the 100% demonstrated need for international students. Based on my SAT score at least, I found out on the net that Amherst, Williams, Swarthmore, Vassar, Grinnell, Haverford and Colby will be my reach schools.

With all that said, what are the odds of me gaining admission into any of the above private liberal arts colleges (LACs)? Would I be evaluated more fairly by admission officers if my extenuating circumstances are mentioned and discussed in my application? **Current students in the aforementioned colleges or alumni are also welcomed to chip in!** Do let me know if you need any further clarifications.

Intended Major: **Economics**

P.S. Despite facing many dips throughout my final 2 years in high school such as my poor health condition, my dad's retrenchment, losing my A-Levels scholarship and discontinuing school, I really hope to achieve my dreams of experiencing a liberal arts education in the US. So, I hope you guys are able to understand how much my college application matters to me and provide me with pertinent and impartial opinions. Thanks in advance guys! :)

I found out a company next to my domicile is looking for a Business Intelligence intern, and their only requirement was some basic knowledge of SQL.(didn't know what is it back then, I've learned basics in 3-4 days and sent a CV to this company, finally got interviewed and accepted) In the meantime, when I was trying to master my SQL and Power BI abilities my manager told me that I could try programming if I want to, because one of the developers left recently. I accepted that proposition, I also never tried and never saw a 'real' programming before. I liked it, started to understand the whole essence of programming. Unfortunately, I found out the technology I'm working with is PowerBuilder and it's outdated so it's going to be hard to go on with in my future. So I started to learn web development on my own (basic HTML/CSS/JS). I really enjoy this stuff, that's my main hobby for now, I do it everyday after coming back home. Yesterday my manager told me that there's 80% chances that I will have to leave the company after my internship so at the moment I feel like I will have to return to another shitty job... because my knowledge in web development is still too small to ask for a junior job or smth. Any advices how could I continue my career in IT instead of returning to my former life? (Main issue is that I have no degree)"

But now that I'm in the last phase for my undergrad  thesis and working in a part time internship (which increased the workload a  few weeks ago) now I'm unable to manage with the same ease all my  stress and I feel in constant migraine and anxious, which keeps me from  working and studying properly which then turns into more stress. It has  developed into a gastric ulcer, vomiting blood, along with some vision problems and  sleeping disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the main source of stress is work. This is kind of a dream job here, I'm working on two projects, part time, one with a team and the other one I'm my own team. The project where I'm alone is kind of important to the company since it has big impact on the company's name and image, but then again I have no idea why they put just one inexperienced intern working on that (this is my first job). A few weeks ago they told me they want his new feature, and they wanted it ready in 2 weeks. There is no way I'm able to do that half part time (again I'm on 2 projects there so half and half), without ever working before with the tools and technologies they expect it to be built on, and with my thesis exploding right on my ass because I've been going to work more frequently to be able to deliver something.

&amp;#x200B;

I did talked to my boss about that and he kinda arranged with one of the experts to ""help me out"". I say kinda because I still have to do the entire thing but whenever I feel stuck I just write the guy.

&amp;#x200B;

They did increased the pay, but without having time to dedicate to my thesis I won't be able to graduate! So I'm in the verge of dying out of stress

&amp;#x200B;

If you have some advice or techniques, apps, for relaxing/focusing/meditation I would appreciate the help

Thank you!"

I currently have an offer that I'm taking for Spring 2019, and I'd like to have at least two internships before I graduate. My anticipated graduation is may 2020. 



**Option 1:**

Search for another internship now for Summer 2019. 

pros: 

* I wouldn't miss another fall/spring before graduating.

* I still have a lot of time to find something.

cons:

* I wouldn't be able to leverage my internship experience in Spring to get something in the Summer. 


**Option 2:**

Wait until after my Spring 2019 internship to find another one before I graduate.

pros:

* I would get to leverage my previous internship experience to maybe get an internship with good name recognition.

* I would get to continue my research project through the summer.

* I would possibly have a part time internship during the summer through a local company with my professor's connections. It would be a small startup company. 

cons:

* This would delay graduation a lot. 

I'm starting to lean toward option 2, but I'm not sure if it is worth delaying my graduation by so much.

9q5eq4,204,2018-10-21,"I am a HR Staffing Advisor for a medium tech company, and here are my concerns with tech applicants from UofT",LeatherLeek1231,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/9q5eq4/i_am_a_hr_staffing_advisor_for_a_medium_tech/,"Hello, I am a HR staffing advisor for a medium tech company that has offices in our Seattle location as well as offices in Toronto and Ottawa. As a HR Staffing advisor, one of my jobs is to actually browse news sources and other information from the various universities we hire from in order to keep up with what's been happening, and this includes reddit. One of the consistent themes I see in the UofT subreddit is the lack of jobs or career opportunities that students from UofT have. 

We hire students every term either for four month terms, or for a full year (12 months). We regularly hire from UWaterloo, Carleton, Ottawa, Ryerson, Guelph, UofT and MacMaster. From my experience, UofT has consistently been one of the schools that we are not getting a good pool of applicants from. I'm not sure why this happens, but time and time again our hired students are almost never from UofT. Hardly any UofT student makes it to our interview stages, and when they do, it tends to be for the purposes of school representation. 

Where I work, I mostly manage the coordination of our internship programs, and the entry-level HR analysts do the resume screening and schedule our interviews with team managers. However, I decided to take a look at the submitted resumes for our last posting and saw a concerning trend with UofT submitted resumes (we receive and group resumes by university buckets, although this has little impact on our choice). 

Before I talk about that though, I want to talk a bit about our resume assessment. We assess our resumes on three main things. The first one, and the most important, is relevant experience. This could include other Co-ops or internships, good side projects, or volunteer work. The second is the compatibility with the candidate. We want to see candidates who have worked with our languages or stack before, or who seem willing to learn. We love candidates with a personal site that shows off their side projects. Sometimes, we take into account cool stuff like the candidate having some unique hobby like being a wedding photographer. The third, and last one, is what school they went to. And this doesn't mean we take into account their actual prestige or school recognition, but rather we try to maintain a roughly equal balance of interviews between the schools that students come from. So if we have 10 interview slots and 3 openings, we might try to have 3 from Waterloo, 2 from Carleton, 2 from UofT and so on. 

Going through all the resumes, I found that the ones from Waterloo tended to be the strongest, with applicants having a good amount of Co-ops done before applying to us. Carleton and uOttawa were a distant second, but still good - we see a lot of applicants with prior government experience come through here. Ryerson and Guelph also had good submissions, and we routinely hired from them. However, I felt that UofT resumes just seemed lackluster for some reason. We had to dig pretty deep to select the interview candidates for UofT, and I'm not sure how they would stack against the other candidates. 

Based on my screening of the resumes, here were my main concerns with the UofT applicant candidates:

- Much of their resume consisted of retail or fast food experience, and not much else. Our company tends to be considered ""mid-tier"" by most standards, which means we would normally expect around 1-2 previous summer jobs/co-ops done before applying, or a strong portfolio of side projects. 

- Many of their side projects were projects that seemed like a class assignment that had been modified, rather than a project of their own idea.

- A lot of resumes were quite long (2 pages), even though they lacked experience. We tend to see 1 pager resumes as the most desirable, as it shows a candidate can condense relevant experience into one page. Some candidates at the masters level submitted their research CV instead, which was not what we were looking for. 

- A lot of resumes seemed to be outdated in format. They would list references from high school teachers, contain an objective, list other meaningless information (interests, a list of hobbies without elaboration, membership in clubs, etc). 

- Many students seemed to be very focused on the academic side of things. They would list their coursework, their scholarships, and their GPA. One resume even listed UofT's rank in Canada. Their education section would sometimes take up over half the resume, versus the 2-3 lines we see from our successful applicants. As mentioned before, we don't take this into much account, if at all.

- We saw a lot of fourth year UofT CS students with no prior work experience applying to our 12 month program, which is usually intended to transition graduates into full-time work. We wanted to see candidates here with 1-2 years of experience. 

I'm not entirely sure if this is an issue with the school providing very poor career support resources, or perhaps the student body at UofT is more concerned with academia, but it seems to be a continually ongoing trend where I am. 

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments, and I will answer to the best of my ability. "

It's in the retail space, so I'm scared that there isn't space for growth in my technical abilities there. And it's in the midwest, where I don't really want to be as I have no friends/family there and I'm more of a city person. However, I haven't found anything better yet and my moral is pretty low from all the rejections from the big companies like Microsoft and Apple. The deadline is coming up soon and I just would like some life advice on whether or not I should take the offer and try to find something better later when I'm already working, or take the chance of being jobless and see if I can find something more in the tech industry...

9q6cik,0,2018-10-21,Should I work in IT?,MonoToc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9q6cik/should_i_work_in_it/,"I'm currently in my last year of high school (studying Computer Sciences), and college is right around the corner, but I'm still not sure whether an IT career would be right for me. It's the easiest and most obvious choice but I don't want to end up regretting it. Here's a couple of reasons:

1. I'm not passionate about it. I used to be in love with programming back when I started high school, then the hype quickly died after my first year or so. I was a straight-A student back then (only talking about programming classes) and didn't even have to study for my exams, but nowadays my interest is pretty much zero and a lot of times I end up just memorising code sequences. I've got no desire to learn new things related to coding.

2. I don't want to be involved in the IT world in general. There are plenty of meet-ups, events, places where so called ""geeks"" gather, and after a few tries I realised they're not for me. I'm out of touch with this community and I don't feel like I belong at all. I can't relate to anyone and the fact that I'm very introverted doesn't help either. I've even tried an internship and quit after only 3 weeks.

3. IT careers (especially software developer, which is probably the most likely in my case) are meaningless in my opinion, and will probably hurt me in the long run. Knowing myself I'll probably end up being bored, stressed, frustrated, and so on. Especially considering points 1 and 2.

So, is it worth it? Problem solving comes naturally to me and such a career would probably be my ticket out of this backwards second world country I'm living in, but I won't be enjoying my job. If I were to choose with my heart I'd go for a degree in something like history, philosophy, psychology, foreign languages, but I've heard they're pretty useless. I'm great at these subjects, and I actually LOVE studying them in my free time. I also have artistic hobbies such as drawing, photography and film making. My life goal is becoming a well-rounded renaissance man (sounds silly, I know) and hopefully I'll have a masterpiece with my name on it someday."

He has primary custody. The bio mom has been out of the picture for over two years now, spending time homeless, in jail, and now in treatment. According to North Dakota Century Code, the parent with primary custody can relocate out of state without going through the courts if 1) the other parent has not exercised parenting time for one year; or 2) has moved to another state and is more than 50 miles from the parent with primary residential responsibility. 

The most recent amended custody judgement (December 2017) awarded my fiance full custody and the mom one hour of supervised parenting time per week at a specific social services program in town. We have documentation that mom has not utilized this supervised parenting program since March 2018. However, my fiance allowed her to see the kids a couple of times this past summer (July/August 2018) at a park. Do those visits count as parenting time? Or do hit a year of no parenting time in March 2019? 

Also, the mom is in treatment in Minnesota, approximately five hours away. This is a court ordered stint in treatment. So I am wondering if that changes the situation? Can she argue she wasn't able to see the kids and was forced to move due to mandatory treatment? She also has five years of supervised probation in MN due to a 3rd degree drug charge. 

I am finishing up my doctorate program and will need to relocate for internship this summer and my fiance wants to move with me. I am wondering if our situation meets criteria for not requiring an order from the court. Our next step is to speak more in depth with a lawyer; however, retainer fees present an issue and I wanted to get a few opinions on this situation if possible. Thank you!"

He owns an decent sized accounting firm and is pretty successful. We dated in college but realized we were better off as friends. We lost touch during my three years of addiction and got back in contact once I got back on social media and got clean. 

He told me I should leave my old life behind and come to work for him. He said I could start as his exec assistant then go back to school (they have a tuition reimbursement program) and can work my way up through the company. It was a great opportunity. I decided to pack everything up and move from Nevada to the East Coast where his company his located. 

He failed to tell me that I had to do an actual interview. It was so awkward having to sit there and be interviewed by him and his other associates and act like we didn't really know each other. I don't understand! Then he admitted to me that there actually isn't any openings and they aren't really hiring but if I can intern for them for a few weeks for free, then he can get me hired. He claims he wants it to happen ""organically"" so he doesn't seem like he just brought me on for favoritism.

9q7f0v,10,2018-10-21,Withdrawing from MEng suddenly (medical reason) - how does student loan repayment work?,TizOut,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/9q7f0v/withdrawing_from_meng_suddenly_medical_reason_how/,"So long story short, I graduated with a bachelors in chemical engineering last summer and I couldn't find full time work in industry (took half a year off travelling though). I had a full 1.5 year internship and a 3.6 cumulative GPA. 

In late August, our school announced a brand new 1-year Master's degree in Software Engineering designed for non software/computer-engineering graduates, it honestly looked perfect for the change of field I was after (and it was perfect so far in terms of curriculum/content - I really liked it). Classes started 12 days after the program being announced so it was super short notice. I applied immediately and got admission during the two days prior to the first lecture.

So here's my issue: I've been having some terrible sleep issues since June so my physician suggested I use sleeping pills temporarily for 6-8 weeks (benzodiazepenes), making sure I wasn't going to pursue anything cognitively demanding in the next 2-3 months. When the Master's was announced, I was already physically dependent on the drug so it was too late to quit. We tried tapering me off at a reasonable pace but the withdrawals were so unbearable that I couldn't function daily - I could barely get out of bed to be frank. I could not retain any of the information that I learned in class or recall the logic behind most of the code that I was writing at the time. I genuinely feel that I need a week or two of being bed ridden to stave off the initial wave of withdrawals. [If you're curious you can read about it here].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome). The one I got prescribed is a very fast and short acting one which is why I got dependent fast (apparently highly abusable).

After 6 weeks of schooling and knowing it will only get harder from here, and also being cognizant of the fact that the longer I stay on benzos the worse the damage will be (and harder the withdrawals), we decided it's best that I withdraw from this semester and continue when I'm fully off the drug. 

I have 6 years to complete my Master's as per academic regulations (I find that really odd) so I can come back next year and just work until then once I'm off the benzo. Anyway, I applied for student loans (federal and provincial) and used that to pay for tuition, residence fees and a new laptop which was much needed. I purposefully chose to live on campus in order to maximize my productivity knowing I was going into an accelerated program with a cognitive handicap.

How does repayment work in this case - do I get a grace period given my medical issue? Official documentation can be provided by both my GP and endocrinologist, I'm just not aware of how it works. I couldn't find a concrete answer online and the support team from my province's student aid didn't know either when I called last Friday...so what should I do?

Any advice is sincerely appreciated and sorry for writing a mini-essay, I didn't intend for that. I cannot fathom that I am in this situation, I've always excelled academically but things happen I suppose and my health should come first for now I believe. I know that this is ultimately my fault and I accept that as a fact. I shouldn't have applied knowing that I was already taking the benzo for a month by then but I still went against my GP's advice because I didn't want to ""waste"" another year working in a field I don't enjoy. My GP only rx'd me the benzo after getting confirmation from me that I wasn't going back to school in September so it's not his fault. After reading my post again, I do realize this may come across as senseless whining but I felt the need to explain myself (and it feels therapeutic to write it all out).

Edit: forgot to mention, I don't owe any previous loans from my undergrad. I just don't have much in savings right now and would prefer to not borrow money from family. Worse case scenario I let interest accumulate and start working in 2-3 months when I'm able in order to pay it off asap. "

9q7sbt,25,2018-10-21,"Feel like I've been flailing around in the dark, but maybe finally onto something",pngitnom,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9q7sbt/feel_like_ive_been_flailing_around_in_the_dark/,"Hello everyone! I realize this may not be the best forum for a lengthy intro post, but I am also using this to channel my thoughts into something cohesive for review with my doctor this week, so here goes. I'm a 30-year-old professional, and I have been feeling a little ""off"" for about 10-15 years (symptoms described below). After the birth of my first child earlier this year,  it has finally hit home that I need to get this resolved before it impacts my career/family. I went to my doctor a few months before my daughter was born to talk about my lack of energy and mild brainfog, thinking the culprit was almost certainly sleep apnea. His first reaction was ADHD or depression, but he referred me to a sleep specialist at my request. I did an at-home sleep study which turned up no abnormal results. I assumed that it must be in my head, just laziness and lack of motivation, because I couldn't possibly have ADD (always did well in school, never the hyper type), nor do I feel especially depressed. I did not take any further action at that point. 8 months later, my symptoms are now the worst they have ever been (maybe due to having an infant in the house, maybe I am just noticing it more because my current job requires organizational skills). I got doing some reading and realized that ADHD covers a wider range of behavioral issues than just the bouncing-off-the-walls, can't sit down for more than 5 minutes stuff. The predominantly inattentive presentation, in particular, seems to fit my issues very cleanly. I am the sole provider for my family, there's a little human life dependent on me, and my company recently had a series of setbacks that will result in layoffs at some point soon. So bottom line, I want to go into my next appointment with my doctor as well informed as possible to hopefully push for a diagnosis, or at least an immediate referral to a specialist who can help. I am also going to request a referral for a full in-lab sleep study regardless of any other diagnosis. So, here are the main issues, which I believe largely point to ADHD, and some other characteristics that dont quite fit. I'm not sure what kind of response I am looking for here, maybe just encouragement that I can improve my situation, but all commentary is welcome. The symptoms, in order of severity:   


* Extreme procrastination
* Unrefreshing sleep. I fall asleep relatively easily, wake up a few times during the night, and eventually wake up groggy, cloudy, and unrefreshed, no matter how much sleep I get. I start the day at my lowest energy level, climb through lunch-time, then gradually crash in the afternoon. 2-5pm is difficult. 
* Excessive application of willpower required to initiate pretty much any activity, including hobbies and things I enjoy. I don't feel ""driven"" to do anything, I have to talk myself into getting started. 
* ""Brain fog""-  hard to explain, but it seems like the term is used commonly and I cant think of a better way to explain the feeling. It is hard for me to focus my thoughts. I experience an involuntary and seemingly insurmountable reluctance to get the wheels turning to work through a problem. I will mentally freeze up when asked a question. The harder the question, the more severe the freeze-up. I also feel like I am ""out of it"", like I am a step back from the present reality. I am not in the moment, I am just observing it from a space slightly removed. Basically my head is in a thick cloud and I cant get out and come back down to earth. Like when I had a bad cold as a kid, but all the time now.
* Difficulty articulating thoughts- I struggle to get my point across, bordering on stuttering sometimes, and my extreme Type-A boss  will often get impatient and cut me off before I can finish
* Easily distracted from necessary but difficult tasks (ie work), especially if done on a computer. On the flip side I can get ""in the zone"" very easily for low brainpower tasks like cleaning the house or yardwork.
* Short- and medium-term memory issues. I cant keep track of due dates without taking detailed notes and keeping a calendar right in front of me. I forget what people have just said to me, and I will often start small tasks and immediately get sidetracked and forget what I had initially set out to do.
* Fidgeting. I can and do sit in a chair for hours every day, but I drum on my desk or bounce my leg almost constantly, and have always done this as long as I can remember. 

There are other minor things as well, which I have always assumed were just part of my personality, but I am now beginning to question if they are actually related to other more significant mental issues. I get extremely anxious talking to anyone other than my wife. Friends, family, coworkers, superiors, it is not really any better or worse for any of them. I get nervous, jittery, sometimes wavering speech, even in casual conversations. I have presented directly to the C-suite of my company and interviewed 20-year-old college kids for summer internships and I experience the same problems with both. I moved away for work about a year ago, and the first time back around my friends since moving, I got all the same issues just hanging with them. I dont really have any desire to make new friends here, or even to keep in touch with my old friends. 

  
And the things that don't seem to fit with ADHD- I always did extremely well in school, with what felt like little effort. High school and college both. I always read that presentation of symptoms in childhood is important for an ADHD diagnosis. I was always a procrastinator, but I dont remember having the brainfog before college. I also felt like I had a great memory in school. I would read things (sometimes multiple times, admittedly) and be able to recall them effortlessly when it counted. I also dont remember having trouble keeping track of deliverables, although maybe that was just the difference in volume between real world and school. And finally, sometimes I do feel like I can focus on a task for hours on end. Sometimes it is researching  something interesting, sometimes mundane household tasks (mentioned above), and occasionally work projects."

A little background. I was class of 2020 and started off as engineering. First year I didn't really like the course work. Took CMSC132 over the summer of 2017. Took some engineering courses during in fall 2017 and decided that I wanted to do CS instead. Then I ended up doing an internship from January 2018 till August. This semester, I'm taking 132 and 250. I'm doing pretty well on 132 but 250 is absolutely killing me. I did really bad on the first exam. And I just estimated what I would end up on the class and I think I will end up with a D+. Best case scenario, I end up with a C which seems really highly unlikely.

So I'm def thinking about dropping this course and take it again next semester with 216. Do you guys think thats a good idea? because I really don't want to get a D and have to take it again next semester anyway?

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions cause I'm really lost right now.

9q98z5,237,2018-10-21,seasonal depression guide,cheekyyucker,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/9q98z5/seasonal_depression_guide/,"There's a lot of depression posts. Most likely these are due to the season change that happened over the past 2 weeks. Here's some tips to combat seasonal depression:

1: get out of your room/apartment as soon as you wake up. Go to a warm study spot with extremely bright lighting and lots of people (Ex: grainger).

2: exercise, preferably with a group of people (Ex: intramurals).

3: actually make time for the above two. Yes, that means taking some time away from studying, or not scheduling 30 internship interviews. If you work out the time wasted from seasonal depression, you can see that the anti-depression investment is worth it.

4: fix your scuffed sleep schedule 

5: accept that the above 4 tips will not go perfectly and there will be hills that make things really difficult to not slip back into depression. This one sucks, because generally you have no control over it. The best thing you can do is to try and set up a habit that you do have control over (Ex: see (1)).

hope this helps, don't forget to give yourselves and also other people a break if you even slightly suspect depression could be involved, it's surprisingly common (ask people how they're feeling regularly). "

9q9fu0,78,2018-10-21,I Work as a Social Media Intern,CandidDoctor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9q9fu0/i_work_as_a_social_media_intern/,"For the past year or so, I’ve been working as a social media intern for the \*\*\*\*\*\*\* City’s Department of Transportation. I work on a small team of 2 interns (including myself) and 4 full-time analysts. Most of my job involves posting about road closures, bridge construction, even bike lanes. We use Facebook, Instagram even LinkedIn, but Twitter is our most active platform by far. People always want to give us a piece of their mind when there’s a road closure or traffic. Since we represent the city, we always have someone monitoring comments to respond to any questions or concerns. People seem to appreciate how active we are. Whoever is monitoring comments logs into the office’s account for the social platform and posts on behalf of the organization. We never use our names. Even when we respond to comments, we never use any identifying sign-off or signature. We’re faceless.

We have a few favorites on Twitter. We have a list of our favorite users who think that they’re doing us a favor by responding to posts. But despite all the negativity, we do notice the users who are genuinely grateful for our work. We do a round-up of our favorite comments every month and send it through the department as a monthly motivator.

We’ve been noticing this one user has been very supportive of our efforts for the past few months. According to his Twitter, his name is Nathan. Whenever we post about paving or construction, Nathan always tweets back about the amount of effort we must be putting in and how it helps the city. We appreciate his positivity, especially on days when other users are more agitated and lashing out. But lately…Nathan has been different.

Earlier in the week when I made a post about new mural that the city commissioned, Nathan responded, “Beautiful job! It looks like a lot of hard work. 4 days well spent.” To most people, that would be an ordinary comment, but the reason that it’s weird…it because he’s right. The artist was scheduled to spend 7 days on it, but she finished early and only needed 4. I brushed the comment away, telling myself that Nathan had just seen the mural in person.

A few days ago, one of the full timers, Carlos, posted as soon as he got into the office about how bridge maintenance would require an overnight double lane closure. Carlos made a typo when posting, but instead of removing and reposting he simply edited the post. When I was monitoring comments, I noticed Nathan tweeted back, “Well, looks like someone could use some coffee.” I asked Carlos if Nathan was referencing the edit on the post, but Carlos brushed it off and said it was because the closure would go into the early morning. Something about it just didn’t sit right with me.

This morning, one of the other interns posted about a closure of a local road, and the comments seemed normal at first. The road was being closed for repaving, so we used a picture of one of our crew members smoothing the asphalt with a caption, “It might be getting colder, but our crews never stop! Paving continues 10/24 from 5AM-9AM on \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Street down to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Avenue. Please see detour route and details on our website: \[redacted link\]” The post was up for a half-hour when the other intern flagged me over. I quickly scheduled a road closure notice to go up in 15 minutes before walking over to the other cubicle. He looked like he had just seen something he shouldn’t have.

“What’s up, Jason?” I asked.

“I don’t think you’re very funny right now.” Jason said, trying to sound tough but his voice warbled.

“I wasn’t trying to be?” I questioned, curious as to where this was going.

“Running an account just to scare me? You’re so funny.” He said, his voice getting more and more agitated with every syllable.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” I said, frustrated.

Jason was exacerbated, “Why did you create ‘Nathan’ just to scare me?” Jason pointed to his screen to prove his point. I looked over his shoulder and saw that there were about 4 comments on his most recent post. The one he was pointing at said, “Commute’s gonna be a little longer with the detour, isn’t it Jason?”

“That wasn’t me.” I managed to say.

Jason’s face paled. He kept looking from me to the screen. “I live on that street.” Jason finally said. His gaze now not leaving the screen. “And they knew that.”

I took the mouse and clicked on the Nathan’s profile. I don’t know how we never realized; they had no profile picture, no followers, nothing. His only tweets were the responses to our posts.

“You’re overreacting.” I said, trying to be brave. “There is no way that they knew that.”

Suddenly my phone went off about the post I had scheduled. There was a new comment on Twitter.

It was Nathan. Three words.

“Yes, there is.”

We haven’t told any of our supervisors yet, we’re afraid they’ll think we’re crazy or that one of us is playing a prank. Jason is afraid to go home. Every time my phone goes off I feel my heart sink.

Help us."

Currently I'm reading/working on the art of problem solving and how to solve it in hopes of improving rather than doing code/tool stuff. Besides this, I am only taking school classes focusing on basic code/my precalc class. Will it pay off to do this and will being weaker on the coding side suck for me during internship searches, etc.?

I need advice or support on how to keep up. I haven't had an internship yet due to having to retake classes. Meanwhile, other students have had internships and are on their way to do great things. I feel like I am getting left behind. I feel like I'm wasting my time. I feel like I made a huge mistake. I feel like I haven't yet found my place.

I have literally contemplated suicide during tests, as if its easier to just give up than to prolong my inevitable failure in this degree.

What makes it even more frustrating is that all the students who have had internships explain that the real world job is 100x easier because computers do all the actual engineering work. They just have to tell the computer what to do.

I am no stranger to failure. But I don't want to come this far and have to restart with something completely different. Or even accept defeat and take a dead end job with a lousy 20 - 30k a year. "

I have a BS, majored in Computer Science with a double major in Mathematics. I was offered a Graduate Assistantship through my college for grad school. I'm currently doing that for an MS degree in Engineering and Technology Management with an emphasis in Computer Information Systems and Analytics. To pay my bills, I have my GA which doesn't pay all of my tuition and I also have rent so I'm a Sales Associate at a local shoe store making $8.00 an hour, barely getting 20 hours a week. I know I need to start looking for CS opportunities soon but I have no clue where to start. I LOVE analyzing data. That is always one of my favorite aspects of programming. I enjoy crunching data and using algorithms to look for patterns. My undergraduate thesis was researching algorithms to detect sleep apnea from ECG (or EKG) signals. My advisor says I should look into careers as a bioinformatician or data scientist. I have no idea where I could find a job like that however. A hospital maybe? I have a BS, pursuing an MS, I personally think I am a good programmer. My sleep apnea project earned me the CS student of the year at my university. I just feel like I have no clue where to look. Also it should be known that I have 0 CS job experience, like an actual job in CS. Some of you will say to find an internship but there aren't that many internships in that area in my location, my university is in a rural community. I'm not asking for a job starting at $60K a year. I just don't know where to start at all. Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance!"

I grew up in a nice neighborhood with nice people and a comfortable living situation, but I always longed for a change. I just kept telling myself once I turn 18, I’ll go to a college I want to go to, and my life will be different.

Now, I’m 20 years old, and if I had known my life would be the way it is now, I would’ve been incredibly upset as a child. 

In high school, my parents told me they wanted me to go to a local college for two years, and after that, I could go to a college of my choice. I chose to go to a college two hours away. I had fun the first month, but long story short, my roommate ended up being satan and bullying me. I ended up spiraling into a deep depression and suffering from a lot of anxiety. The next semester, I went to a local community college. I hated it, but it was cheap, I was able to work while being there, and with the GI benefits from my dad, the college is nearly free and I’m getting money for living at home.

I kept telling myself I’d transfer because I hated the shitty college. I tried living in an apartment, but my roommates were slobs who never cleaned up after themselves, and I decided the astronomical rent wasn’t worth it. Besides, my parents live 30 minutes away. 

So now here I am, I have 14 classes left to take at this shit college, so transferring anywhere at this point would be pointless. I live at home, and I try to avoid talking to people around town because I don’t want them asking what college I go to. While all my friends from other colleges are taking semesters abroad, I’m here, suffering from crippling anxiety in my own home. When I go to classes twice a week, I just want to leave campus because the buildings are so run down and depressing. 

I write as a part time job, and I’ve applied for internships in NYC and DC to maybe get a chance of leaving my house. 

Every time I try to talk to my parents about it, they just call me ungrateful. It hurts since my sister graduated from a college that cost $60k a year, while I’m suffering at a garbage college. 

I want to leave the country and never come back here. But I feel like I can’t. Somethings stopping me. I feel like I’ll be stuck here forever. I’ve tried multiple therapists but I can never connect with anyone. I feel hopeless, like my life will never change. "

So a quick about me: 

I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering (one major) at the University of Connecticut. I'll be graduating with a BSE in May I have a 3.2 GPA. I have had 2 internship experiences, one engineering related and one IT/Project Management related. I've also been working with my university's Server Support team since my freshman year (roughly 3 years if you take out time the time I left for internships). I also currently have a job lined up and will be doing a Technology rotational program for 2 years starting in July. Up until a few weeks ago I really wasn't planning on grad school but always knew I wanted an MBA. I really want to move into Project Management at some point and believe in having a holistic perspective of business in order to maximize results. I really wasn't considering grad school/MBAs until recently. If I do it, I'd most likely wait to enroll until Fall 2020 because then I will have had 1 year experience and my company offers tuition reimbursement. I also want to get started as soon as I can because I'd honestly rather not still be in school when I'm close to 30. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are below:

1. I would prefer to do an online MBA or distance learning. I'm really over doing school full time. Does an online MBA really look bad/not help in future applications? 
2. Going off of that, how important are rankings exactly? I don't know where I'll be in a few years, probably not local. 
3. If I do wait a year or two before applying, how much will it help my application? I don't think I have a strong enough application to get into a 'top-tier' school, I don't even know what type of schools I could get into currently. 
4. I haven't yet taken the GRE/GMAT. Does it matter which I take? Is one more preferable to another? 
5. Is it worth considering doing a MBA/MS dual degree program? How beneficial is it to have a MS and an MBA? If I get an MS, I'd like to study cyber security more in depth. Would this pigeonhole me to specific jobs? 

Thank you for any and all advice you can provide. Sorry for such a long post.

First some chronological background. I graduated in the august of 2016 with a Computer Engineering Degree and took a little time off to soul search after a few months, went back into job searching and couldn't find much of anything. Feeling desperate I worked at a liquor store near my apartment to have an income and a purpose. Eventually after a year got fed up with how poorly the store was run and getting back into programming that I wanted to try searching for jobs again. That was back in may and now we are in October and my situation has barely changed.

I have sent out over 50+ resumes but have only gotten three bites. I have even tried searching the entry level IT market just to broaden the search and still no luck.

Initially I had some hesitancy getting back into the job market from college. I had a bad experience at a co-op where I horribly wore myself down and berated myself and couldn't then keep pace with normal requirements. I've gotten better but also have been trying to apply to places with more integrated management and less giant corporation structures; However, even when I vary that requirement I still don't really get any takers.

Bringing it back to the present. I've been scouring threads here and people seem to say that usually it's the resume at fault in these situations, and if it's possible any comments or critiques would be welcome. I've sent it around a bit and had reviews done but not by many CS professionals.

Furthermore am I doing something wrong? I know the two year gap is by no means favorable but I know CS work is needed now more than ever before. The one thing is I know I don't have enough pet coding projects going on, but ideally I'd rather have the job I can devote the brunt of my time to first, rather then spend extra time sitting on chair coding and not being paid for it.

I've also even thought about trying to apply for internships but those are also hard to get into as well.

What do you guys think? I'm more than a bit lost. Thank you

If they happened to up and fire me today I'd be pretty fucked outside of finding another job at a hospital. While I love this part I realize I need to learn a lot more generic information. I'm not really a programmer at all, so I know that limits me.

I've been thinking about doing the Security+ exam. I know the CompTIA stuff is bottom level, but it's a start for someone who doesn't know anything about security.

Well, I had my Foundations for Business Programming midterm today, and got absolutely slaughtered even though the exam was actually very easy. I pretty much know I'm going to get lower than a B in the course, which means 99% chance my offer from the Big 4 firm will get rescinded.

I don't think I want to continue with the BAIT major now. 

Since I wont be able to start recruiting until after my offer officially gets rescinded aka when final grades are out, I was wondering what recruiting for Supply Chain majors is like in the spring. Are there enough opportunities, or am I pretty much screwed and bound to be unemployed? 

Any and all insight is very much appreciated. Thank you! "

RatemyProfessor claims the professor is caring but boring and my classmates who have taken the class before either claim it a waste of time or it's easy.

I have reviewed the course course listings for GVPT, Public Policy, and Econ but I feel that anecdotal insights might be more helpful to aid my understanding of the programs and guide my choice of program.

1. Generally what have been your experiences in the different major programs? What do you think are some limitations of each program?

2. Do non-profit/government/NGO employers tend to prefer any particular program? What fields are they most tailored to?

3. Are they more theoretical? Practical?

No matter how hard I tried (going to every class, I kept failing on my midterms in two of my classes that is.

Last Friday after getting two D’s on midterms finally I’d just had enough. I yelled and cursed in the air repeatedly. When I got back to my dorm room I banged the door, threw my backpack down on the ground and kicked it numerous times against the wall.




This is my phone conversation with my mother:


Me: Where are you?! Are you on your way?! I need to talk to you about something.

Mom: I just left. Whats up?!

Me: What do you mean you just left?! You’re supposed to have left like 30 minutes ago. What the fuck is taking so long?!

Mom: I was at work Steven. Is there that you'd like to talk about?!

Me: “You can’t be this fucking self-absorbed to put your laptop down for one second to realize that you have to come pick me up?! We could have been on our way back home by now. Hurry the fuck up and get your fucking ass over here.

Mom: Steven calm down.

Me: What do you mean calm down?! I’m so sick and tired of dealing with fucking idiots like you who can’t even be bothered to show up on time because they don’t even have the common sense to check the clock on their god damn computers. See this is why I need to get my own car that way I don’t have to wait for you all the time. Life would be so much fucking easier without you being so self absorbed and lazy. 

Mom: Ok Steven I'm going to ask you one more time. Whats going on?!

Me: I'm struggling in my classes yet again this semester. It just seems like no matter what I do, it never seems to work. I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I'm just gonna drop out of school and take out loans. Maybe I should just jump into the Kishwaukee River and end it once and for all. I'm so fucking done with life.

Mom: You're gonna kill yourself just because you're doing bad in a few classes?!

Me: Do you fucking not get it? I'm studying accounting with the hopes of getting a job after graduation. I need a 3.0 GPA in order to get internships. Right now my GPA is 2.8 and with the way classes are going, its gonna drop to a 2.6.

Mom: Steve I'll see you when I get to NIU we'll talk more. I'm in the middle of a construction zone. Hangs up the phone.

I continue kicking my backpack around and punching my pillow cursing and screaming rages. I have a good relationship with both of my parents. Normally, I wouldn't yell at them (or anyone). I'm a very calm person, but today I just lost it. IF anyone kept failing tests despite attending all of your classes you'd feel the same way.

Should I drop?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi r/advice, 

Just to preface a little bit, this is my first post to this sub so sorry if there are any formatting rules I'm breaking.

So here's my problem:

I'm a 18 year old sophomore Computer Science Engineering student at my university, and all of last year I've been having a gut feeling that the field isn't for me, but I wanted to push through until this upcoming summer when I was supposed to intern to see if I actually disliked the field. having said that, my course load for this fall has completely caught me off guard and I'm struggling through concepts that my classmates seem to pick up very easily, and the professors are no help, they have a figure it out on your own mentality unfortunately. 

For the life of me I cannot figure out Java and coding and all that higher level math, and the deeper into classes I get the further behind I find myself due to the speedy nature of the classes. 

On top of this I am strictly relying on scholarships to continue through school as myself and my family cannot afford tuition. I need to maintain 27 credit hours and a 3.0 GPA by the end of the Spring semester to keep the scholarships.

I went into this field mainly because I like technology and it pays well. However at this point I would rather be doing something that doesn't make me feel miserable even if the pay is less, and I've always been very interested in editing and graphic design. I found my school offers majors in film, digital marketing, animation, etc.. things I would love to learn how to do and pursue in a career. I've met with advisors and I think I'm gonna make the switch to something along those lines.

The big problem I'm facing is getting through my current classes, I'm doing very poorly in my coding class and I don't want to take a huge GPA hit because of it. I can drop it, however I will be part time for this semester and will have to take 19 credit hours next semester to maintain funding, although the classes will be intro to business classes and other electives. 

I don't want to rely entirely on doing well next semester, but I know my GPA will drop more if I keep the current coding class. I've talked to advisors and they have set me up with a predicted course load for next semester if I make the switch, but that isn't including the extra hours I'd have to make up. Dropping will also allow me to pick up a job until the start of next semester.

My parents aren't really in the picture to help me with these decisions, its more or less ""up to me to decide whats right for me"" but to be honest I feel really helpless and stressed about the whole thing especially since this is deciding the career path my life will take. I could really use some advice. 

Thank you if you read this whole thing, sorry if it seemed like I was ranting.

9qkcsi,16,2018-10-22,"Two years in, and very uncertain about how much more I need to do to be employable",honeypuppy,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/9qkcsi/two_years_in_and_very_uncertain_about_how_much/,"I started learning Python two years ago. After a slow start, I’ve become more productive this year (though perhaps still not as much as I’d like) with the help of various productivity systems. I’ve focused less on trying to systematically learn Python through courses and more through personal projects.

However, I’m left feeling very uncertain about my abilities and how much more work I need to go to be employable. I’m concerned I could spend another two years without a clear direction and still be some way off.

To see an example of my code: by far my biggest project is my [Badminton Matchmaker](https://github.com/Platos-Cave/Badminton_Matchmaker), a GUI I created for and use in my social badminton club to automatically make up games based on an algorithm I designed. ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/8r8bss/i_made_a_tkinter_gui_for_automatically_creating/) is a link where I explain it further).

I know right away it’s not professional quality - it lacks unit tests, is organised rather poorly, and isn’t very extensible, areas I know I need to work in. (Also, I’m aware there’s not a big market for Python desktop GUIs). 

But I’m pretty happy with the quality of games it produces - and I’m enheartened by the fact that two professional programmers who were also club members and were each (independently) going to produce their own version couldn’t come up with a better algorithm. One of them even suggested my approach would be too slow, so I must have at least some knack for efficiency given it makes games in &lt;0.1 seconds.

As for online courses: some I’ve completed include a Data Structures and Algorithms course and a Introduction to Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy. I’ve also gotten a few weeks into Andrew Ng’s [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome), but I think I need a better grasp of math to go any further. (However, my matchmaker has similarities to a [recommender system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system), which seem interesting to me and require Machine Learning).

Also, I’m not dead-set on a developer position. I wouldn’t mind something programming-adjacent (like data analyst), or I could make do with something like an internship if necessary. 

But I have very little idea if I’m at a point closer to “just learn XYZ and do ABC in the next couple of months and you’ll be good” or “if it’s taken you two years to get to *that*, you must be such a slow learner that you’re at least two *more* years away at that pace”.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

My Ex just broke up with me and told me that she's seeing another guy, mainly because of my life choices.  
Let me elaborate on my Background and last 4-year long relationship.

I'm the first one of my family to graduate HS and one of the few of my high school who went to a college. And probably the only one who managed to get into a elite university since the founding of my school.

Also, I'm 21 years old and just received an Full Time offer for an investment banking role in London (I'm from a small European country), however, my ex already began seeing the new guy during my internship because I only had time for her when I came back home. (She literally expected me to call her during work and responds to her texts within minutes)

Actually, she started to become cold towards me when I started studying at a ""elite"" school, which was multiple hours away from home, instead of just working a regular job or choosing the local community college/state school. Furthermore, she told me I changed and was frustrated because I was focusing too much on my education/career instead of doing drugs with her dumb and unemployed friends.  
She then told me that she's a disgrace for me because she only barely passed her GED (equivalent) and decided that she wants to drop out of the local college (because she thinks it's too difficult). She only did the GED and enrolled in college because I put a lot of pressure on her (which is true).

Also, she wanted to get married in the next one or two years and get children. And this is just not possible with my plans. Now she's f\*\*\*ing an 18-year-old (WTF?!) HS drop out who works as a construction worker.

I just wanted to get this out. I feel fucking lost, especially now since I'm going to move abroad and don't know anyone (besides other interns). Do you guys have any tips on how I should approach the future? I'm extremely grateful for all your advice!"

9qkjmy,3,2018-10-22,Competition among student teachers?,-greenleaf-,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/9qkjmy/competition_among_student_teachers/,"Preemptive apologies if anything in this is unclear.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a college senior in my second semester of student teaching. At the elementary school I am assigned to, there are six other student teachers. There are also eight student teachers at another local school, with whom we share a college class schedule as a cohort. We go to our classes on Mondays and Tuesdays. Wednesday is an optional student teaching day, and Thursday and Friday are the mandatory days. We also have a seminar with a supervisor from our university every Thursday morning, who also evaluates some of our lessons over the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

The environment can feel... strained, to say the least. My mentor teacher is great, the school is part of a fantastic community, and I think the world of my students. I'm trying my hardest to run my own race and focus on improving my teaching. However, the environment among my colleagues has made it difficult to focus on my goals alone, and it doesn't feel healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, eleven out of twenty-four teachers at the school quit. Three out of six student teachers were hired after they graduated. I think that there's an underlying fear of being jobless in all of us, and it shows. Our last supervisor told us to think of student teaching as a ""three-semester long interview"". (I absolutely understand emphasizing professionalism and giving it our all, but I'm not sure if this is the best outlook to have on a student teaching experience. Maybe that's just me. Am I alone in thinking this?) Now, it feels like we all compete with each other to see who can do the best to impress the staff. The environment has grown toxic. There is constant gossip in our classes, one-upping and passive aggressiveness during seminars, and it's unnerving.

&amp;#x200B;

Who can come in on the most Wednesdays? Who can attend the most school events? Who's getting the best grades in our classes? Who gets here the earliest and leaves the latest? Who is getting the best scores for their evaluations? Who has quit their job to student teach? Who has the best lesson plans and ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying not to feed into it, but I have to admit that it's spiking my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

One girl in particular has really been pushing the rest of us around. She asks us highly invasive questions about our grades, evaluation scores, and mentor teacher feedback. She argues with the supervisor, puts down other people's ideas, and even gossips about her students and other teachers. Admittedly, she's a hard worker. But I'm tired of her expecting everyone else to kowtow to her attitude, and I don't know how to stand up to her without making the problem worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to work as hard as I can toward student teaching. It's my priority. I want to improve as much as I can this year so that I can be the best teacher I possibly can for my future students. But ultimately, this is a learning experience and internship position. I would love to contribute more to the school and community, but I also have expenses that I need to pay for. I have a full class schedule because student teaching didn't fulfill the credits I need to keep my scholarship. I can't drop classes, and I can't quit my job. Tiring and time consuming as it is, I can't afford to go the rest of the year without an income. I'm coming in all the Wednesdays I don't work. I'm brainstorming ideas for lessons. I'm taking the feedback from my supervisor and mentor teacher and learning from it. I love teaching, and I look forward to seeing my students every week. But I'm tense. Constantly questioning whether or not I'm good enough, if I'm just screwing up, if I'm not working hard enough, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I'm making sense here. I want to contribute as much as I can for the sake of my students and my learning experience, but the competitive aura in the cohort of student teachers is making it incredibly stressful. I try not to share my scores out loud, but when everyone seems to be discussing them out loud, it's hard not to compare myself to them. It's hard to run my own race. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this sounds... valid. "

I graduated in May this year with a bachelors in computer science and completed a data analyst internship this summer. I did another data analyst internship during my senior year.

9qlb6s,1,2018-10-22,In a bit of a tough situation. Wanting to renege on a job offer,throwaway_ovo_xo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9qlb6s/in_a_bit_of_a_tough_situation_wanting_to_renege/,"So, I'm currently a senior in college looking to graduate around May. A couple weeks ago, I accepted a return offer for full time from the company I interned at over the summer. To be honest, I regret it- the company only gave me a couple weeks, with extension, to decide, and essentially put me in a high pressure situation to accept the somewhat lowball offer out of fear that I wouldn't necessarily find a better job later on. Well, it turns out a couple companies I interviewed with around that time just got back to me, and I got an offer from my dream company. Now I'm in a pickle because I'm stuck having accepted an offer for a company I'm not crazy about, and I really don't want to turn down my dream company.

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered it for a while, and I think I'd be okay with reneging on the previous offer, just this time. The only issue with this is that since I worked with my old company over the summer, my dream company will likely reach out to them for a background check/employment verification. If I renege on them, I'm concerned they'll let my dream company know of this in the check, and suddenly I've lost both offers. One prevalent background check service (HireRight) mentioned directly that it *may* check for things like employee personality, mode of living, behavior, etc. on a HireRight contract I've seen. However, I've also heard such checks only go through HR most of the time, rather than also contact previous managers. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: is it worth the risk to renege on my old company and accept the new offer? Some options I'm considering:

* Renege on old company first, then accept new offer
* Accept new offer, then renege on old company: 
   * benefit may be that my previous company isn't aware of my reneging until it's ""too late,"" and won't badmouth me 
   * carries the risk that the verifier calling the old company might tip them off that I'm about to accept a new offer, and should they mention the purpose of the check, my old company could mention the contradiction that I'm scheduled to start a new job with them.
* use an excuse to try and get out of old company some other way, that makes it seem like I'm not reneging to accept another offer
* apply to future dream companies leaving my internship off my resume, so it's not checked for
* suck it up, work at my old company, and try my luck with jobs again in a year (though a year potentially filled with some regret and resentment)

I'm really stuck on this issue, so if anyone has advice/experience with this, I'd really appreciate it. I know reneging is honestly not a wise or respectful thing to do, and it's not something I consider lightly, but in this scenario I feel like it's appropriate for me to try and look out for my own career, especially considering the way my old company put pressure on me to accept their offer as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

\--- High School --- 

\- ""If I want to escape this small town, and let people know that I am different, I need to get into a top 10 school.""

\- (After working 5 hours on homework every night after mock trial practice: ""I don't have the grades...I'm stupid. I'm depressed. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I can't get in anywhere.""

\- ""I might as well apply....I probably won't even check if I get accepted because I'm too nervous.""

\- (Best friend's dad died the day before common app due, I barely even text him because I'm too stressed about hitting the deadlines)

\- (Look at email, see rejection for early decision, heart shatters and panic attack rises as I sit in mock trial practice, an extra curricular that kills me every day, but I'm only doing because I want to get into these schools.)

\-  My parents are going to be so embarrassed of me (they’re not). I'm going to kill myself. (I won’t.)

\- Day of Ivy admissions letters, I get 4 rejections. Last email I opened, accepted. I burst into tears and call it the happiest day of my life.

\- I vow that the next 4 years will be different, that I am worth something and will prove myself. That it wasn't a fluke.

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Freshman year ---

\- I have so much energy, I have so much to prove. I will go to the library the first day of school, even without homework. Just because I want to stay on top of everything.

\- Things go so well! I commit to extracurriculars, feel smart. 

\- On the inside, it's a battle. I work out every day, sleep 8 hours, not because I am content, but because I feel that if I get behind, If I am not perfect, I will crumble. 

\- I do a hackathon. I somehow win, and suddenly feel like one of the ""computer science kids."" This means there is no doubt in my mind I will either work for Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, Dropbox, MongoDB, Two Sigma, or Jane Street. I have no idea what any of those companies actually work on all day long, but I feel like it is uncool if I am not interested in those companies.

\--- Sophomore year ---

\- Somehow, while I was enjoying my summer, everybody else in CS stepped up their game, and are all now worried about internships.

\- This is college acceptance part 2. Am I smart enough to get an internship? Instead of school rank, it is prestige, monthly salary, return offers that count. 

\- Without even realizing it, I begin to believe that the end goal is money.

\- Halfway through the semester, I have a full blown panic attack after working 100 hours a week, my vision turns purple, I get dizzy and fall over, and I lay in bed for two days. I ball my eyes out as I realize I will have to drop a class. 

\--- Junior year ---

\- I apply for 40 internships. I get rejected flat out from 38. I feel suicidal, and embarrassed. Everybody else, it seemed, was getting accepted to Google. 

\- On the outside, people are friendly and accepting, but on the inside, I muse, everybody is a cutthroat, social  climbing snake. Really, I am just insecure about my inadequacies. People probably aren't even thinking about you, except to worry about how they shape up as well.

\- I somehow land a great internship. I get to san francisco, walking over heroin needles on my way to work and pretending like this is the utopia people sell you at career fairs. I hate my internship. Somehow I blame it on myself, and not on the dystopic environment of silicon valley. 

\- I think, If I stick with it, I will prove myself. I will be deserving of this legacy that I have built. 

\- On the inside, ALL THERE IS IS IMPOSTER SYNDROME. 

\--- Senior Year ---

\- I don't get a return offer. I scramble, applying for 15 jobs based solely on prestige. I get two offers, excited and giddy about the golden handcuffs that I will be falling into.

\- I look back on the four years, and realize with sadness that I had missed out on social interaction for the sake of proving to my friends that I was smart. At the end, I barely had friends to show. After that sacrifice, I still feel stupid. 

\- I graduate, alumni parade down the campus, cheering and applauding, telling us how excited they are for us. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  I do both.

\- I wonder, is this a new era in America? are colleges actually harsher than my parent's generation? or am I weak?

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Post Grad ---

I'm 30 and currently live in France. I've started studying web development in college since i wanted a change of career . I should be done in about 2 years even though i might try and get an engineering degree after, not sure about that. Right now i'm studying html/css/js as well as java and sql. Wife is american and might want to relocate closer to her family in texas once i graduate. Probably in/near a city like dallas, waco or austin. What should i learn to have the best chances to get hired in a junior position ? What's the pay range ? Is the fact that i've never worked in the industry at my age a deal breaker ?

Intended Major: Astronomy/Math  Additional study interests: International Relations   


**SAT**: 1550 (750 EBRW, 800 Math) Essay:7/7/7   
**SATII**: Physics, Chem and Math2 (all 800)   


**GPA**: I'm not sure how they calculate, but I gave 4 A-levels and one AS, and I got 4 A\* (Physics, Chemistry, Math, CompSci) and a B in English Language. Before A-levels, CBSE board (lmao I've been a nomad) where I got straight A's. 

Income bracket (I think this will be my downfall): Will definitely need almost full aid 

*(i'm sorry if i'm coming off as boastful but I'm really academically inclined)*   


**Extracurricular activities:**   


Participated in various Science and Mathematics Olympiads since like middle school, notable ones include 1st positions in an Astronomy Olympiad (national level) on two occasions and Honorable mentions at the international equivalent of the Astronomy Olympiad, both twice. This year I joined the committee that organizes the Olympiad as a tutor, so I've been helping students prepare.     


Debating, MUN and Science club at school, quite active in all three. Focused on MUNs alot in junior and senior year, so about 8 participations (this is where I got an interest in IR). Science club conducted some extra-help classes for juniors.   


I was involved in a lot of writing too,  mostly Science and IR related throughout school. I was chief editor of the school magazine, did some writing on online blogs too which lasted for about 3 months (they promised to pay me but didn't  :( ).   


I have taken a gap year in which I'm currently doing an internship at a research institute, doing for about 4 months now, um mostly remote sensing and drought analysis. At the same time, I have taken up a temporary position as teacher in a local school mostly comprising of underprivileged students, where i teach them Math, Comp Sci and Science (been doing this for about 2 months now).  


I also took part in a lot of foreign exchange trips back in the first year equivalent of high school, mainly through PASCH's German language program. I'm not sure if this is very important though lol.   


**Recommendations:**   


I'm not sure about them, but I think the teacher and the peer recommendations are going to be really good.   


**Essays:**   


They are decent.   


Thank you for reading through all this (forgive me if I come off negatively in any way). Any advice is appreciated :)

9qopmf,1,2018-10-23,Did I do the right thing by walking away?,Jass1995,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9qopmf/did_i_do_the_right_thing_by_walking_away/,"Hey everyone. Could use some advice on something that's come up again recently from my not too distant past.

First, Story Time.

I had this friend, we'll call D. D seemed like a nice enough guy, who at times pushed my buttons, but was otherwise pretty chill to hang with. We've gone drinking and partying and spent time with each other. I guess you could say we were good friends at minimum? Anyway, fast forward a couple years to this year. 

Earlier this year, there was a party with some juniors and he got invited. Being the kind of guy I am, I declined his invite because I didn't wanna crash the party. At the same time, this girl I liked, we'll call R, was also going. I didn't mind. They'd be closer, being from the same batch and all. The night wore on and I got a call from D asking me to pick R up. She was wasted. I drove her to a nearby fast food joint to sober her up a little. I let her off, then once I'm back in my room, I give a call to make sure she reached her room okay, only to be called a fucking asshole for telling everyone she was my girlfriend. Please bear in mind, for anyone I drive back if they're drunk, I always give a call to make sure they got back alright. It wasn't specific to her. She told me to stay away, and I agreed. Didn't speak to her for the longest time, but we'll get back to her in a bit.

Cut to around 3 months back, I'm hanging out with my old school friend, E. She has a sister, A. Awhile back D had asked for her Insta, and after I checked with her, I passed it to him, and he began chatting her up and hitting on A. Anyway, back to talking with E, she asks if I'm still roommates with D. I said no, that was awhile back, because I got back with my old roommate after his internship. She then told me that when D was hitting on A, he would shittalk me, call me weird because I'd be in front of my PC all day playing games and stuff. Well, yeah, I do spend a lot of time in front of the computer playing games, but that's when I've got nothing else to do, and considering I usually finished my assignments pretty quick, that was a lot of the time. I got a little pissed, but then brushed it aside. What's one story right?

Well, back to R. I was grabbing food from the cafeteria one day, and I bump into her. I say a quick hello, promptly walked past, grabbed my food, and sat on the opposite end of the cafeteria. Only for her to walk over and ask if she could sit with me. I said yes, she grabbed a seat, and she apologised for what she said back then, which took me back. I wasn't expecting it, and I thought that angry drunken phone call was the last I'd see of her. She told me that someone fed her those lies and she believed them. She was about to say who, but I didn't wanna hear it, it was an old tale anyway. We kept talking, and D was brought up in conversation, and she told me that was the guy she was trying to warn me about. She told me to stay away from him. This kinda stunned me. Surely there must be more going on if two people who have no relation to each other beyond knowing D in some way or other are telling me more or less the same thing.

I confided in my roommate, one of the best people I know, a genuinely nice guy. He told me I should confront him. But he's graduating in a bit. He won't be in my life for much longer. I just decided to step away from it all and not look for trouble. I'm passive to a fault, I'll admit, but the way I see it, I won't have to interact with him after this anyway, so I'll just keep to myself. He's contacted me a few times since then, but I don't really speak to him the same way.

Anyway, the question is this: Should I confront him about it? Should I sound him off for talking shit about me behind my back while I've had nothing but positive things to say about him before I found this out? Or was I right to just step away from a toxic person and continue life without something like that dragging me down? 

Any opinions would be really appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to read this."

I currently work for a luxury brand as an Intern. I’m 8 months into my 12 month contract, but since month 4 I’ve been told by management that they want to keep me on the team full-time. One of two potential roles opened up on my team, and I was tasked with taking over the responsibilities with the impression I would fill the role permanently.

After interviewing with my current manager on September 18th, I was told I should hear back by early October at the latest. It wasn’t until last Thursday (October 18th) that I was told they hired someone externally who would start on Monday (yesterday). This whole process has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. Not only did I not receive the job I was already doing for a couple months, but I was also blatantly disrespected by my own manager in not communicating anything to me along the way.

I’m feeling extremely demotivated with completing my work now, and am also finding it difficult to train the new hire to do the role.

I’ve already reached out to HR and they share the same disappointment, but unfortunately can’t do anything to remedy the situation. I’ve begun looking elsewhere for employment but my gut is telling me to leave the company sooner rather than later.

Any advice regarding how to go about handling this situation would be greatly appreciated. "

&amp;#x200B;

I'm caught between:

Taking 17 credit hours and graduating a year late but doing a nice internship in my field

Taking 20 credit hours and graduating on time

Or both!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards both, but I don't know if that's feasible. 1 class is stopping me from graduating on time, and I either take it this spring or next spring. The internship will probably take between 10 - 20 hours a week, but I'm not sure how much until I iron down the details. My course load is very heavy. I'm taking 2 chemistry classes, physics, a joke class, and then the other class is a somewhat difficult class but easier than my stem classes. I'm also taking 12 hours of labs. I'm prepared to get the textbook and read through it over winter break so I'll have to spend less time studying next semester.

So, reddit, I'm thinking about taking 20 credit hours and doing a 10-20 hour a week internship. I am fully ready to give up my social life for a semester, but will even that be enough? Am I crazy?"

Hey guys, I've sort of hit rock bottom in both my college and career and really need some advice moving forward and trying to salvage whatever I can from the time I have left.   

A bit of a background, I'm a junior international student at a good liberal arts college majoring in Computer Science and Economics. The last two years of college have been a blur, because I couldn't decide what I wanted. I wanted to go into film making, and did an internship on that this summer, but decided that wasn't the best thing for me. I wanted to do economics but am now dropping my major because I didn't like it as much as I thought I did and it brought down my GPA by a lot. I started Computer Science from my first semester, but I was never really serious about it until the last semester. I did a team software project last semester developing a web application on Ruby on Rails, and worked with the college Android team to create a newspaper app. I did a lot of leetcode and CTCI grinding this summer, but unfortunately, haven't gotten a single interview offer and did horribly in all of my coding challenges after applying to over 50 companies. 

This whole process has been very demoralizing, especially seeing all of my peers do so much better at me and a few have landed internships in Big N companies. 

I don't think it is complete shit yet, as I still have time. I don't how but I'll still try to find an internship for the summer, or do research on campus. I want to know, how should I build up my resume from this point on? How can I use the next year to become better at applying? Also, is it too late for me?

After a slow start, I’ve become more productive this year (though perhaps still not as much as I’d like) with the help of various productivity systems. I’ve focused less on trying to systematically learn Python through courses and more through personal projects.

However, I’m left feeling very uncertain about my abilities and how much more work I need to go to be employable. I’m concerned I could spend another two years without a clear direction and still be some way off.

To see an example of my code: by far my biggest project is my [Badminton Matchmaker](https://github.com/Platos-Cave/Badminton_Matchmaker), a GUI I created for and use in my social badminton club to automatically make up games based on an algorithm I designed. ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/8r8bss/i_made_a_tkinter_gui_for_automatically_creating/) is a link where I explain it further).

I know right away it’s not professional quality - it lacks unit tests, is organised rather poorly, and isn’t very extensible, areas I know I need to work in. (Also, I’m aware there’s not a big market for Python desktop GUIs). 

But I’m pretty happy with the quality of games it produces - and I’m enheartened by the fact that two professional programmers who were also club members and were each (independently) going to produce their own version couldn’t come up with a better algorithm. One of them even suggested my approach would be too slow, so I must have at least some knack for efficiency given it makes games in &lt;0.1 seconds.

As for online courses: some I’ve completed include a Data Structures and Algorithms course and a Introduction to Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy. I’ve also gotten a few weeks into Andrew Ng’s [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome), but I think I need a better grasp of math to go any further. (However, my matchmaker has similarities to a [recommender system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system), which seem interesting to me and require Machine Learning).

Also, I’m not dead-set on a developer position. I wouldn’t mind something programming-adjacent (like data analyst), or I could make do with something like an internship if necessary. 

But I have very little idea if I’m at a point closer to “just learn XYZ and do ABC in the next couple of months and you’ll be good” or “if it’s taken you two years to get to *that*, you must be such a slow learner that you’re at least two *more* years away at that pace”.

I feel like I've been fucked from the start, and that any T10s in business are basically off limits.  Should I even try, or just relax and slip into a state school.  I really don't know.  My academics are all I basically have, my social life is dead, and my athletics are sub-par.  I really don't know what else to do besides maybe getting a business internship, volunteering for the community, and starting a business, of which I know nothing.  How am I supposed to look competitive?  Are there hidden opportunities I'm not seeking?  I really don't know.  I am in more clubs than the school offers.  I invest in the stock/ bond/ETF market, but that's not really an EC.  I'm not sure if its me not having the correct opportunities or me being inadequate or both.  Anyone know any academic Ivy-Level ECs a rural western PA student could participate in?  Anyone have ideas?  Should I just say fuck it all and give up and go to Pitt or Penn State?"

I'm happy with my salary, but I'm having trouble with this increased workload.

I'm basically the only developer responsible for this piece of the software.

There's always tons of escalated support tickets that take a while to figure out. I'm supposed to handle those as well as meet new ""top priority"" development deadlines.

I always feel like there is never time to do things the correct way and I have trouble focusing on single tasks at a time because thinking about some seperate issue and wondering if that should be priority. If something falls behind, I always tell myself, ""Ok I just need to get this working in 2 days, I'll refactor and clean it up later"", but there is never time until the next ""big issue"" is the new top priority. The quick fixes are coming back to bite me which takes even more time away. Customer support tickets go weeks without being resolved because there's some kind of development deadline that I'm working on. And yeah customers get pretty impatient...

There are Jr developers and interns who are great that could probably help if I just had time to show them the ropes, but I don't even have time for getting them set up with everything they'd need, teach them what they need to know and answer all their questions as they come up.

Is anyone familiar with this anxiety? I feel like my time managment skills are awful, and need work. Does anyone have any suggestions on time management and prioritizing? Good books?"

I wanted some advice on what the best move for me might be. Sorry for the lengthy read in advance. Also, I am very much so a Python developer and SQL would come next in terms of skill.

**My background:**

I am an economics major from a University of California school. Out of school I went into the user acquisition/digital marketing space. I worked for about 2 years picking up Python and SQL along the way. I started taking some Python and data analytics classes which helped me land a job as a data analyst for a start-up. Unfortunately I ended up getting screwed over, being laid off before my start date due to budget cuts.

It just so happens that that my mother VP's finance and HR at a biotech company that had just lost a junior to mid-level software engineer when I lost my job. She asked the director of software/informatics if he had some work for me, he liked my background and took me on as a software development intern. He let me openly apply to full-time positions but ultimately I chose to stay as an intern. We both intend for me to fill a full tine software engineering role opening in January, but as I've found out before nothing is guaranteed. All I know is I love doing software and programming.

I've been working my butt off studying after work everyday. But want to know what I should focus on. I recently bought a book about operating systems which a senior engineer recommended along with a data structures and algorithms book for Python. I've also been working through leetcode problems but still feel like I'm not good enough. (A lot of imposter syndrome)

I'm not sure how non CS majors are perceived so I was thinking of going back to school. Options that I'm entertaining are sticking to a more data focused role and get a M.S. in Statistics or do an online post-bac in CS. I'd really like some thoughts about this.

**Most of my intern work so far has been: (It's been ~4 months)**

* Documentation using Sphinx and reconfiguring old code while recreating the internal apps. (Pretty much small bug fixes)
* Creating new calculations and configuration files in an internal QA app and building unit tests for them

I've also been working on a personal website in Flask and another app idea in Django. I've also made some Python cheatsheets on my Github I've shared on /r/learnpython.

*Technologies I know best/most familiar with.*

**Data:**

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-Learn

**Database:**

* Redshift/Postgresql (Mainly used these at my marketing position)
* SQLite
* MySQL


**Web:**

* Flask, Django
* CSS, HTML 
* Enough bootstrap and JavaScript to get by
* Selenium/Beautifulsoup

**Other:**

* SPHINX /.rst documentation
* Docker
* Git: pull requests, tagging in team development
* Unit testing

So... should I go back to school? Should I just keep studying? I'm kind of lost here, and would like to just get some advice from those who've been in the industry much longer. Cheers and thanks."
9quwze,28,2018-10-23,Advisor gave me false information. What now?,zestypesto,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9quwze/advisor_gave_me_false_information_what_now/,"I'm a business student who was on track to graduate fall 2019 with a minor in graphic design. My main advisor for my business degree is amazing, he has never let me down when it comes to choosing classes and planning my schedule. When I declared my minor I had to meet up with a new advisor - new to me and the school. I told her at the time I was on track to graduate summer 2019 and if there was any way I could graduate that same year, just a semester later and she told me yes and that the courses would work that way.

This was all last semester and as you can guess, when I went in for my advising appointment with my business advisor today he let me know I 

1.) didn't even have my minor declared, the classes I had taken for that minor were just electives at this point
2.) the classes aren't offered in a way I can graduate in 2019

Basically some of the minor courses are stacked (design 1, design 2, etc.) and are only offered at certain times in the year, and never during summer. The new advisor told me completely false information and now I'm set back an entire year if I want to go through with this minor, which I'll have 2/6 classes complete at the end of this semester. I was extremely upset at the information, and I could tell my advisor was upset as well because he knew I wouldn't have declared a minor if it meant an entire extra year of schooling and screwing up my graduation plan. 

Now I'm stuck. I already submitted internship applications stating my current major and minor and have a good chance of getting in to quite a few of them because of the mix of business knowledge/design knowledge I've acquired. I don't want that to be a lie, but I don't know how I feel about an entire extra year of school. I don't know if this would hurt my chances of getting a job, too.

Should I just stick with my major and graduate summer 2019 or go ahead and finish the minor and graduate spring 2020?"

I've graduated just this May from a pretty good private university. I did a small internship my Sophomore year where I worked with some data mining in Python, but most of the internship was unrelated to software development. It wasn't until this year where I was able to get an internship as a web developer in St. Louis. The work at the company is primarily centered around maintaining old products and services, but there are some new projects coming thru. So far, I've noticed that the work is mostly PHP with some Node and Javascript in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Working at this company has been good so far, but I've been aiming to become more involved with Python, Java, and C++ work. I'm from Chicago so it would be great to work my way up there in financial tech and maybe even block chain tech in the near future. I want to work in an industry with more innovation and development. My internship is about to end and they want to offer me a full time position, but I am also barely in the process of looking for positions as well as studying for tech interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I cut my losses and take the offer? The question of how long I'll be jobless tends to make me feel like I'm taking a risk. I've been getting rejection emails from some companies and I'm wondering if my current experience is enough to keep me afloat. If I were to decline the position, I'd focus more on studying data structures and algorithms, as well as working with Python full time at home. I'm wondering if working at my current company will hinder my progress into that new field."

I'm 25, and I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago. I'm thankful I finally got a diagnosis; it's put a lot of my struggles in context and has helped me start putting in the work to overcome them. Lately I've noticed that during one-on-one conversations, my mind often goes off on tangents, and I spend a lot of time thinking about what I want to say instead of listening to what the other person is saying, and I've been trying to make more of an effort to stay present.

I live in the same town I went to high school in, and one of my closest friends still lives here as well. He's been a great friend. He spent the entire day New Years Day with me last year because I was feeling incredibly depressed and didn't trust myself being alone, and he's let me crash on his couch more than a few times when I needed to. We like to have interesting discussions about math and science, but we sometimes have disagreements. More than once, he's accused me of ""not listening"". Every time he says this, I feel insulted because I feel I am doing my absolute best to pay attention.

The past few months, we've been working at the same internship together. This past Friday, we had another disagreement (about the mathematical underpinnings of unit analysis), and on Saturday he canceled plans we had to work on an (unrelated) project together, again accusing me of not listening and telling me he didn't feel like he could collaborate with me. Monday morning I checked my email to see that he had resigned from the internship. He's radio-silent online, even though we usually talk every day, and I get the sense that our friendship is over. I didn't realize that it was that much of a problem.

I'm not entirely sure what my motivation is for posting this. I suppose I'm hoping to find people who understand the struggle, to know that I'm not alone in this. Do any of you have similar experiences? What happened? How did you handle it?"

To let you know, i'm french so i'm gonna mostly search something in french or nearby countries websites

But, of course, i will really appreciate your suggestions, even with probable price differencies and let you know how it is =)

For now my choice would be the \[Acer Aspire 3 A315-21-97JA\]([**https://www.ldlc.com/fiche/PB00239363.html**](https://www.ldlc.com/fiche/PB00239363.html))

(found at 500€ on french website and 7% discount on it so around 465€)

I tell you why:

compared to the laptops at the same price (that i found), the CPU seems to be better (source: CPU BENCHMARK) and the SSD and the 4Go extandable to 16Go are attractive as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My utilisation of the laptop will be mostly multimedia, and sometimes games, but not most power needed ones, so i'm not really into searching the best GPU, just a decent one.

It's possible that i will make some web development, that's why the CPU power and the RAM extension feature is interesting.

For the capacity, i think i'm gonna invest in an external SSD in the future but not for now. So a intern SSD would be appreciated.

I hope you will be able to help me and show me some good laptops!

A Quora internship is not an ordinary internship. There is no busy work. Every project that our interns work on is important to the company and its goals.

Because Quora is such a data-driven company, our data scientists play a central role in the product development process by uncovering key insights from our data. As a data scientist, you'll work closely with engineers, product designers, and product managers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems. You'll also develop tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. We use a variety of tools--primarily Python and SQL--to analyze data and communicate results with the rest of the company.

We also realize that mentorship is important to allow interns to grow and develop skills in new areas. Every intern will have a full-time data scientist as a mentor and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Description**

**To give you a taste of what interns could do at Quora, here are some projects interns have worked on in the past:**

* Analyze external traffic patterns over time to better understand how changes in outside products cause increases or decreases in visits to Quora
* Study the usage differences between the English and Spanish Quora products to understand how various mechanics of Quora translate across different languages
* Develop methodology and prototype features in our internal experimentation platform to identify and capture novelty effects in experiments
* Investigate the effect of how “satisfying” a question page is on user engagement and clickthrough patterns through the rest of the product
* Understand effects of positional bias on home feed ranking to identify opportunities to improve ranking and feed engagement
* Improve the accuracy of a user engagement prediction model and understand what factors are important in determining new users' long term usage.
* Build a recommender system to suggest Quora topics to a user based on provided interests
* Evaluate statistical properties of various methods used to determine significance in ratio metrics, considering coverage, power, and feasibility
* Create dashboards and perform ad-hoc analyses to monitor and understand important product metrics

**Requirements**

**Things we look for include:**

* Pursuing a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a scientific or quantitative field
* Excellent statistical intuition and knowledge of various analytical approaches
* Curiosity and passion for Quora
* Superb communication skills and ability to explain your analysis clearly
* Proficiency in SQL
* Familiarity with Python or similar scripting language

My dad passed away about 3 years ago and I have been struggling with waves of depression and anxiety ever since. Since then I graduated with a CS degree, and this time one year ago I got hired to my first full-time job as a software developer. I had done many internships prior to that while still in school.

Cut to March of this year, girlfriend of 4 years breaks up with me, depression starts creeping back in. On top of that the job I had was burning me out since nearly the beginning. It was a small company and we had 3 people resign between December and March. 

So all of the work fell on myself and one other developer while the company was taking their sweet time hiring new devs.

By July I was completely burnt out and the depression had worsened so I quit. They were not willing to offer a leave of absence or anything like that, plus I did not want to be part of that mostly toxic environment anymore.

So here I am, months later with only a part time office job doing non-dev work. I sought out treatment for my depression and feel ready to resume my career again. I have sent out many applications with no responses and am starting to be concerned that the gap in my work history, along with quitting after less than a year at my previous job, is hurting my chances of getting an interview. How do I proceed in this situation? How do I communicate the reason for the gap without worrying potential employers? I feel so stuck.

tl;dr quit my job due to burn out and depression. Want to get back in the game, but can't seem to get a callback for interviews.  "

Im a computer science student (Masters: Georgia Tech)

My undergrad was bioengineering.

I'm struggling to find some internships right now, its pretty unusual because most people have said my resume looks pretty good, although there are some unavoidable factors such as I went to medical school for 2 years and they may think Im just a bob trying to get in at the pie CS has to offer. Someone recommended SHPE or NSBE for any kind of minority

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been to two career fairs:

1. Georgia Techs online program

\- Terrible because it was just a chat room with 7-10 companies, a few of the recruiters answered half a question and just left, other companies like Verizon just told you to apply online

2. SCU (Santa Clara University)

\-Terrible and surprising because this school is smack in the middle of silicon valley. A very poor selection of companies related to software, maybe 10-15 /70 and most were just giving out information, not accepting resumes, and had extremely long lines for okay'ish to work for (Dell, McAffe)

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Im just curious to know about the selection of companies at conferences like SHPE**

**2. What about the companies who attend, do they usually accept resumes, do they plan interviews ahead of time?**

**3. Whats the likely hood of walking out with at least an onsite interview?**

**4. How bad are the lines?**

**5. Im not hispanic, does this make a huge different to recruiters?**

What really gets the recruiter to move you forward? From my experience at SCU, its just a line of 200 kids, you pass your resume on if you can, say hi my name is bob, I am a blank student at blank university. I am really passionate about blank, what kind of students is company blank looking for?

Projects

* Migrate website to Azure
* Create Office 365 with local AD Integration
* Server Rack Migration with 6 additional physical servers, two being 24TB Storage servers(not large I know, but better than what I had) which required a raid controller replacement.
* New Dental Clinic Opens up on Monday(ran the cable, configured the switches/aps/firewall/servers/computers)
* Hired a second IT person as a intern, to start, with the possibility of full time employment supervised by me.
* Finished our new finical server (Microsoft Dynamics GP) with migration from quick books
* Finished our BridgeIT Server

Still left to do

* Locate new offsite backup solution (most likely Azure to keep from having a ton of cloud accounts
* Finish up New Fiber Circuit for VPN connection between this office and a new office (\~ 1 - 2 Months)
* Finish AirFiber Cross connect to anther site within line of site.
* A few website overhauls
* Present to the city about acquiring light post for a public WiFi project, the mayor is being a pain in the ass about it.
* Find out more about the new construction starting next year (\~ 6 - 7 story building). We had a breif discussion about it today.
* Prep for more growth
* Possible upgrade cross connects to 10GB

So I just wanted a second opinion on my decision hoping to ease my worry a little. I got two offers that I am considering which have quite different lengths and pay. One offers a typical 3 month internship with above average pay and the other is at least a year long internship with below average pay. 

If I went with the higher paying one I would definitely end up making way more money then the lower paying one. Especially due to I would work other jobs while I'm not at the 3 month internship. 

The thing is that the main thing I want out of the internships is experience with real world development. I think I want to go with the year long one due to I hope that would give me the most exposure. It still would be more money than I am currently making at my student job so that's not a problem. 

What I'm worried about is my decision rides on the assumption that both companies will teach me at the same rate. In other words I'm not sure if maybe the three month one would teach me more than the other company would in a year. It sounds like the lower paying one is a lot of writing tests, debugging, and some development. I don't really know how much of what I'll get. While the higher paying one you work in a group of interns on a random project they throw at you. 

This is my first internship so I know even if it ends up not being what I want at the very least I have something on my resume to open doors for future internships.

Any opinions or experiences that you can offer I would appreciate it.

Thank you."

I started my first job out of college about 5 months ago. I work at a small company in the southeast, and I never really put much thought into the university recruiting process at bigger companies. If a company didn’t happen to be recruiting on my campus, it didn’t occur to me to try to apply to them. When I started browsing this sub after starting my job, that was the first time I realized developers my age on the west coast at big companies are earning 2 or 3 times as much money to do more or less the same thing as I do.

My job is fine. It’s just fine. It would be so easy to stay here and never challenge myself and be content with mediocrity. But when I look at the difference between earning $70k here and maybe working my way up to 6 figures in the next few years, versus the starting and mid-career compensation at a major tech company, it seems like I’ve skipped out on an absolutely life-changing amount of money to be here, and that’s unacceptable to me. Essentially, I’ve chosen to forego \*millions\* of dollars for the privilege of living somewhere I don’t particularly like. This seems like a catastrophic mistake, and it feels like I’m majorly off-course to having a career I’m okay with.

I’m at a loss for how to proceed. I’ve started doing Leetcode problems and I don’t think I would have any trouble passing the coding and behavioral questions, but I just can’t even get the attention of the people I want to work for. I’m not a new graduate or an intern, so I can’t take advantage of the robust college-to-industry pipeline that these companies have built. I’m not an experienced industry hire with 2+ years of experience ready to apply for senior roles. So it’s not really surprising to me that I’ve received no positive responses from the dozens of applications I’ve sent in the past few months for new grad and mid-level roles at these kinds of places.

Is it just something about MY approach specifically (cold applying to their career pages), or is there just no realistic pathway to getting hired at a top company as a candidate with only 6-12 months of industry experience? I hate the idea of sucking it up here for another 6-18 months. That’s going to veer into “CSCQ is not your therapist” territory, but it’s just such a crushing feeling to try to build a life in this new city when I’ve become obsessed with the idea of leaving it for somewhere better. I feel like I’m wasting my time right now by showing up to work in the morning, and I don’t know how to get my career back on a course that’s acceptable to me."

I did 2 internships at 2 different teams at company A, which is one of the biggest oil and gas service companies and I got offers from both teams to come back for full time. I also just got another offer from company B, which is also very big and is in Fortune 500. I’m an international student so one of the things I look for when I search for job is whether they can sponsor for my H1B visa. I’m torn between the options and it’s a big decision which will determine the next chapter of my life. Below are the details:

Company A: 90k base salary, great 401K and medical, dental benefits. 12 vacation days with optional 5 extra days unpaid. But no flexible work schedule (no work from home policy). Location is in Houston (where I current live so no need to move). Not an e-verify company, which I only get one chance in the H1B lottery. However, they told me that if I don’t get the H1B, they can transfer me to their office in Singapore, which is very big as well. If I don’t want to move to Singapore, I have to find another company to work for. About the 2 teams:
- Team 1: Position is Design Engineer. I really like the people. The boss is super nice and supportive. It’s a small team so I could get involved in a lot of aspects of a project. 
- Team 2: Position is Research and Development Engineer. This team has the best scientists and engineers in the company. Everybody in this team has a PhD. I’m the only one who is still an undergrad so I often feel intimidated bc I’m in no way near their level. The project is huge and could potentially put the company ahead of all the competitors. 

Company B: Position is Design Engineer. 70k base salary. Potential 5-10k bonus. 10 vacation days. Average 401K, good medical, dental benefits, pension plan. Can work from home. 2k sign in bonus. Great company culture. Lots of community volunteering and cultural events. Very diverse. Is an e-verify company so I have 3 chances in getting my H1B visa in the lottery. Location is in Stoughton, Wisconsin which means I need to move. But they have relocation assistance also. 

My goal is to potentially get into a big tech company like Google where I could develop new technologies, automate the world and make out life easier. So I’m not planning to work at either company for more than 5 years. Company A is in Oil and Gas which I don’t really like because it’s not so meaningful for me. Plus the laid offs and the stress. Company B is in automotive/ heavy equipment/ renewable energy, which I find more meaningful to be a part of. All 3 positions can help me develop different skill sets. The job at A-2 involves a lot of coding, which I think can help me to later get into tech companies. But I don’t really have a reference on this as the skills I could gain at other position are very valuable as well. 

The offers just came in today so I haven’t started the negotiations yet. But I’m sure I can negotiate for better salary and vacation days. But I don’t think Company B could ever match what A is offering me but their perks like work from home and good company culture and being e-verify are important to me. 

Very sorry for a long post but I need to give them an answer in the next few days and I don’t really know what I should choose so any input is appreciated.

Need some motivation here as a soon-to-be new grad (June 2019). For some background I'm an EE major with a strong skillset in both hardware and software, but am shifting my focus to software jobs as I have started to enjoy programming more in my last few years of college. I've been grinding Leetcode and CTCI for a bit so my DS&amp;A skills are definitely getting to where I need to be. I feel like I have solid project experience as well due to all the low and systems level work I have done. However, as an undergrad senior with only internship experience (hardware roles), it feels very very tough trying to break into the software scene. I will keep sending applications for now but am very tempted to just give up.

&amp;#x200B;

I've sent out 50+ applications for new grad and entry-level software engineering jobs but I haven't heard back from anywhere. I've applied to both big companies and small companies, but no cigar except for one top SF tech company that I was fortunate enough to get interviews for. Made it to the final round for them but got rejection soon after (issue with not solving the problem fast enough, not my personality/behavioral -- I asked them afterwards). For starters, how did some of you stay motivated throughout the process? I've seen some incredible stories here and I am definitely amazed by them, but its hard not to feel worthless as you send your resume out into the flame, not knowing whether someone read it or whether the resume parser took a dump all over it, or when you spend months in the interview process only to get shot down.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like shit trying to develop my skills if I know that nobody even cares to see what I can do. How do I beat feeling like this? How did you guys stay motivated? Are there any steps I can take if I'm not hearing back from companies? What did you guys do upon not hearing back? 

&amp;#x200B;

My resume is also written in Latex, and it's very pretty (no images but nice columns and formatting), but I don't know if this may be why I'm getting screened out by automated software (Can I check this with some tool? Keywords in my resume are detected when I upload them as part of my application, but I don't know if I should completely change the formatting or put it in Word or something). 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't meant to be a pity post. I'm reaching out because I need help staying focused and motivated, and I hope I can get some inspiration as well. I know some of you can relate to my situation, so I hope responses on here will help you guys as well. "

I’m not failing out of my program or anything, and I have a pretty average GPA (around a 3.0), but have never had a summer internship and nothing of real value on my resume, nor do I have any personal project to show to interviewers.

Recently, I’ve just been feeling really unprepared for heading out into the real world and landing a job. It’s been about a year and a half since my last real programming course, and it’s really just caught up with me about how much I’ve forgotten about C and C++. Is there any good place for someone to brush up on their coding skills online? I’m just afraid during an interview they’ll ask me a problem that I’ll have no idea how to solve/or I’ll forget the syntax to every little thing and look like a doofus in front of my interviewer. 

Also, all around me I see students working on their own little projects, but I have no idea what I should be working on. Should I create a bunch of little demos to show to interviewers? What should my project be? I see all of these people making plugins for scanning subreddits and all of these other cool things, but in all of my coding classes we’ve never learned how to design user interfaces or do anything of real value. We’ve pretty much all have done basic programs. (Linked lists, binary search trees, different sorts, parallel, etc). I mean yeah it’s nice to learn these things, but we were never really told what the value is behind them, or where they’re even used in real programming environments. I guess I’m just feeling lost on what I should be doing in my spare time to get prepared/what I should be doing at all? It just seems like everyone else around me is so much more prepared than I am. It also doesn’t help that I was an idiot and didn’t keep saves of all of my old code to reference back to. (I was the freshmen/sophomore that was like: “Welp, it’s done and working and I got an A on it! Don’t need this anymore!”). 

Basically, I’m just feeling lost on what I should be doing. What should I be doing to get prepared?"

I was offered the job, which is located in Charlotte, NC (in the same state where I live) and the pay is very good for an intern in North Carolina. The issue is that after asking what software projects I might be working on as in intern in the interview, the recruiters could not give me confirmation of any real software work that their interns had worked on in the past, other than listing some of the development languages the developers use.

The other issue is that they have given me until October 31st to give them an answer regarding their offer, but most of the other internships I applied for (and are more excited about) are now just beginning the interview process, or are in the middle of it. For example, I have interviews scheduled in November for both SentryOne and SAS. Since I am a Junior and I switched late into the CS major, I know that this is my first and last opportunity to get an internship, so I want to make sure I secure something for the summer.

My options are either to accept, deny, or ask for a decision extension (which may or may not backfire and cause me to lose the opportunity). Thanks in advance for your help"

I've even done good projects in Machine Learning and to the best of my knowledge people are desperately trying to apply ML in the VLSI Industry.

I'm currently facing a problem due to most companies in India preferring either graduates or experienced people for jobs. I'm not in a position to go to grad school right now (the one's in India aren't very good and ain't got the resources to go abroad) and a job in this field is the only thing that can give me a fulfilling purpose as I'm more of a Learn-on-the-go guy and not the academic type.

 I'm really passionate about this field but I don't know how to get myself a job.Given the explosion of interest in Hardware accelerators across the industry, I expect my experience to be greatly marketable but I don't see results.

I have a 5.0 weighted gpa (the max possible at my school) and perfect SAT score, (I havent taken the SAT subject tests yet though). 

ECs: 
Arts: Danced ballet an average of about 10-12 hours a week since I was 4, got into and attended 4 semi-prestigious ballet summer intensives all with full scholarships. Vocal lessons since I was 6 an average of about 2 hours a week. Heavily involved in musical theatre, about 3 musicals a year with a few at semi-professional or professional companies.

Academic: Founder and president of the mathematics club at my high school. We provids free tutoring for under-preforming math students and compete in competitions. President of a post-secondary student organization at my current university. Mainly a social group, but we also volunteer in our community a lot. I also am currently doing a 2-semester applied math research internship under a fairly respected professor at my current university.

 I also have a few hundred volunteer hours helping out at local elememtary schools. With jobs ranging from helping teachers handle huge classes to privately tutoring under-preforming students.

In math I finished calculus 1 2 and 3 at my current university as a 9th grader and am currently taking proofs in discrete math which, at my current uni, is a class meant for junior math majors. Next semester I plan on taking multiple senior math-major level proof classes, chemestry, and ordinary diff eq. All my subjects have also been taken at my university (im going to end up with about 110 college credits when I graduate high school)

Do I have a decent shot at Princeton or MIT? Im trying to figure out what else I should do in the next year to prepare for admissions. I have two potential rec letters that should be VERY good (one from a math professor who loves me and one from an english professor who loves me) amd I know a few harvard grads who will help me with my application essays."

*Work experience*: 

* Intern (8mos) at The Daily Show and then was a Production Assistant for them during the 2012 RNC
* Assistant Editor (2.5yrs) for a VFX company in Los Angeles; clients of spots worked on included, FAANG-level, a multi-national oil and gas corporation, and various music videos for artists like Katy Perry (sound designed the Dark Horse music video). 
* Post-Production Coordinator (2yrs) for a Creative Agency that works on video game marketing and trailers. Main duties included: infrastructure implementation, consulting on workflows for studio operations to the President and Executive Producers, developed a process for quality control and ensure processes are used.
* Post-Production Manager (current) for same Creative Agency. Essentially managing studio post-operations. Since my promotion, I have restructured the department so as to actually create a talent pipeline for internal growth. This restructure has been a majority of this year for me. It's helped in hiring along with retaining talent and reducing turnover. All of this has reduced the amount of money it costs for training as we're now hiring people that are specific for a job function.
* On top of all this I've written and developed a few screenplays through my s-corporation.
    
*Extracurriculars*: 

* Student Pilot
* For about a year, I was working with the Santa Monica Airport Association fundraising committee to strategize a grassroots crowdfund campaign. The Santa Monica Airport is currently fighting against the city of Santa Monica as the city wants to close it and create a park. Long story short, the Santa Monica Airport provides key utility and infrastructure for the SoCal economy and emergency management and closure will be a huge deal. I created a manifesto and business plan that helped to springboard their campaign efforts. On top of this, I was able to connect the top aviation YouTube influencers and ensure that they can create integrated content in conjunction with the campaign.
   
* Undergrad school/major: Large State School in Florida / BFA in Motion Picture Arts
* Other education/coursework: I did a summer program in high school at NYU Tisch which I got credits for.
* Race/nationality: Hispanic / American (I want to apply through Consortium)
* Sex: M

*Stats*

* **GMAT Score (include breakdown!)**: 580 (40Q; 29V; 6IR; 6AW); I took this last December and will be taking it again. This year got away from me in terms of how busy I was (work + wedding planning) so I never got a chance to be able to get back into the books. I'm also going to take a stab at the GRE and see which format I do better at so I can best focus my study efforts.
* **Undergrad GPA**: 3.66

*MBA Info*
    
* **Goal of MBA**: I want to go into management consulting so that I can gain exposure to a diverse pool of industries for 3-5 years. I feel like I've been in an insulated bubble of only film and tv since high school and want to be able to see how other industries operate. I also like problem solving (probably my favorite aspect of my current job) and when I found out what consultants do after some research I was excited to see there was actually a career path for doing this. After my consulting stint, I'd like to go into corporate strategy at one of the major studios here in LA or with a professional sports team/league and move my way up the ladder to executive management.
    
* **Target schools**: Anderson is my top school as my fiancée also works in entertainment and I don't want to uproot nor do long distance if we don't have to. Outside of Anderson, the top programs I'm interested in are Ross, Marshall, McCombs, and as a stretch would like to try at Tuck if my scores are decent enough.

I'd like to shoot for a 690+ on my GMAT or if I end up taking the GRE, whatever the median is for the schools on my list. I would definitely like to know how my profile looks otherwise. I'll be applying next fall.

My plan as of right now is to double major in math and computer science and get a minor in risk management and insurance (consists of mostly finance classes -- there is no finance minor).

How would this combination look to future employers/graduate schools? I plan on getting an internship this summer and after that as well and making as many connections as I can.

If it was absolutely necessary and feasible I would consider transferring to a target school for these jobs (although I'm still not entirely sure what that means).

However, I got an offer for this Spring at a relatively well known mid-tier Tech company (Ultimate Software) which would push my grad date back to May 2020 (which would be my normal date)

I am wondering if this extra internship would help me land a bigger/better job out of college and if graduating a semester early is worth not taking this internship. It's not Big-N level, but it is a fairly well known technical internship. 

The main reason I'm considering it is because I know a lot of bigger companies nowadays have a matrix and 3 internships vs 2 would result in a pay raise."

I wanted to share an opportunity that I think is a really great campus job to have.  I've been working as a student assistant for Desktop Support for the past year and a half and we are looking for at least one more student assistant to help out (possibly more and there will be another position opening in January as well).  Desktop Support is a subdivision within the Office of Information Technology that focuses on assisting administrative staff with all their computer related needs.  We resolve computer issues and are responsible for deploying all computer hardware to end users.  Students are responsible usually for prepping all of the new systems, and we also assist with day to day tasks including office moves, general troubleshooting, and more.

Preferred skills (you will be trained, but being comfortable using computers is a must):
Experience troubleshooting Windows computers (7 &amp; 10)
Installing and configuring software
Troubleshooting network issues
Remotely assisting users via phone and remote connection software
Light hardware troubleshooting (do you know where everything plugs into the computer?  Can you replace a PCIe card, pull hard drives, etc)?

Soft skills are equally as important as technical skills.  In this job, you will talk with people in person and over the phone.  When you help users, they don't always know you're a student and you're representing all of OIT so professionalism is a must.  This is not a helpdesk job (answering the phone is not your responsibility) but you still need to be comfortable calling people to schedule things.  Detail oriented individuals will do best in this position.  Driver's License is required because you will be required to operate university vehicles from time to time.

Why this job is good:  It's a student job so they work around your quarterly schedule (max 19.5 hours per week).  Compensation is good for a student position.  I started at minimum wage but got raises to $17/hr in less than a year and a half, so they do notice and reward good work ethic.  The office is only open 8-5 monday through friday so you will never be required to work early, late, or on weekends.  You will gain good experience working in a large enterprise IT environment, and you will be exposed to lots of other groups within OIT.  The job is what you make it like anything else in life but personally it's the best job I've had so far.


If interested, you can apply on Handshake.  Search for ""Student Desktop Support""

If you have any questions feel free to PM me.

The job posting will be closing by November 9th.

*edit for more info*
I forgot to mention that during the summer, you can work full time (40 hours per week), but they also don't mind if you go away for an internship or go back home.  I think they prefer to have students over the summer, but they will keep your position for when you return in the fall.  You can also work full time during winter and spring breaks, if you want."

It's all been pretty good, but, as always, there is far more work than I am capable of doing. So, my manager found funding to hire an intern to help me, and she starts here next week. 

I am as excited as I am terrified – the new responsibility feels amazing and very promising, as ability to get so much more done together. 
Yet, it is a challenge too, as I'll have to teach her everything I've learnt here and share a lot of my experience in an effective manner in the shortest possible period of time. And I'll have to keep supporting my regular job routine at the same time too. 
Considering I am a 23 old who has just one year of experience, it makes me kinda anxious, and I don't really consider myself all that good too – I still have plenty to learn myself.
I also want to make the adaptation as smooth and comfortable as possible for her, and I generally just want to help her achieve here as much as possible and do a lot of great things.

So, how do I help her adapt at the new place? How do I transfer knowledge most effectively? Give me any advice you find reasonable in my case. Are there any mistakes I can avoid?
For reference, I am working in analytics in a large IT-firm.

Hi guys, I am a senior from one of Texas' competitive high schools want to major in electrical engineering, Texas A&amp;M being my #1 and UT Austin my #2.

I'm sorry about this post being a little incoherent, but thanks a lot for reading and I appreciate your responses.


Background: I am a permanent resident (will be a citizen in a year) who moved to the Michigan from India during my 8th grade. The very next year my dad got another job and we ended up in Texas, where I have attended all of my highschool. I have been a tinkerer since as far back as I can remember, I used to screw around with my grandpa's electronics, transitors, radios. This one time I opened up my mom's iPhone and messed it up, ( sort of, only the screen connector went bad) but I did get to learn a lot. Physics has always excited my curiosity and I've been learning and researching since my middle school days.

9rf321,7,2018-10-25,Grad school?/5th year?/work?,AbsolutelyNotTim,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/9rf321/grad_school5th_yearwork/,"Hi r/gradadmissions, 

I am currently a 4th year Comp Sci major with a Stats minor at UC Davis who has an interest in the field of data science. I have questions regarding choosing what to do after graduation because of my situations and would like to hear what you all think about my analysis of my current options and which one you would choose with your exprience.

#TL;DR: 

GRE: current 161;160. Confident in getting 330 for the next.

GPA: 3.0 GPA first two years because of lack of interest &amp; naive HS thinking =&gt; Switched major =&gt; 3.7 UD GPA.

Research/intern: none due to late major change &amp; lack of confidence

LoRs: possibly only one strong letter and two letters from A courses.

Plans: Apply right now and see how it goes **OR** apply for graduate schools next year and get research experience at school, internship experience during summer, and major in statistics in the mean time **OR** work for two years then apply 

# Background

##**GRE**

V: 161; Q: 160; AW: 4.5

I took this with the ""testing the water"" mindset, so I had only prepared for verbal. I had also scheduled another one early November, which I have confidence with achieving a score or 330+. 


##**GPA**

In my first two years of school, I really struggled with everything. I wasn't prepared at all because of my silly and naive underestimation of what college work was like based on my HS experience, and the major I had (computer engineering) was something that I found myself to have no interest in at all. Because of these two factors, my GPA was about 3.0. However, everything changed when I found myself being intrigued by programming, which is the reason I switched to CS. From then on (1st quarter of my third year), my overall GPA has increased to 3.35 with an upper division GPA of 3.67 and a CS subject GPA of 3.74. I do realize that many graduate school admissions look at GPA trends instead of simply an overall GPA, which wouldn't put me at a HUGE disadvantage due to GPA as long as I keep following my upward trend. But still, it's not a competitive GPA for many top schools. 

##**Research/intern**

Besides problems with GPA, I do not have any research or intern experience due to my lack of confidence that is caused by myself thinking I had taken enough CS courses at the time to do anything valuable. However, while doing my part-time job, I found something really interesting and had acquired a dataset that I would like to do a research on by myself using subjects(i.e.: machine learning) from classes that I am taking currently. Besides this, I am fairly confident that I will be able to find a research project from a professor in the next quarter.

##**Recommendation Letters**

There’s only one professor that can possibly write me a strong letter. I took two classes with him with fairly good grades on both the final projects and the courses; I am currently taking another course with him which I participate quite often; and I had talked with him regarding graduate schools, which I felt he really does believe in me being a competent student. Besides him, I don’t really know any professor, so I can only find the ones that I had As in their classes. 

&amp;nbsp;

# My plans

## **Plan A: F’ it. Apply for graduate school (master) right now**

This is what my parents suggest me to do simply because of the mindset of ""you never know if you'd never tried"" and the fact that they believe I could maybe get lucky. I could likely get into the top 30~40 schools in the US, but I really wish I could get into top 20 or even top 10, which I believe I am not qualified at all given my current circumstances. 

**Advantage:** I could get lucky; possibly less financial burden

**Disadvantage:** Zero time: no more room to increase GPA, to have research/internship experience, or to have strong LoRs. Slim chances of getting into top programs 

## **Plan B: go into 5th year, double in Statistics, and apply again (master or PhD if I became more interested in research)**

This is what I prefer the most. I want to be involved in data science, so having a degree in statistics will definitely help a lot. Again, I am financially fortunate enough to be able to even consider this option without going into debt, which I am extremely grateful to my parents. 

**Advantage:** Maximization of my chances of getting into top graduate programs: likely to have higher overall GPA; one more degree in the field I am interested in; more research/internship opportunities; able to finish my side project; possibly have better LoRs

**Disadvantage:** more money; possibly waste of one year of time; the advantages above can only *possibly* increase my chances. 

## **Plan C: work one or two years upon graduation; then apply for graduate school (master or PhD if I became more interested in research)**

**Advantage:** less financial burden for my parents; I can really know well what I'm interested in; more room for me to build my portfolio and research experience.

**Disadvantage:** weaker relationship with professors to get better LoRs; might get comfortable with the current situation and lose the wish to pursue for a higher education; possibly waste of two years of time just doing something superficial (i.e.: fixing bugs) instead of anything related to the field I am interested in. 

&amp;nbsp;

what do you guys think? which one would you choose if you were in my situation but with your existing experience in applying for graduate school? 

Thanks in advance.

I graduated in may from a top 50 business school with a degree in Finance. I am currently working in NYC in Internal Audit at a large bank. I have had two external audit summer internships and I interned in internal audit at this same firm before my senior year. So clearly my resume is very heavy with audit/accounting experience. I am much more interested in a career in the front office, but I am not sure exactly path I want to take which has been making the switch more difficult. FP&amp;A, WM, Financial Advising, IB, Corporate banking, research, corporate finance all seem to be interesting to me. Really anything not in audit sounds appealing lol. I want to make a switch sooner rather than later, as I know the longer I wait the harder it will get. I do not want to be labeled as an auditor every time someone reads my resume.

I have three questions that I am hoping you all may have some insight about.

First, how did you decide on your career path? I feel very directionless, but at least I know what I do not want to do with my life.

Second, I really need advice/help on how to tailor my resume to a job in a business like the ones I listed above.  Certain phrases, buzz words and topics to focus on in my resume.

Third, how would you suggest I approach the job hunt? Should I send out a ton of resumes after I update it and hope I get a bite or really focus on making each resume perfect for each job I apply to.

[USA],ElementWire,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9rfjts/psa_concerned_about_getting_a_high_salary_job/,"Hi all, I graduated in May, 2017 and I wanted to share a bit about job prospects in the industry I recently joined. The cleared world \[USA\] has an incredibly high demand for engineers (most disciplines) with security clearances, both the government and even more so on the contractor side. TS/SCI cleared engineers (contractor side) start at no lower than $80,000 and if the cards are played right, they will easily break $100,000 within two to three years. Due to the massive backlog for clearances investigations and a 'booming economy' job security is incredible, basically recession proof **™**. If you are fortunate enough to attend a university with DoD or intelligence community ties (or have DoD supporting industry for internships nearby), there may be an avenue to be sponsored for a clearance. Keep in mind clearances are averaging around 15 months, so start early.

If you go this route keep your nose clean (seriously, don't smoke pot and don't let your debts go to collections) and check out the job boards such as clearancejobs and others that specifically cater to cleared applicants.

My 2.71 cents.

With all the rave reviews floating around, My bakery is booming, but supply and demand is, well, demanding. The process for my sweets is arduous to say the least, the hardest part for me is rendering the lard from the meat, but boy does is make my pies flaky. My sweets aren’t just any sweets, they’re the type of sweet that I can charge triple for, and people will buy them. I get at least 7 large orders a day, the poor office interns drag in and try to pack these sweets across town for their pompous bosses, knowing that they will never get to taste a sweet morsel, then there’s the suburban mom, the ones I loathe most,  stay at home with 2.5 kids, whatever the hell that means, they come in wearing  their workout gear, ponytails swinging and swishing around as they animate every word they speak. They always make a comment about their diets, and how “this is going straight to my hips”. Gag. These people, along with the hordes of society’s assholes, upper class, too good for you people that I want to serve, theses are the people, no matter how soul sucking, and rude they are, are the people that I want to eat my sweets, not just eat them, savor every bite, take in every single morsel of flavor and declare, “I swear this is the best cake I've ever eaten!”. That is my target audience and i’m playing the long game......

&amp;#x200B;

Once my business partner, a butcher by trade, shows up with the goods, my work begins, you see, I’m very skilled around the kitchen and the farm, my talents aren’t chained to just baking. Oh lovies no. How boring would my tale be? 

Anyway, we start with rendering the lard, although a smelly, long process, it’s obviously the most important. And, watching the fat swirl in white tendrils off the meat is very calming. It swirls and swims about glistening in the boiling water. I watch until the last tendril swirls off, and I know my real work is about to begin, but usually, by this time of night, the real work waits till the morning. My business partner takes the meat leftovers after I’m finished, Peculiarly, he watches in silence through the whole process, we barely speak and when we do, it’s usually related to business. He’s quite handsome, but too studious. He doesn’t think my jokes are funny.

After the dirty work is done I bake my sweets, a dollop lard here, a sprinkle of cinnamon there, some chocolate chips thrown in. It takes all morning, and isn’t as satisfying as watching the lard swirl away from a newly dead hunk of meat, but it must be done. My chocolate chip cookies are by far my best seller, everyone asks what the secret ingredient is, and I haven’t told them yet but i’m going to tell you in just a minute! 

You see, I keep track of all those nasty customers, the ones who don’t say thank you, order while they’re on their phones, basically the ones that are just plain rude. It’s amazing what you can find out about someone when they swipe their cards. Anyway, I keep track of them, I give a list of those people to the butcher, and he brings me back my fresh meat for lard. Only 2-3 a month, you would be amazed at how much lard one human body can actually produce! How we came upon this agreement, I’m still not sure. We are both disillusioned by society, we both want to make a quick buck while secretly getting even with our enemies. He makes a special meat pie that his customers go crazy for!

&amp;#x200B;

 We’ve made bank, so to speak. When we get tired of it, you’ll know but For now, i’m tucking this away, one day you’ll see it in my shop window, you’ll get sick to your stomach, you’ll vomit, you’ll feel like absolute shit and i’ll be cackling my way out of town, with my silent partner at my side. I’m not sorry, and I wish you the best. "

However I feel like this is something I should’ve researched and applied at least a month ago.

9rgff1,9,2018-10-25,Dropping CS as a junior?,dolcheen,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/9rgff1/dropping_cs_as_a_junior/,"Hey guys, I need some advice. I’m currently a junior studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science (double major). The thing is is that I have been thinking about dropping my comp major for a while now, but I’m not sure if I should just go for it and graduate with a cog sci degree.

Reasons for keeping it:

* I’ve already put in a lot of work by taking 12 of the required classes and I only have 5 more classes to take
* I think it’ll be easier to find jobs with a CS degree &amp; I really don’t want to just graduate with a cog sci degree
* I’m almost done with my cog sci requirements so it’ll be doable
* If I take the classes, I think I can manage getting Cs and still graduate with \~3.0 GPA (even though it doesn’t really matter in the tech industry)

Reasons for dropping and being just Cog Sci:

* I don’t really like/am not that good at CS
* I want to have time to take classes that interest me (right now a lot of CS classes overlap with other classes I want to take)
* I will be sad/stressed for the rest of college b/c of me struggling in the classes &amp; the rest that I have to take are the hard ones
* I have a PM internship lined up for this summer at a Big4 &amp; I want to do UX/PM and not SWE in the future so maybe having a CS degree isn’t that big of a deal

Should I just tough it out and get both degrees since it’ll just be pain for 1.5 more years or drop it and enjoy the rest of college? The main reason for keeping it is for future job prospects since the internships I’ve had I know I got them because I was CS (also maybe b/c I go to a top 20 school). I will definitely be applying for FT positions senior year. However, after this coming summer, I will have 3 internships so maybe experience wins out over what degree I have (but I feel like I also haven’t learned that much in my internships so far). I wish I could do a minor/concentration in CS, but my school doesn’t offer that. Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: I don’t know if I should finish my CS major or just drop it."
9rgj28,9,2018-10-25,"Everyone says you shouldn't go biomedical engineering, what if its my only choice?",2019EngineeringMajor,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/9rgj28/everyone_says_you_shouldnt_go_biomedical/,"To start this off, I'm picky about where I want to go to school. I have dreamed my entire life of getting to go to School A which is out of state. I cannot afford out of state tuition however I do have the option to pick from two majors (Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering) that if I choose then I can attend for in-state rates since no school in my state offers them.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of those interest me, the latter more so do to the focus on several disciplines and my not knowing exactly what I want to do. I do have an interest in grad school (I am a first gen student and I am going to grad school at the very least to have the esteem that follows someone with a M.S. and in respect for my family who have worked to get me here) and I do know I want to work as an engineer for at least a few years. However, my ultimate goal is entrepreneurial. I love the medical field but I don't want to be a doctor, I am currently a bioinformatics research assistant and I have love every second of getting to develop things that help people. I'm sure you can see where this is going that I eventually would like to get into the medical start-up scene.

&amp;#x200B;

Is biomedical something I can make work? I am a very dedicated and hard worker, but I have read nightmares stories from students who were (as much as you can trust someone online) ""From top tier schools with top tier internships"" who claimed they couldn't get jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fine with aerospace to because the aerospace industry is soooo awesome I just feel for my entrepreneurial goals that would be very tough as any kind of aerospace venture will probably require a huge amount of capital and things such a security clearances.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my dream may be a naive teenage dream but some of my biggest mistakes in life have been because I thought my dreams were too unrealistic so I entertain even the wildest of dreams. Thanks for any advice.

**My Stats:**

1580 SAT (780R/800M)

780 Math 2, 760 Physics

Top 5% (GPA unweighted is like 3.9, weighted doesn't really matter since its a very arbitrary number)

**My main EC's:**

Founded two businesses, one in the video gaming industry another in crypto

Computer Club President for 2 Years, member for 4

Calc/Precalc Tutor

Volunteer at Public Library, created curriculum and teach Computers 101 and Internet 101

Paid work experience at a medical company for 3 years. Build computers and basically do IT work

Internship at medical place to help with advertising and IT

**Letters of Rec/Essays:**

This, like a 'weighted' GPA, is VERY arbitrary. But both teachers had VERY good relationships with me. My essays are also 'goodish'?

**Colleges I'm applying to:**

MIT

Princeton University (Planning to SCEA) - very loose ""legacy"", Uncle used to work there a while back, but Princeton doesn't recognize him as ""legacy"".

University of Pennsylvania

Cornell University

Carnegie Mellon Univ

Northeastern University

University of Michigan

Boston University

Rutgers (New Brunswick)

Stevens Inst of Tech

The problem I'm running into is I don't know when you hit that wall where you are competent enough to actually apply for positions in the field. This is my first semester and I'm off to an amazing start and I truly enjoy the projects I've had to do in my java class but having a friend who is finishing up his cs degree next year and is already getting interviewed by a huge company makes me feel like I am so far behind even though I just started.

I want to be proactive with all of this and for me that means getting into the field and learning and getting experience before I get out, however I don't know when is a good time to apply and have a serious chance at an internship or something similar.

It's almost 2AM here but I can't sleep because I need to vent what I'm feeling right now.

I'm a senior who's graduating next semester and I have yet to have an offer, and it's starting to take a toll on my emotions. The thing is that I know I'm not the worst candidate out there, I've had two internships my past two summers, and on my real reddit account, people said my resume was good (the only criticism was to make it easier for autoparsers to parse the data).

Even then, I struggle so hard to get interviews. I applied to close to 100 places and the only interviews I get are basically the ones that everyone gets for applying (Twitter, Amazon, Linkedin), and I can do the Hackerranks/coding assessments well, as in passing all test cases, but I still get rejected. I get really upset and jealous seeing how easy it is for everyone else I know, including the people here, get interviews easily, and seem to be comparing Big N offers, whereas I can't even get my foot in the door anywhere. At my school's career fair, I was the only person I know who got solved a company's technical question on the spot, and still not get an interview from it. Otherwise, I went 0/10 at my school's career fair in even getting interviews. I practice leetcode daily but what good is that if I can't even get an interview?

The only thing I have left for me is the final round for Amazon, but if I fail that, then I really don't know what I can do anymore. I don't even know if therapy would help, because therapy won't land me a job. And pressure from parents and seeing how peers seem to have it easy only makes my depression worse. It seems like nothing is working and I am starting to get overwhelmed with just how shitty everything is. "

Airbnb’s mission is to connect people to unique travel experiences, in more than 34,000 cities and 190 Countries.   We are making it possible for hosts to supplement their income while helping visitors from around the world experience neighborhoods and communities outside traditional tourist zones.

Here at Airbnb, we’re big fans of travel.  We love thinking about the diversity of experiences our host community offers, and we spend a fair amount of time trying to make sense of the tens of thousands of cities where people are booking trips every night. The tricky thing is, most of us haven’t been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they’re looking for in places they may have never been.  The data science team works in tandem with product management, engineering, and design teams to solve for things like this.

**Job Description**

Our inference data scientists are deep in understanding the complications of running experiments in a two-sided marketplace, power analysis and stopping criterions, and statistical models to improve power/significance. Another interesting problem space is understanding what to do when we are unable to conduct experiments. How do we understand the impact of something new?

We are looking for Data Scientist intern to join our team and expand upon the work we have done. Here are some examples of projects we currently need help with:

* Develop experiments to reduce friction in the listing creation process for hosts  

* Designing experiments to measure the lift when displaying hotel rooms on our platform

* Improve the statistical methodology behind our experimentation platform to ensure that our understanding of product changes is rigorous and accurate  


**Benefits:**

* Competitive pay, a generous housing bonus, and Paid Time Off  

* Quarterly employee travel coupons so you can explore Airbnb’s incredible listings  

* Daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner inspired by the local cuisine of listings from around the world  

* Company-sponsored tech talks and social events  

* Much more…  


**Requirements**

**Skills and Qualifications:**

* Currently pursuing a PhD or MS in CS, Math, Statistics, Physics, Economics or other quantitative field.  

* Preferred fields of study are statistics, math, economics, or related discipline.  

* Tools: Experience using R, Python, and/or SQL.  

* Product sense: Ability to connect your analysis to real world phenomena, always thinking about how insights from the data can be used to improve Airbnb.  

* Communication: Demonstrated ability to distill and share complex technical concepts to a less technical audience.

Let's just say the rules here are: no rules. Previous tales: [If it needs power..](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/89dbwj/if_it_needs_power/) and [The story of the incorrectly programmed keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9hp8mg/the_story_of_the_incorrectly_programmed_keyboard/).

It was a slow Friday morning, much like this one right now. Me and the other folks here were eating [pão de queijo](https://site-amb-s3.clubedaana.com.br/prod/imagens/receita/2037/-2019.jpg), as is tradition on Fridays, when the phone rings.

&gt; $Me: Good morning, tech support speaking.  
&gt; $Caller: Hello, this is $Caller from [Department On The 4th Floor], I think my computer disconnected from the network.  
&gt; $Me: Do you mean you can't access websites? Can't log in?  
&gt; $Caller: No, just nothing happen, and I've -- ... -- Sorry, someone else just complained, I think all the computers here disconnected from the network.  

Now, I am sure that for many of you, my dear readers, alarm bells are already ringing on your heads.

&gt; $Me: Wait, all the computers? They are powered right? It's just the NETWORK, you can't access the intranet or internet?  
&gt; $Caller: Yes! Can you help?  
&gt; $Me: We'll verify and I'll return the call shortly.

Now, I quickly turn around to my colleague, the one that knows EVERYTHING about the hardware around here and ask if we had any network problems, since I didn't see anything wrong.

&gt; $Colleague: No... The computers didn't turn OFF right?  
&gt; $Me: No, they said it was only the network... But on the entire department? Maybe the switch?  
&gt; $Colleague: Could be. Grab the key and go check on the switch, it's in a room right past the elevator on this floor (IT was in the 2nd floor)

So I grab the key, find the room with the rack and three switches. Everything seems fine, lights happily blinking, except for a small row on the top switch, hmmmmm... So I lock everything up and head up to the 4th floor.

Of course, at this point those alarms in your heads are now the equivalent of nuclear sirens. As I arrive in $Department, I am greeted by $Caller who points me toward the computer. I go check it and, to noone's surprise, it's off. Pressing the power button does nothing. All other computers are off. I turn to $Caller:

&gt; $Me: You said you didn't have network, but the computers don't even turn on!  
&gt; $Caller: Well, yes... Can you guys fix it?  
&gt; $Me: I'll look into it.

I feel like I should point out that the computers are on separate circuit, at least SOMETHING done right here, so lights and other shenanigans are still working.  
I'm sure at this point the other 2 departments have called the appropriate people to solve this and not IT, but since they have a record of being slow (let me point out how slow: the main AC for the server room has been broken since May) I decide to fix this.  

I run into $Colleague who asks what happened. After explaining, he says we should go down to security in the 1st floor and grab the keys for the breaker for the 4th floor (Sec has keys for... Well... Everywhere). After me and $Colleague explain to security what happened, we get the keys (after a quick signature) and head up to the breaker only to find two electricians from the responsible department staring at the breaker:

&gt; $Electrician1: Yeah, all the computers on this floor are down... Probably someone plugged something wrong in a socket.  
&gt; $Electrician2: Yup, let's reset the breaker... Where's the key?  
&gt; $Electrician1: I thought you had it... Oh man...

So I step in:

&gt; $Me: Here's the key, let's fix this.

So we quickly open the breaker panel, reset it, verify stuffs is again powered on and close it back up. I leave them to their business and return the key to security.

I return to IT and me and $Colleague tell this tale to our coworkers. Many laughs were had. We got back to work, this was low level for our users (and the department resposible for $ELETRICITY_THINGS)  anyway.

9rlim3,6,2018-10-26,Software Developer Intern for a year. What can I expect as far as a starting salary?,yehmum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9rlim3/software_developer_intern_for_a_year_what_can_i/,"So I started this Software Development Internship (.Net Developer basically) in May 2018 and they have allowed me to continue working for them until I finish my degree May 2019 which will amount to a total of 1 year of working for the company as an intern. 


On top of what will be 1 year of software development experience at the company I also co-found a startup company in which I wrote and launched our iOS application in about 10 months time. 


On top of that I also have significant Game Development experience (800+ hours on this game written in C#) from a game that I have spent the last 2 years of my free time working on as a hobby.
(Not a promotional link :|)[Link to a clip of an AI test if you want an idea of the quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E9Ld9uEgs0)


Between the Game and the Startup I co-found I believe that that should net me at least a minimum of 1 year of serious development experience on top of what will be 1 year of software development experience at my current company giving me a solid 2 years of development experience to factor into my starting salary when I get hired. 


Currently I make $20/hour as an intern (Company is based in Indianapolis). I am hoping that by the time I graduate I should be able to expect at least $65,000 as starting pay but I am also thinking about asking for $70,000 but that makes me start to feel a little bit greedy. What do you guys think?"
9rljto,3,2018-10-26,Going to get a salary cut because the company says I'm not productive enough. What shall I do?,nazipanzer,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9rljto/going_to_get_a_salary_cut_because_the_company/,"Background:

Indian guy from a lower middle class family. Although I'm a computer science graduate but the standards of my college were lower than the floor of Indian ocean. In second year of graduation I decided to take matters into my own hands and started teaching myself coding and data science. I've done numerous courses so far and have done some interesting projects as well.

Qualifications:

After an internship that lasted 9 months, I am some what an avg in the field of computer vision and data science. I interviewed for many jobs and found a decent one with a good pay in one of the biggest cities of India.

At the moment I have decent knowledge of Deep Learning, Python and traditional Computer Vision.

Problem(s):

First thing first, money is a big issue. If I had enough of it, I'd be in Germany pursuing masters in Data Science followed by a Ph.D. in the same.

Naturally, to make that possible by the means of savings, I took a job in computer vision in a very early stage start-up. I've been working there since I graduated 6 months ago. The pay is sufficient for me to save enough after a year so that I can do my masters abroad. 

However, there are some glaring issues with the company. 

Since my joining, I've worked on 5 different projects. None of them were able to generate revenue. Even though the last two products that I worked on were quite fine. The financial aspect of company is not sound. But that's not the end of it.

My company says that my efficiency is  low. Hence they are introducing a cut in my wage. I admit that in the starting months I was quite inefficient but I've been productive since then.  Also, it's a company of 4 people including an intern. I cannot comprehend the fact that they are blaming me for the company's poor performance. Also, this is being told to me all of sudden. I didn't get any prior warnings. None what so ever stating a 30% salary cut.

Last but not the least, I work 6 days a week, 10 hours a day. Effectively I code for 6-7 hours per day. That looks like a lot but quite frankly it's not. I have no supervisor that tells me what to code and what not. Google is the best help that I can get. Thus I am not satisfied with my queries most of the times. Learning in the current condition is not what it should be or could be.

The city that I live in, is an expensive one. Adding that to the poor finacial background, I feel extremely cheated. I have strong feelings regarding this issue but I don't want to jeopardize the little earning that's there.

What should I do? 


TL;DR: 

1. Got a job after teaching myself coding. 
2. Job takes a lot of time and learning is not sufficient
3. Gonna get a salary cut if I don't increase my productivity. Got no prior warning about the cut.
4. Am poor hence no money to do what I really want to do which is to pursue Masters.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been interning at a company for a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came to the interview for the internship (back in february) I gave them an updated resume and I informed them that I would be graduating in spring 2019 instead of december 2018 because my department was not offering a course that I really wanted to take in the fall.

&amp;#x200B;

In August I was offered a full time position, but they believed that I was going to be graduating in december so that I could start working in january.  They did not know about my updated resume that I told them to keep on file.

&amp;#x200B;

I told them about the changed graduation date and that I was looking to start my master's degree following graduation.  They still seemed interested in hiring me and they said they would send me some information about the position.  I am still interning here 2 days a week, but they have not sent me any information (it has been 2 months since they offered me the job).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure how to handle this.  I want to send an e-mail so I can start planning for what I'm going to do next summer, but I'm not sure what I should say in the e-mail.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr- company that I am currently interning at said they would send me information about a full time position they offered me, but didn't know that my plans for graduation had changed and that I was going to be pursuing my master's degree.  I am interested in the position because I may take some grad courses at night or online while I work starting next summer, but I'm not sure how to ask them about the position because they did not end up sending me any info and it's been 2 months.   At the same time, they never retracted the offer, so I'm in a strange place.  Thanks for reading."

Canadian engineering student here. I've been actively applying to summer  internships (in SV and Toronto) for almost 2 months now, consistently  about 5-6 a day. Most of them end up in ""limbo"", showing ""submitted"". Is it normal that most companies don't review on a on rolling basis? or  have they just decided to skip over my application? It's hard not to  feel discouraged when you feel like people aren't even considering you.  I'd take a rejection over this lol.

I guess I'm was really hoping to find out what the hiring cycle is like for companies in the US. Is not hearing back now basically a rejection? Or have most companies not started reviewing applications yet? There's anything from small startups to big 4 on the list of companies I applied for. 

TL;DR:  New to the tech summer intern hiring cycle. Most of my applications are  still ""Submitted"" but not rejected. Is it too early/late to be hearing  back for interviews? Have I just been ghosted?"

9rmrd3,66,2018-10-26,"Anxiety/depression f*cked up my life, now what",Polar-94,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9rmrd3/anxietydepression_fcked_up_my_life_now_what/,"So I’m in a real mess.

After struggling with depression in my teen years, I was motivated to help others by using my life to help develop new treatments for mental illness (depression, dementia etc.). Current treatments for depression (SSRI’s) are often not effective and bring awful side effects, so I wanted to help develop new drugs – and I was pretty good in science at school so this seemed like a logical choice. My family always pressured me to study medicine, but I wasn’t quite *that* good of a student. So I did what I thought was the next best thing.

I did my BSc in Medical Neuroscience and then did an MSc in Molecular Neuroscience, both from top UK research universities. The original plan was to get into academic research, but I later discovered that only the very best students get on a PhD. Thus, I’ve had a lot of pressure on me to succeed, but secretly I knew I didn’t really want to work in academia nor in a lab – I hated it – but I felt like it was too late to change my mind; “I’ve already got this far, I can’t quit now”. For both this reason amongst others, both past and present, my mental health started to deteriorate; I wasn’t sleeping or eating properly and I couldn’t focus, but I didn’t tell anyone since I thought I should just “pull myself together”. By the end of my Master’s, I was struggling to keep up, my attendance was poor and I had to re-sit an exam twice – but luckily I still managed to graduate.

I spent the first 6 months after graduating applying for various Research Assistant jobs both in university labs and in industry. These jobs are often a good opportunity to get experience and for networking to help get onto a PhD programme. I managed to land interviews at the likes of the University of Cambridge and various well-known pharmaceutical companies; however I was always rejected due a lack of laboratory experience (my experience consists of two very specialised 3-4 month lab research projects). I thought if I sold myself well enough, I’d be able to pick up the skills I lack. But after 6 months I realised I wasn’t getting anywhere, so decided to abandon that idea – I don’t think I’d even enjoy that career anyway. I never enjoyed lab work, it was always the theoretical side of science I enjoyed more; learning about it, writing about it, analysing the data from my research projects – I enjoyed writing essays and almost always got first class grades in my essays and dissertations in college. So I figured there must be something I can do in science, outside of a lab.

I found out about the Medical Communications industry which seemed like a perfect fit for me – I could see myself really enjoying it as a career – so I spent the next few months learning about it and applying for various scientific/medical writing jobs in the industry, with the help of specialised recruitment agencies. However, as it turns out, most employers for these positions only want PhD graduates; sometimes there are opportunities for MSc graduates, but these are few and far between. I’ve actually written a blog on neuroscience research (which I linked in my CV), so I thought coupled with my enthusiasm, if I sell myself well I might be a good candidate nonetheless. However I’ve only secured 2 interviews in the last few months, one of which wasn’t even strictly a writing position. I’ve been given a few writing tests by potential employers, but they’ve told me that although I write well and have a good scientific understanding, I lack the level of clinical knowledge required. I’ve since discovered that the MedComms industry is apparently “notoriously difficult” to get into, even if you have a PhD – which I don’t. So I’m probably wasting my time with that one too.

At the same time I’ve also been applying for more general office jobs – data analyst, digital marketing, account executive etc. (none of these interest me, I’m just getting desperate). But I’m not getting anything – only an endless series of rejections scattered with the occasional interview, which always ends with the same, “*you were a good candidate, but somebody else was better*”. I also had one interview for something totally unrelated to my field which turned out to be a scam.

So a year after graduating I still haven’t found a job; despite having applied for hundreds, I’ve only had a handful of interviews. It seems my degrees aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on; unless you want to get on a PhD, but those are extremely competitive, and neither my grades nor experience (nor references) are particularly impressive.

To top it all off, toxic relationships in my personal/home life have really knocked my self-esteem and confidence this past year, which has made it especially hard to keep motivated and believe in myself – even if I could find a career I might be good at. I’m currently back living at home and on jobseekers allowance, though I don’t actually see any of that money. I’m desperate for any sort of work I can do – I just want a life at this point – but apparently I’m unemployable for anything.

I’ve never worked an actual job in my life; I’ve been living on student loans the past 5 years. I never got a summer job – I was always told I needed to “relax” and “de-stress” over the holidays. In hindsight, I should have ignored that advice and got anything just to pad out my CV. I really screwed myself over there, because now apart from my academic/lab research projects (basically doing the same things a Research Assistant does), I have no actual work experience on my CV; which makes it ten times harder to land interviews.

Though I’d love to, I can’t afford to go back to college and study something else, and I can’t afford to take unpaid internships – I need/want money to live, and I have debts which need to be repaid immediately.

But my most significant problems now are explaining the &gt;1 year career gap, and my lack of references. By itself, the events described are not convincing. I’ve tried being honest about it, but that’s never a good idea – the moment you mention mental health in a job interview, you might as well show yourself out the door. I’ve tried lying about it, or at least stretching the truth (travelling, voluntary work, freelancing), but I’m not a good liar (I’m told I have good interview technique though, so it’s not that). I also don’t have any references at this point, since my last project supervisor only had bad things to say about me, and my previous supervisor doesn’t remember me.

I’ve even applied for low-paid jobs in supermarkets but never heard back – I’m assuming because I’m overqualified. Yet if I omit my education from my CV, then it’s essentially a blank CV (plus some hobbies). Recruiters tell me I have a good CV, there’s just not enough work experience on it – so it’s not that either. In any case, I would really struggle with any sort of customer service focused job (sales, retail, bar work) where extroverts typically thrive. This sort of work would be extremely stressful for me; I’d work better and be happier in some sort of technical position. But I have no real (employable) skills in anything besides neuroscience, and these are totally useless for anything outside of academia/lab work.

So I need to teach myself something from scratch, since I can’t afford to go back to college.

My passions in general are more creative. I’m really into music – I play instruments, I’ve written/produced a fair bit of my own stuff, and it’s the only thing that really excites me. However I’m aware that it’s unrealistic to make a living of making music. I’m not sure what other sort of jobs in the music industry I could do? Is there any music related career I could teach myself without requiring a music degree/college? Perhaps sound engineer/producer, recording artist etc

I’m pretty good with computers; I could see myself enjoying something like programming. However I have zero experience with coding, and I feel like it’s a field saturated with highly-experienced experts and Computer Science graduates – it would take me years to get to a level where I could compete with them, and I'm not sure what I could do in the meantime to pay the bills.

I also enjoy writing – hence my attempts to find a job in scientific writing. But I’m aware that it’s unrealistic to make a living from writing, too (unless you’re extremely good), so I'm not sure what I could do with that either – especially without a degree in English or Journalism etc.

I feel like I’m stuck and I don’t know where to go from here. It’s hard to stay positive when I get rejected from everything I try for and put down by everyone around me. It’s like a full-time job searching for jobs, calling recruiters, writing applications, cover letters, proficiency tests – only for it all to end in nothing, rinse and repeat. I’m tired of it. I’m sick of feeling like a failure and being told I’m a disappointment – I worked extremely hard in college and completed grad school, much to my surprise. Yet I feel like I’m no good for anything.

I need a new path, but I’m afraid to take any step since this feels like the biggest choice of my life, and I haven't exactly made good choices thus far. I just want a career I’m even remotely interested in and which gives me money to pay bills and live my life (I’m 24 and feel like I’ve wasted it thus far), but I don’t want to make a bad choice again and end up being miserable and hating my job every day.

I also really need to move out and get away from my family. I love them but they're a source/agonist of a lot of my anxiety and always have been. Moving out is a priority. Plus I live in a small town where there's nothing to do and not a lot of people my age. I feel like I'm missing out on life. But I'm not sure what job I can get with no experience, which pays enough to afford my own rent, and allows me time to learn a new career from scratch.

Honestly maybe this should be in /r/depression.

Any advice?"

I have applied for some internships for the summer to help build more experience. 
9rmuy7,12,2018-10-26,Continuing treatment for my ADHD while on internship in Germany,saltshakercat,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/9rmuy7/continuing_treatment_for_my_adhd_while_on/,"\[Important stuff in bold so you all don't have to read my wall of text. Thanks so much to anyone who can help or point me in the right direction. Don't worry about sending articles in German; I can read them\]

I am 20 years old and have ADHD-PI. I was only diagnosed a year ago because my mother didn't believe in ADHD treatments so I had to wait till I was 18 to go through the steps of getting a diagnosis. Meds (Concerta 36mg ER) have helped me SO much and I can actually be productive at work now and get things done. It's amazing. It used to be in an 8hr workday I'd do maybe 3-4 hours of work and spend the rest of the time staring into space, getting distracted or trying to remember what I was doing. (According to most of my friends my ADHD is relatively severe and very noticeable).

I've been looking into getting a 6 month Computer Science internship in Germany. I speak German (Sprachdiplom B1, Mom is fluent, speak Denglish at home) and I have family there that I've visited/stayed with before. I was looking into how bringing prescription meds works in Germany, and I am very confused. Onto my questions.

Most sites are like, just bring enough for the time you're there! Problem is that in my state you can only get a 30 day supply at a time with 0 refills. So I can't just bring it with me.

1. If I am diagnosed with ADHD in America will that carry over to Germany? (I have a \~20 page neuropsychological evaluation that diagnoses me with ADHD, Anxiety and Depression and goes through all the tests they did to diagnose me plus their results, all in English obviously). Or **do I have to get another, German ADHD diagnosis?**
2. If it does carry over, how do I go about getting my medication? I assume I'd show them my diagnostic paperwork, maybe a letter from my psychiatrist explaining what medication I'm taking and why I need it. **What kind of doctor would I go to** and **how would I find them**? Like I said, I do speak German but all my paperwork is in English so they would have to be able to read it.
3. My mom was asking **if I can get my American prescription mailed to Germany**. I've done some reading and it appears this is illegal. Does this mean I'd definitely have to go through getting a German prescription?
4. Health insurance wise, if I'm doing a paid internship for six months I assume I'd get **public health insurance. What does this cover in terms of medication?** 
   1.  I've heard that **public insurance will not cover Adult ADHD medication**. Is this still true?
   2. **Would I have any trouble getting my antidepressants?** Again, I kind of need those to function and I can't go off them. It's less urgent though cause I would probably be able to get some kind of 6 month supply as they're not controlled
5. I've been looking into **traveler/expat insurance** for my time there. **Would this be a better option?**

Thanks so much to anyone who has any information, even if it doesn't exactly answer my questions. Also any links regarding exactly what public German insurance does/does not cover would be super helpful. "

We're definitely not doing anything that's cutting edge, but since this field seems to be kinda in demand right now, two other employees were recently offered better deals at other companies and are leaving.

This is an issue because that would leave me as the only data engineer in the whole company. That's a big deal for me since prior that, I had only been working as an intern. My workload is about to increase substantially, and I'm not quite sure how I'll be able to handle it. I know the systems we use and everything, but it's a lot for someone whose only been an intern.

I'm not really sure what to do. Here are some of my thoughts on this:

Pros:

This could lead to a promotion.

It's a big opportunity to show what I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons.

I won't have any mentorship.

I'll be the only one on the team for a while. (Hiring is a slow process here)

I'm just starting out.

If anything goes wrong, I will be the only person to blame."

&amp;#x200B;

1. Alka Gandhi is teaching Econometrics 1 next semester. I'm looking at the planetterp data currently &amp; her class GPA is a 2.03 (median is a C) + 14% fail rate). What makes her class so difficult? Is it a lot of Stata proofs? No curve? Not enough homework?
2. The follow-up question has to do with trying to land internships: So my GPA is currently a 3.06, I could push Econ422 back a semester and take Econ406 instead (the teacher has a 3.17 GPA for that class). From my understanding Econometrics is the most important class in the B.S curriculum, so it would be nice having that class under my belt before summer of 2019. Should I take Econ 406 instead, keeping my GPA above 3.0+ going into next summer &amp; work on Python/SQL/Excel skills as well. Or should I take Econ 422 and risk gutting my GPA below a 3.0 going into next summer?

Tl;dr - Econ 422 is important to take but may affect my internship chances if I drop below a 3.0. Do I worry about the classes I've taken, or worry about my GPA for an internship next summer? (This would also be the last summer before I graduate, worth noting)."
9rog9a,0,2018-10-26,Delaying graduation year for doing 6 tech internships in total?,poutineislife75,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/9rog9a/delaying_graduation_year_for_doing_6_tech/,"How beneficial is it to graduate with 6 tech internships (so 24 months of internship experience) but at the cost of delaying my graduation date by a year? So far, I already did 2 four-month summer tech internships, with the most recent one at a big N tech company; and I will be returning back to that company this summer. 

If I do take a year off to do 3 more internships, I will graduate a year later, and I will need to find a Fall 2019, Winter 2020, and Summer 2020 internship (assuming they don't take me back as an intern for the third time). I heard it is hard to achieve since there is a limited amount of Fall and Winter internship positions. However, I do like this approach because it helps diversify my resume and I would like to experience what it is like to work in different environments at different companies before I start a full time job for 5-10 or 20 years. 

However, if I don't delay my graduation, I will graduate on time and the company might give me a full time offer after I graduate. My biggest concern for that option is that on my resume I will graduate with only three internships; two of them from the same company. Moreover, I am also concerned in missing out on the full time offer (since they mostly hire full times from their intern program and I do like their culture as well compared to my first internship experience). 

Hence, what is your opinion in delaying graduation by a year to get more internship experiences? Is it beneficial?"

So long story short I have to switch to an Information Science Major, with a Concentration in Data Science Major from my CS for a few reasons (and no I can’t stay CS unfortunately) 

However, I still want be a software dev, and more specifically either web dev or maybe the data analytics and science side

How much will I be hindered by this degree? Both in the short term and long term? Is it still possible for me to get into software development? Will I need to get a CS masters asap?

I had an internship already last summer as a Summer Tech Intern for a decent sized finance company where I was doing software work in Java and SQL. It ended up being moreso a lot of Junit testing and testcase writing rather than actual dev work though, but I’ve been highlighting the small dev stuff I did there more. 

Looking for another final internship this summer (Junior) and I’m noticing a lot of places do say CS or other related technical degree. I’m definitely proactive when it comes to learning on the side, so I’m hoping that can carry me + an active GitHub portfolio 

—————

Courses I’ve taken from CS before having to switch:

OOP 1 and 2 (Java)

Intro To Comp Systems (C, Assembly), 

Calc 1/2, 

Linear Alg (Matlab), 

Statistics 

—————

Coursework I’ll be taking with new major over next two semesters. There’s still a decent amount of programming done in the major, just not really algorithms/data structures focused but I’d be willing to self learn that:

Data Statistics (R)

Database design and modeling (SQL)

User Centered Design

Dynamic Web Apps (JS)

Data Sources and Manip (Python)

Advanced data science (Python)

Intro to Data Viz (Python)

9rqnwc,1,2018-10-26,A Girl Named Vannessa,AnimeLuva,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9rqnwc/a_girl_named_vannessa/," 

Love can hurt. Love can be pretty painful sometimes.

I know this because I was a victim. Not a victim of divorce. Not even a simple break-up. No... I was a victim of something, more sad. Sinister, if you will. This is my story.

It was September 1996. I was in the 11th grade of a private school in Philadelphia. My friends, Jared, Carlos, Markus, Franklin and I, were total nerds. We always watched a bunch of movies and anime and even talked about which girls were the hottest at our school. 

Jared, the tallest of them, had more of a thing for young actresses. His favorite out of all was Alicia Silverstone, who played Cher in the Movie ""Clueless"" from last year. Mark and Frank meanwhile had the hots for Anime girls. Carlos and I were mostly Neutral. 

Most of the Jocks girls at our school usually ignored us, most likely because we had a pretty pervy nature. They were more into the big muscular dudes who worked out in the gym. The one they found the most attractive was Braden, a greaser, Handsome and tough. Basically who you'd call ""King of the school"". The nerdy girls, we had no interest in. Despite them being nerdy like us, we never had any love relations with them. We were friends with one of them, Denitra, but we wouldn't go that far, unfortunately.

Getting back on topic, on the first day of school, before classes started, the teacher came in announcing that a new student had just transfered to our school. When she walked in, my friends and I were stunned to see the new girl.

She was an asian girl. Cinnamon red lipstick, Red eye color (Pretty rare if you think about it), and even long, black hair, a Brunette. She came in with a cute smile on her face, innocent and pure. Her name was Vannessa Kawasaki.

She was a Japanese girl, Born in Nagoya, Japan in the late 1970's, but her family was part-russian and she spent most of her childhood in Moscow. They migrated to America Following the Collapse of the Soviet Union, just 5 years prior.

Frank uttered out a little joke, saying that she looked like she walked straight out of an anime. Jared even wondered if she were a teenage actress from Japan. I was neutral between the two theories. She took her seat next to me, Jared and Frank. I hadn't noticed how she felt about me until about a month later.

It was now October 31st, 1996, The night of the Halloween Costume Dance. Me and My friends were dressed in red, glittering Tuxedos so we could attract some of the girls at our school. Markus brought up the idea. I wasn't keen on it but he forced me to do it, so I tagged along.

We wore masks like it was some fancy masquerade party. We asked the girls if we could have a dance with them, and we were, as expected, rejected by many of them, mostly the not-so-nerdy ones, but that was when it happened.

That was when Vannessa came up to me. She wore a Blue dress with a short skirt, a mask of a bunny, and had blue make-up. She wore black gloves, high-heels and blue stockings as if trying to seduce me, and at that point, she really was.

I remember her saying that she wanted to take me to a quiet secluded area, as if she wanted to have a private dance with me. I agreed and went with her to the back of the boy's locker room. The fact that I did even upsets me to this day.

The first thing I remembered from when we entered the back locker room was how spartan it was. It looked dusty, with a chair and some desks. Vannessa said she wanted to be away from the crowd, to be with me. She admitted that she loved me. She didn't care about who I was and what flaws I had both inside and out, or if my friends were total weirdo's.

I accepted her confession, but as we were about to kiss, The teacher, his name is Mr. Barkley by the way, burst into the room. I remember he had a confused look on his face, as if he said ""Eugene, Vannessa, What are you two doing in here? This area is off-limits!"". Jared came in, and he wondered what was going on. Barkley told him it was none of his business, but then I came in, saying that Vannessa wanted to be away from the crowd.

""Well, you can at least go to the hallway. This is a storage area and besides, you, Vannessa, are in the BOY's locker room!"" He rambled on and on and we eventually changed our minds and went back to the gymnasium. We danced, and even kissed. We even shared our phone numbers so we could contact eachother. My friends were jealous because they had no luck in trying to get any girls. The next day, as I was about to open my locker, they ambushed me. Jared, being as tough as he was, pinned me against the locker.

""Eugene, You lucky Son of a bitch! How come YOU were able to score a pretty young thang, let alone the new girl Vannessa, when WE had no luck?! How the hell did you do that man?! Answer us!"" Jared yelled at me, still grappling my shoulder against the locker.

""She just- she-"" I stuttered, answering Jared's question. ""She just asked me if- If I cou- could go into the storage room with her for a private dance!""

""BULL. FUCKING. DOG SHIT! There is no way she woul-"" Markus said before he was interrupted by the sound of the bell ringing. Jared let go of me.

""We'll talk about this later during Lunch period!"" Exclaimed Jared.

I finished unpacking my things and putting my backpack away in my locker, when I was suddenly startled by Vannessa, who managed to run into me while I was getting ready to go to class.

""Some friends you have."" She said.

""Jeez, you scared me there, girl.""

""I'm sorry. I just noticed your friends taking their jealousy out on you. Real shame they can't find a lovely girl like me. What foolish dweebs."" She giggled.

We talked along the way to class. I remembered that Jared and the others were expecting me at Lunch, so as I went to the cafeteria, I asked Vannessa if she could come with me to see my friends. She nodded, and so she told my friends the story of how it all happened on that night.

January 1997, our first date. We were on a School trip to New York City. We rode the Subways, explored Times Square, and even went to the top of the Empire State Building. Vannessa told me she always wanted to visit the city's tallest buildings, the World Trade Center. I remembered when we were on the top of the Twin Towers, Vannessa and I kissed, and somehow, as we did, my friends, still jealous of me, snapped a photo of me and Vannessa kissing. Vannessa didn't mind though, she laughed at my friends' stupitidy and how gullible they were.

Together, we were perfect. Me and Vannessa. However, my social studies teacher, Ms. Leblanc, didn't trust Vannessa, or her nature. One day in May, me and Leblanc had argued.

""You have no clue what Ms. Kawasaki might do, Eugene. She could be dangerous.""

""What are you talking about? She's nice, innocent, and yes, can be a bit mischevious at times, but there's nothing wrong with her. Why be so suspicious of her? She's only been here for almost a year now, why the sudden suspicion???"" I questioned her regarding Vannessa.

""SUDDEN Suspicion?! Hmph! Remember when she took you to that storage room in the boys locker room back on Halloween night?""

""Uh, Yeah, why?""

""Wasn't it obvious? She was trying to seduce you into making LOVE with her!""

""What?! Come on!"" I laughed. ""She just only wanted to have a private dance with me. What's wrong with that?""

""That is EXACTLY what I am talking about. Listen, she MAY be innocent, but even if so, she could still be dangerous. I will only let it slide for now, since there isn't anything to prove against her. At that time of the Halloween Dance, she was only in for almost 2 months, and you haven't even engaged in friendship until that night.""

""Yeah, so what? I love her, and I am NOT letting you interfere in our relationship! I know you want me to be safe and all, but this is just not the way to achieve it."" I told her, in a serious tone.

""Don't talk back to me like that, young man! I know you love her, but..."" She sighed. She was lost for words on what to say next.

""...I'll let you two be. But don't think I didn't warn you.""

I left the room and then proceeded to the next class. The next few months were pretty rough between me and Leblanc. We had argued alot over Vannessa, but she soon gave up, as she had no evidence against her. She feared that, as time went on, something bad would happen. In December that same year however, she was killed in a car wreck.

The School gathered for the funeral. Me, Vannessa and my friends, were present. Vannessa told me after the funeral that Leblanc wasn't to be trusted, that she (Leblanc) was trying to spread a rumor that would damage her reputation. Vannessa had no trust in Leblanc either. She believed that Leblanc was trying to get dirt on her so she could be expelled. I remember agreeing with her, and to this day, I wish I trusted Leblanc instead of Vannessa, because in the coming months after that, I would encounter something horrible.

It was now August of 1998. We had just graduated High School 2 months prior. We went to Vannessa's house to celebrate her birthday.

Vannessa and her family lived in a Dairy farm just miles northwest of the city. It was a quiet area to be quite frankly honest.

It was one crazy party though. We brought some booze, weed, and even some whiskey. We even jammed to some tunes from the late 2Pac and Biggie smalls.

Vannessa and her friends were talking about usual girly stuff, and even watched some baseball on television. Markus and Frank were cracking jokes about the president, and how he was having a ""Sweet ol' time"" with someone he wasn't even married to, Braden however was just being... well, Braden. Attracting girls with his greaser vibe.

Jared and Carlos usually hung around the basement, playing Resident Evil on the Sega Saturn. What caught my attention however, was a locked door that led to a tornado shelter. The sign read ""TORNADO SHELTER. USE IN CASE OF CATOSTROPHIC DISASTER.""

Carlos came in. ""It seems you found it too, huh?"" he said when he approached me. ""She seems to be hiding something in there, Eugene. I got a quick look through the keyhole. She's got what appears to be a bunch of suggestive gear. Even some sharp objects.""

""Don't get paranoid, Carl.""

""I'm supposed to be paranoid here, Eugene. We've got most of our friends upstairs jamming to music and even watching the Phillies game. What about Jared here?""

""It's okay Carl, my man. Jared's my- er, OUR best friend. I'll never let anything bad happen to him. No need to worry.""

""I know you will. Listen, your girl Vannessa? She happened to lock that door REAL tight the second we entered the house. I can recall I heard a noise from the basement. Now we gotta know for sure what is behind this door. Go find a lock-pick or something so we can have this off in a second. We gotta do it before Birthday dinner.""

""Hold on, bro. Think this through for a moment. You destroy the lock, and what if it turns out you were wrong? You may have fucked your chance to get a good meal from the nice, delicious dinner Vannessa would be serving us. Use your head, Carl...""

""Okay, Smarty-pants, what've you got?""

""Let me look at what we're dealing with first.""

I looked at the lock, and examined the Lock-pad first.

""Hey, uh, Eugene? You know how to pick a lock, right?""

""What? No! Why the hell would you say that?""

""I don't know, 'cause you're... uh........ a free-man?""

""Oh, you gotta be shitting me. Are you saying what I think you're saying?""

""Jeez, man, my family and I are from New Orleans! Shit just comes out of my mouth sometimes. Sorry 'bout that.""

I then examined the screws, and that's when an idea popped into my head.

""See those screws? Instead of just breaking the Lock-pad, we could just dismantle the assembly, then have a peak inside and then put it back together like nothing had ever happened.""

""Alright, looks like we've got ourselves a plan. I'll hang around by Jared while he's playing his game.""

""Resident Evil?""

""Really? I thought it was House of The Dead... Whatever...""

Vannessa came in. ""Can I help you two?""

I made an excuse. ""Carl thought he heard a noise.""

""Huh, pretty jumpy, I see? Well at least most of the others are here. It wouldn't be much of a party without them around. Now please, do me a favor, leave that door alone. I always get nervous whenever I think about it.""

Her friends called out. ""Vannessa, come up! The Phillies scored a home-run!""

""Okay, I'll be right up!""

I asked Carlos if there was a way to distract Vannessa. He and I hoped the baseball game was good enough. I was able to find what appeared to be a Multi-tool in the backyard, but as I had entered the house, I felt that Vannessa or anyone else in the house would be suspicious if I just held it in my hand, so I hid it in my front pocket. I hid it all the way so it wouldn't poke out.

As I headed back towards the basement, I reported back to Carlos. ""Nothing to stop you now!"" he said. However, as I reached the door the tornado shelter, the dinner-bell rang.

""Aw yeah! Dinner Time! I'm hungry!"" Said Jared, as he paused the game. ""Come on, you guys! Lets eat!""

""I'm gonna make an excuse for you. Get that thing off!""

As they left, I unscrewed the screws, quickly, and quietly, hoping that no one would catch me in the act. As I opened the door, what I saw shocked me.

The Shelter was a large room, about the size of a tennis field. There was blood spilled on the walls. There were some saws, knives, and a bunch of BDSM gear. A whip, a latex suit, ballgags, ropes, cuffs, even a box of lubricant. There was even a locker and a bathtub, both of which had a foul smell. I was too afraid to know what was inside of them.

As I stood in front of the horrifying nature of the room, I heard a voice. It was Vannessa.

""Darling, didn't you hear the bell?"" She smiled with a creepy grin. ""Dinner time.""

""Why is there so much blood in this room?! What happened in there?!""

""Listen, You don't know this, but my parents are top hunters. When they hunt a deer down, they skin it and dress it back there. We don't like to make a mess in the house, so you see? Nothing to worry about.""

I let it slide, and cooperated with her up to the dining room. I can hear the other guests as they were excited to eat dinner.

""Whoa-hoa, boy! I tell you guys and gals, that Vannessa girl is an angel!"" said Braden.

""Everyone sit down as I get the meal! Oh, this is just wonderful!"" Said Vannessa, as she entered the dining room.

""Man, I could eat a buffalo!"" said Markus.

""Where are Frank and Denitra?"" I asked.

""Don't worry about them. I already brought some food up. They just need some rest after drinking so much alcohol...""

""Mind if I wash my hands first?""

""Sure thing, Darling. Bathroom is just around the corner. Plus, be sure to get under your nails, you've been walking in the dirt all day.""

As I walked to the bathroom, I noticed the picture of her family. Loving family from the look of it, but little did I know...

I was about to go to the bathroom, when suddenly I thought about going upstairs. Now really, I should have just used the bathroom, because I knew that I could get in trouble if Vannessa found out I had lied about washing my hands. However, curiousity got the better of me, and I proceeded upstairs.

I remembered how dark the upstairs floor was. The first thing I noticed was the closet. Inside, what I saw was what appeared to be a bunch of medical supplies. Then I noticed a cord. I plugged it in, and a beam of light jumped to life. The cord seemed to lead into an unknown room.

I then opened the door to a bedroom, and noticed Frank and Denitra were missing. I then noticed what looked to be fresh blood on the floor. Outside the window, a storm appeared to be rushing in. I then proceeded to a bookshelf, which happened to be blocking a door. There was nothing out of the ordinary with it, just a bunch of books. Some were about history, others were works of fiction, some either from H. G. Wells, or C. S. Lewis.

I Pushed the bookshelf aside, and opened the door to the source of the light. Inside, I saw a horrifying sight....

It was a bathroom, with blood splattered all over the walls. Denitra layed in the bathtub, lifeless. Blood and guts were spilled out of her stomach. Franklin had layed on the floor, with his legs hacked off, and what looked like a swastika cut into his chest.

""Help... me..."" he said in sheer agony...

""Oh, shit! Frank, What happened to you and Denitra?!""

""V- Vannessa...""

""The hell happed to your legs, man?!""

""Eugine, D-don't... eat... dinner......""

""Don't eat di-?! Oh, fuck!""

I could hear Vannessa's voice from downstairs. ""Oh, dear, Eugene, Darling, Did you fall asleep? Dinner's on the table where everyone's havin' at!""

I ran downstairs quickly, and as I went back to the dining room, I noticed Jared, about to eat a piece of Frank's legs.

""JARED, DON'T EAT THAT!""

The others were startled. ""Jesus H. Christ, Eugene..."" Said Carlos. ""Did you find something?""

Braden butted in. ""Come on Eugene, sit your fuckin' ass down and eat! Your girl just made you a nice meal!""

""Frank and Denitra are both upstairs! Denitra's been cut up and both of Frank's fucking legs have been chopped off! You're eating them!""

Everyone thought I was making a sick joke.

Brad raised his tone. ""Shut the fuck up! Your girl here made you a homecooked meal, you dense piece of shit. Show some respect for once! I bet you don't even have the damned DECENCY to show a girl respect on her birthday! It just sickens me, really does.""

""Well you know what?! Fuck you, Brad! Eat the fuck up!""

""Oh I will, and I will eat EVERY last bite of it!""

To this day, I wish I never had Brad eat human flesh without him realizing it...

""My goodness, Eugene, the hell's gotten into your head?""

""Don't indulge him, you dorks. He's always in his own world 'n' shit.""

Carlos grabbed the plate from Markus. ""Wh-? The fuck, man? I was eating that!""

""We have to get out of here! What I'm saying is that Vannessa here is serving you pieces of Denitra and Franklin! Vannessa! Tell us they're not being eaten right now!""

Vannessa was speechless. She sighed, and then told the truth. ""It's true... but you have to understand though, many people have their secrets, even if they can be sickening. My mom always told me that back when I was a little girl. It doesn't even matter anyway. Besides, your president even had a sexual affair with someone who wasn't even his wife, and we all know how that happened! True, he lied about it at first, but then he was honest about it in the end! Some people will have to come out of the closet eventually!""

""Vannessa, you're sick. Sick in the fucking head! I can't believe I wanted to go out with you in the first place!""

""Aw, darling! That's not a nice thing to imply now, is it?""

She continued. ""I also killed both my parents, because they knew their daughter was gonna kill them anyways. They knew they'd meet an uncertain fate............"" She paused for a moment.

""....................Like all of you...""

""Mark, Call 911!""

Just as Mark got his cell-phone out, Vannessa quickly snached it from his hands.

""You're not calling ANYBODY. Nobody will! If I can't have nice friends like all of you, NOBODY CAN!!!!""

Everyone panicked. Brad stuttered, the girls screamed, and I could even hear Markus going ""Oh god, please, no! No no no, I don't wanna die like this man! Eugine, man, what the FUCK did we just eat?!""

""Everyone, everything will be okay!"" I assured. Suddenly, we heard a noise, and saw that it was Franklin, who fell down the stairs, dragging his torso. ""H-help.... S-s-someb-body....""

Suddenly, Vannessa hit me with a heavy object, knocking me out. I had no clue how long I was knocked out for. I could hear faint sounds of the other guests being stabbed, chopped up, or even tased by stun-guns. The next thing I could recall was when I woke up, I was back in the Tornado shelter/Torture chamber, chained to a chair, unable to move my arms and legs. My mouth was tapped shut so I couldn't scream.

I struggled to get out. I kicked, I cursed, I begged... but to no avail. The room was dimly lit, and I could see a familiar vague shadow. Vannessa appeared, now in a latex maiden suit, covered in blood, with a stiletto knife in her hand.

""It seems you've finally woken up, darling..."" She said, as she giggled. Her smile was innocent no more... ""I know that what you had witnessed was truly, and utterly terrifying, but it's okay now, silly! You're safe with me now! No-one can hurt you no more...""

I let out muffled screams. I cryed and begged for her to let me go, but with no luck whatsoever...

""Sh- shush... don't cry... we can now be together forever and ever and ever and-"" She then noticed I looked at both the closet and the bathtub.

""Oh, it seems you noticed where both my parents are. Remember when I said I killed them? I didn't just stab them to death, I also chopped them up and then ate their delicious, tasty organs....""

It soon dawned on me that Vannessa, the girl I had fallen in love with, was a cannibal. She had apparently ate the organs of her victims in the name of love for me. Frank, Denitra, Her parents, and now Jared, Carlos, Braden, Mark and the others....

I thought to myself ""My god... Ms. Leblanc was right this whole time, this whole FUCKING time! You ARE dangerous! Not just that, You're a monster! I'm so sorry Leblanc... I wish I noticed earlier....""

Vannessa continued on. ""I'm sorry you had to witness such a horrifying predicament... Poor Mark though, he was screaming about how he didn't wanna die, how he didn't want to become a tasty, delightful dish... but honestly, he was asking for it, and so I granted his wish. I'm cooking him right now as we speak! He should be ready by now..."" She giggled, in a sinister tone... ""I'll be right back, Sweetheart!"" She kissed me, and then walked back upstairs.

As I waited, I could hear the ghostly voices of my friends....

""Told you there was something about this room, man. It's a fucking sex Dungeon/human slaughter house!""

""You made me eat Frank's legs... You knew... and you made me EAT THEM! You dumb fuck! You did it just to piss me off.... and then get me fucking killed!""

""She thinks scandals like the President's sexual affair with an intern gives her the right to SECRETLY Kill and eat people?! What kind of girl did you fall in love with, Eugene?! You should have told us before dinner, and then the police could handle the situation! But NOOOOOOO, you just had to be a fucking coward about it and stay silent 'til later tonight! You hear me?! You're a COOOWAAAARRRD!!!! A COWARD, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE! GO ON COWARD! ROT IN THIS FUCKING ROOM WITH THAT SICK, TWISTED BITCH YOU CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND!!! It's over for you! You know what you did!""

I took every second of it. All the guilt, the horror, the fact that I could have reported to the police after encountering the room at first hand. I noticed my phone on the table nearby. The screen had cracked, one of the buttons missing, and its paint scratched up. I had no clue if it would still work, but even if it did, I still couldn't get loose to go get it....

Vannessa eventually came back, feeding me bits of human flesh from Mark. I pitied him, and hoped he would forgive me. I just wished they all would. As time went on, being held captive in her forbidden room, I had no luck of escape. She would feed me human meat, torture me, rape me, and even carve messages into my skin with a knife. Messages like ""E + V 4EVER"", ""I'M HER SLAVE"", And even hateful symbols, such as a Pentagram or a Swastika.

16 Years later, we eventually had a kid. A boy. He would be named after one of Vannessa's later victims. Ralph. He would spend most of his life with Vannessa and would occasionally be with me from time to time. She never released me. She kept me captive in the house. Her previous attempts of having a child always ended in miscarriage but this time she was successful. Little did she know that a year later, she would let her guard down, and I would make my great escape.

Which now brings me to May 2015. One night, as she came to check up on me, I asked her If I could be the dominatrix this time. I asked if she could wear one of her sexy costumes and she agreed. She wore a playboy bunny costume, and had brought me ropes so I could tie her up. And so I did. I tied her tightly, putting her hands behind her back in the shape of a box, tying a crotch-rope under her, and you know what I did next?

I tied and hung a noose on a hook carried over a suspended beam to a valve, and then tied the noose tightly around her neck. After doing so, I tugged the crotch rope a bit to get her excited. She then wanted me to raise her higher. As I reached the valve, she asked me something.

""Hey, Darling, If you don't mind my asking, why did you decide you wanted to be the one in control?""

""Oh, uh... Why? Well, I guess it's so...."" I paused for a moment.

""...........................SO I COULD ESCAPE!""

And then, I did it. I hanged her, as High as the valve could go, and watched her asphyxiate. She struggled to break free from the noose's grasp. She kicked, she tried to untie herself, but to no avail. As I watched her slowly die, I then grabbed my cell-phone, and attempted to call the police. 

The phone took about a minute to boot back up. I was surprised my phone had still worked even though I hadn't been able to use it in years. As I left the basement and went up to look for Ralph, I called the police. I told them there was a disturbance going on. I told them to send in many cars as they can and even went as far as telling them to dispatch a helicopter and even the SWAT team.

I then found Ralph in his bedroom and took him into my arms, ran out of the house, and then boarded him into the front passenger seat of a nearby car. I then started the car, and drove off. I never took any driving lessons back in High School, but I did play a lot of racing games back then.

As I drove along the road, I could see lights flashing red and blue ahead. The police had come, but only 3 cars were present. I drove as far as I could, even as far from the city of Philadelphia, and onto a highway, crossing the Benjamin Franklin Bridge over the border to New Jersey, switching onto Interstate 295, then onto the NJ Turnpike, passing the tollbooth, and then past Newark Airport. I exited at a town nearby New York, now in search of finding Ralph an orphanage. I was lucky enough to find one in Hoboken.

I told them that I had no experience in taking care of children, that Ralph needed shelter and proper care. Ralph was now safe, but now, I had to find a home. I didn't want to go back to Philly, because I had a feeling they would find me and send me to prison for hanging Vannessa. I drove to the city to try and find somewhere to live. Eventually I ran out of gas as I reached a vacant apartment building. I then parked my car and rented a room. I was lucky to have brought money with me.

The room, though being small, was still good enough for me to stay in. A TV, a bed, a kitchen... everything was nice.

Exhausted, I went into my bed, and fell asleep. That night never left me so distraught. I kept thinking to myself about it all everyday. Not a single day goes by where I wish I would've done things differently....

First off, it didn't take me long to realize why only 3 police cars showed up. The night I escaped Vannessa's house, An Amtrak Northeast Regional Train had derailed from going too fast over a 50 MPH curve. The driver was apparently distracted by a radio chatter reporting that someone had thrown a rock at a Commuter train's windshield. 8 people were killed and hundreds were injured.

I wonder now if that was why only 3 police cars turned up instead of how many I requested. The timing as such when law enforcements turned a blind eye while I escaped from being trapped in that house, was somehow a coincidence. Eventually they would soon investigate the house I had escaped, and look for clues. They would be unable to perform any arrests, as Vannessa would soon be pronounced DOA.

It has now been 3 years since that night. 3 Valentine's days. I now have a job, working as a computer technician in New York. Ralph is now 4 years old. I visit him every week on Sundays. He now goes to Preschool in Jersey City. I try not to tell him about his mother, as it would only bring back memories from that night.

Sometimes I visit the places me and Vannessa used to go while dating. I even once went to visit the house she kept me in, only to find out it had been torn down. It is now the site of a new windmill farm. The Twin Towers, the place where Vannessa and I went on our first date, no longer exist. 2 fountains now stand in their footprints, surrounded by new towers I had not been familiar with at the time.

As time passed, I eventually moved on with my life, by going to therapy. Time can make things easier and better, and over time I gained new friends, bought a new phone, and even got myself a new TV to replace the old one. I had now gotten stronger and knew nothing could ever faze me.... Until last night that was...

Last night, I got something in the mail. A red envelope. When I opened it, I found a note inside, reading ""Eugene my love, I've found you at long last! I've missed you so much... Oh, how our baby Ralph has grown! I look forward to meeting the both of you very soon... Can't wait! \~kisses and hugs, Vannessa.""

This had to have been a prank letter. No way could Vannessa have survived, I hanged her! Did the noose give way? Could she have faked her own death with some invisible string? How did she find me?! All these questions rattled through my head as I tried to find the answer to all of them. I don't think I can even go to the police, because they'll think I'm some babbling lunatic with hardly any evidence.

Anyone who reads this, let this stand as a testament. If you ever come across someone who may have a crush on you, BEWARE. They could have horrifying secrets that could potentially scar you for life. They could be stalking you, blackmailing you, or worse, and long after you have left their sight, it'll only be a matter of time before they track you down.

Think twice when you come across a person like Vannessa."

9rrc96,0,2018-10-26,Looking for advice (yep...long post),op25705994,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9rrc96/looking_for_advice_yeplong_post/,"Sorry, text ended up being way longer than I initially expected. 

Hello , first time posting here. I needed some advice on how to proceed after I graduate this December. 

Some Background: my undergrad was in a natural science major (Biology) and after completing it, took a 6 month break(tried to get into med school) and attended community college for some coding classes, ended up liking it and decided to pursue a career as a programmer. 
Fast forward two years later and I will be graduating with a M.S. in computer science by the end of this year(took too many classes in a rush to finish up, it worked ). 
Now, I just want to mention that though there was a learning period for most of my courses,it was never truly hard or sophisticated and I had understood what was going on and knew how to teach myself when/if I had gotten stuck somewhere on a topic. ( Have a 3.7+ GPA, doubt it matters outside of academia) 

Most of my courses focused  on data structures, algorithms, touched tip of data analytics and machine learning, basics of  C# and software practices ,C  and Java development. I am doing a small bit of android development atm and have touched a bit of ASP.NET as well for web application development.

And now leading to the question/looking for advice part : I liked working with OOP concepts in Java and c#, Did not like data analytics (even though i thought machine learning concepts were pretty cool)  and def. Did not like front end development(sucked at it;lacked interest) for web applications. android development is okay, it was decent.

Actual question/need advice part: What are my options as far as getting a career started as a programmer ? I know most the jobs are technology dependent, so what is a marketable technology that I can learn even at this point  that may place me in a platform/position that I would like ?   What are some position titles or job description that I can apply for ? For e.g. I am kinda avoiding applying to any web and Android developer positions atm since I don't any of the front end stuff. As far as preparing for interviewing goes, I just practice data structures, algorithms and going through the book 'cracking the coding interview'. I believe it is also important to mention that I don't have any internship experience( sadly never landed one) and all my projects are academic( kinda feel like throwing all of it into my GitHub accoubt after revision just to show my code to prospective employers). Also bonus: I know it's one of the last things I should worry about, but if you could please tell me what salary to expect working in the Texas, Houston area for the technology/positions that you end up suggesti g really not sure what to shoot for), and for any overall advice. Thank you so much for reading this far, and for your opinions and advice."

I'm so polite and try to catch mentor for questions but will wait half an hour for a 5-min answer. And they'll be so harsh in commenting and criticizing my code review (But I think this is good).

I feel so painful when it comes to communication with mentor, and their harsh code review commenting is really slowing me down (because I'll need to have lots of revision). I guess I can't finish my project by the end of intern and can't get return offer.

9rum5j,1183,2018-10-27,First Rule of Fright Club,TobiasWade,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9rum5j/first_rule_of_fright_club/,"The first rule of fright club is that you can’t join if you have a heart condition or high blood pressure. That’s just common sense though, right?

The second rule is that you can’t leave the room until the bell rings. Whatever you see or feel in there—whatever sees or feels you—that’s your reality until the round is over. 

The third rule is that you cannot take anything with you or let anything follow you out. The poster said that breaking any of these rules makes the participant ineligible to win the $10,000 grand prize which comes with a unique internship opportunity. 

The cartoon pumpkin and witch stickers didn’t make it sound very threatening. Besides, the poster had my University logo on it, and everyone knows that school-sponsored events are lame and politically correct by necessity. 

“You can’t not do it,” my friend Jesse told me. “It’s free money.” This coming from the guy whose retirement plan is buying a lottery ticket every month. 

“There has to be a catch,” I told him. “They charged me to print out my resume so I could apply to their own job offers. You aren’t going to get it.”

“Let’s make it more interesting then,” he said. “Bet you $100 bucks that I last longer than you, whatever it is.” 

$10,000 is $10,000, but showing up my friend and taking his money? Now that’s priceless. I agreed to check it out and we both went to the specified room in the psychology building after our classes finished for the day. 

The stickers made it easy to find the right place. Big black cauldrons with frothing brew, zombies and skeletons, ghosts with their billowing sheets and demons with pitchforks. The scrawny teenager in the long black cloak who checked us in was even less intimidating. 

“You know the three rules?” he asked when we said we’d like to join. 

“Yeah. But what’s up with something following you out?” I asked. 

The teenager shrugged. “Donno. I figure they just don’t want to make a mess in the rest of the building.” 

“Has anyone won yet?” Jesse asked. 

“Maybe?” he scratched the back of his head with the intensity of a dog chasing fleas. “Man just let me read from the script, okay?” He coughed and held up a clipboard, beginning again in what he must have thought was a dark and spooky voice. It sounded more like Dracula’s gay lover to me. 

“Once upon a time in a far away land, an aging King had to decide which of his three sons would next sit upon the throne. Believing bravery to be most important, the King devised Fright Club to test which of his sons were worthy.”

“Seriously? What self-respecting King would call his test Fright Club?” Jesse asked.  

The teenager gave us a long suffering look, like a waiter when you ask him to taste your gluten-free food to see if he thought could still taste the gluten. 

“Ever since Fright Club has been passed down through the generations,” the cloaked guy continued. “Dare ye enter to see if you too are brave enough to be King?” 

“Is that what we’re interning for? Being King?” Jesse quipped. 

“Just sign the damn form,” the teenager snapped. “I don’t know anything more than you do.”  

I picked at one of the pumpkin stickers on the wall while Jesse was signing. It peeled cleanly back to reveal a little hole in the wall. It was time for me to sign though, so I pressed the sticker back into place and pretended I didn’t see anything. I thought that I might be able to get an advantage from this insight later. 

The teenager meanwhile produced a large uncarved pumpkin from beneath a table and left it in the middle of the room. He set a timer on the table for ten minutes and said he’d check back after the first round was over. Then he was gone, and it was just me, Jesse, and the pumpkin. 

“I don’t get it,” Jesse said, pacing the perimeter of the room. “What are we supposed to—” 

The lights went, suspending the room in nearly complete darkness. The only light came from the stickers which apparently glowed. 

“Oooh I’m a four year old. I need a nightlight because I’m scared of the dark,” Jesse whined. 

“Shut up. Do you hear something?” I asked. 

“Yeah I think so. It sounds a bit like the easiest $100 I ever made.” 

I didn’t reply. I was intent upon the scraping, scratching sound. Like a knife peeling a potato, or— 

“Something is carving the pumpkin. Listen.” 

I felt my way toward the center of the room and the sound grew stronger. It was a wet, juicy sound, and I could clearly smell the freshly cut pumpkin. 

“My phone isn’t turning on,” Jesse grumbled. “Can you see what’s happening?” 

I fumbled in my pocket. My phone was dead too, although it had been at half battery the last time I checked. I gingerly probed the darkness with my foot until I found the pumpkin. I reached down to feel it with my fingers, but immediately recoiled at the soft, warm touch. 

“It doesn’t feel like a pumpkin…” I said. 

Jesse traced my voice and quickly located it as well. I felt him kneeling beside me.  

“That’s a head, dude. Check it, I’ve got the nose right here.” 

I felt along his arm until I reached his hand. Then back to the invisible ‘pumpkin’. It was undeniable. The shape, the flexible cartilage, even the lips and teeth below it. There was a human head on the floor where the pumpkin had been.    

“This is kid stuff, dude,” Jesse said with the slightest tremor in his throat. “I wonder how much time we’ve got left.” 

“So what’s the sound coming from if it’s not a pumpkin?” I asked. My hand was still tracing the face when I felt the jaw suddenly open. The scraping sound grew louder. Something brushed against my fingers, evidently exiting the mouth. 

I stumbled back a few paces. “Jesse? Did you feel that? Where are you?” 

“Over here man. I’m getting some glow stickers to try and see what’s going on.” 

I spotted him against the wall, his hands vaguely illuminated by the small stack of stickers he’d already peeled off. The scraping sound was coming from the walls now too. Something was coming through the holes behind the stickers. 

“Stop it. Put them back,” I said. 

“Chill, dude. You’re just jealous you didn’t think of it first.”  

“Hurry then. Come on, that’s enough.” 

His pale illuminated hands were carrying about a dozen glowing stickers. I watched him grab two more before carrying the pile toward the middle of the room. Then his hands hesitated, and he changed direction. 

“Hold on a second. I’m just going to check the timer.”

The scraping was getting louder by the second. Like sandpaper along a rough surface, or hundreds of tiny legs skittering—

“Three minutes. No big deal.” 

Something flying brushed my face. Then another one. The whirr of unseen wings beat against the blackness all around me. 

“I want out of here,” I said. 

“Come on we’re almost there. I bet it’s just like stuff on strings swinging around.” His glowing hands were moving toward the center of the room. 

“Are you encouraging me to stay now? Don’t you care about winning anymore?” 

“Whatever, I can win next round instead. I just don’t want to be alone in here.” 

“Aha! I knew it! You are afraid!” The triumph of that realization gave me courage. It was easy to forget that we were still at school with the dark buzzing all around us. 

“Do you remember when we were freshman and that those three guys started following us one night?”  
Jesse was standing directly over where the pumpkin was, but the light didn’t reach far enough down. 

“Yeah, so what?” I asked. 

“You remember how we kept taking random routes to lose them but they kept making all the same turns?” He still wasn’t moving.

“What are you waiting for?” I asked. “Light that sucker up.” 

“Then how we started running and they ran too? But they were just playing a prank on us to scare us.” 

More flying things were brushing against me. They kept landing on my face or the back of my neck. My hands were nonstop windshield wipers now, but it still wasn’t enough to keep them off. 

“What does that have to do with anything?” I asked. “Is this a pep talk or something?” 

“No,” he said. “I just wanted you to remember.” He finally knelt down with the glowing stickers. If that was a fake head on the ground, then it was the realest fake head I’d ever seen. From the congealed blood at the base of the severed neck to the flies and maggots swarming out of its mouth, everything looked exactly how I’d imagine it should. 

“I just want you to know how well I tricked you. I know everything Jesse knew, because I already got him the second the lights turned off.” 

The glowing handful of stickers illuminated Jesse’s head on the ground. But it couldn’t really be him, because I’ve been hearing his voice the whole time. Hadn’t I? 

I studied the hands that were holding the glowing stickers. For the first time I noticed how large and rough they were. How much hair was on the knuckles. The light wasn’t strong enough to see the rest of him, but in that moment I was 100% certain that those were not Jesse’s hands. 

“Run,” Jesse’s voice said from the darkness. 

“I’m not leaving before you do, Jesse,” I said, addressing the head on the ground. “$100, that’s the deal. But I’m not leaving without you either.” 

“That’s good,” said Jesse’s voice. His pitch was growing deeper with each word though. “I’ll see you again in round 2 then.” 

The hands cupped to cover the glowing stickers and disappeared along with the head. There was no sound but the mad buzzing of insects, although this too grew fainter and more distant by the moment. 

I crossed my arms and stood stubbornly still until the bell rang. The lights came on an instant later, just in time for me to see the last few insects crawling into the holes in the wall. They looked like wasps, but were at least three inches long with monstrous spiral stingers. They reminded me of those army knives that were supposed to leave wounds that couldn’t be closed. 

“Round 1 clear!” the teenager said with forced enthusiasm. “Congratulations.” 

I blinked rapidly to readjust to the light. There was a pumpkin in the middle of the floor again. Jesse’s head and the other figure were nowhere to be seen. 

“What about Jesse?” I asked. “Did he leave early?” 

“Who?” 

“Jesse. The other guy who took the test with me.” 

The teenager scratched his head vigorously. Hard enough for there to be blood under his fingernails when he withdrew his hand. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Only one person at a time is allowed to take the tests. You came in here alone.” 

Jesse hasn’t answered my calls since I got out. No one has seen him anywhere. I can only hope there will be more answers in the second round.

I'm going to be rotating solely in IT, which means i will have 4 rotations in IT (cloud computing, data science, cybersecurity, software development, etc) 

Lets say after the program in two years, I realize I don't like IT, and want to get into finance. Should I target IB or PE internships to get my foot in the door? Or would I need to start over, get my MBA, etc.

The job I do is basically the technical side to another job which is more customer facing. It is nearing the end of the internship and a job comes up for this adjacent team. I am very well qualified because I know the entire technical side, internal applications we use, and the team very well. I have additionally helped solve a lot of issues for this team when they've been under some pretty tight deadlines. There are 2-3 openings and me and  another intern are applying, so realistically we could both get it. 

I finished the interviews on Monday and she found out on Tuesday that she is moving on to the last round which is with the CEO, a quick talk and then he gives the ""ok"" type thing. I was told I'd find out by Friday and have heard nothing. I'm feeling pretty insulted because I have continued to do extra work for this team that evidently won't hire me it seems. I know the job better than the people currently and would need virtually no training to move into the position. Putting me on the back burner like this feels like a slap in the face. Could this be that (even though I thought I got along well with everyone) that they don't like me personally? Should I talk to my supervisor about it? Why would they have reservations when they have seen me do extra work for them and do my current job well? They just let someone go that was not good at the technical side of the job and I would have no issues with it, wouldn't it be riskier to hire someone external cause you don't know how they are going to do?"

**How I was diagnosed**

  I always remember being ADHD since i was a little kid. I never really finished class work, I lost things and I was the one with the extremely messy desk. 
My parents thought i would outgrow it. Around 16, I became very depressed to the point where I missed a month of school. I didn't have many friends and I was a terrible student. They took me to a psychiatrist. She said that i definitely have ADHD, referred me to get tested and prescribed me Wellbutrin and Focalin. 

After getting tested, they confirmed that i indeed to have ADHD, the inattentive kind and that I had a gifted IQ. 

The Focalin worked for a month, then wasn't as effective and she put me on Adderall. I started out at the 10 mg IR pills and soon moved up to 20 XR and 10 IR in the evening. 

My parents saw a major improvement in my schoolwork. I was paying attention better in class, I was focused. I went from being a C student to A student. The only thing that changed was my focus, but Adderall woke me up in the morning gave me a sense of confidence. I was prescribed it for all of college. 

**My College Years** 

Around when I was 19, it stopped working. I would hyperfocus, my nights that I was supposed to spend doing homework and sleeping were often spend on google deceptive because I wanted to research shipwrecks or some weird shit that came in my mind. My psychiatrist prescribed me Daytrana patches, and it was the same as Adderall. I didn't like how long they took to kick in. 

I soon had to switch psychiatrists because of insurance issues. I had a lovely NP, she was awesome. 
She was able to treat my depression with Prozac, 30 mg and prescribed me on 30 XR and 10 IR. I was still staying up very late and not sleeping. Adderall XR would make me daze and when I didn't take it, it made me very irritable and angry. But I was too focused on trying to fix being good at school and being organized. I researched so many organization methods, and how to get things done. I grew frustrated, why couldn't I be productive and get shit done? Why do I have no idea how to estimate time and time block? Why do I plan on preparing for interviews but end up spending the whole time doing something else that I enjoy instead? 
I tried apps on apps, never followed through with them. Downloaded many books and never finished them. Nothing was working. I just wanted to be able to finish things and be productive. **I barely have in my life!!**

My hyperfocus and love for finance earned me an internship (I struggled with interviews though, mostly because of the prep) at a small Investment Bank last summer. I was not a good employee lol but I was also great at my job at the same time, that is one thing I love about Investment Banking. Every day felt like a new job, and I loved it. However, I was often late, very late, disorganized, I would get distracted on the computer or too hyper-focused and forget about other things. Lots of projects were unfinished. I received an offer, but wanted to go to a better job. 

Senior year started. I was over school and was too distracted. I took a finance class that I loved and took classes that interested me. I definitely had senioritis. I tried to get a job, but because of lack of preparation and getting distracted, I could not get one. I grew pretty depressed. I stopped going to class and would cram for tests.  It took me almost 6 years of my life (5 years of school because I took a year off) to graduate. Fucking 6 years.. I had a 3.0, had to switch my major multiple times because I had trouble passing some of the required classes. Its not that I didn't understand it, I just 

I told my psychiatrist that I was feeling awful on Adderall XR and she switched me to taking 30 mg IR in the morning and 10mg at night. I finally was able to fall asleep before 2, and I had less of a comedown. I had to stop seeing her because she was through my University. 


**The past year and now** 

I graduated University last december with a 3.0. I had a few interviews, one wanted me to do a case and I never finished it. I tried everyday and it never got done. 

Past 9 months, I have done nothing with my life. I just sit around the house. I started to see a new psychiatrist and my depression has improved and motivation, but other than that I feel like I am back to where I was before. Disorganized, foggy, countless to do lists, never able to finish anything and trouble with following through.
I was also diagnosed with Aspergers.  

Last week I went to my psychiatrist. I told her my depression was a lot better and I finally want to do things and get my life together, but the Adderall is not helping what so ever. I told her that I want to look at other medications, but I don't know what is best for me. 
 She is a resident and told me that she needed to ask around, prescribed me 60 IR mg a day. I take 45 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon. 

Last Friday I spent all day organizing my room and I actually finished MOST of it. I have never done that. I was pretty confident about that, however this whole week I have been getting hyper focused ALL day. Like yesterday I made a to do list for myself and a schedule and I ended up spending all day on the computer at my desk, *rarely taking breaks* researching organization methods. Yesterday I spent all day deciding on a halloween costume. Like... ugh 



**Here is what pisses me off about adderall:**

* Addictive AF : I freak out if I don't have it. The thought of switching meds and not having it and being stuck with new meds that don't work with nothing else. It makes me sleepy and moody if I don't take it, I also get nothing done. In the past I would run out and I would desperately ask my other ADD friends if I could have some of theirs, makes me sound like a druggy.  

* I think it may have effected my cognitive abilities. My memory is poor, I can't hear and see as well. Completing tasks is getting harder and harder 

* My body has aged. I am 24, have wrinkles under my eyes, dehydrated skin (I am a skincare junkie) sometimes I have woken up at 8 wired despite little sleep. XR use to give me acne. 

* It makes me dizzy and disoriented, especially at night. I don't work out anymore because its effected my body so much. I eat more now, but I am just pure skin and bones with some cushioning. 

* Sometimes I need to take caffeine with it, and sometimes it gives me panic attacks where I can't breathe and my heart pulsates, but they go away. 

* Makes my hyperfocus even worse sometimes 

* I am socially bland when I take it at times. 

* I get angered when people interupt me when I am doing stuff, like my BF called me during one of my hyper focus sessions a few days ago and I zoned out when he was telling me about his day. 

* Some days I am lightheaded on it 

* it makes me sweat like a mofo. It is 44 F degrees here and I started to sweat in my house when I blow dryed my hair. I had to turn on the air conditioning and my parents were like ""WTF"" 



**Why I am writing this**
Well anyway, sorry for the long, disorganized story. I am at the point where I am just overwhelmed and frustrated and I don't know what to do. I have googled and researched how, I see a therapist but I don't think she knows much about ADHD and I still really struggle. I want to find an ADHD coach, but they are expensive, I can't afford it because I don't have a job, and my insurance (Medicaid) doesn't cover them. I don't know what tools work for me or what my learning type is because I never knew how to. My dang mother had to help me write my graduate school essay and I am 24!!!!!! 

What prompted me to write this was I was researching ADHD meds for people with ADHD-PI. Adderall has fucked up my body and I heard it ages you so quickly. I can't even work out when I am on it and I don't work out anymore. Thank god I am off the XR. I don't see myself ever going on that stuff again. 

At this point, I am overwhelmed and I need help. I am typing this in hyperfocus, lol writing about my problems with hyperfocus while hyperfocused.  

 My thoughts are too complex at times. Any resoures, guidance, encouragement, criticism... etc would help. 



**TL;DR**

I wrote a summary of my journyI am finally wanting to do something about my ADHD - PI and be proactive, and I am overwhelmed and feel like I will never improve and I will live my life not being an adult, failing at my job, never finishing anything and not being responsible. I also don't want adderall to effect my body. 
After being severly depressed for a year and recovering from it, I feel like I am back to dealing with the issues I had before x 10. I meet with my psychiatrist again in a few weeks and I want to have a plan for medication etc.

I attended a top 10 university in UK, I struggled a lot. In first year, I failed all of my exams but luckily passed the resits later on in the summer. Second and third year went a bit better but I still graduated with a third. For those that don’t know, that’s the lowest possible grade, below that is an outright fail. I didn’t do an internship, I didn’t even want a career in CS up until about a month before end of uni. I had a serious think about what I am going to do and decided to stick to it because I didn’t know anything else. 

I decided to brush up on my programming knowledge and I spent the next couple of months online courses and youtube tutorials, learning as much as I could. I had some interviews that didn’t go to well and I was invited to another that went really really well, I thought I had it. I loved the place and they seemed really happy with me but I didn’t… I was devastated, I honestly didn’t know what else I could have done, I thought that was my one and only chance gone. I was depressed afterwards, I gave it my all and fell short. The manager gave me excellent feedback and told me to not get discouraged and go out there and do exactly what I did here and that he’d love to work with me at some point in the future. I got back to learning and searching for more jobs. In the next 4 months, I learned a lot and had about 40 interviews for all sorts of companies. I kept getting declined and feedback I got over and over again was my lack of enthusiasm. I agreed but it was extremely difficult for me to come across enthusiastic for a job I didn’t really want. I honestly run out of jobs in my area. 

Out of nowhere, I received a call from the manager that had previously turned me down, asked if I was still looking for a job, I was. We had a chat about what I was up to in the last couple months, then was asked if I could come in for an interview the next day. I had less time than I would have liked to but I said yes, of course, that was my one and only chance returning to me. I went in the next morning. This time I was interviewed by the man up top this time, the CEO, as if the situation wasn’t stressful enough. Again, I did really well in the interview and received my offer withing couple days. I couldn’t believe it 6 months ago I was on the verge of failing my degree and now landed my dream job. I get to relocate to a place I absolutely love and work in a fantastic environment. I love it, couldn’t be happier. 

I cried when I got my offer through, there was a point where I thought I wouldn’t ever find a job. I’ve been continuously told by friends and family that I fucked it, I wouldn’t get anywhere with a 3rd, employers are looking for 2:1 or 1st. That I wasted 3 years of my life and £40000 on a worthless degree. I’ve been really discouraged by some people close to me, some saying that I should just try for a career in retail or fast food. I know it would have been much easier if I got a better grade or if I done an internship. What I want to say, I guess, is that it’s not too late, even if you fucked up massively, you can still recover! Better late than ever, if you are in a similar situation, start working on it now!

**TL:DR Almost failed my degree and had no experience, my one and only chance came back round to me and I landed my dream job within couple months of graduating.** "

I’ve gone to one of the top high schools in the country, but I’ve taken to the path of a college that’s not an Ivy League / Stanford / UC Berkeley because it’ll be easier for me to attain higher grades and I have a shot at a full scholarship. Basically, I just would like to go to one of the top business schools in the country. So my plans involve.

1. Obviously, getting good grades, because my application crumbles without it

2. High extracurricular involvement + leadership positions in the future

3. I’ve already helped to found one non-profit organization, and I might found a small start-up of my own.

4. Try to get internships at the best places I can (and I have no idea how to get these internships, but hey)

Is there anything else I should know or work for to make my application as solid as possible? Thanks in advance

I asked both mentors for a LOR because I honestly didn't know how to ask one and not the other considering they were both very supportive and helpful in different ways. When I asked them for letters I specified I was asking for strong letters and they both said they can write a strong letter. 

Is this going to look bad that 2 out of 3 of my letters are from the same place? My other LOR is from my undergrad research advisor who's lab I was in for 2 years and published with. I have the option to ask another professor I took a relevant grad level course with and got an A and have a good rapport with (she also wrote me a LOR for the internship) but she is on sabbatical and I'm not sure I can reach her.

9rzmgx,2,2018-10-27,Internship: Hulu or Tableau,Broad_One,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9rzmgx/internship_hulu_or_tableau/,"Hi everyone,

So I have a week to decide which place to choose for a Software Engineering Internship, please help me out! I go to a top 15 CS school. Post tax comp is almost the same at both places.

I'm really confused as I honestly like both the places. My end goal is either working at G/F/Lyft etc or getting a return offer.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Hulu**

Pros:

1) Better brand name, everyone knows about it

2) I've already been placed on the team I want

Cons:

1) It's not purely a tech company. SWEs might not be as respected. 

2) LA. I'd prefer living in Seattle. 

3) Will have to live in corporate housing (would appreciate is someone can tell me more about them) since housing allowance is 3k which I don't think is sufficient for Santa Monica/LA

&amp;#x200B;

**Tableau**

Pros:

1) I like Seattle and the fact that I'll have to pay less tax. The pay is lower but I'm pocketing the same amount post tax.

2) A LOT of interns get return offers

3) From what I've read on glassdoor, the culture/management seems better and people enjoy working there

Cons:

1) Have no idea about team placement

2) The company is a little less known

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions I have:

\- Are Hulu/Tableau as respected in the industry as Amazon/MSFT? Will I easily be able to get interviews for full time roles in the future? 

\- As an employer, would you be more impressed by seeing Tableau or Hulu on a resume?

\- Why isn't Hulu's engineering team as revered as Netflix's?

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen many Tableau/Hulu mentions on this subreddit. I would really appreciate if former/prospective interns or current/ex employees at Tableau/Hulu could PM me!

I have also done some work in previous internships with security, and while I find it somewhat interesting, it doesn't excite me to the point where I want to pursue it as my career.

During my last semester of undergrad, I took some courses in AI, ML, and Natural Language Processing and I found I'm much more intrigued by these concepts. At the same time, it seems most companies are understandably hesitant to hire undergrads for roles pertaining to these areas, so I'm not sure how I'd break into such a role anyway. It could at least help to join a company that tends to focus its software in some of these areas- the place I'm due to start at doesn't really leverage these much, so I don't think there's much hope of an internal transfer or something like that. 

Is it a bad idea to renege on such short notice, without any other offers in hand, in hopes of landing a job that I might find more suitable? Or should I plan to stick it out a year, in hopes of applying to jobs I'm interested in then? If anyone has experience working in either security or AI/NLP, I'd really appreciate your input as well. Kind of in a rough mindset at the moment."

TL;DR:  New grad offered $75,000 in Minneapolis MN wants more; but how to ask?

I am nearing the end of an exhaustive job search and I have been offered a position at a very large company H.Q.'ed in Minneapolis MN.  The position was for a Software Engineer with 3 years experience that I somehow charmed my way into with just a summer internship and a somewhat impressive senior project.

To my surprise, the company agreed to my min. salary request of $75,000 (plus relocation).  I have had one other job offer out of Portland OR for $65,000 that I wanted to take, but without relocation assistance, I couldn't afford the move; so this feels like already a $10,000 raise.  

If I wore a younger man's clothes, and didn't have to support a family of 4, I probably wouldn't think twice about accepting this offer.  However, after a little research, I have found the twin cities to be more expensive than anticipated.  My family would be much more comfortable with as little as $5,000 more than the initial offer, but am I asking too much?

I can't exactly play the experience card, as I have none to speak of; and the position was asking for 3 years to qualify.  I tried looking up salary estimators for the area, and I get anything from $75,000 being in the top %10 to it being less than average.  

I was thinking of asking if they could do $82,000 and hope to settle on $80,000, but I don't know how to ask without having any real data to backup my request.  Any suggestions or advice?

9s3unm,34,2018-10-28,Experience Over GPA (advice to younger students from a kid with a below average GPA),TractorHead346,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9s3unm/experience_over_gpa_advice_to_younger_students/,"I intend this post to be a general PSA that your GPA does not define you, it's what you actually take out of college that matters. This is my tips for younger students. I put a TLDR at the bottom to cover the main points. 



Background-

I am a senior in mechanical engineering that will be graduating in May, just signed a FT job starting in June with a great company! Really low cost of living, $71,000 a year base salary, and $2000 for relocating to the area. In addition to this offer I had another offer with a similar salary package. 

Anyways, I got this job not because I have a 4.0 (I have a 2.6 GPA), but because I have had 2 internships and a coop. This is the stuff that matters. If you don't have a coop or internship on your resume then get one. Knock on every door until someone calls you back. Sure, maybe you can't get a super cool internship building space laser because they have a GPA cutoff above yours. Well then look somewhere else that GPA doesn't matter as much. 



Internships-

My first experience was a coop at a manufacturing plant. They wanted someone that was mechanically inclined that had the soft skills to work with the operators. Did I want to work in manufacturing? Not overly but hey, it's hard to beat 8 months of experience! So even if you want to work in design, look at manufacturing because at the end of the day companies want to see a track record that you can use your degree to provide them benefit. I used this first coop to get my other 2 internships which were directly related to the industry I wanted to work in. 

But what do you do if nobody will hire you as an intern? Get some other hands on experience! Look at both big and small companies around town, see if you can get a summer job doing maintenance, being an operator, or being a welder. I know people that did those things and then had real world, hands on experience to talk about in interviews. Were they doing design work? Well no, but knowing how something is operated or welded makes it easier for you to design that product. These jobs also usually pay better then say McDonalds, so you can bank more money for college while getting your foot in the door to industry. 



Career Fairs-

This right here my friends is where the magic happens. If you have a crappy GPA it is going to be a lot harder to get an interview through a online posting. This means you need to hit the pavement hard at career fairs. Dress up, have an on point resume, research companies before hand, and don't be afraid to talk to the people at the booths. The main thing companies are looking for at the career fair are soft skills, can you hold a conversation? Eye contact is super important! 

Another important thing is to find a small way to set yourself apart from everyone else in a monkey suit that day. One thing I did was prepare a folder for each company I talked too. In a cheap little paper folder I put my resume, a business card, list of referances, and a list of the top 3 reasons I wanted to work for that company. This last item was the real kicker that the company represenatives loved. Sure, it took extra time, but this is one of the reasons I got the job that I did so it was worth it! This shows the company rep that you did your research and you care, you aren't just applying everywhere willy nilly. 



Interviews-

After the career fair hopefully you got a interview. If not, don't give up, just see where you can add more experience and try again! 

My main tip here is look up sample interview questions and have real world examples that go along with these questions. Glassdoor is great for providing company specific questions. 

The next thing is practice practice practice. If you suck at interviewing, practice more! Practice your responses in the shower, practice a phone interview with your parents, check out career services and practice with them! Doing more interviews is the only way to get better at them. 

At the end of the day, companies want someone with soft skills that is tollerable to work with but also has technical skills. The question that sucks the most if you have a poor GPA is when that ask why. Don't lie, don't tell them a sob story, just be straight. My reason I have the GPA that I do is because my effort goes to the internship I work during the school year and projects for school. Most companies like this response because its true. If you don't have a good reason, then you need to get your stuff together and get your GPA up or get more experience! Because experience trumps GPA for MOST employers. 



TLDR-
1. Get any and all experience you can. 

2. If you cant get an internship, get a job such as working at a machine shop. 

3. Career fairs are your friend. Prepare like hell before you go

4. Work on the softskills

5. Don't give up because you have a poor GPA. Try harder to either get the GPA pumped up or get real world experience on your resume!

9s40ff,6,2018-10-28,Need advice please,cashUbuTter,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/9s40ff/need_advice_please/,"I'm so lost and I just don't know what to do with my life anymore.

I am a 1st yr chemistry PhD student at one of the top 10 graduate schools in the country. I don't know chemistry very well at all.

Let me explain. (You can skip to the Fast forward to 2018 Fall if this is too long)

Since I was a sophomore in HS, I had very bad depression, and it affected my cognitive abilities. For the first 2-3 yrs I even had schizophrenic behavior issues (looking into space for hours, just standing and peeing in public, and I didn't talk with ANYONE, literally, for those yrs). Yes, it was hell. I watched helplessly as I saw myself become a monster. 

I was 16 when it got really bad. Family sent me to one psychiatrist, and I didn't know what was going on to me and didn't know how to communicate myself. So I gave her lies about myself, because I had to say something to her. On the fourth session I told her I was not telling her the truth, she snapped and told me to never come back, told my parents I am crazy and wasted their time and money.

My parents  didn't send me to another doctor. Instead they turned to religion. 

Eventually I applied to an in-state college (not known for academic rigor but it was a 4 yr college) and got in. That point I was deep into religion. I was very detached from reality because I had no friends and bc I had a 2-3 yr period when I talked with nobody. It was easier to be religious and talk to the god in my head than to go out and meet real people and see the world. 

My cognitive ability was declining everyday. In college, a chemistry TA who was really passionate lit up a passion in me to study organic chemistry. I even got a summer internship for the government.

The semester after I no longer had the TA, I began to lose focus. I thought I should try harder and slept less to study more, but of course I ended up getting burnt out and losing the small focus I had left.

I went through the motion, in the last 2 yrs of college. I didn't know any chemistry, honestly I knew very little more than the freshmen, but because of the prestige of my resume from my internships and bc I was in a research group (the synthetic research group, where I went through the motion and didn't learn any concepts. I was a lab rat) everyone thought I was really good at chemistry.

I got B's and A's in chemistry classes, but you all know that good grades don't mean you actually learned anything. I would memorize things and after the test forget everything.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fast forward to 2018 Fall...

This summer I moved to a new state for my PhD. I started to TA. Last month, my PI (theoretical chem) kicked me out bc he realized I need to learn a lot of math, I dropped out of 2 grad lev classes (I was helpless w the math), and I gave up on the TA (couldn't grade or teach well). 

If I don't find a group by December I'm kicked out the school and I lose my insurance. I've worked hard to finally have enough money and insurance to get professional mental help on my own, and now all of it is going to be taken away from me.

You see, I'm not only incompatible (I can't focus and I don't know much chemistry) to be a PhD student here, but I also need medical help to be compatible again.

I can join another grp that I don't care about, but I don't want to do that just to stay in the school.

I thought I can turn in Leave of Absence (LoA) and take the 2019 yr to recover. But I won't have insurance to pay my therapist during my leave. 

Now I'm looking for a job for insurance, really. But I don't know if I can even handle a normal job with my current cognitive condition... I'm smart, but I can't focus and I don't have much skills in anything particular outside of experimental chemistry.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm in Austin, TX, if that helps.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this.

This is a throwaway account. I'm a new grad with 1 year of internship experience at 3 big Ns. I will be returning full-time to one upon graduation. 

So far, I've been told by multiple seniors/principles during previous performance reviews that I will be a lead/senior myself in 2-3 years max. Truth be told, I disagree and I think I'd make for a bad lead/senior at the moment: I lack the patience to mentor people, have really high expectations and often find myself feeling frustrated when I need to answer question that can be found on google in less than 5 seconds. 

I have never acted out on these feelings and always treated this aspect of the job professionally, but I believe I will struggle to keep a healthy tone if I had to do this multiple times per day. 

I'm generally pretty empathetic and it's honestly scary to me that I can't seem to find the same level of empathy when it comes to mentoring someone. For the more experienced developers out there who seem to have an infinite amount of patience, do you have any tips or words of wisdom for me? What's your approach? "

I was very dedicated and strived to learn everything about iOS. I worked 6 months doing internship projects. It took me few months after that to find my first full time job. During first three months I was working hard to show my skills and good dedication at my current position. However now I noticed I have less motivation to do self study in my free time. I don't have that much desire to make tutorials about iOS which I used to make few months ago. Generally I feel unmotivated to improve my knowledge and instead in my free time I just go to the gym and do anything but not coding.   
Have you ever experienced something like that? How do you push yourself to develop your skills? Maybe it's a temporary downgrade..  
Thank you."

9s76g1,1,2018-10-28,Data Engineering or Full Stack?,ghalgy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9s76g1/data_engineering_or_full_stack/,I have the opportunity to choose between two separate teams for my internship this year. One is data engineering and the other is full stack development and I am inexperienced with both of these areas since much of my work before has almost exclusively been data science and machine learning. I would like to try out different roles but I'm unclear which position would be most beneficial for my career and learning. The full stack position would most likely be the classic .NET and C# development role. The data engineering seems a little more interesting to me and uses AWS technologies like Kinesis as well as Apache Kafka and SQL. I think most of it will be either in Scala or Java. One large difference however is the data engineering team has never actually had an intern before whereas the position for the full stack development commonly has interns. I'm not sure how much of a red flag this is though since this is a relatively established tech company so I think they're pretty well organized with good on boarding. I also asked what I would be working on and it does look like they have a specific project in mind for me as an intern so it won't be just a bunch of busy work. I was wondering what this sub's opinions on this are and if data engineering is a good choice relative to a full stack position.

Anyways, I failed the course (comp-sci), then ended up having to take an even harder, next level class the very next semester, which I ended up getting a 75 on.

I had an internship before with the state doing Risk, Quality, and Compliance work (A lot of Excel). I’m currently getting paid $18 an hour ($38,000 in salary approx) in New York.

Cable Management
On-boarding and off-boarding tasks
Setting up and troubleshooting Google Accounts
Setting up and moving new Workstations

I feel like it’s kind of a high pressure environment  (Think of it like a telemarketing company or a company that sells loans) and people quit or are getting fired like clockwork (mostly the salesmen). I always have things to do (not necessarily bad but can be overwhelming as there’s only 2 of us)

**Background Info**

I'm currently a junior at a satellite campus in the Midwest and I'm in the recruiting process for finance internships right now. I was fortunate enough to get some offers from various industries, but I wanted to come on here and ask what position I should take. I know schools look at your application holistically, but I know your job position plays a big part in that decision. Assuming I do well in the internship and I get a job offer, what full-time positions do you think will help me get a better chance into M7?

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Offers**

1. Big 4 -- Accounting role either in Tax or Audit
2. Technology Company (think Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google) -- Finance role (division undecided)
3. Banking Company (think Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, B of A) -- Finance Role

**My Target Future Offers When Recruiting Full-Time**

1. Banking Company -- Asset Management, Wealth Management, or Credit Risk
2. Big 4 -- (M&amp;A Transaction Service, Risk Advisory, Business Valuation)

**Current Undergrad Stats**

\- GPA: Will range between 3.4 - 3.6

\- Small non-target, satellite campus in the Midwest. Accounting and Finance major.

\- Started high school program to teach students about experiences in higher education

\- Active in public speaking

\- Started non-profit in local city to help education in teens

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal for MBA**

\- Don't really know at this point but somewhere along the line of the executive route.

\- Highly interested in investment banking or management consulting.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Questions:**

1. In my Current Offer roles, which position will help me have a higher chance into M7?
2. In my Target Future Offers, which position will help me have a higher chance into M7?
3. With my weak school name and GPA, in the next 3 - 6 years before I plan on getting my MBA, what should I try to work on in order to have a higher chance of getting into M7?

Thanks in advance!"
9s9fjc,5,2018-10-28,How Can I Negotiate a New Grad Offer Quickly?,grudolp2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9s9fjc/how_can_i_negotiate_a_new_grad_offer_quickly/,"Disclaimer:

I'm using the actual company names because I don't have much time and want responses that are as applicable to my situation as possible. I am not necessarily looking for general negotiation advice, but will absolutely appreciate any help.

Background:

I interned at Amazon this past summer, and received a return full-time offer from them. I am graduating this December, so I also applied to Google during my internship, passed the phone interview, and got invited on-site.

Around the same time I got my return offer from Amazon, I got transferred to a new recruiter for my remaining Google candidacy. I already alerted Google to my offer deadline of November 1st during the first week of August. My recruiter then did not reply to me for almost an entire month, so my onsite did not begin being planned until early September.

My onsite was scheduled for the beginning of October. The day after my onsite, I sent a follow up email with a reminder of my other offer and deadline and thanked them for having me. Two weeks later I was approved by the hiring committee, and got a request for ""any competing offers and deadlines"" and that a final decision will be made in ""1-2 weeks."" At the time I received that 1-2 week timeline, I only had 15 days to respond to Amazon's offer.

Current Situation:

I still have not received a final decision or offer from Google, and my Amazon offer expires Wednesday night (3 days from now). From my understanding, there is a low chance of being rejected after approval from the hiring committee, so I am trying to prepare my plan of attack for the moment I get a final decision/potential offer.

How can I negotiate with Google quickly after receiving an offer? I've barely been able to get responses from my recruiter, and with this insanely tight timeline, I am fearing I won't be able to even make a single request in time for my deadline. What components should I aim at first that they are likely to budge on? How can I maximize value with as little back-and-forth as possible?

Should I take this recruiting process into account in my decision? My previous impression of Google as an employer was very positive, but the recruiting process has been very negligent to my timeline and is making me second guess that impression.

Note: Amazon has already stated they are not open to negotiating their offer. This makes negotiation with Google especially important because the ball is completely in their court to put up a better or worse offer at this point.

Thank you for any advice."

I know it requires patience and work, and I'm trying to put my efforts in the right place right now, to make it happen. A bit of background - I first visited Copenhagen as a teenager because my high school girlfriend grew up there and we went together to visit. I really liked the vibe of the place, even at age 17. Later on, I studied abroad at age 21 in Copenhagen from January 2016 to May and stayed for the summer after into the fall. Just recently this month, I  visited Copenhagen again for two weeks and saw all my old friends and, decided that yes, I do want to live there even working daily and paying bills and facing 'adult challenges', removing the rose tinted glasses of studying abroad so to speak and seeing it for what it is to a working adult. While there this past month, I tried to find jobs online and 'drop in' especially environmental and energy related places like Ramboll and Odense while there, the non-profit Energy Crossroads, as well as trying to get a job at the study abroad company I went to - but Danes don't really do the 'drop in'. I got shut out and told to apply online. Understandable. But disappointing. I know if I could just introduce myself and show my qualifications, I'd at least make a good impression, if not be the ideal candidate for some of these jobs.

Anyway, I am currently living at my parents house in Chicago after moving home from Indiana where I went to college. I am eternally grateful for the fact that I have supportive parents and that I can just work and save money right now while I figure my life out (or at least this step at 23 YO), but at the same time I am so anxious and ready to go ASAP. It feels like doors are closing too as time passes. Recently, I found out that you can move to Canada, Australia, and Ireland as a US citizen, however Ireland only after a year of graduating a degree program in the US - I finished over a year and a half ago now. That's a closing door feeling to me, it's not a good one. I got a scholarship to go to a audio production  højskole  [https://musikogteater.dk/english/about-us/](https://musikogteater.dk/english/about-us/) when I was 22, but I didn't have the money at that point and didn't take it seriously enough to commit right then to saving the money in time to attend. At that time I would've been the oldest there by like 2 years, the average age is 17-20 YO. Now it just feels like it's too late for that, I'd be 24 or 25 by the time it starts a new semester, even if I did save the money also noted that I wouldn't be able to work while attending this Højskole. The scholarship I won was only about 10% off of the total tuition btw. Regardless, another feeling of a door closing.

I am working at a restaurant/cafe right now, and would happily do the same in Denmark (or honestly anywhere in Europe - recommendations are welcome - I've heard great things about Stockholm though I've only ever been to Malmö Sweden, I liked, Budapest, Oslo, and Hamburg) but in order to make a move happen it can't just be this sort of restaurant work. To my understanding. I have applied to coffee roasters in CPH, Nordhavn Coffee roasters, I have applied to restaurants, bars, I even stoged at a few, while I was there, got offered a job, then when the paperwork came up and I didn't have a valid CPR number for working - they said sorry, we can't pay you ""in the black"" - ""under the table"" is the American term.

I have a BS in Science of Public Policy my major being Environmental Management - ecology, sustainability, renewable energy, public policy, urban planning etc. I am open to whatever it takes to make the move to CPH, and would like to do it without having to go back to school as I am not 100% sold on working in the Environmental Field my whole life and taking on debt to study something I'm not 100% sold on - and I know that sounds incredibly entitled to say, but some understanding on my POV is that with my family and life circle it was just expected to go straight to college after HS with no time to think about what you wanted to study or even begin to understand about how your studies affect your life after college.  Then by the time I got to college I only had 2 semesters to really 'try' things out before I had to commit or risk not graduating on time, jeopardizing my scholarship which was only valid for 8 semesters. Also, as soon as you get to college they tell you, 'just get your gen eds out of the way'. So you do for around a year and a half, taking classes like 'Public Speaking' or ""Communications in Culture"" - cutting into the limited class schedule you have to 'try out' majors. And even if you did swap stuff around, the drop/add date is only the first of the semester before they start penalizing you (financially of course) for changing classes. And that first week is just two short classes that the professor cuts short because you just sit and read the syllabus and talk about the format of the final for half an hour then all leave. Like they sell this possibility of 'exploring' your interests and career options once college will start, when you're applying for colleges, or when they visit your HS, but that's not the case at all. I would've been so grateful for a year or two of just working in a restaurant and learning to pay rent and function on my own and see the 'real world' before college - and I don't think I'm alone on this experience. Americans are way less likely to have a 'gap year' another reason I want to move to Europe. \*\*\*I want to say this tangent may sound like complaining, but I explain why I included this later on in this post - and I am fortunate I know. I am lucky and grateful trust me.\*\*\* But yes, even if I did go to get a Masters in Environmental Science in DK, if I am qualified enough going from management to 'science' might be frowned upon - I never took chemistry or physics or biology in college, it is not free. (I've checked - it's not free for non-Danes to go to school there). Additionally, you can only work so much while being in school in Denmark  (20hrs) and I don't get the SU there because I'm not Danish, so that's paying rent and living off of only 20hrs a week, which I know in the US a job that makes $11/hr might make around $22/hr in DK ( I know from experience), but even that may not be enough.

My other experiences are that I have about a year of administrative experience, handyman experience, years of kitchen work, working with children with Autism and Down Syndrome, years of customer service and restaurant work, I have years of experience writing essays and professional emails and have always been good at writing articles. I speak a bit of Danish, and a decent amount of Spanish (very basic conversation level). I am a musician who at one point and deep down still would like to make a living in some facet of music creation either as a recording artist, or sound engineer or a video/audio editor.

I wish it was as easy as just picking up, moving to CPH saying I'd take Danish classes, integrate, work hard, pay taxes, and contribute to the society as a whole - but as we all know on this sub, it's not.

Questions -Are there places in the EU where masters programs are free for Americans without dual citizenship? Or places that offer VERY large scholarships to the point of it almost being free? From experience, as someone who likes the lifestyle of CPH and has a soft spot for Scandinavia, where else would be worth considering, maybe that might be a little easier for an American to transition to? My friends have told me Amsterdam and Berlin.

Does anyone have experience with the job shortage list in Denmark, aka **The Positive List**? Or any country? I looked at it, in the hopes that there was something that I could fit into - but I'm not sure I'm following or understanding. For instance, there's an opening for [142010: Management of the main activity in retail trade](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/nomenklaturer/disco-08#) . Does this just mean that if I get a job offer for a job as a head manager of say a shoe store, or an H&amp;M or something, that that is 'retail' and I am the 'manager of the main activity' so if they approve me, I get to live there as long as that is my only source of income, the manager position? That seems like a possible option! Especially given my experience working and even being a manager in stores and restaurants over the years.

Is it insane to try to study music as a masters in Copenhagen as an American exchange student in the hopes that I can make enough money with a job in that to stay after the degree program? Is anyone on this sub an American music student in Europe?

Has anyone been to a højskole in Denmark? Did that pan out into an internship of any sort after? Or is it basically like 'summer camp' for lack of a better term. Not to sound insensitive to any Danes on here, I love the idea of højskole, I just can't think of a better way to put it as an American - we don't have anything like that. Boarding school for adults just for the sake of learning and personal enrichment that doesn't penalize yourself or look bad during future employment opportunities.

Does anyone know anything about the ""Special Individual Qualifications"" scheme on the Ny i Danmark site? The description is, and I quote,

&amp;#x200B;

*"" If you have been offered a job so closely linked to you that only you can carry it out, you can apply for residence and work permit based on these special individual qualifications.*

*This could apply in the case of:*

* *Performers or artists, including singers, musicians and conductors.*
* *Professional athletes or coaches*
* *Specialised chefs ""*

I've thought about trying to get in using that if I can land some sort of audio engineering internship at a studio in CPH or something (I have experience and a portfolio - and would work hard. Even if it's coiling cables and vacuuming, I'll do it happily. I also have music connections in CPH and know a couple people that have studios there). My argument would be that as an of an audio engineer and in house studio musician, on the grounds of it being unique to me as only I am the only person that possesses my specific skillset because all art is subjective ---- a stretch, I know, but I'm asking this sub to see if that's worth a shot. I've tried to contact them to ask and the government administrator got back to me (about a month later) and the email response was essentially  'special individual qualifications are determined based on the person who determines the qualification's judgement of the candidate which I can not convey because you haven't applied and I'm not that person for that specific skillset' And I'm like, I appreciate the response but that clears up nothing. It's just as vague as the website. I asked in person too, but apparently the office of immigration in Østerbro does not deal with that, someone else does, though they said look online to find who. So now I'm just as confused as before.

I know this was sort of a  long, rambling post, but I am so thankful for you reading all of this and any insight on moving abroad as an American is very much appreciated. I added so much detail and personal details (including some frustrations\*\*\*) not to have a pity party for me, but in the hopes that maybe even if you don't want to move to Copenhagen, DK specifically, that maybe we have some things in common that you can relate to me on and offer insight on how you worked around these roadblocks/used these skills and interests to your advantage in your /IWantOut journey. This sub has been extremely motivating and inspiring to me and is probably one of the main reasons I haven't given up on this goal quite yet. I don't think I'll ever give up on it completely, but I definitely have had the thought about just picking up and moving to some other US city and starting new there, but this thread keeps me hoping for the best, 'shooting for the stars' so to speak hahah. Just yesterday I read a post on here by some 22 year old American who got a job in CPH by applying online and is now moving there. Granted I don't have a STEM degree, or a Finance degree of some sort - but I still think there's hope! And if you don't, that's also appreciated! Reality checks are welcomed too ;)

Thank you all for your time, I really appreciate it!

Here's a brief intro:

 I go to school in upstate NY (RIT) and study computer science with a concentration in AI and Computing Security. I am from Queens and are looking for a job in the city since I would like to fulfill my co-op requirements while living at home. I am currently a Full-Stack developer part time and primarily use AngularJS(Javascript), Angular(Typescript), Spring(Java), and Oracle SQL for most of my development there. I have in total about 1 1/2 years of experience. I am also proficient in other languages namely, Python, C, and C#. If anyone has any leads, please DM me and I will send you my resume. Thanks!

P.S If you're wondering, I am posting on here since I know there are many companies out there, mostly smaller ones that don't post on LinkedIn for internships. I am open to working at a startup to a large company. "

I applied for it hoping that i may get the job and build my experience programming in the industry. Eventually i got an interview with standard behavioral questions but nothing technical. I get hired on the spot. 

The week after my interview, i start my first day at the company. At the office, i notice there was only one other person working (again, its a small company). I asked about the team size and my hirer said he had a few others who graduated and left. The same day, im given a project with specific guidelines and to work on it in language that ive never seen before. Additionally, ive got quickly orientated with what theyre service does and what they use. Although i'm still a noob at programming (2nd year at university) i'm very overwhelmed at whats given to me at this job and its veryyyy steep learning curve especially at my level of skill. I want to keep this job as it may help me learn to be a better programmer and open more doors later in my career, but i am also very intimidated coming to work everyday trying to understand their code that they wrote and understanding what I should do (currently going over my head).

Maybe for computer science. But first I have to find out if I'm gonna be good enough and enjoy programming enough before I make that commitment.

So my main question is, is college even necessary to make a good enough living to where I could have financial freedom and support a work when I want to work, travel when I want to travel lifestyle. Bc I really feel as if I won't be truly happy if that's not where my life ends up.

Second question would be is college worth it? Is a computer science degree worth the debt student loans will put me in. What does life after college look like? Unpaid internships? Praying that you catch a break and an internship turns into a stable job? A lot of corporal ass kissing?

Third question. How big of a grind is teaching yourself to code? If I put an hour into a day and learn at a decent rate when can I turn what I learned into money?

I know I threw alot of questions at y'all but that's all my life is right now is a big ass question lmao. I appreciate any and all responses! "

9sds40,1,2018-10-29,Opportunities for a Law/MBA Grad currently in Sales &amp; Staffing?,Arod36,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9sds40/opportunities_for_a_lawmba_grad_currently_in/,"Good morning r/careerguidance,

Obligatory apology for wall of text, some ranting, and for any mistakes per the rules. 

Honestly, I just joined this sub and posted because I am very unhappy with my current career and company. A little about me though...

I graduated from our main state school with a joint JD/MBA. I was heavily involved in undergrad at the same school and graduated summa cum laude and won awards for service and leadership. For most of my life, however, I thought I wanted to practice law. After working at a couple firms for internships, I quickly determined it was not for me and proceeded to join my school’s MBA program. I enjoyed this so much more and performed well academically and as class president. I graduated and was unemployed for about half a year after taking my state Bar.  I had no clue what I wanted to do or where I wanted to do it. I was applying to random jobs in different industries with little success. 

Eventually, over the course of my job search I was put in touch with the manager of a mid to large sized recruiting agency in the city I am currently in. We initially discussed opportunities in the area, but after speaking a couple of times he asked if I wanted to come work for him in sales. I said yes, negotiated an increase in salary, and have been working here for about six months.

Fast forward to today. The work is often a pointless grind. I say that not to indicate that I do not like working hard or putting in long hours, but I find myself consistently having to work just for work’s sake. For instance, my boss at our corporate HQ (2 states away) is a notorious micromanager and measures performance by activity metrics that don’t necessarily lead to success. An example would be the required amount of emails/calls I am to make each day. If I am driving and cold calling companies, I often have to end the trip early just so I can get back to the office to make sure I hit my call/email daily quota despite it likely being more productive to stay outside the office cold calling. 

Additionally, we are heavily pressured to have current employees on contract over direct hires. Never mind that I just placed someone at a major company as a direct hire with a large salary and good markup. The company will make roughly $17,200 in this placement in revenue, but no one cares since my manager prioritizes people on contract where we bill the employer $18 an hour (not disparaging that salary or contract roles at all). My time spent on this placement and landing the client feels wasted as my company does not even include this as progress toward my quota.

My boss here in my branch office though is the opposite. He is a salesman 1st and 99% of the time. He is a manager a distant 4th or 5th. He has done some good things and I am still grateful for the opportunity he gave me, but as far as training and preparing me for success, I feel like I was hung out to dry. My first week of training consisted of only reading from a 200+ page training manual that has not been updated since the early 2000’s. My second week I was left to my own devices and it’s been that way ever since. To give a benchmark, I spoke to a rep from another agency last week and their training is a 3-4 month process with mentoring, shadowing, modules, and more. Further, we never actually discussed basic aspects of the job and even now I have to frequently ask other people or him directly what form to fill out or who to email for basic things when they come up for the first time. 

There is incredibly high turnover in the Staffing/Recruiting Industry for both salespeople and recruiters. Our 2nd most senior recruiter in the company (out of probably 50-60) has been with the company for exactly 1 year, for instance. Recruiters quit or get fired every 2 weeks and I am probably already past the average tenure for new salespeople. One coworker told me a story once of one of the top salespeople in the company getting fired for not specifically following the sales methods their manager wanted them to. This obviously makes me uncomfortable when it comes to job security. 

I would love to leave the agency on my own terms and maybe the industry. A little bit about me, I have experience in government, politics, sales, and business. I’m a good public speaker, like working with people, can interview well, and am really looking for employment that has an opportunity for growth, good training, and not as toxic of an environment as the one I am currently in. I’m open to relocating and have lately been considering business development roles at large law firms, entry level roles with large companies, working for the state or federal government, and have considered lobbying (but not as a licensed attorney).

So, what opportunities should someone with my background pursue? What types of roles or industries could I be best suited for? And what would you do in my position?

I will edit this post with any additional information you all think I should include. 

TL;DR: JD/MBA graduate working in sales in the staffing industry. Poorly trained, micro-managed to hell and back, and looking for advice on career paths and opportunities to pursue. "
9sdxn5,1323,2018-10-29,TIFU getting caught performing on a webcam site by my gf.,malcazoo,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9sdxn5/tifu_getting_caught_performing_on_a_webcam_site/,"I know it’s not the weekend so I’ll keep this very clean, it’s not really vulgar to begin with. I’m a 24 y/o male and my girlfriend, 22  recently just bought a house together. Money is a little tight especially since she is still technically an intern (paid) and my job stopped offering over time which was a huge help for me. We wouldn’t have rushed into such a big responsibility but there was a series of bad decisions we made that kind of led up to this point. We are HUGE animal lovers and subsequently have rescued some animals with abusive pasts to foster. But some of the medical bills were too high and no one wanted to adopt them so we “had” to keep them. I had a dog and my gf also had a dog when we met. The landlord at the time didn’t mind. we couldn’t bare to re-home these puppers after the Abusive past they just came from. Anyway, point is we couldn’t have an apt with 4 dogs and weren’t willing to get rid of them so we had to buy a house kind of quickly and with not much money. I do freelance work on the side and my gf does waitressing to help with the bills. I recently broke my leg and it cost me a few jobs this month so I had to come up with a solution pretty quickly. After some research and some internal, moral battles I decided to try performing on a webcam site (that’s the most vulgar part of this story). I had been doing it for a couple weeks and was making anywhere from $50 to as much as $250 a day! Which was nice and kind of addicting so I was trying to get the time in as much as possible during the hour or so I had at home before my gf got home. Anyway, last night I was in a private session and this guy was like a big spender. So being desperate I was drawing it out as long as I could. I still had some time before my gf normally gets home so I thought I was good. The next thing I know my gf walks in to our room! I don’t even wanna relive this moment haha it was so awful, i should mention she had no knowledge that i was doing this and it’s pretty out of character for me. So she turns around and slams the door and on her way out she grabs as much shit as she can including our GameCube (she knows how to hurt me)  and she won’t pick up her phone. Obviously this is all on camera to this one guy in my private session. So I get myself together as quick as possible and slam my laptop shut and try to chase her to explain but she has already left and taken the cube with her.

***UPDATE***: Idk how to get this update so everyone sees it but here is a shortened, as close to verbatim as I can, recollection of what happened last night. I’d also like to say that it’s pretty funny to me how many people are telling me I fucked up haha isn’t that the whole point of this subreddit? Like i literally say it in the title. Anyway here goes, enjoy.

She came home and said “so, wtf was that!?” I said, i said “i was webcamming, it’s the same site that your friend uses I’m sorry I should have discussed it with you. I didn’t know I was gonna make any money doing it so I thought it was gonna be a one time deal and I ended up making more than I expected” she said “so, what? You just masturbate with a girl over the computer and I’m supposed to not consider it cheating!?” And I said “well there are hardly any girls, if any and I don’t see anybody they just watch me and I watch porn but I realize I was so stupid for not talking to you about it. That was something so obvious and I still didn’t do it” and she said “then how come you were so scared when you saw me?” And I said “well it looks bad even if I was just masturbating alone never mind on camera” she said “well you really should have talked to me about it idk how comfortable I am with you being on there and having like someone we know see you.” I said “well I wear a mask and I made it so no one on the east coast can see me, but I know that doesn’t justify my actions and I’m so sorry for going behind your back. I was just nervous that my leg was gonna put us too far back and we already dipped into the savings for the cellar I just didn’t wanna cause you anymore stress” she said “how long were you doing it for?” I said “like 3 weeks and I saved up like $2000” she snickered against her will and tried to hold back her smirk because she was still mad “holy shit, you made 2000 masturbating!?” I said “well it’s not consistent but there’s one guy who likes me a lot” then she said “well, show me, do a show with me in the room I’ll be off camera and you can show me that there’s nothing to worry about” this was her way of saying that she almost didn’t believe me and wanted me to prove it. So I signed in to do a show. She sat off to the side. For the first 45 mins there was nothing and I was trying to justify to her that it doesn’t always work. Then a person signed in to a private show. I was performing for about 35 mins. I made like 112 bucks. When I finally signed off (the guy ran out of money) I had been doing it for like an hour and a half and made $115 total. She said “well damn, I need to start doing that.” And I said “see it’s way more work than it is pleasure and you don’t even see anybody.”. She said “well do you make more money if you do see them” I said “well idk if that’s an option but couples make wayyyy more money” she said “idk if I’d feel comfortable doing that. Idk if I’m that desperate yet, but if you can keep making this much money feel free to keep going like in addition to weddings you could make bank!” I said “haha It’s exhausting idk that I wanna keep going it was just to hold us over” she said “well at least you have this if you ever wanna buy something or save up you could do it in no time” I was like “ haha maybe we will see” then she was in a good mood but still mad that I didn’t tell her. I was still naked at this time. She said flirtatiously “I am impressed you went that long” I said “well it’s not exactly hard when the longer you last the more money you make” she said “how long could you last with me?” And then we had sex. After that the rest of the night she was playing with Idea of doing it herself and trying to come up with ways for me to make more money doing it she even offered to type the responses back to be more flirtatious. I have no idea where the GameCube is I’m gonna wait to ask... 

TL;DR
 desperate for money starting performing on a webcam site for some cash. Gf doesn’t know. Walks in on me during a sesh. Leaves and takes my GameCube with her."

So quick backstory:

I'm 22 and I'm studying to become a Veterinarian (Male) Nurse and I am currently 2 weeks away from finishing my internship that's going well.

A week ago this cute girl came in with her new rescue puppy for a check up and I just completely melted, she's absolutely beautiful, her voice is that of an angel's and she's super polite! Obviously I stayed professional and did my job but god I had to force myself to stop looking at her.

Her and I talked about the puppy for a bit about how cute the puppy is and how she's like and afterwards we did the usual patient file, with the puppy's name, owner's name, phone number that sort of thing. And I think she enjoyed talking to me just as much as I enjoyed talking to her.

She came in again today with Milka (puppy's name, super cute) and pretty much the same happened, I think we both had a good time talking to eachother, even more so than last time.

Here's the issue though, I'm a wuss and didn't ask her for her number or if we could perhaps add eachother on social media. And now I don't know if I'll ever see her again, which doesn't sit well with me because I had fun and was happy throughout both interactions I had with her.

I wouldn't want to be a stalker but, would searching for her on Facebook and perhaps adding her make me one?

Should I just let it go and move on with my life?

Hope you guys can help me out! :)"

9sfgyn,4,2018-10-29,Guidance for a software engineer looking to relocate after 2 years in banking?,AnybodyThrowCS123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9sfgyn/guidance_for_a_software_engineer_looking_to/,"Hi guys,

Hopefully this is on topic here, but I'm looking for some general guidance on where I should go after two years. Here's some background about me.

* Decent GPA 3.5/3.8 from a state school, majored in electrical engineering, did internships at tech companies/worked on more CS-like roles.
* Took a job with JPMC after graduating, working in Delaware
* I consider myself a generalist - worked a lot with Java, a little bit with javascript, great with Linux, worked a lot on CI processes(mainly Jenkins and some linux scripting) while here, and have used AWS, docker, Kafka, Cassandra, etc. outside of work.
* I did a lot of interview prep over the last few months, so my algorithms questions and knowledge is at a solid level, though I'd need some refreshers if I did an interview blitz.

I've learned a lot while being here, but I've started to hit into some serious growing pains, and I think I want to leave.

* There's a big cultural issue of technical direction being handed down - i.e., we're required to use some centralized tools and libraries by a central development office, and they often have issues.
* ""Fake"" agile/scrum is a huge time waster, with meetings that go for hours.
* Getting tech resources is a nightmare - I've been trying to get my development environment upgraded from 8GB RAM for about a year now with absolutely no luck.
* Access requests can take upwards of a week.
* Being at a banking mega-cap makes all of the tech choices very conservative(Think on-premise cloud, old java versions, internally written JS frameworks, etc.). Our attempts at using newer tech are shut down by the first point - i.e. I can't get a Kafka instance in dev without a 2 month wait for a centralized team to create it.

I interviewed with a few companies over the summer:

* On-site with Google for release engineering - rejected, but it was a nice ego booster to be invited on-site.
* Capital One DE as a software engineer - They made an offer, but I didn't take it.

I wasn't convinced Capital One would have been that much better of a employer, since they're still a bank. I partially regret it - some friends of mine moved there and have enjoyed it a lot, but I think I'm interested in making an industry shift, and hopefully to relocate(Flexible on location, slight preference for CA).

Here's my questions:

1. I think I want to either go to a smaller company(\~10,000-50,000) or to an actual tech as a product company. Do these both tend to allow more freedom in tech choices and give more resources?
2. There seem to be so many possibilities for where to work that I'm not even sure where to begin looking. Are there any sites that can match your interests to jobs or similar?  I've checked LinkedIn a bit, but they matched me with roles here near Philly, and regular searching on SO jobs and indeed just gives too much info to sort through.
3. I think I'm a good all-around engineer, but I don't quite fit for a ""DevOps"" position since I don't have much experience with infrastructure, and I don't quite fit for a traditional software engineering role since I've worked a lot on CI/CD processes and tools(migrating teams to git, automating our deployments, etc.). A lot of the entry-level roles seem like they would be okay with that, but will I have a harder time finding a ""mid-level"" role without very sharply hitting a niche?"

In about a year I should have my degree as teacher and as such I have to currently do internships at different school per semester and this semester I am interning at the first/ second grade. 
Next to this I also already work in the field as a 4th grade teacher, because there is a real big shortage on teachers. 

Anyway, this morning the school where I intern called me and I thought it was my mentor because I had emailed her with some ideas for activities. To my surprise if was the school director. 

He told me that a mother at school had accused me of sexual misconduct with her daughter. The daughter had come home and said I hugged her and gave her kisses during gym class. The girl was taken to the physician and was subjected to a rape kit. Nothing was found. Then I was reported to a government agency for sexual misconduct. 

I was informed by the director about this and I had to report to school. My mentor was able to back up my side of the story that there was no way or moment for me to have been alone with the child and that the story told could not be true. Because she was there the whole time and so were 15 other kids. 
The school doesn't want to pick sides and want me to continue with my internship there. 
Still teachers and others that know about this look at me differently and there is nothing I can do about it. 

Today I was informed of this false accusation. Today my my life just turned upside down and in this school and neighborhood I have been tainted. 
Today a piece of me died. 

I have always been very careful with kids because of being afraid something like this could happen. I try to figure out how even though I already am very careful how to make sure his doesn't happen again. There is nothing worse than trying to give your all for the future of tomorrow and there being rotten apples (kids and or parents) that will try to tear you down. 

Could some of you give me more advice? I already am never alone with 1/2 students and always leave doors open in class. "

I’d also like to point out that I’m not a CS person (I’m a social science nerd), so forgive me for my lack of knowledge.

My partner has had a rough start in life. Therefore, he’s a few years older than the typical college sophomore. This is his first year studying CS and he’s wanting to gain as much experience as possible, so he grabbed onto a technical support gig at the university. With his full time job and this part time job, he’s working about 50 hours a week on top of full-time classes.

This leaves zero time for personal projects. I’m not sure if taking this job is preferable to completing a personal project when it comes to landing an internship in software development. He’s wanting to land a summer 2019 one. With only one semester of CS under his belt, would it be preferable to quit the tech support job and focus on a project to land an internship or will the tech support job help in any way? I know tech support does not help at all with dev jobs, but I’m not sure if it’s any different for internships aimed at students with less experience.

On top of that, with his current level of CS education, is it possible to land an internship or should he shoot for next summer?

I did an AI-specialized undergrad (taking mostly grad courses in my fourth year), so thought I could find something entry-level in data science or AI-engineering but eventually realized that wasn't happening. I started applying to software eng at medium-sized start-ups to big companies...still nothing. I'm now applying to junior positions or more generalized positions at super early stage start-ups that I'm guessing are finding it a bit harder to attract top talent...still nothing. 

I've had a bunch of interviews, exclusively with start-ups, and they seem to go well. I usually have good chemistry with the interviewer, and have had mixed results on technicals but have failed to make the cut even when (it seems like) I performed well. The only consistency I can find here is that they have candidates with more experience who they would rather go with. I didn't intern and I know that has to be doing some damage right now. 

Any advice or encouraging words here? I'm currently balancing time between Hacker Rank, a personal ML project, applications and my part-time job.

I am a fresh college graduate who finished in April of 2018 from a mid-level/low-level Liberal Arts college in America. Up until my Junior year, I believed I would be a fantastic Psychologist, and expected to continue on into Graduate school. Life happens though, and I found myself exploring greener pastures; namely, Computer Science. After taking Computer Science classes, I decided to aim my career that way.   


Due to time constraints, poor decision making, and other factors, I finished college with a Bachelors in Psychology with a Minor in Computer Science. I have since landed an internship doing full stack web development at a sinking local start up, but I am looking to move into the big leagues as soon as possible. So here is my question:   


It would take me one more semester, full time, to complete a Computer Science Major at my previous school and have my degree amended. Alternately, with my current meager credentials and Computer Science Minor, I could try to strike out and not shoulder the costs of finishing the degree.   


Is it worth the trouble to go back and finish the degree for a Major if I'm so close? Many websites say you can make it without the degree, but it will be easier if you have it. I also find myself struggling to complete personal projects due to lack of time/dedication, but deeply enjoy assignments and any task that I'm set on which I'm being compensated for.   


  
TL; DR: I have a Minor in Computer Science after graduating. Should I go back to school to get a Major in Computer Science or try to rough it in the field without it?   


Currently, I've got beginner/Entry-Level Experience as a front-end web developer doing HTML, CSS, Javascript, using Tomcat7, Bootstrap, React, npm, webpack, etc. As you can probably tell by my descriptions, my proficiency with these technologies is probably only slightly above the standard new-grad-with-internship levels, and I would like to stay in the Web Design vein with the intention of getting a remote/WFH job in the future.

-had previous internship experience with the company

-have special product insight due to being one of the few in the company who uses the medical device it produces

I have been really struggling with technical interviews. I have dedicated the last few months to interview prep and I am in desperate need of advice because I have started losing motivation to continue practicing.

 Last year when I was applying to internships I had very little success in getting interviews, but with a lot of persistence and a bit of luck, I was able to get an internship. I claim I was partly lucky because throughout that whole process I did not put **any** emphasis towards technical interview prep.

Now that I have relevant internship experience I have had a lot more success in getting interviews. Which has encouraged me to place more emphasis on technical interview prep. I have gone through most of CTCI and am now completing leetcode questions. Now my problem is that when I encounter a completely new question during an interview I have a hard time: talking to the interviewer while coming up with a solution to a problem. 

Whenever I hear a new or confusing problem my mind starts to race. I begin trying to understand and solving the solution, all while trying to explain my thoughts. Oftentimes I will run into a dead end and have to retrace my steps. My mind and mouth fall completely out of sync, which results in me losing track of the original problem. By the time I understand the problem I have run out of time to come up with a solution or write actual code. This has become a recurring issue in most, if not all, of my interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I am struggling to come up with solutions while articulating my thoughts and it has drained my motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

How have some of you overcome this issue and is there any advice you can offer?"

Programming wasn't really my passion, and a lot of my upper division electives were theory/math based courses since I enjoyed them more. 

After some research I decided that I would want to try out being a systems analyst. I applied to about 20 places, and only 2 have even responded back, telling me that I did not make the cut.

I did 2 summer internships as a software engineer, which I do understand is not too related to a systems analyst position. However, I assumed that having a BS in computer science and two CS-related internships would give me a bit more luck in the job hunt, even if it was an IT career. 

Would it be better for me to just start with a software engineering position, and then transfer to an IT job? The main reason why I wanted an IT job is because a combination of not liking programming and also not being confident in my programming skills. I personally believe I would be more useful to a company by not programming for them...

I'm at the point where I'm starting to get really stressed out for not having a job, especially when everyone around me has one. My parents are patient with me but I feel really bad. I want to apply to more places but a lot of ""entry-level"" job offerings require 3 years of experience... 

Any advice would be helpful."

9sl9l7,3,2018-10-30,Extend Degree to take on more Internships? Transfer to CS from Computer Engineering?,BeffBezos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9sl9l7/extend_degree_to_take_on_more_internships/,"Hey there folks, I'm in a bit of a conundrum right now.

I'm currently a 2-3 year computer engineering student at a lesser known University and I'm having trouble making my mind on a few key decisions. At the rate I'm going, I'm likely going to graduate in around 5 to 5.5 years with all the extra engineering courses that go along with CE. I certainly enjoy software more than hardware and while I don't hate the hardware involved with CE, I just feel like all those courses (along with the core engineering courses) are gonna drag my degree for quite a while. I'm also looking into taking some extra internships (already completed 8 months at a local startup) but this would further extend my graduation. This brings me to my first question, is it worth it to take on extra internship opportunities even if it may extend one's degree to possibly 6 years?

&amp;#x200B;

The second issue I have is that I could technically transfer to CS right now and I would actually be able to graduate faster than if I stayed in engineering. The other factor is that I won't have to take all the hardware courses, while the number of software courses would be about the same. Being able to graduate faster would also mean more room for internships but the trade-off would mean lacking the hardware courses and losing the engineering name (and the ring with all its bragging rights/glory).  So my second question is, for a student who's mainly looking to work in a software job (but doesn't necessarily hate hardware), would a transfer to comp sci make sense? (resulting in graduating earlier or more time for internships, less hardware classes, no engineering name)

I’m in my last year of Bachelor Studies in Business &amp; Management in a top university in my country, but it means almost nothing nowadays. I think I’m interested in a career in data and data driven decision making. Strategy consulting, Business Intelligence, Financial modeling - it all sounds interesting. 
I read a lot and try to figure out what should I study on my own, but I have no idea where to start and I’ve put a lot of pressure on myself because of it and friends who already have jobs lined up in the biggest firms. 

So far I read that it would be good for me to learn: High level math, Statistics, Excel, Python, R. Where do you think should I start to be able to get an internship or a new analyst job as soon as possible after graduation?
I tried to learn programming with cs50 but I feel that I’m not ready for it yet.

I had an internship this summer in a IT company, but my responsibilities where unrelated to what I think I want to do in the future.

I plan to do Master’s in a more quantitative field, but on the current job market it’s better to work full time right away after Bachelor’s. 

Thank you guys for any responses 🙂

I mean some courses seem interesting, surveying and environmental courses seem cool, and I really enjoy writing reports and labs, or doing research. On the flip side, I'm fine with calc and really like chem, but I absolutely HATE statics and strength courses. I recently absolutely failed my statics midterm,something I studied extremely hard for and thought I understood. Could have been a bad day, not sure, but I know I mostly understand the problems. Honestly speaking, I'm more of an arts person, but for various reasons, ended up in engineering. Everyone in my life is saying I should just finish, but this fail just made a big impact on me. I could probably pass the course, and its a prerec to a lot, but my GPA is already low (I think its a 3.2 but haven't taken any of my liberals) but I just don't want to take that massive hit. I've considered possibly taking an extra year to distribute my courses but also want to do an internship with the school past 3rd year (and need a decent GPA for it), but on the flip side, if I drop my statics I would not be able to score an internship over this summer. I just feel anxious over tests, as in if say I drop this and extend my course load, if I mess up another course I'll end up in school forever. In general, I'm just really scared I suppose, and don't know what to do. Sorry for the long post, and reading through!!"

Figured I'd provide my own anecdote for the sub.

**College:**

I was a CE student who hated circuits with a burning passion. Made it to junior year before realizing I was getting As and Bs in CS and Cs and Ds in EE type courses. Changed majors and graduated from a decent but not amazing state school with a 3.5 CS GPA and 3.0 overall. It took me ~6 years to graduate, I had an internship and job before graduation to pay off student bills and never worked on personal projects due to lack of time and care.

**Internship:**

Worked for a defense contractor on a pet project pair programming with an IS major. My coworker didn't know getters and setters, this gave me some reassurance I knew what I was doing. I cobbled together a 2k line JS front end all in one file and a slightly less horrific Java back end. My demo worked and they wanted to keep me long term. I didn't want to work in the defense industry and left. I made ~20k in the 6 months I worked there.

**Job 1:**

I worked at a 3 man company making 60k. I wrote pretty solid Java there and migrated our infrastructure from Rackspace to Google Cloud Compute(their javadocs may have been the worst API I've ever used). My JS coding was significantly less shit but my first experience working in Python on their Django web app was quite bad. My boss didn't seem to care because it was just our website and not the product itself. The product's code was in C++ which I was not very comfortable in at all(particularly because we used C++98 with no boost and thus most SO answers didn't help). 100% of my code reviews were monitored by my boss(the owner of the company) and it caused me a ton of stress. 2 years in I felt I needed to hop ship for my own sanity.

**Job 2:**

I was paid 75k and hired to re-write their website in Angular at a 6 man company. As I got onboard Angular 1 to 2 mess became a thing and they decided to hold off to see between React and Angular 2. I instead wrote an Android app that was okay at best. The OOP side was good and the company was extremely happy with it but I knew I wasn't using Android best practices(I just silenced the context switch on screen rotation, a huge no no) and I knew it was littered with bugs that were bound to pop up in demos and customer use. I cleaned it up as much as I could and decided app programming wasn't for me. I worked there ~2 years total.

**Job 3:**

Paid 90k to maintain and update a Django/React website for a 30 man start up. Still don't know React best practices and frequently have a few comments on PRs suggesting better approaches. I also now teach Intro to Java at a community college. Most days I still feel like a fraud and a moron. I daydream about saving up enough money to be a high school teacher or a cop or anything but a programmer. 

I still don't do side projects, leetcode or any of the like. I was offered an interview with Amazon where I passed the phone screen on some simple data structures question. I was excited for the code at home exercise until I learned it was timed for 90 minutes. I felt unprepared and simply didn't even open it. Last week I got an offer to work at a defense contractor for 105k writing Java in what is almost an unfireable position. I still don't think I want to work in the government but the security would be nice. I recently applied and got accepted to an online masters program at Georgia Tech. I'm hoping taking more classes help ward off the dread for a bit.

**TL;DR:** Yes, you can survive in industry with impostor syndrome and do quite well for yourself. Yes it's still soul sucking 5+ years in. I don't expect this post to be revelatory for anyone and it was much longer than intended but, hey, here's another anecdote for you."

Since 5th grade, it has been my dream to study Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech. I have worked towards that goal for the last 7 years, going to aerospace camps at tech, starting my own rocketry nonprofit, doing robotics and engineering, and taking AP STEM classes throughout high school. I’ve tailored my resume and my life to fit perfectly to the model that GT wants. (It’s not that I just want to go to GT for the heck of it, I actually enjoy engineering and rocketry) I worked an exclusive internship at GT that only a few dozen high school students get to work every year, with nearly every alum of that program being accepted to GT. My grades are good compared to my peers (no idea of class rank b/c school doesn't do that, but summa cum laude), my SAT is 1470 combined(superscored), and my ACT is 32 composite. I have multiple rec letters for GT Staff and researchers along with science teachers at my school. Everything works. Everything lines up. Since 5th grade, I’ve been good at math. I’ve gotten As and Bs in the hardest classes. Until I hit Calculus. I made a 79 in my first semester and only managed to raise it 2 points to an 81 in second semester of junior year even though I completely changed my habits (doing homework, getting help from the teacher, reviewing lessons every night, and watching Khan Academy) I was told this was the only C I could make in math if I wanted to have a chance at getting into Georgia Tech, and even that might be a deal breaker.

When senior year came around, I was debating taking BC Calculus. My school has a weird schedule where they don’t have enough class time to teach BC as one course, so they make people take AB as a two-semester course, and once they complete that, they can take one semester of BC. Most people can’t take BC Calculus because the normal math track allows students to take AB in senior year. However, about a dozen students (including me) are in the accelerated math program which allows you to take AB in Junior Year, and I had the option to take BC in senior year. I have read that Georgia Tech basically requires people to take BC Calculus (if they have that option), so I opted to take it. I’ve tried so hard. I’ve talked to the teachers. I calculated what I needed to make on the remaining tests and exams to make a B, and here I am, on October 30, 2018, certain that on this last test I have failed to get the required grade I need to push my grade to a C for the remainder of the semester. I needed 3 95s and a 95 on the exam, and I’m pretty sure I did not make a 95 on the last test because I talked with my friends about the answers, and they are the ones who usually make the 100s. I don’t know what to do. Tech asks for midterm grades, and if they have decided to admit me, and they see a second C in Calculus, it’s an automatic rejection. Everything I’ve worked for since 5th grade, gone. I don’t know what to do. There are other college options, sure, but most of my favorite alternative aerospace engineering schools are T-10 and would also reject if they see the two Cs.

After talking about the position and my internships it almost seemed like a perfect fit. But he almost rejected me because I don't graduate until December. Only after telling him I only have one online course and can start full time immediately he told me to apply at his website.

Then I waited almost a month for a phone interview and a week for in person, and that was October 1st. It has been a month since and I have heard nothing from them. I E-mail the hiring HR for a update. And her reply was ""sorry I have been out of office, will update you in a few more days.""

Is this normal? Is this an indierect rejection?

9spse6,35,2018-10-30,Airbnb vs. Squarespace,how2negotiate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9spse6/airbnb_vs_squarespace/,"I feel extremely fortunate to have gotten summer internship offers from both of these companies. I've been trying to not make a post comparing offers, and I feel like there is no wrong choice here. However, I also want to optimize my actions now for future opportunities. (I am currently a junior, so next year I will be looking for full time opportunities.)

The compensations are pretty close, so the main factors influencing my decision are mostly in terms of location and company reputation.

Squarespace is in New York City, and Airbnb is in Seattle. I have a preference for trying out New York for a summer and for other personal reasons.

Airbnb arguably beats Squarespace in terms of technical reputation/prestige as far as I am aware. Thus, having Airbnb on my resume would optimize for future opportunities, though by how much I am not sure. 

I am currently leaning towards Squarespace due to purely my personal/location preferences, but I can't completely justify taking it over a company like Airbnb. How do you all feel about it? Am I wayy overthinking this?

Thank you!"

I'm a quite recent graduate and work experience relevant to my field (software development) consists of some internships over previous summers and my current position that I have held for only 5 months now. 

So in total I have \~11 months of work experience in my field.

Is it a good idea therefore to advertise that I worked nearly 2 years in fast food?

On one hand I think it would give the impression of being able to stick out a job for a long period (some of which was alongside full-time education) and show that I am capable of basic customer interaction .

On the other I worry that future employers may judge me as being sort of ""easy to please"" (i.e. that I would be content with terrible conditions/pay as any job has to be better than working in fast food right?).

I am also concerned that adding a role that has little resemblance to (hopefully) any future positions acts as poor filler on my resume.

Any thoughts?"
9sqv07,142,2018-10-30,12 Ways to Develop IT Experience,dinon_yda,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9sqv07/12_ways_to_develop_it_experience/,"**Here are 12 ways to develop experience in IT and get into the field.**

Please keep in mind this post is geared towards those who are seeking entry-level work, looking for a career change into the field, or want to improve their resume with IT related work. This is not geared towards those who are experienced although some of the points covered may be beneficial. 

#1. College Work-Study Programs in IT

College work-study programs are great because they provide relevant work experience that translates well into the job market. This is where I started my career. I was hired into my college's help desk and worked in their IT department all throughout college. This experience provided me exposure to ticketing systems, basic networking, support models, printers, AV equipment, and training end users. I developed foundational IT experience for my career. If your college doesn't have a formal helpdesk opportunity the library usually employs opportunities for computer lab assistants which is another alternative.

#2. Volunteering 

If you take a look at volunteer sites there are many volunteering opportunities that relate to IT assistance. These volunteer opportunities are usually for technical support. Other volunteer opportunities include teaching classes at non-profits. Some specific volunteer opportunities that I have seen are assisting seniors with technology, helping people with job searches online, teaching classes on using technology, and social media management. My county library depends on a heavy volunteer base so that's one place to start looking.

#3. Craigslist Gigs and Jobs

You'll most likely find part-time IT related work here along with contract and temp work. It's a resources that's often overlooked but the opportunities are great. I was able to snag a few gigs through craigslist during my time in college. I recommend looking here because the bar is usually pretty low in terms of competition with other candidates. Experienced candidates are mostly looking at formal job sites like Indeed, Dice, LinkedIn, USA jobs, and Monster.


#4. Working Up the Ladder

Getting technical experience can even begin in places like retail stores. A friend of mine started in one of Apple's stores, moved into a customer service center, got a helpdesk position, and now is doing application support. I know there's a handful of people on this sub who have went up the traditional ladder with helpdesk and then into system administration.


#5. Technology Development Leadership Programs

A highly lucrative but unknown opportunity are TLDP/TDLP programs (technology leadership development). These programs are usually offered by large companies (Fortune 500) and provide participants the opportunity to rotate within the technology business unit. During your rotation you can pick out teams you want to work with for a set amount of time like cyber security, project management, database, networking, and application development. 

#6. Internships

Internships are great while you are in college. It provides work experience and networking opportunities while bolstering your resume. When we think of interns we generally think of them as college students but here's the thing, I took an internship when I was a bit older then traditional college age (18 - 22). Before the internship, I had a full-time job doing desktop support but I really wanted to be in cyber security. I ended up quitting my job, took a pay cut, and accepted a short cyber security internship that helped my career.

#7. Hack-a-Thons and Extracurricular Clubs in College or High School

My high school offered CCNA as coursework and I participated in the after school clubs. Did I get certified? No. But it was a great exposure and learning opportunity. In college, there are often clubs that have to do with tech. In my college my after school club was in our linux lab. We usually had LAN parties in there but in order to set that up all of us had to have an understanding of using linux and networking. 

#8. Relocate to a Different City

Some cities offer less tech opportunities while others have more. Take for example hot tech spots like Silicon Valley or Seattle. These hot spots employ large tech companies. I grew up in a rural are so the tech opportunities for me were scarce until I relocated to a large metropolitan area. As I get further along in my career, I've expanded my job search to the entire country vs just looking at jobs in my state. 

#9. Developing Tech Related Skills in Your Current Position

IT related skills doesn't just include understanding tech but it also includes your ability to be customer-focused, professional and supportive. I've seen secretaries and accounting professionals spin their skills in customer support to land them jobs in helpdesk support. 

#10. Getting a College Degree or Certification

I've seen people be successful with all types of educational backgrounds (associates, bachelors, IT diplomas, etc) but only when it's been combined with relevant work experience. My take on this is that if you invest more in your education the more leverage you'll have if you combine it with relevant work experience. Having educational credentials alone without any relevant work experience doesn't carry much leverage in my opinion.

#11. Personal Projects or School Projects

Working with tech requires all of us to keep up and adapt to change. It's a constant stream of learning and at any given moment new technology could be rolled out in the organization. A few of my friends have shown off their personal projects in interviews and received positive feedback. Projects can include home labs, creating databases, developing a website, and so forth.

#12. Military

If you were to join the military there are opportunities related to technology. A buddy of mine is an officer and he's been able to achieve his Net+, Sec+, and CISSP during his time in. I believe 25B in the army is closely related to IT (check with a recruiter). I don't know too much about the military but it seems to have had a great impact on people's careers.

9sqv6v,6,2018-10-30,Capital One TDP vs Smaller Software Firm?,kuan9611,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9sqv6v/capital_one_tdp_vs_smaller_software_firm/,"After two months of intense summer internship search, I've got a few offers to decide on, including Capital One's TDP program (McLean, VA) and another one with a medium-sized software firm in the same area; both offers are similar and return offers would also be similar (maybe a bit more at latter). On the one hand, I remember being really excited by the good news from C1 and think it'd be a solid name to put on resume; on the other hand, I've since read about a lot about the stacked ranking system at C1 and how you have to ""play the game""  (I can see myself getting screwed by office politics), whereas the smaller firm has a much more collaborative environment. I guess these shouldn't matter that much for internship purposes, but there's a good chance I would stay at the same company after graduation. For anyone that has interned at C1 before or still works there (especially in NoVa), what are your thoughts on performance management and corporate culture in general? I'm still leaning towards C1 for the brand name and future opportunities, but not sure if it'd be a good fit post graduation if I were to return there for full time. Much appreciated!"
9sqw7l,0,2018-10-30,Do I stand good chances of grad school,cs_ugrad_bad_grades,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/9sqw7l/do_i_stand_good_chances_of_grad_school/,"My grades are really bad, I really didn't give a shit about school until my second year. I did enough to get by and literally passed courses by the skin of my teeth. After second year, I really got into research after landing a lucky internship at a Big company where I worked on some research stuff. Fast forward to now, my CGPA is still shit, but in the courses that had relevance to Machine Learning/ AI, I have not dropped below a 90%. If we consider the GPA of just the courses that have to do with ML/AI, my avg is around 90+, if we add other required ugrad courses, my average is bad (really bad). I somehow managed to also get a few publications (around 3) and some very relevant profs in the field to write me recommendation letters (most of which are glowing, because I really put in tons of effort into the research). In addition, I worked on research at some reasonably good labs and made some nice connections. I can't help but feel like if I had a chance to do it again, I'd do significantly better, but I was stupid and immature and I messed up. 

I know most people say that research experience + publications + recommendation letters &gt;&gt; grades, but I wanted to actually ask to what extent this is true and whether I'd just get outright rejected because of this. I really do love doing research now, and I can't regret enough how immature and silly I was for not focusing on my grades. Sorry for the long post, but if you stuck around, thanks, I do appreciate the feedback."

I was actually in their offices on Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles back in March of this year when two lawyers (one young,one old) told me very nicely that “oh......that project was kind of garbage” &amp; that they can do whatever the fuck they want.I sued them in DECEMBER 2017 because they were actively preventing me from becoming SAG eligible.They begged me.......begged me to drop my lawsuit against SAG AFTRA.But at the same time claimed they “would defend themselves”.😳We came to an agreement &amp; I have a signed statement from SAG AFTRA that says “nothing is preventing me from becoming SAG eligible”.I have that letter,in hundreds saved on my Google Drive.

Earlier this year they told low budget productions to stop submitting taft hartley waivers.......so as of now N/U actors cant join SAG.........unless I sell myself to Harvey Weinstein.Fuck them.You heard me.Fuck anyone that would keep me from earning a fucking living wage.

I’m no Christian.I don’t care what I have to do.You show me a better way.........there is no other way.Morals won’t pay your damn rent.

The only other way into SAG for N/U people is to join a sister union,get one Principal role,wait one year,then join SAG.

........whoops,I forgot about the $3,000+ entrance fee🤦🏾‍♀️


Now isn’t that nice?😁


I was talking to my theater instructor today &amp; they have an EMC internship with an EMC theater for AEA/Equity..........but they wont “let” me do it until I take a Shakesphere class only available during the fucking summer (then I have to audition in Dec.....then I have to write a letter.......then I have to 💋 their ass.......)

He didn’t seem to give a fuck about my distress.........but dammit if he wasn’t hootin &amp; hollarin because I emailed him twice yesterday (OMG........the world is ending!He got too many emails from a student IN HIS CLASS!)


What he doesn’t know is that I’m a huge fan of British musicals.........especially one in particular:

Sweeney Todd:The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

I have been since seeing the 2007 film as a teen.

I have the knife he used to slit his customers throats with (replica,but its stainless steel &amp; not silver)


This kind hearted instructor who doesn’t get paid nearly what he deserves.............DOESN’T FUCKING UNDERSTAND nor care what this past 3 years of kissing ass for nothing has done to me.........


I earned that SAG PRINCIPAL TAFT HARTLEY back in 2016.I dont give a FUCK what you think about low budget productions..I was on set for 12 hrs in La Canada Flintridge on a Sunday that year........&amp; they stole that from me.


I’ll be 31 in December.
I’ve never had a boyfriend.
Never had a husband.
Boys hate disabled women (deaf in one ear;tinnitus)


I have nothing to show for anything.
And I’m too scared to do it.
No I dont give a fuck about my disabled parents too stupid to not have kids while on SSI.
About the paranoid schizophrenic father (and ex-communicated Jehovah’s Witness AND religious fanatic) who had me separated from my Health class in the 6th or 7th grade because they were going to (gasp) teach me about sexual health.
My elderly mother (who I care somewhat about) who is blind in one eye.......last year she abandoned her apartment on the East Coast &amp; moved to NC because her youngest son wouldn’t stop beating her &amp; stealing her money.That was after he got a reckless driving charge &amp; lost the car she bought him to the impound lot.He’s been doing that since 2013,by the way.The other son beat her too......&amp; took her money.......&amp; got our family evicted TWICE in 2008.Where is the older of the two brothers.........in prison doing 10 years for armed robbery with a gun &amp; aggravated battery.He’ll get out in 2020.The younger son is still living back East but now asks me for money........&amp; my mother left her home because of him.

There is only one thing I GIVE A FUCK ABOUT.
I give a fuck about the little golden card (SAG card) I SHOULD have in my pocket.

Need advice.",organicgroot,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9ssjxe/i_graduated_with_degrees_in_marketing_and/,"Hi,   


So I graduated with degrees in marketing and international business with a strong GPA, extracurricular involvement and leadership, and 3 marketing internships with a Fortune 500. I ultimately took a job with an IT consulting company thinking the intense problem solving/analytical/CRM skills would benefit me. In the last 2 years, I've received several awards for my work and have been promoted ahead of schedule. But, I desperately want to return to a true marketing role and have been on the job hunt for 5 months now with no luck. I've had 2 interviews: the one position was cancelled and the other came in significantly under my minimum salary requirements (like, no point in even negotiating level of low). I understand I may have to live with a slight pay cut, but it's not like I don't have competitive skills to offer from my time consulting. I've tried multiple things to get noticed:  


* Connected with a woman through a good mutual friend who works in HR for a company I'm interested in. She passed me to someone in their talent department who explained marketing roles were on hold until Q4... Well, it's been a month and I haven't heard back on the role I applied to there.
* Searched LinkedIn for a recruiter or a career coach with intimate knowledge of the area (I'm new to this town) and switching careers. Found someone who looked promising, connected, she immediately offered to meet . Provided multiple scheduling options, she never got back to me.
* Submitted an application to what essentially would be my dream role with one of my dream companies. I spent hours tailoring my resume and cover letter to ensure it was clear I met the requirements. Waited a week, didn't hear anything. Found their area talent lead and sent him an email iterating my interest in the position, applicable skills, and desire to learn more. Never heard back.
* Asked my manager about switching me to an account back at home (I fly every week, which is getting to be tiring). He said he'd work on it. Connected 3 months later, and he wants to put me on another account that has me flying every week. 

This has been such a frustrating experience. I know it's probably the universe guiding me somewhere but I'm hitting a wall at every single turn. It's starting to wear on me mentally. I thought skills acquired through consulting would enhance my marketing background, but it seems that couldn't be further from the truth. How can I make this break back into what I graduated to do? Where am I going wrong?

I have around 15k saved up for school expenses, so that'd leave me with 45k. I have a back-up plan for a job in the summer that'll net me 8k at most, which would reduce the cost down to around 37k. So is it worth getting a masters in CS and being 37k in debt? I tried listing out some of the pros/cons for doing/not doing it:


Not going for the MEng:

Pros: 

- Won't be 40k in debt

- If I get a job, I'll be making money earlier than I would've staying in school

Cons:

- Resume is kinda underwhelming, will probably be hard to get a job. I didn't get internships during my 4 years as an undergrad so all I really have to go off of is independent projects and some related work (not internships but things where I coded for a job). If I took the Masters program I'd have way more project experience that'd help build my resume.

- Can't apply for internships.



Going for the MEng:

Pros:

- Students in the program do alot of project work with professors and other students, so I could get a lot of CS experience that'll help me and my resume out.

- Have another opportunity to apply for internships. 

Cons:

- 40k in debt 

I've mulled it over these past few days but I think I just need some more advice. I'm planning to live with my parents for 1-2 years and have a job in the area in order to save money, so I guess for the time being living expenses after college aren't an issue (if that matters). Thanks guys :)

I told her that I had interviews this week and need some time to think about it. She said that she can tell me after the background check. She proceeded to tell me that I have 48 hours to do this background check. 

They're using a third party background checker and the customer service number is an international number. I tried emailing the third party to know more about what this background check is for, but they said I had to call the recruiter. I called the recruiter yesterday and this morning and emailed her. She hasn't gotten back to me. 

And a couple of hours ago, I got another email saying something from this company along the lines of ""congratulations, this is a reminder to do your background check so your first day goes smoothly"". 

This is also a very well known fin-tech company so I'm just not sure what is going on. I don't want to except the offer just yet however I don't know why she's hiding the fact if I'm taking this offer or not. 

Does anyone have any input on this? I really don't want to take this offer until I finish my interviews this week. "

&amp;#x200B;

  The reasons I would like to pursue a graduate education in Biokinesiology at the University of Southern California stem from my undergraduate experiences at the University of Maryland, College Park. As a freshman, I came to the University of Maryland in Letters &amp; Sciences, but soon found an interest in Kinesiology. My interest for the field of Cognitive Neuroscience began in the Spring of 2016 when I took Motor Development and Motor Control and Learning. In Motor Development, I learned about the different stages of motor skill development and learning as they relate to a lifespan and epigenetic perspective. Motor Control and Learning gave me exposure to mechanisms and theories of motor learning and control, also allowing me to have practical experience working with EMG hardware and data processing. I furthered my exploration of motor control by taking Neural Basis of Human Movement in the Winter of 2016. This class explored in-depth  the underlying neural structures and mechanisms of voluntary and automatic motor movements. I learned how these motor movements are encoded, what structures of the brain the signal is propagated through, and how that movement is encoded and performed by individuals both with and without impairments such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, and limb loss.  This class gave me exposure to assistive technologies for those with limb loss and motor disabilities, which ranged from body-powered prosthetics to advanced BCI and EMG-Driven prosthetics.   

&amp;#x200B;

 I developed a deeper interest for Traumatic Brain Injury and Motor Impairment research when I took Writing for the Health Professional in the Fall of 2016. Through the coursework in this class I explored and synthesized research on Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, TBI and its effect on emotional and social functions, and the effect of TBI rehabilitation method on substance abuse prevalence in TBI patients. This class allowed me to synthesize works of literature into essays, brochures, and conference presentations, giving me exposure to multiple types of communication that may be experienced  during graduate level education.  My experience as a Rehabilitation Medicine Intern and as an intern in the Cognitive Motor Neuroscience laboratory allowed me to experience diverse applications of concepts learned in my coursework, and emboldebed my passion to help others. For example, I saw Parkinson’s, stroke, and TBI patients as a Rehabilitation Medicine Intern, and was able to recognize the characteristics of their motor impairments. Through my work in the Cognitive Motor Neuroscience laboratory, I gained insight into how research is conducted at a graduate level. This experience allowed me to contribute to two research studies: Memory System Engagement as a Potential Neurocognitive Mechanism Underlying the Effectiveness of Self-Regulated Practice by Jaquess et al. (2017) and Cognitive-Motor Processes During Arm Reaching Performance Through a Human Body-Machine Interface by Gentili et al. (2015).    

&amp;#x200B;

During the study performed by Jaquess et al. I assisted in data collection by performing EEG electrode set up and application, data collection, data marking, and recording absolute error of subject performance during trials. I interacted with subjects through application of EEG electrodes and dispensing questionnaires to assess cognitive states of the subjects. My work in the study performed by Gentili et al. occurred after the study had been completed. My role was developing MATLAB algorithms to clean and analyze Virtual Endpoint effector data. I was provided with coordinates of the endpoint effector over a 200 trial period for each subject, and developed code to eliminate extraneous data, calculate displacements between endpoint positions, and classify the direction of the movement through referencing the linear and angular displacement from one point to the next. I then analyzed subject results from two conditions (4 degrees of freedom vs. 8 degrees of freedom), and determined the most used directions by each subject during task completion. These hands-on experiences gave me exposure to graduate level research, interacting with laboratory subjects in an academic setting, performing analysis on data, and ultimately solidified my decision to apply to graduate programs that will allow me to explore my interest in Cognitive Neuroscience.    

&amp;#x200B;

My specific areas of research interest are in the relationships between motor control and learning in subjects with TBI and/or limb loss, and on the cognitive processes associated with learning to use BCI and EMG-driven Prosthetics. I have not yet had the opportunity to have hands on experience with TBI and limb loss subjects in a lab setting, but I have been given knowledge of how these conditions affect motor performance through coursework in Motor Control and Learning, Neural Basis of Human Movement, Motor Development for Individuals with Disabilities, and Prosthetics for Limb Amputation. I have experience interacting with and teaching individuals with a multitude of disabilities, and am passionate about being able to aid these populations with the  research I would like to complete. I also have an interest in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to the modeling of neuromuscular disease progression and rehabilitation. I plan to use the education I gain from graduate school to work in academia and perform research at a University. I want to enable college students to perform academically sound research and educate them on the neuromuscular system and the processes in the brain underlying somatosensory functions and the diseases associated with them. I would like to research assistive technology effectiveness in affected populations, and optimize this technology for usability by those with disease and disability. I would also like to develop cost-saving procedures for assistive technology making it more widely available to those in need. I am currently working on a EMG-driven virtual prosthetic arm utilizing ARDUINO and MATLAB, and hope to develop an actual prosthetic utilizing this technology. My goal with this project is to learn how to build and program a prosthetic, and then teach those in need how to do the same.    

&amp;#x200B;

The Bioknesiology program would allow me to achieve my academic goals through providing with me comprehensive courses on different topics in kinesiology, research, and public health. I have a passion for educating the public on the topics of anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and health. I gained this passion through exposure to health disparities while taking Public Health. The Biokinesiology program would facilitate my success both in research and education through providing a pathway for me to explore my research interests, and a platform to educate the public on kinesiology and neuromuscular function and disease.     '

&amp;#x200B;

The USC faculty members I am interested in working with are Dr. Finley in the Locomotor Control laboratory and Dr. Smith in the Neuromotor Control Laboratory. Dr. Finleys' research in locomotor adaptation and learning, the principles underlying locomotor pathology, and the adaptation of Virtual Reality to neurorehabilitation relate strongly to my research interests and explores other topics of interest to me in cognitive science. An area of motor learning I am especially interested in is developing virtual reality training protocols for optimizing prosthetic learning. Dr. Smith's research in the development of neural control in infancy, how the experience of movement influences these systems, and rehabilitative interventions for developmentally delayed infants interests me from a cognitive development perspective, as well as from a therapeutic perspective.   

&amp;#x200B;

 I believe I am a good candidate for the Biokinesiology program due to my education, internship experiences, and my background in interacting within diverse communities in the classroom, laboratory, and during my employment. Through my undergraduate coursework I have developed a determination to pursue goals, an ability to develop original ideas, and a capacity for working through problems independently and in diverse groups. Courses such as Anatomy and Physiology, Exercise Physiology, Biomechanics, and Sport Psychology have kept me knowledgeable about all aspects of kinesiology while being able to focus on my interest in motor control and development. This focus was kept through other classes such as Neural Basis of Human Movement, Motor Development for Individuals with Disabilities, and Prosthetics for Limb Amputations. I showcased my ability to develop original ideas through my work synthesizing research into multiple comprehensive papers in Professional Writing, and by contributing to the design and carrying out of group projects in Biomechanics and Motor Control and Learning. The apex of my undergraduate education occurred during my Senior Thesis, which I wrote and presented on EMG-Driven Upper Limb Prosthetics. This semester-long project taught me valuable techniques of literature review and synthesis of ideas, as well as sparking a passion in advanced assistive technologies.  Through my employment as a Personal Trainer and a Stretch Therapist, I demonstrated my ability to deal with adversity and to adapt when helping others live healthier lives. I have interacted with and led clients that have movement and exercise-limiting conditions such as Fibromyalgia and Arthritis, and have helped clients work through issues such as negative self-image and low self-efficacy. I came up with methods to allow for these clients to still succeed despite these challenges. I altered exercises for my clients with physical challenges, and gave reassurance to my clients with mental barriers. Accommodating these client’s needs required that I develop original and effective ideas about how to modify exercises and how to respond to client’s negative self-talk. Interacting and adapting to the adversities my clients faced ultimately made me better at facing adversity, and aided in the development of my capacity to generate original and practical ideas.    

&amp;#x200B;

My desire to attend University of Southern California is driven by the diverse academic community that exists at the university and the large breadth of research that is conducted across multiple scientific disciplines. The Division of Biokinesiolgoy and Physical Therapy is attractive to me because of the close relationship between actual therapeutic practice and the concepts and cognitive processes underlying  the therapeutic effects. The academic community present at USC, the diverse fields of research available there, and the  comprehensive department of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy are what drew me to, and ultimately solidified my decision to apply.

9sw03w,43,2018-10-31,Am I completely wrong?,iwon8,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/9sw03w/am_i_completely_wrong/,"Hi, I was a web dev intern at a company a couple months ago and I got tasked with making a website with this basic idea:

You sign up to a website, you create (or join) a challenge. To join or create a challenge you have to invite 5 friends first. If you invite friends and when friends join you get points. 

It's a cool idea and it was meant for challenges to save the environment. 

Here come the part where I disagree with another senior developer that told me what to do. I was in charge of making this on my own and I suggested using node.js with express for an API and a couple custom HTML pages which would grab data from that API. A simple and fast way to develop an app like that.

The senior developer however forced me to create the whole project in WordPress. A CMS I'd used before but never really got the hang of. He told me WordPress is ideal for any situation and especially a website like this.

I went ahead and made it in WordPress with me warning him that I didn't think WordPress is the right tool for the job because of mainly database speed and hacking certain features into plugins, I also said this would make the website have a lot of unnecessary features that won't be used and will massively slow down users speed.

Me going against the senior developer made him mad though. He wouldn't acknowledge my thought and brushed my solution off as if I was too inexperienced and wrong.


So my question is, was I wrong in thinking WordPress wasn't the right tool for the job and would my solution be bad?

Don't mean to bum you out too. Just a little pissed at luck in general and wanted to share.

I started studying for my diploma 10 years ago in India and got super excited about software development, then immigrated to Canada and started my Bachelor of Computer Science Degree, got an internship as a hardware technician for 16 months, got an Associate degree and stopped halfway and got a job as a software technician for 2 years, used that to pay off school debt and consolidate my permanent residency in Canada, quit and started an Associate Software Engineer job but it turned out to be a testing position, worked a year and slowly made my case to be switched to a development role, got it a month ago but my company got acquired and out branch is getting shut down. I failed a Technical interview for another dev position and I see myself having to do another sideways career move. 

I feel like all this time and effort is really wasted and all I wanted was to go to school, get a job as a developer and get better at that craft over time and make cool stuff and contribute to society doing things I like. But now when I'm working on a development project, I don't even feel interested in it like I was when I first got my first ever code to run. Maybe once I learn a bit more about it, I'll start enjoying working at it again but I gotta switch my job and start all over again. 

It's just taking so long to actually get such a role that I'm feeling pretty bummed out today. Felt like sharing it with y'all."

&amp;#x200B;

The mythological hero’s journey has emerged alongside human society since the very beginnings of Language. Anthropologists speculate early cave drawings depicting man hunting mammoths, were the first cinemas, where humans practiced their fear, where humans danced around the fire, beating the courage out of their chests, and being, readily and fully with that uncomfortable, intense emotion- involved in organizing and banding together, to hunt Earth’s largest known mammal of the time. More evolved, and more widely known, time-transcending Three Act (Pity - Fear - Catharsis) works of drama were developed in ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia, either enduring through the tradition of storytelling, through the theatre, or through the written word. The works of Aristotle, of Homer, and of others, often gathered the emotions, behaviors, associated with victory over evil, into the hero, or the protagonist (or immense loss, into the tragic hero). The protagonist is manifest in opposition to the main force of antagonism, and is made more powerful, more heroic, more virtuous even, with the increase in power of the forces of antagonism. The protagonist finds a conscious, oppressive, vindictive opposition when pursuing his or her goal, that challenges a goal of the antagonist, which more often than not, is not virtuous, and is instead selfish; drama had it moving in exactly the opposite direction of the protagonist’s goal; that speaks to the definition of the power play in drama and adds real stakes to the story. The hero’s journey is a structure of narrative that any consumer of any kind of popular literature, cinema, television, or streaming services, is quite familiar with, although that same consumer may not know the structure’s presence in his or her own biology and psychology. We live out, in our individual daily life, even more *dramatically*, in each decision we make, the structure underlying all narratives. Stories, whatever the medium, act as a metaphor to an ongoing confrontation with obstacles, and it is practical to see it that way, because obstacles are somehow innate to humanity. It was surprising for me to be able to draw this comparison, so clearly, while practicing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with my therapist, Dr. Gary Hawke: stories teach us about ourselves, so we can act better the next time we encounter a familiar story; that is what memory is for (biologically speaking)! A fundamental tenet of cognitive behavioral therapy, and to decoding potentially, among other things, contributors to the flourishing of anxiety and depression, is this three part structure, and in CBT, is denoted: (1) Activating Event, (2) Behavior, (3) Consequence. Looking at events in the world, and that includes feelings and thoughts about the world, as things that we encounter, (1) activating events, and as things then that one needs to deal with, can be extremely useful. What is more useful, is noticing that this is a long term, repeated phenomenon - playing games with obstacles, and that our (2) behavior surrounding the activating event brings consequences (3). That noticing is ever so powerful, because if done honestly, with the spirit of curiosity, an individual can, in the conversation about anxiety and depression which flourishes, begin to point out, what are called negative freedom behaviors, and harmful, irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions which one may be unconsciously practicing, to the end of the detriment of their well-being. Then one can stop these negative freedom behaviors, thought patterns, and begin to take control of what one can control. *Noticing* is a solid first step towards becoming formidable, in a world full of adversity. It seems to me, that it is particularly apt to select the lens of Drama, as a meaningful way to look at the matter of instant gratification versus maximization of meaning and fulfillment through present sacrifice, as a drama, that unfolds in the individual, and consequently on the level of the society - as a sum of individuals, between the individual’s wants and the individual’s needs. It is meaningful to decode the chaos that is 'Being in the World of 2018’, and ‘Becoming in the World of 2018’, in a manner that is familiar to us, and has been since we literally can remember (language instantiated any and all form of useful, long-term human memory). It is meaningful to me to look at the life of an individual of today as that of a drama, as a means to recognize, and to transcend non-optimal patterns of existence. The main non-optimal pattern of existence, arising in my analysis, and the same pattern that potentially contributes to a large majority of depression and anxiety plaguing society, is the pattern that viciously repeats the choice of instant gratification over meaning. There are several reasons as to why this may be a repeated pattern that a lot of us are not able to or want to notice and break through, for the simple fear of the unknown that arises after. **In a world full of ‘\[what seems to be, Systems of \] Order’, how can we, citizens of Order, tread into the realm of Chaos?**

The individual born in the world of 2018, or rather, let's say the individual whose adulthood begins in 2018, as you can only really begin to be an individual when you start to strategize on leaving the home and can truly begin your own, independent life, lives out the drama that pits the proclivity for instant gratification against maximization of meaning and fulfillment through present sacrifice. This suggests several things about the nature of who the individual that is playing out this drama really is, in relation to predefined archetypes. The individual of this drama seems to be a Peter Pan or a Pinnochio, as expressed often by the now-prominent, clinical psychologist, Dr. Jordan Peterson in his lectures, and in his talks; the Peter Pan is caught between the choices of staying in Neverland, as a child, forever, or growing up with Wendy in the real world, and respectively, the Pinnochio, is caught between the choices to stay on Pleasure Island, which promises lifelong, available means of instant gratification or to continue on the path to becoming a real boy, and accepting to undergo whatever trials that entails, however uncomfortable it feels now, in the Present, to do so. We need to look at the individual who is not particularly ailed by privation and can participate in social discourse as a function of basic education, and one owed to some sort of career goal or general sense of an aspiration, some form of direction.  Anyone who is living in extreme poverty and does not have access to proper means of education, cannot live beyond the present, because it is not an optimal strategy of being; the individual living in extreme poverty must dedicate their time securing their needs, for now, and maybe a little later, but by and large that is all that individual can manage for his or her family… We are getting better at eliminating extreme poverty, which is something to be grateful for, to recognize the strength of humanity, and its ability to triumph over suffering. However, it seems to me, and others I read from, that for the individual in focus right now, the drama that plays out between pleasure and meaning, is enacted by the child who is Becoming an adult. It seems to owe itself to no particular age, and there has been a seemingly arbitrary, although a timely, with the emergence of the internet, widening of the conventional 'beginning of adulthood', generally defined as the age range 18-25, to somewhere upwards of 30. Now that is incredibly stilling. The beginning of adulthood has been **delayed** with the progress of time? This I believe was not a self-evident situation, as the next stage of human development, to previous thinkers, aside from being a function of us living longer, generally speaking. Surely, certain means would have been created for us to transcend childhood more efficiently than our parents. Surely Not, is more like it. I would like to go back into psychological discourse and look for instances where psychologists or others who can speak to this, with some degree of expertise, and effectiveness, predict adulthood beginning later, predominantly, as a function of phenomena, other than prolonged or improvements in life expectancy. That is a worthwhile exercise, I am sure. It is also worthwhile at this point to ask: Is the adult then, a more slow cooked roast, knowingly, lovingly tended to by the lowered, ever-present embers of a newly emerging ‘young adulthood’, where adding to the flames, includes adding: Masters Degrees, Internships, Youth Graduate Programs, and other abbreviated certifications, until the individual emerges from it all, consciously saying, ""I have now had enough, and am perfectly saturated with knowledge and experience. I am now going to begin to contribute to the world in my own unique way, and continue to learn as I go, but on my own terms""? Or is the Becoming adult stumbling forward through his or her twenties, oppressed by disappointed parents who expect them to leave him or her alone, way earlier in his or her life, when they really are trying to make it, although in what is unclear, and they find themselves constantly tripping up on obstacles that are dubbed, 'necessary to growth', when its actually more often, and more practically, 'necessary for employment', no quotations needed, or more honestly, and necessarily ""a way to get off my parents’ couch""?

I would think a parent would hope that within each individual in his or her twenties, there exists both spirits of the former and the latter young or Becoming adults proposed. Healthy parents would fight for their child to be equipped with everything they could possibly provide, and the healthy child in turn, would communicate his or her understandable uncertainty, and nod along with faith in society and in his or her parents, until it clicked with him or her, and he or she feels he or she are confident in himself or herself, to resist society and his or her parents, just enough, to create the boundary around himself or herself that is his or her own individuality. I would like to think that is the realm, of time and space, in a person’s life, where 'free will' begins to play a role, but that it is not as much free will as it is the ‘new will \[of Truth and non-Suffering\]’, born of an Adult of 2018, of Now, acting authentically and genuinely to promote Truth, and Good (or the opposite of Malevolence), in opposition to the opinion of his or her parents and consequently the soon to be dying society, that birthed him or her. That is incredibly complex. It can be articulated, but only at supreme length, how complex the mechanism, which divines the true ‘free or 'new' will’ of an individual of the Modern Day, as a result of decent parenting, and a healthy exposure to society,  but not so much that it overwhelms the individual, is. Even articulating the complexity of its determinants needed an extra long winded statement. To knowingly, confidently resist parents and society, and succeed, on a large scale is to find impetus to continue, hopefully, as this is an act of great courage. It is truly a balancing act of inter-dimensional and inter-temporal proportions, that no one individual can consciously control, except within the realm of the boundary of opposition that composes their unique personality.

Where does it all begin?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Emergence of a Strategy to Pursue Meaning**

&amp;#x200B;

To walk the line dividing chaos and order, we need to be brave, seekers of truth, and not mundane, undefined, unfocused children caught between pleasure island, and some low resolution, never pursued version of what we could be. And the question “What we could be”, or “What can I do if I maximise my potential?"" is something we ask ourselves all the time, and it is the source of what we call existential anxiety. Motivational talks caused me a fair amount of anxiety when I was pursuing my Screenwriting Masters, in 2016-2017, because they were right: I needed to act, and I was no where near where I should be. However, I realize now, that anxiety was indicating to me: I already had an innate sense of what I should not be doing in pursuit of what I was looking for, which at the time, I did not exactly know how to articulate. The anxiety was saying, “Look! This person you are now, who watches series, YouTube talks, Variety Actor on Actor interviews, ALL THE TIME, in avoidance of facing the unknown, involved with writer’s block, is not the person you need to be, for the very reason that you aren’t willing to stop all that, and to sit quietly with yourself, and again, not do, anything else, that opposes you getting towards your goal, which often for the present moment, included what I used to call 'research’"". 

My citizenship or my nationalism or my patriotism to Order, told me: “Do something!”; it told me, “Doing nothing, for hours on end, is going to take you: Nowhere! That makes sense doesn’t it?"". I listened. A lot. Without question. I am grateful my anxiety did not listen, but that part comes later. It seemed to add up in my head, and I acted in this way, hundreds of days in a row. I rejected to allow myself to enter into an unknown space familiar to writers, and ask questions to myself, for an unknown amount of time, to determine What I wanted to write, Why, and so on. Usually, eventually, my unrecognized, unorganized citizenship to Chaos took over, and in the two or three days leading up to the two or three month deadline, or in the two or three days leading up to my regular 10 day late submission and attached apology email, I managed to put something together that earned me a passing grade. With late submissions, I only received at most a passing mark, disregarding whatever merit I earned; that was fair. It was also a problem, because most of my submissions were late. I thought I could pass the Master’s this way; I just needed to pass everything. If I failed one module, I would have to redo the the final submission - a price I was willing to pay, because I did not think I had to pay it. It happened, twice, during the MA for two sizeable submissions, due two different modules, among other pressing deadlines for a final master’s project, and a final research essay. It was more costly than I had imagined. I had to resubmit a ten page prose feature film treatment, which to my original professor’s point, was incomprehensible, upon initial submission, as well as a timed, film pitch to an external panel of judges. The first pitch ended in a panic attack of epic proportions, because I had not prepared well enough; I practiced the second pitch 20 or so times to get it down to a cool, confident four minutes, out of fear of repeating previous failure and out of a desire to triumph over my anxiety and depression, which arose from my unhelpful patterns of behavior, as outlined above. It was fun I am happy to report, presenting a pitch I had prepared so well. I describe the unaddressed, unhelpful patterns of behavior in this way, because it truly was a vicious cycle, where I was avoiding pain to find deeper pain, and realized, through a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, combined with a need-based, regular delving into my past and precise use of psychoanalytic practices, and through facing the pain, that there was only that course. Greater, uncontrollable pain, was not an option, anymore for me. Ever. It made understandable, not yet realisable, but still, understandable, the states of mind, which a person can access, through inaction, avoidance, and attending to negative trains of thought consistently, which would consider suicide a viable strategy for ridding one of pain. I saw strands of thought suicide people would tug on that would lead to eventual disaster. I did not tug. And so, the path involving consciously taking on manageable, certain, relievable pain, as a price to success and greater rewards, of my choosing, was truly, the only path that remained. Upon further discovery, I found, in practice, and in research that it was one of the most meaningful paths one could pursue. In reflection, further back into my childhood, and my teen years, it aligned with times in my life where I felt my most confident, and most driven.

Reflecting on my masters, out of necessity of my worsening mental health, and noticing my living a non-optimal pattern, over and over again, was a result of blindly subscribing to my identity to the nation of Order: ""All I've known  so far, and all behaviors I pursue now, are the best for dealing with whatever comes  my way."" FALSE. Although it may not be self-evident: thinking I could pass everything and submit late, was me rationalizing, “Actually, I needed all that extra time"". I created an illusory reality for myself, where the film school did not know how to set deadlines, did not know how to teach screenwriting, were mistreating me, and where I was one who would never master screenwriting, or actualize the investment and faith my parents had placed in me by sending me to the program. These were such vivid fictions that formed my reality at the time, and caused me to separate myself from the potential of creating other fictions surrounding success. It was sad and ironic that I could be so creative in aim of nourishing my depression and anxiety for so long, but not my happiness and vitality. I love that sadness and I love that anxiety, as it was the first step towards taking ownership of my feelings, and realizing they were extensions of a hunger, to lift a load, to create my own meaning for myself, through setting goals, and achieving them, one step and a time. And oh, how delicious those first steps were. The relief of pain is often of the more pleasurable of human experiences. Smokers know that very well, as every time they light a cigarette they relieve themselves of nicotine withdrawal. If only they admitted it to themselves honestly instead of believing it makes them focus, or less stressed, or whatever other reasons they use to mask addiction. Slowly, steadily relieving the fogginess of overthinking, the rigidity of anxiety, were some of the most rewarding experiences I recall, of recent memory. And it was for such a low cost: do authentic, legitimate behaviors (ALB’s)- ""eat, sleep, exercise and study in a way that gets you closer to your goal, without losing momentum,”  I would write in my journal; “Notice and stop all the behaviors that make you tired, guilty, anxious, and you’ll start to feel better.” And it happened! It was a revelation.

Anxiety and depression were symptoms of the emergence of real, tangible, moldable meaning for me. What mattered in those instances of pain, was the pain itself. I needed to stop whatever I was doing, and ask, as a true exercise in curiosity, what was the situation that led me to be in such pain and turmoil - that I could not go to the supermarket without trembling from anxiety at having to speak to the shop clerk, let alone need to scramble over hundreds of hurdles, that rationalized my fictionalized reality, to be able to avoid my work, and maintain a “sense of sanity”. It was truly an awful time, living in panic, worry, sadness, tears, anger, isolation, until I started to decide to take matters into my own hands, and accept the fear of failure, as a prerequisite to success. I began to eat fear for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it started to profoundly affect my psychology, and my biology. I became less anxious, less depressed. I found instances of joy, after 90 minute runs, after yoga, or cycling classes, after writing a little. I found instances of joy where tears flowed, and it was me grooving with feelings of victory, with feelings of vitality, in going on the tube, for example, and drawing formless geometric symbols to Become one with classical music, using my hands, not attending to looks of judgement, and resisting inner feelings and wishes to ""stop making a fool of myself"". I was shaping my secondary identity, given to me before birth, that of Chaos, by consciously, consistently being with what scared me, and finding myself there, in authenticity and genuineness. I was becoming Chaos, in relation to my more formed, more organized presence in Order. Each of us has a place there, in Chaos, and it holds real, palpable treasures, of inner growth, if we are willing to enter. It holds in it the willingness to change for the better.

Does this have to be the case for everyone? Does everyone have to experience panic attacks to transcend mundaneness and depression? It does not have to be, but depression and anxiety certainly seem to be prevalent mental states at the moment. With my current knowledge, I can only posit, that a collective disrobing of Christian, Muslim, and other religious, ideals that used to drive a core aspect of child education, and replacing it for the garb of Atheism, has left a gap. Yes science is immensely valuable and necessary. I do not need to stress that. However, it turns out that there are nuggets of value hiding in the bible, of the same degree of importance of the story of Odysseus, Peter Pan, Pinocchio or even Batman. Metaphorical truth. A Map of Meaning, on which to orient oneself, as posited by Dr. Jordan Peterson, to whom I owe a wealth of gratitude. Dr. Peterson, if you are ever reading this, I express my gratitude to you by shouldering every day the most responsibility I can bear, towards bettering my self.

The narratives that invoke the hero’s journey, the archetypal journey of change, available in film, on Netflix, in books, and available in every obstacle we face, resonate, in the physiological feeling of catharsis, with us, because they speak of transcending through meaningful engagement with obstacles. It seems the ‘postmodernism’, described and understandably, challenged by Dr. Peterson, is one where millennials shed culture like a snake sheds its skin, and find only nihilism instead. I feel Dr. Peterson’s palpable disgust for this kind of thinking, which I do see inklings of, in my social circles, and within myself - or rather have seen more so previously than now, and it seems to arise from the simultaneous arrogance and ignorance, the kind of thinking postmodernism implies: “We can figure It out better than our ancestors did, and we can figure It out, without using the nonsense stories they made up, that caused massacres all over the world.” Here’s another view of what that is saying: Very, very few people - as a percentage of the more general religious public, have succeeded in holding the world’s attention hostage - a nod to our media’s lack of mindfulness, a refusal to strategize how to approach, exactly and properly, journalism of Religious and otherwise, Fundamentalism and Extremism, again: in the most effective manner, to ensure it stops. These individuals, who act in the name of religion, commit acts, that are insane, clinically, without any real rationality, through promises made and accepted in fear, and commit truly horrible, but also more important to the argument, fundamentally **irreligious**, criminal acts of pure malevolence. Because of how that plays out, today, the large general majority of people, who aside from mental health issues, or possibly we are discovering, because of, are quite sane, have placed all religions in a box titled, “Makes people bomb other people, and commit other horrible acts”, and have decided to up front assume anyone who mentions God, in a context other than mockery, is at some fundamental level, an idiot. That seems like a sure fire way, to never explore the past, not only other religions, because it implies inherently there is ""no value to the past"". Not only is there no evidence to support that claim, it is a strategy towards acting ineffectively, and maybe even irrational in relation to today’s standards of how to be in the world. By and large, it is irrational to ignore history.  A large part of history is stories decoded by who we would now call religious figures. The degree to which we challenge religious books and their content as valid, is definitely a worthwhile argument to make, however it is one that the atheists should make, because in their skeptic, search for a universe without a god, they will certainly find metaphorical value, in religious texts, compiled over hundreds, thousands of years, as a collection of human values, arising out of culture, as a determinant of progress, not because of it. The atheists who undergo this task, will also quite fastidiously, as per their adherence to skepticism, denote all content which can be described as irrational, dogma, for all to see. There is certainly value in peering in to religious, philosophical texts in the mind of curiosity, of seeing the way people looked at the world, and wondered about what lied beyond what they know about the world, for what it is, an exploration of knowledge and lack of knowledge. Those are the conditions under which religions are created. Whatever meaning, politics, violence was attached, to that exploration was a mutation of something originally scientific in its spirit. Don’t throw out the baby with the bath water. It’s a difficult task, but certainly worth while. Go on a search for meaning, wherever you may find it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rejection of the Proposed Meaning**

&amp;#x200B;

To me Atheism which fosters the spirit nihilism, is a way in which, the protagonist of today’s drama, the individual of 2018, rejects the call to the hero’s journey, an archetypal step along the way to transcendence, an archetypal step towards change. It is a way to say we’re not going to buy this script of sacrifice, whatever that means, because it doesn’t seem logical. “I will not sacrifice my present for my future,” is what the atheist nihilist says, when deciding not to confront their manager about a raise or a promotion, because it’s going to make them uncomfortable, and the refusal to sacrifice supports our current proclivity to prioritize happiness over meaning, ""because of the ways in which I try to get what I want, confronting my manager, involves an uncomfortable conversation, and I’d like to stay happy, so I can keep on surviving my day to day life.” It emerges for me immediately upon analyzing this that what I see as the casual avoidance of responsibility, to maintain present happiness is a rampant, repeated avoidance of changing, in ways crucial to attain true adulthood. You need to be confrontational as an adult, as well as comfortable in confrontation, so that when anger arises, you know how to bring it out, to your manager, authentically and legitimately, so that he or she does not fire you for disrespect, but also so that he or she respects you more for speaking up. Then you can contribute, freely, creatively, to the discourse, and to your business, and become an influential, relied-on, trusted individual. That sounds like the recipe of an adult to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you then imagine confronting yourself, openly, honestly in aim of stating what you want, what you REALLY want, with all your heart, and pointing out and removing from yourself everything you're doing which stands in the way of that? (In so far as what you can control, today, and only today, and maybe tomorrow, and a few tomorrow's after that, because going further in your mind can also be wasteful in expending your focus, and in essence, your well-being, much needed to perform)

&amp;#x200B;

The more I pursue the above kind of inquiry, the more it becomes, innate, unconscious. Now I can say no to a friend, when my previously highly agreeable self could not, because I do what is important and good for me and my future, and I don't do what isn't. But that isn't immediate, it's earned. The process is sweet in its toughness like the feeling of a good workout; it is the most thing that is you, fundamentally, that person that's in between giving up and pushing forward. Nourish that You, and move forward through life mindful you never want to stop transcending yourself, and you'll live a full life."

I made the stupid decision of doing my 2 first two years of college at community college even though I attended a school that was basically made to prepare me for university. Back then, I was retarded that I didn't even realize this so I thought it would be fine doing CC, but now I see that really I just made those previous 4 years of high school a completely moot. Also I wanted to use these 2 years I had at Community College to try to get better at art in order to get into my University's animation major, but of course I didn't do that either. Instead, I wasted so much time doing dumb shit like binge eat, gaining 40+ pounds, and blowing all my savings on junk food. I never interacted with any of peers at CC, so I have no career connections and honestly it isn't going much better at the University I transferred to. So with the portfolio review for animation program coming up in about 3 months and my skills still not at the level where they need to be. Not to mention being overweight, having no connections/friends, and still struggling with eating addiction I've basically realized that I've fucked up my life beyond repair. I could've gone to a great school and not been this way but instead I was too stupid to realize what I a good thing my high school was doing for me. And the sad part was is that I was actually a pretty good student in high school, if I just studied a little harder things could've gone great for me. But now, I graduated from Community College with a 3.1 gpa and no valuable career prospects to get an internship this summer. I either have a year or two left in the university I'm currently attending, and with not that many options left I have honestly debated about driving up to my city's bridge and throwing myself off of it. It just seriously feels there's really no hope left for me, and that I've fucked up beyond repair. What am I going to tell my parents when they see that I'm not getting any jobs or internships, they're going to know that something went wrong. "

* I don't really have a connection with my co-workers (most of them are 45+ yo, I'm only 21..), I don't really look forward to the lunch because of that
* I get a really good salary for what I do and it will increase when I do my internship here

**The second option (experience):** 

* Bigger company (50+ workers)
* The team is much younger, I saw a lot of guys from my age in their office
* Because of the younger team I get a good vibe from it
* More networking options because of the bigger company
* The assigment I will be working on really fits my studies
* My mentor is a true professional (25 years experience) and I will learn much from him

9sxdfq,3,2018-10-31,Can I have a devops career but not get too far away from programming,stonecipheco,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9sxdfq/can_i_have_a_devops_career_but_not_get_too_far/,"Still a little bit away from entering the field full-time, and been reading up on devops as a possible choice, also have an internship in it next summer in what seems to be the really early stages of a devops transformation at a 6-7 y/o startup (still a startup at that point? not sure).

&amp;#x200B;

I have A LOT of prior ""think of things as a system and how to optimize flow through it"" and heavy soft-skills experiences, and I have an eye on engineering management -&gt; CTO track once I have the requisite hard-technical experiences early on.

&amp;#x200B;

As such, devops seems like a good fit for me. The systems-thinking/soft-skills seem to be at the root of devops, and once every devops transformation in the world is at last complete and there aren't any 'devops engineer' titled jobs anymore, I think the holistic-thinking required for it seems like a good fit for a management track.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I like programming and CS, and I'm not sure if a devops track will pull me too far away from this base, and I'm aware of the 'hire devops eng, want sysadmin' trends that can exist.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on:

\-&gt; is devops a way into engineering management longer term? (edit: A lot of the roles seem to ask for SWE/SW-architect type of backgrounds)

\-&gt; can i still code/stay good at it in devops (edit: clarify, code as part of my daily job, and beyond just crafty python scripting for automation)

\-&gt; if devops eng positions go away, what does the skill set pivot to. dev tooling engineer?

9syixq,44,2018-10-31,So discouraged...,GarnetElf,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9syixq/so_discouraged/,"I need some expert advice. So, I have my Associates degree in Computer Information Science. I tried unsuccessfully to get even a helpdesk job for six months before finally breaking down and getting a job at a collections call center. It pays the bills, but I still want to work in my field. I had three IT interviews - one went well and the two owners were very encouraging, but I didn't get the job; the next one was the owner of the company who didn't know anything about tech and who said that they were looking for someone with the right fit for the company; the last interview was a nightmare. It was for an internship and the director was very rude to me, insulted me and made jokes at my expense, and pretty much told me to change my career. They also emphasized that they were looking for an experienced person for the internship, which is what I thought that was for.

I am about a year away from graduating with my Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science and I plan to get my A+ in the spring and maybe the Sec+ around the time I graduate.

My dilemma is the fact that, even though I love being able to work with computers, I have no experience that can be put on a resume other than serving as tech support for friends and family. My school does not offer an internship at all for my degree. My fiance and I just moved to be closer to his career, so we can't afford for me to quit my job in order to get even a small internship around my crazy hours. But without experience, do I even have a shot at an entry level position?

I keep telling myself that prospective employers will look past my lack of professional experience when I get my Bachelor's degree and a few certs, but I'm getting discouraged that it won't be the case. I want to do software support if I can, but I am willing to do anything to get my foot in the door. I eventually want to get my Master's and teach CIS at a community college or at a highschool level. But for right now, I just want to work in software support.

So, I just need some career advice. I worry so much about never being able to use my degree and that this will have all been a waste. I don't want to be stuck at the call center forever. "

**I had a few students ask me to share the differences between the online and traditional FSHN 120 sections for spring 2019.  Let me start by sharing a couple sites that have been published for FSHN 120:** 

* Learn more about FSHN 120: [https://publish.illinois.edu/nutrition-fshn120/consider120/](https://publish.illinois.edu/nutrition-fshn120/consider120/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Although I love teaching both the traditional and online sections, below are my insights as you decide which section is best for you as a student:**

&amp;#x200B;

**TRADITIONAL 16-WEEK (section A - CRN 32987)**

* The traditional section for spring 2019 provides guided learning walking you through the topics in a manner that sets you up for success with mini assessments due each week that providing valuable feedback comfortably getting you ready to master the exams.
* Although attendance is optional (not required), students gain valuable insight into the topic with a dynamic lecture/discussion format while earning extra credit iClicker points for coming to class.  
* The traditional 16-week section encourages students to explore to topic on campus while earning extra credit (ex: alcohol awareness event).  
* If students want to earn an ""AH"" on their transcripts, we have an amazing James Scholar Honors project working with the NCAA athletes with either a hands-on nutrition internship or behind-the-scenes activities.  This option is not available to online students.  
* Interested students enrolled in the traditional section could have an opportunity to be part of the teaching team in future semesters.
* If it fills prior to your time ticket, you will need to be put on a wait list by visiting: [https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist](https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist) 

&amp;#x200B;

**ONLINE 8-WEEK (section B - CRN 57561)**

* The online section for spring 2019 is accelerated covering 16 weeks of material in 8 short weeks.  If you are a seasoned online learner who can prioritize your coursework and get ahead of deadlines, this may be a good fit for you to get 3 credit hours of a science class in 8 weeks.
* If you are studying abroad, the online format may be the only option for you to take FSHN 120 in spring.
* If you really enjoy diving in and discussing ""hot topics"" in nutrition, the online section may be the better option as it is expected that you actively participate in the discussion online throughout the week.  
* Due to the accelerated online nature of the online class, there are fewer opportunities for extra credit compared to the traditional section. 
* As of October 31st 2018, there was only one seat left in the online section.  The online section is on track to fill before November 2nd.  If it fills prior to your time ticket, you will need to be put on a wait list by visiting: [https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist](https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist)

So when I apply for the jobs that say disabled are one of the target populations, do I need to specify my disability on my resume?  Since bots are looking for things?  I have to give them my diagnosis papers from when I was young but is that not enough?

At this point I am willing to put anything anywhere and use both the built resume as well as the other.  I have gotten through to review a couple of times since I tweaked my resume last.  But when I ask them, what do they want, they say ""beef up your resume"" - which is now 3-4 pages long, and I have been in school for all but this year.

The other thing I find is that they don't let you have a ""skills"" section - things that I have picked up in college or high school, various database or scientific skills - and it is hard to find a place to put all of this stuff in their built resume....sigh.

I'm currently a junior here at USC, but I transferred here from a college in Ohio after my freshman year. At that school, I met this guy there, but we did not really start talking to each other once I got to USC and once he got to Vanderbilt. We pretty much kept in touch through Facebook Messenger, video and audio chats of FB, WeChat, or text messaging. At first, we just talked about general things and about school, but I then helped him study for a test in history class. Since that moment on, he started asking me for help on his humanities classes or anything involving writing. I actually expected him to do some of the work, but I did most if not all of the work. During the first semester, I only helped him with one class, this history class when I wrote a final reflection for him which was 10% of the grade. Not only that he also fabricated a story when he was asked to interview a person and write about that.

During the second semester of the last school year, I really started to do pretty much all the work for him. He took a class on jazz, and I wrote all the papers for him that made up 30% of his total grade. Also, I pretty much did his homework, which made up 30% of the grade, for him in his marketing class and helped him cheat on his tests by messaging him answers to questions he didn't know.

I also did his homework for him in Oceanography. Lastly, I helped him falsify emails to appear that he completed some assignments when he did not. He had me create a new email to impersonate his professor and changed the date on his computer to appear that those emails were sent on days he missed the assignment.

Recently, this guy has become a total dick towards me recently. Yesterday, he specifically mentioned that he did not want to talk to me anymore because he did not need me anymore for anything. He then went on to make fun of me for being ""different"" and basically called me a retarded, creepy weirdo. I am deeply hurt by his actions and feel like he has thrown me under the bus.

I pretty much had a lot of second thoughts regarding his actions for months now, but I did not want to think of them. I really don't understand as to why I so much work for him in retrospect. His dishonestly and deceit doesn't go from relying on me to do the work for him. This summer when applying for jobs and internships, he fabricated his work experience by claiming he did tasks during his internship when he quit the internship after 2 weeks. Also, he made up extracurricular and leadership positions.

Not only that, he boasted openly about ""gaming"" the system and tricking admissions officers at the various colleges he applied to transfer (Vanderbilt, WashU, Rice, &amp; Notre Dame) by claiming he participated in extracurricular and holding leadership positions when he was sleeping for 12 hrs a day or watching Chinese drama. He also falsely self reported his AP test scores by claiming he received 4's and 5's, when he received one 5, a few 4's, and the rest 2's and 3's.

Lastly, he lied to me about his background by claiming that he graduated from a boarding school in the Northeast when he actually attended a public HS. He has pretty much told me many lies about his life to appear better than he is.

This kid has really high aspirations and wants to go to IB or consulting. I really regret enabling him by doing his work for him so that he could receive a 3.8 GPA, while I received like 3.3's or 3.4's. He pretty much has really done nothing for me over the past year and never helped me whenever I asked for anything. I essentially have been doing coursework for myself and him.

The most important question is should I report him to his professors or the dean at Vanderbilt? I don't think it's fair for him, myself, or his fellow colleagues at Vandy that he's able to get away with so many dishonest actions. Even if I have the risk of hurting my own reputation or my academic record, should I still report him? Should I do what's right and moral and possibly hurt myself or just move on with the actions.

I have saved all my messages of FB &amp; WeChat, the emails, and the documents I saved along with all the edit history. So, the evidence is stacked against him.

Location is Massachusetts. We are both college students.

So this is a long story, but the gist is that I broke up with my ex about a month and a half ago as a result of the relationship becoming abusive (have a history of seizures, he would purposefully flicker the lights to get me attention, not caring about the possible consequences, etc).

He was Section 12'd almost 2 weeks ago and spent a somewhere between 5-7 days in a psych ward, during this time his mother repeatedly emailed me to get me to call him, call his doctors, whatever. I told her I wasn't comfortable doing that and did not respond after that. So about a week later, he gets out, and due to the way he has treated me, I am not comfortable being around him. I tell him this in person, he ignores it.

After three or four days of having anxiety attacks at meals due to him consistently ignoring my requests for him to leave me alone and sitting at my table, I send him this message to cover my bases and make a paper trail, then promptly blocked him on all forms of contact.

**""You need to stop coming near me. I am not comfortable around you right now. I thought I might have made that clear with the afraid for my safety bit but maybe not.""**

Within 24 hours, he messages one of my close friends who he is acquaintances with, claiming I told him he wasn't allowed to be around his friends, armchair diagnosing me, decides my therapist (who I have seen on a regular basis and has said I am one of the most well-adjusted people he's ever seen) is not enough, I need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, decides on a course of treatment for me, and he will do whatever he can to get me there. Entirely because I cannot be around him due to him putting my physical health and safety at risk. I have a screenshot of this message for a paper trail (document, document, document!).

We think he is not in his right mind and might call the local police, not campus police, and tell them I am trying to kill myself, as that is the quickest way to get someone in a 72 hour hold in his eyes, and he knows I won't go willingly (for good reason).

I am seeking a no-contact order with the school, considering a restraining order, but as I know they take around 2 weeks, and I'm worried that in the mean time he'll do something, I'm not sure how to legally protect myself. In the case that he calls it in, what is my best course of action? Should I keep a copy of the message on me at all times? I'm at a loss of what to do here.

&amp;#x200B;

A Couple Notes ::

The Campus Police are not viewing this as a threat, due to being sent to a hospital usually being considered a good thing. I view it as a threat because not only will I likely lose my internship, I may end up failing my classes (was out with pneumonia for 2 weeks earlier this semester, still catching up), I might lose my job, and it will put me in a terrible financial situation.

I do have a history of mental illness, and I was taken off my medications (Bipolar 1) about two months ago by my doctor, but I have been 100% stable since coming off my meds. This is one of the reasons I regularly see a therapist. In both their eyes, I am considered recovered. If he found this out, I have no reason to believe he wouldn't use it against me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."

Recently, I got my first internship as a Web Developer in the Boston area. I really like it, and in my first week I even contributed some code to be used in A/B testing for our company site. So far, I feel like it's going pretty well and I'm learning a ton.

The thing is, my financial situation isn't the greatest and I can't afford to be not working anymore. The internship is scheduled to end in December. I have an associate in Computer Science and am taking online courses to finish a Bachelors and am currently a junior. I put a lot of work into both programs and my GPA for each is 3.5+.  

My current internship was only scheduled for 15-20 hours on the job posting, but I told my boss I was looking for as much experience as I could get so I've been putting in 40 hours, one of the benefits of taking classes online - having open availability. Shortly after I started I got an email from HR asking for my expected grad date (2020). This kinda makes me believe they're not interested in hiring interns full-time until after they've graduated.  I guess where the uncertainty is, is not knowing if I should treat it like my internship won't be extended / offered a full-time position and continue to apply elsewhere for after December while still learning as much as possible while I'm here?

I had a decent junior internship with a capital advisor. I didn't have a great resume or school, but I was pretty scrappy and did all the networking, cold emailing, visits, etc that you are supposed to do. During the summer, an MD at one of the big investment banks in town estimated that I had a 30% chance of getting hired at a BB or elite bank, 20% chance of getting hired at one of the minor regional ones, and that was during a bad hiring season for the banks. Then I decided to go to graduate school for computer science - I noticed that I was more quantitative and scientific than most bankers, and I wanted to make use of that. However, I've completely failed grad school because I find it impossible to focus on academia and abstract learning; I had overestimated my ability to push through the subject. But I'm still quite confident in my ability to work well in an actual job, which isn't all code and numbers. I was never dissatisfied with the idea of non-quantitative finance in the first place, I just wanted to push the envelope of my learning, and it didn't work; I make more complex and precise Excel models but I'm no quant.

If I try to go into finance now, what are my options? With IB for instance, can I just recruit for being an analyst (or analyst intern) at the same level as regular undergrads? On one hand, my history looks bad. On the other hand, I'm certainly not dumber than I was a couple years ago. Also, what about asset management or equity research?"
9t2bw7,1,2018-10-31,21F- Can you help me figure out my path into data science and fashion?,sydney122x,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9t2bw7/21f_can_you_help_me_figure_out_my_path_into_data/,"Hey y'all!

Some background on myself:

I am a college student currently in my junior year. I am graduating in 2021 as I took a gap semester before transferring to my current university. I have a 4.95 GPA in my university's honors college, and am working on a sociology major with Russian and data science minors. I have had one internship, and it was in a community organization setting back when I had only declared a major. I have a passion for beauty/fashion-- I run an Instagram blog on curly hair. I am a very analytical person-- I love statistics, data, and am highly interested in learning code. I am really interested in the idea of applying data analysis to the fashion industry. I love to analyze people, their behavior, and their clothes.. haha. I am currently trying to join all of my interests together to develop a career path. It's obviously a little hazy, but I am making progress day by day.

So, here's to the point:

I am now trying to create a plan of action for now and post-grad. I know I need to do more internships, but I am insecure in what I have so far. I have yet to take a coding class (I'm planned to take my first computer science class in fall 2019) and have been learning a very tiny bit on the side. I am considering getting a job at Urban Outfitters in order to be able to list something fashion-related on my resume. I want to find a mentor who works in the fashion industry, but I have no idea how to get one. I have sooo many questions, and I know this post is all over the place, so I am sorry in advance. I just am a bit unclear, and am looking for some guidance or resources. So, I guess my questions summarized are: 

What do I need to be thinking about for my next steps in terms of learning data science/exploring that interest? How do I integrate fashion/beauty into this interest?

How do I learn to code efficiently?

I'm almost positive I need to go to grad school... Do I need to go to grad school?

If you can answer even one of the questions above, you'd be a lifesaver. Thank you for even taking the time to read. "
9t2f4r,2,2018-10-31,"Is it possible for someone with moderate-to-severe ADHD to have a high-level, successful career without medication?",inittowinit777,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9t2f4r/is_it_possible_for_someone_with_moderatetosevere/,"I type this as I'm sitting at my internship, where I got to more than an hour late today. I also don't have my phone in my pocket since I forgot it in my rush to leave.  


I've lost count of how many times I've been late by an hour or longer since I started at this place just 2 months ago. Luckily, I have been able to get away with it most days since the interns kind of have a separate workspace, so I can just sneak in through the backdoor and hope and pray no one noticed my absence for the past couple hours.  


Today my supervisor emailed me asking about my lateness. She has caught me being super fucking late on multiple occasions now, but has been very, very nice and non-confrontational about it.  I suspect part of it has to do with my great resume and recommendations, and the fact that I’m generally a pretty smart guy. But obviously even the nicest of bosses will eventually reach a breaking point.  


Right now I’m on 150 mg Wellbutrin XR. I’ve been taking it for maybe over 3 months now, and honestly it hasn’t done much for me, if anything at all. Like, I can actually sit there and power through reading an entire article without getting distracted and opening a million other tabs, but that’s about it. It hasn’t helped me with organization, or procrastination, or task initiation/avoidance. It hasn’t been particularly useful period. And in exchange I have a pretty badly suppressed appetite and horrible dry mouth.  


I refuse to take Adderall because of a previous history of substance abuse and addictive behaviors. I’m an addict, plain and simple, and Adderall is as druggy as prescription meds get. Also, I am very, very sensitive to stimulant-induced anxiety. Even half a cup of coffee will give me terrible anxiety and jitters, and I will be unable to sleep that night. Just very uncomfortable.  


So, all this being said, I just wanted to know if there’s any hope for someone like me. I really want to do great things in life - get a Master’s degree in a rigorous discipline and then go on to have a successful career in a high-pressure environment. I truly believe I have the raw brainpower and intellectual capacity to do so, but my piss-poor executive function lets me down every single fucking time when it comes to punctuality, consistency, starting and finishing tasks, and meeting deadlines. It’s honestly infuriating and a little frightening. I don’t want to have to “adjust” my goals or temper them down or whatever. I think it’s incredibly difficult to admit to oneself that you might not be able to achieve the life you want. I used to have dreams of being CEO one day, 25-30 years down the line. But now I’m not so sure…  


I want to see what people in this sub who have been in my position and are highly successful today have to say about this. I do know that there are many skills and techniques I could learn to make my days easier and more efficient/effective, such as developing routines to automate certain processes. I use the Reminders app on my phone religiously, and have a morning “routine” of wake up, open blinds, take meds, brush teeth, wash face, put on sunscreen, put on deodorant, put on clothes, grab keys, wallet and phone, and get out of the house. But obviously there’s so much more I could be doing, and so many skills I am yet to learn and implement in my life.

  
If medication truly is the thing I need to change my life drastically and achieve everything I want to, then I will go down that path. I am willing to give anything a try at this point, except Adderall and Vyvanse. I wonder what the non-stimulants like Concerta or Strattera would be like, or even something like Ritalin or Focalin. Please weigh in with your opinions, advice, and knowledge everyone. I just really need to hear and know that it’s possible for me to reach my goals and get everything I want out of this life."
9t2j16,2,2018-10-31,"Crossroad at 26: Should I continue my career in manufacturing, or try and chase after work related to my broadcasting degree (which is proving to be difficult!)?",LadyInWhatever,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9t2j16/crossroad_at_26_should_i_continue_my_career_in/,"First off, sorry if this is ridiculously long. I'm glad I found this sub, I'm in need of some advice. Some context, my fiance is military and we just moved from our small hometown to Virginia Beach. Before we moved, I was working a manufacturing gig for almost 6 years while I studied broadcasting &amp; communications part time. This proved to be a bit of a mistake on my part. Now that I've quit my job I'm having a difficult time thinking about what is a ""smart choice"" (as my Dad would say lol).

I worked in manufacturing for 6 years. It was a good job, good pay, good benefits, lots of upward mobility. While I worked there I decided I would go back to college for broadcasting and mass communications. I really enjoy this field and had a lot of fun working on projects for television and news production, but half of my attention was always focused on my full time job. This meant I passed up a lot of good chances at networking so that I could continue to make money. I passed up opportunities to hang out with class mates outside of school and good internships in favor of less ideal ones during off shifts. I was always tired so I had no energy to engage with my teachers who worked in the news and television industry, and I felt my projects were often lacking (not bad, just not gold star material) because I had so little energy and time to dedicate to them. 

At the same time, I missed out on a lot of opportunities to move up in the company I was working for. I was a great employee and they took notice of that. I passed up management positions and better jobs in different departments because I had to keep changing shifts due to semester requirements. My supervisors were more than happy to move me around but that meant I couldn't be relied on to take on extra responsibilities because shift supervisors couldn't hop around shifts like the operators could. 

I've since realized that broadcasting is an incredibly hard field to get into. I knew I wasn't going to waltz into any job I wanted, but I didn't put in the time making connections. It's a very ""who you know"" kind of industry. That was my fault for choosing to work full time while I finished a degree. Since we've moved, I had to finish my last two semesters online, which means I'm essentially a ghost now, or at least that's how it feels. 

I feel a lot of pressure from people in my life (such as my parents) to ""succeed"" at this. I've always been an artistic and creative person who loves to write and do art, so people were always feeling sympathetic for me for having to work in a very sterile environment making car switches while I pursued this dream of working in a creative and ""meaningful"" industry. When I put my two weeks notice in my supervisor told me she hopes I find a more fulfilling job, and my dad and stepmom always talk about how they can't wait to see me working at a news station or something, but I'm starting to wonder if that's a smart choice to make. 

Most places won't hire you unless you've done an internship first. I have one measly fall internship from 2016 that I did on Sunday nights when there was nobody working except a skeleton crew. It was not a good internship at all. I had classmates who traveled across the country during summers to do internships at major companies. Anyways, I'm so used to being paid well for working so hard that taking on an internship to work for free feels like I'm lowering myself, plus there's no guarantee I'll even get hired afterwards. I have the luxury at the moment to have a wonderful fiance who supports any choice I make, and he can support us both financially while I look for work. 

On the other hand, I have so many skills and years of experience in manufacturing I would have no trouble at all finding work. I just had an interview at a plant that offered me a job, and they gave me a week to think it over because they know I just moved to the area. I feel like I have a good foundation in manufacturing and a lot of momentum to keep this career going (I've only been unemployed for three weeks!) but I wonder if I'm settling for something that will crush my soul in the long run. My last job was good but the work could be hard on your mental health due to long hours and weird shifts, and it was tedious and dull and didn't challenge you. There's so much expectation these days to find a career doing what you love, and I don't love manufacturing work but I'm really good at it, so I'm left confused (and deep in debt) wondering what to do next.

While practice problems aren't a perfect reflection of deliberate practice and don't reflect time spent learning new topics, they are a good yard stick for time spent studying.

Of my 11 total tests taken, I scored a 740 three times - each was an Economist GMAT practice test which may be a bit more lenient in grading, and each of which had questions (both in quantitative and in verbal) that I had seen before. As a result, while I may have ""scored"" a 50 in Quant multiple times, I don't really count those scores.

I chose the Economist GMAT program after using the free-trial versions of Veritas Prep, Manhattan Prep, and Economist GMAT. I found that Veritas and Manhattan forced-fed you practice problems without much focus on strategy, and that the answer explanations seemed very copy-and-pasted. Overall, I loved the Economist GMAT prep.

My final, actual score was a 730 - 48Q/43V, 7 IR. Because I was under good test taking conditions and paced myself well, I think it's tough to rationalize taking the test again - but of course, I'd like to see myself score a 760 or above to help get into my target schools.

What do you think? Should I take it again?

I'm looking to apply to B-School in September of 2019 - and plan to add more volunteer experience before then.

I've always enjoyed reading other's GMAT progress, so I wanted to share mine too.

Thanks!

Two years ago I was starting my last year of my Physics bachelor degree and was building up a really good relationship with an amazing girl. I was studying in Germany, and being originally from Bulgaria it was challenging for me being abroad. I didn't speak any German (my program was in English) but I got up to a B1 level, also I was working part time and saving some money. I also had found a nice apartment in the city center, lived with a friend who later moved out and transferred the contract to my name. As he was moving out another friend of mine who was on an exchange was coming in and we were going to be living together. My life was shaping up amazingly. I had saved up enough to buy second hand furniture for the kitchen and something for the living room I was going to live with a good friend who studies the same subject, I was in a very good relationship and I was living right in the city center. However, due to the stress of the program, and the general lack of organization a lot of my friends grew spiteful and nihilistic and I think that had affected me. Because I stopped appreciating all the good things around me, and had it as a goal to get away from that university and program, thinking there is no future for me there. I started getting somewhat depressed and overworked around February (2017) when final exams were. Final exams drained me a lot but I passed them. I started looking for masters elsewhere, and my girlfriend at the time wasn't sure she would move with me. I stopped looking for possibilities in the city, and instead of learning more German and gaining a B2, C1 level over the summer and following winter I looked for masters in English countries more as an escape. A few months later mostly from miscommunication and uncertainty of where we would end up, me and my ex broke up, I got even more depressed, then a friend found a nice job in an English speaking company in the city and instead of applying there or looking more I got even more depressed thinking it was the only one etc. At that time the accelerator I was working on for my thesis brakes down and no one has an idea when it will be fixed. So all of a sudden, I have no time frame of what will happen, if I should be looking for internships in the city, or if I should move for my masters. 

My roommate was going to graduate and he got accepted into TUM, but I wasn't thinking straight and instead of finding a new roommate i decided to move back to the dorms and submit a letter to the landlord. I then get back in touch with my ex turns out she found an internship in the city and will stay there for the next couple of months. We meet, all the feelings come back but I chicken out and don't push for it, we make excuses and we don't continue forward. I go to the dorms (around October) and I didn't think how bad that would feel. I had lost some of the things I had worked for to have a nice apartment. I don't have a nice kitchen to cook for the week, I don't have a nice living room, I don't have a cool place to be social and invite people and my new roommate barely talks. At this point I'm thinking of just pushing through. I stop talking to my ex, push through the winter, meet mostly with the students one year bellow me, but all of them will be going away from the city so the friendship doesn't feel the same, it feels like something temporary and almost everyone I knew from my year is already gone (I think I was really depressed at this stage, in hindsight I should have been meeting new people etc). At the same time a friend of mine in Bulgaria got an interesting very well paying job and in the back of my head I am slightly fantasizing about joining him but it was more of a comforting thought, because my main objective all those years was to settle in Germany in that city but somewhere through the chaos of last year I forgot that. A few months pass, the accelerator is fixed and I am almost done with my thesis and i randomly meet my ex who has moved on and is in another relationship. I get really sad, and all I think about is ""just finishing the degree"". Again, in hindsight I could have used the time to meet new people, taken advantage of a free integration course I had known about, but I kept having this thought of I will be gone in 2 months there wont' be time, or it won't be worth it, and I kept postponing. I applied to a bunch of master programs and June this year I submit my thesis... but then I am left with almost knowing anyone in the city, no relationship, no apartment, no job... I've never experienced feeling so purposeless and empty. However in a few weeks I get accepted into TUM, and I barely manage to organize myself to go. Now I am staying at my old roommates room because it is hell to find a place in this city and I am not as motivated or confident about this masters program as I was starting my bachelors. I also really miss my ex, and regret not saying what I really wanted was to continue the relationship, I regret not sticking with my plan, staying in the other city, and continuing to progress there. It's hard for me to imagine living in Munich for the next 2 years. But at this point I feel like I just wasted all my previous hard work and options. I keep thinking that I could be having a well payed job, be living in the center of a nice city, and be in a caring and strong relationship if I had stuck with it, because I think going through hardships and creating memories is what builds a relationship. 

Any advice on weather I should suck it up and stick to this program or try to find a job in the previous city  as well as how to deal with the feeling (or fact) that I fucked up a lot of good options for myself would be helpful.

tl;dr: International student in Germany, from being in a nice city, good relationship, finishing a bachelor degree, I lost track of my plans, me and my ex brake up because we might not be in the same city, all my friends go elsewhere for studies, I get depressed, my thesis gets prolonged from circumstances out of my control, due to just thinking theres nothing out there I miss an opportunity to intern at an English speaking company, ex ends up in the same city but has moved on, I just want to escape, get into TUM but not sure I can or want to stay in this city and finish the degree.
