My experience...",LockeColeLamora,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/j2xt57/passed_security_today_781_my_experience/,"About me: I am an intern in a position for the government. I was required to take and pass this certification for compliance in my position. I have a degree in Management Information Systems, which helped my for this test in almost zero capacity. There were some of the database concepts that I had a firm grasp on from my degree, and that is the extent of it.

The stats: My test was 79 questions, the first 5 of which were PBQs. 2 of them were quite easy, 2 were difficult but I understood them, one was so far off from what I studied or heard or read that it was complete and absolute guessing. I skipped the PBQs, did my multiple choice, 22 of which I flagged for review, 52 I felt pretty confident in my answers. After the multiple choice, I had 52 minutes left for PBQs and returning to flagged questions. Finished and pressed submit with 14 minutes left.

The materials: Same as everyone else, with some government flavor. Required to take Skillport video courses, about 13.5 hours or so. These were a decent base of knowledge actually. Sound pretty similar to the Dion videos that a lot of people use. They were in-depth and short per each category, around 4-9 minutes each. I would have failed without Gibson's book, and his app ($7.99). Though the app simply became memorization from doing the questions in my free time, they were worded well and very helpful. They are the exact same questions from the book in an easier to use format. I cannot overstate how helpful this book was. Great stuff. Finally, I did a couple Messer videos to reinforce areas that I personally struggled with, namely command line concepts, PKI, and cryptography.

Takeaways: Skip the PBQs, absolutely save for last. This will help your time management immensely. Flag questions you are unsure on, but go with your gut on most of them. I changed a couple that I don't think I should have, which resulted in a lower score than I had hoped for, but in the end doesn't matter. Know your command line stuff. I hardly got anything related to ports, know your acronyms. I stress this, knowing only what they stand for, not even what they do, can take them out of questions are possible answers in some cases. Example, test asks about hashing and 3DES and AES or two possible answers. These say encryption right in them, you know they are not for hashing. Stuff like that. 

Sorry for the long post, let me know if I can help anyone. Thanks to everyone in this community for helping me, I couldn't have done it without you. "

I just graduated from community college right before the shutdown, got an Associates in Applied Science for Computer Information Systems. It's just a general Information Technology degree, but with it I hope to land an entry level IT job, rather than working my minimum wage college job for the rest of my life, and (hopefully) pursue a bachelors degree.

I've been using all the different job searching websites, and applying for so many jobs constantly. I have excellent social skills and often excel at all the job interviews I've done in the past, and I was hoping to attend career fairs and IT events to network with people face to face in order to secure a good job. My first impressions and my conversation skills were something I relied on during my temporary internship and college hosted career fairs. Though the college career fairs had basically no IT related jobs, so I wasn't able to network throughout most of my schooling.

Now, with COVID, I can't attend any events or really network. I'm hoping for some advice on how to secure a good job, even though one of my strongest skills is basically worthless for the time being, because all I have left is just shot-gunning my resume to every job opportunity I come across."

So I have a virtual job fair coming up (and this is my first job fair I've been to actually). I'm an IST (information science and tech) major and am looking to make a good impression on a company and try and help my chances for an internship. I scheduled a few individual 10 minute 1-on-1 sessions with either recruiters for that company or with engineers or analysts at the company. I'm wondering what I should ask, or what I should expect to be asked during this session.

Never been to a job fair before so I don't know if they like ask you questions or if they expect to be asked the questions. I'd like to get a data analysis related internship (but I'll honestly take whatever I can get). I'm a smart and good student but I'm lacking in the coding department is all. I've only just began learning Java and Python. I know SQL and R will be coming later down the road in my coursework. I'm not concerned that I don't know a whole lot of programming, I'm just not sure how to sell myself without it I guess. Any help would be awesome on how I could nail this and make a great impression!

This may not be the right subreddit to post in, but I wasn't sure where else to go for advice. If it's in the wrong place, let me know and I can remove the post.

My life has gone through a lot of changes lately, and I decided to finally push myself to go back to school. I've wanted to teach since I was in high school. I even did a teaching internship my senior year, and I really enjoyed it. The problem is that I convinced myself that I was too stupid for college. I convinced myself that I would fail. I never pursued it, because I was so scared.

I'm 25 now, and a shitty relationship has recently ended and it landed me back at my parents' house for the foreseeable future. I figured out that I can afford to pay for school out of pocket if I stay at home, so I'm going to sacrifice my freedom for the ability to go back to school debt-free.

I was accepted into a local university, but since I never took the ACT or SAT, I have to take a placement test. I'm terrified, because I only took math up to algebra 2, and passed solely because I only did my homework. I don't remember how to do anything. Geometry is a blur, too. I have a friend tutoring me, but I have bad text anxiety and simply looking at a math test makes me freak out. The only 2 math courses I have to take are called math for middle school educators 1 and 2. I think with help from a professor, I'd do okay, but it's testing high enough to get into them. I also have to write an essay, and I've convinced myself I no longer have the ability to write a five paragraph essay with a strong thesis statement, and that my grammar and punctuation is all wrong (someone let me know how I'm doing on that front based on my ramble, PLEASE). Basically, I'm freaking out.

I'm still scared that I'm not smart enough to go to college, and I'm scared I'm not smart enough to teach kids. I love kids. I love teaching. But what if I don't have the mental capacity to do well in school? Is college THAT hard? How do you know if you can succeed in college or not?

Seriously, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm so stressed and anxious about the placement test. I'm stressed and anxious about potential failure in classes. Please help."

j337gb,3,2020-10-01,Rotman FULL-TIME vs Morning Evening MBA (Part-Time)! HELP wanted from Rotman MBA Alumni!!!,ask_9,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/j337gb/rotman_fulltime_vs_morning_evening_mba_parttime/,"This is a long query!

Really torn between Rotman's full-time MBA and Morning Evening MBA (part-time). Not being able to understand and decide which one would be right for as a new immigrant in Canada. Since I am already 31 years old and will be moving to a new country with my wife, ideally it would be preferred if I get into the part-time MBA program and get into some job. 

However, I do not want to spend such a huge amount on an MBA program not make the most of it. That is why I am open to getting into either the Full-Time or the Part-Time program. 

I have corporate job experience, however, I was into entrepreneurship in the last few years. So this move to Canada is going to be a **restart for my career** in the job market.   My academic background and professional experience have been in marketing in my home country. So, I want to work as a **brand manager** or **product marketing manager** in Canada. 

**My Questions:**

1. Can someone help me figure out which program will be the right fit for me?
2. What are the key differences between the programs? So far  I understand that the main difference is that there is no internship opportunity in the part-time MBA program. 
3. Is there any difference between the kind of support I will get from the career coaches/career service team?
4. Will the recruiter distinguish between a full-time and part-time MBA student? Will I miss out on specific job opportunities if I am in the part-time program? I saw a lot of the top companies starting from Microsft, Google, PepsiCo, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, etc hire their interns. Will I be at a disadvantage if my dream is to work for one of the top companies?

I am not sure if I want to change my career path but I am open to know if a career transition can help me to get better jobs.

Here is my profile for a better understanding.

**My profile**: 31 years old. Waiting to move to Canada as an immigrant once the travel ban is lifted.

**Work Experience:** Job (little over 5 years): 2012-2017: working in sales (2.5 years) and as an assistant brand manager (2.5 years) for one the top global consumer product brand.

Entrepreneurship (2015- 2020): started my own business in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) while I was in my job. Left my job in 2017 to concentrate on my business.

Did really well till the end of 2018. From 2019, the business started to go down and I started my plan to move to Canada. In 2020 got badly hit by the COVID 19 pandemic. Had to close down my business a couple of months back.

Education: Bachelor of Business- UK degree. MBA with major in Marketing- Bangladesh degree.

So i have been working for this consultancy firm in Dubai starting February 2020. I was originally taken in as a junior assistant with a promise of proper on the job training and a salary of 1400$. Since i am a student i was given just a job invitation letter that me and the CEO of the company have signed, no other contracts was signed. So when i have started i did not receive any training instead i was a bit pressured by the office admin and the company lawyer as i graduated from the British University which made them assume that they had the same program as a Russian one so i was yelled at for not being able to draft a contract from scratch or fill one up correctly. Then i was again told off due to my inability to work with the local Dubai laws as majority of them is in Arabic and I dont know any Arabic.

So for the first 2 months it was going good, then the pandemic hit. We moved to work from home and the ceo called me in saying that during the times of pandemic he is going to reduce my salary to 400$ to cut costs. I was given an option to either quit or stay, my family pressured me to stay. So i did, so for the next 3 months i worked from home and received my 400$. At first i believed i was making progress so i thought i could ask for the raise, suddenly in July company has hired 3 new people who are now working from the office with the admin. When i asked what about me, i was told that i could keep working from home but now i was an intern not a junior assistant as they were not satisfied with my performance.

Again i had admitted to my own wrong and kept working, now the scope of my work at the start was working with the documents and clients. Sure i made few mistakes with documents and clients, who wouldnt in their first year of proper work? Admin took a note of that and begun taking away document works from me, since the start of September i was mainly doing courier like tasks delivering documents and driving admins new assistant around and after my car broke down cause i had burned through the battery from driving over 1500 kilometers in a month. Me and ceo decided to have a talk.  


So Today we had the talk, apparently everyone is unsatisfied with my work; my document work is lackluster and doesnt match their standard of a lawyer which was again odd as they hired me with promise of training that i never got. Secondly i was told that i was too informal and unprofessional with clients as i offered them personal aid and my personal phone number (i dont have a company one and doubt ever getting one). And thirdly i was pinned down with an ultimatum; either i stay in the company as a driver, or i do a course that would train me to be a personal assistant to the ceo.  


On one hand it sounded like a healthier option and i was promised an immediate post course raise to 544$ but then i had a talk with my mother and the company lawyer. And oh boy it was not pretty, my mom released the most toxic blast on me essentially yelling that i now must go back to work from office to get back on the ceo's good side. The company lawyer called me a fool and that i will be effectively ending my legal carrier by doing those courses, but when i asked him for alternative he told me to find an internship in another law firm. Which again i swear to you was promised to me in here, i was told that their company lawyer would teach to which he responded that ""he has no need for me as my degree is from UK and he mainly works in the Russian legal system."" And apparently today our company was visited by the tv station and no one told me so i missed that out after i was talked down.  


So reddit please advise me, i dont know what to do and my mind is clouded with only thoughts of quitting this company immediately and looking for another job. But problem is the UAE job market aint that good at the moment so i could be stuck looking for a new job for a while, at the same time my mother is pressuring me to go back to the office which i really dont want to do as now i despise the men and his team for not appreciating  or even remembering any good things that i did.   


So what do i do? Do i quit and gamble on lookin for another job? Or do i try and make the best of what i got? Please someone help me ;-;"

My dream job is working as a FullStack web developer on international projects (I'm from Spain and I wish to work in English)(my real dream job is working at Google, I know thats what all kids want but I have always felt really attracted to the idea. Anyways, I've heard they only hire people with college degrees).

I also practice at home with some languages I'm interested in.

My question is: Should I join college so I can opt for better/more interesting job offers, or should I keep working to gain work experience? If the second, should I apply to other jobs that are more like what I am looking for? Something like junior developer (I feel thats the correct answer).

j3bs8b,14,2020-10-01,Best way to list varying skills/strengths across different programming languages?,mr_solo_dolo01,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j3bs8b/best_way_to_list_varying_skillsstrengths_across/,"I'm currently a junior in college looking to apply for internships soon for 2021. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how I can include the different programming languages I have experienced on my resume? The issue is that my skills in each language vary, usually falling under one of 3 categories: 

1. Proficient (java, used frequently for \~3 years)

2. Experience (python, used frequently over the last \~3 months)

3. Exposure (Javascript, HTML, CSS. Have looked at/read through lots of code, understand functionality and would pick up fast in a work environment). 

I would like to put all of these on my resume, but I am not sure how to demonstrate in a concise manner my varying skill levels.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I have varying strength levels across programming languages and want to put all of them on my resume and also demonstrate the varying levels of strength. Any tips?"

j3c664,3,2020-10-01,(Rant) Starting to lose my mind,IntelligentObelisk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j3c664/rant_starting_to_lose_my_mind/,"Sorry in advance for vitriol but I just really need to vent.

I am a recent postgraduate and I've been looking for a job since before I handed my thesis in (which was 1st July, been looking since February or so, after missing out on grad schemes in the autumn). It's now October and I haven't had a single offer. I've had a couple of interviews, but nothing leading to an offer, and it's 50/50 whether I get any kind of helpful feedback from the application tests/interviews I go through. 

What makes me the most frustrated is the apparent arbitrariness of everything, and I feel a bit cheated out of a fair chance. For example, I got really really close a while ago and was through to the third and final round of interviews, and in that interview they sprung a *literal maths test* on me, in a slideshow, that went on for most of the interview. The job was insight analysis for a  gambling company, so they wanted to see that I could do probability problems, and while I *can* solve these kinds of problems perfectly fine, and understand conceptually how it's relevant to the role, I was *not* expecting questions as hard as those were, and under the interview pressure I totally flapped and f-ed up. I didn't get the job, of course, because I didn't perform well enough in the maths section they told me, and to be honest, while that's in a sense totally fair, in another sense I just feel angry that this was the reason, since it's not like I'm going to be under that kind of pressure in the actual role, and would have been spending the first six weeks or so immersing myself in the software etc. so would just adapt. They also didn't warn me properly that I was going to get tested like that, so I was unprepared, having spent my time going over answers for skills-based/situational/BASIC probability questions.

Another way in which the arbitrariness gets on my tits is the way jobs get advertised as ""entry-level"" and say they will train you in xyz - not to mention the hoardes of hiring managers/heads of department/etc posting all over LinkedIn about how ""I cAN tEaCh ThE hArD sKiLlS, bUt I cAn'T tEaCh WiLlInGnEsS tO lEaRn/\[insert generic ""nice"" personality trait\]"" - and yet all these roles demand x years of experience in a similar role, or a related degree, or an internship, or a f-cking award in the field. Then when I do try really f-king hard and write a great cover letter, and they ask me to interview, I get a bland email some random time afterwards saying sorry, they decided to pursue other candidates whose experience/skills more closely matched, with no feedback possible to give. Or they tell me that the examples I gave when talking about experience weren't broad or specific enough to the role, which is in my opinion, totally unreasonable since at this point, as they have invited me to interview, they have READ MY CV and KNOW that I do not have direct experience in this field, but am trying to TRANSFER my skills. Why bother interviewing me if they are just going to pursue someone with an internship in the field or who - as luck would have it - was in JUST that specific scenario because they happen to spend all their free time doing large-scale data analysis just for shits and giggles, or who had a job before that was basically the same as this one, but just in another sector?

Or how about the jobs where they give you a ""fun"" assessment once you get through the cv and cover letter stage, and make out that they're all nice and friendly and they care about you, and then give you the coldest most impersonal rejection with no feedback other than ""it just wasn't right"". 

Or how about those that just don't reply to your emails after you have an interview and are asking about the status of your application.

I could go on,...I have just about lost all willpower to continue at this point, and every time I get another rejection after an interview, I regret ever feeling hopeful that *maybe, just maybe,* this one will be the one and the agonising search will end. It has become an enormous effort to even apply anymore, and yet the stress and worry about still being unemployed, and having no money to live on means I obviously can't stop. I am by no means an amazing, perfect candidate, sure, but I have lost what little self-esteem I had and feel so depressed that I am apparently totally unhirable. It probably doesn't help that the area(s) I'm interested in are pretty saturated and competitive (data analytics, performance marketing, research), but I have also tried applying for other more generic jobs (retail, supermarkets) and been rejected there too. I am at the end of my tether and just don't know what to do :("

j3dury,159,2020-10-01,Summer 2021 Internship Hunt Results,Spearman872,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j3dury/summer_2021_internship_hunt_results/,"I just signed an offer for a Summer 2021 internship at a pretty big unicorn so I thought now would be a good time to share my results with you guys. TL;DR at bottom.

**About Me (Resume:** (removed because too much personal info)**):**

* Canadian
* Junior Computer Engineering student at a mid-tier Canadian school
* 2.5 prior SWE internship experiences (bank, small startup, and part-time research assistant)
* GPA: 3.2/4

**Application Stats (Chart:** [https://i.imgur.com/Iw0yMrs.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/Iw0yMrs.jpeg))**:**

* Applied to 149 companies
* 42 Rejections and haven't heard back from 105
* Online Assessments: 19 and counting (most are automated)
* Got one phone screen which I bombed
* One offer at a well known unicorn in SF

**Strategy:**

I started back in early August and my plan was to apply to as many places as I possibly could. So I just kept checking [this list](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships) and LinkedIn everyday. As a Canadian, its pretty difficult to get an internship in the states since companies need to sponsor us for a Visa, so that's why I decided to apply everywhere in hopes of getting a couple interviews.

**Leetcode:**

I officially started doing Leetcode when I got my first OA (online assessment). At first I was pretty casual with it and just did a couple questions everyday. Then I got my first phone interview with a unicorn and started studying a lot. I was putting in almost 8 hours a day and thinking about problems 24/7, this was a huge mistake. I did 130 problems in under 10 days and BOMBED the interview, I couldn't do a single question. This made me realize that studying like a maniac is never going to work, so I went back to just doing 2-3 questions everyday, staying consistent.

**Cold Emailing:**

This didn't really work for me. I sent about 100 cold emails to recruiters and engineers and didn't really get anything out of it. Pretty much all recruiters ignored me and a couple engineers replied. I got referred to two large companies but never heard from them. You guys should definitely try cold emailing though, I've heard a lot of success stories.

**Results:**

After bombing my first interview, I was pretty discouraged but went back to studying anyway. I eventually got an OA from a well known fintech unicorn and pretty much aced the whole interview process. After the OA there was a behavioural interview and then a technical interview with an Engineer. I got the offer pretty quickly and accepted it a couple days ago. It might be remote due to covid which sucks but hopefully I can land a return offer and work there full time in SF.

**Luck:**

After going through this process for the third time, I'm realizing how much luck is involved. I got lucky in my final interview because I got a question that I had done on Leetcode before. Some people get lucky because the recruiter was in a good mood when they saw their resume. Some people get only easy questions in OAs and some only get hards. This whole thing is just a broken and complicated game. Obviously you need to study a lot but there's definitely a lot of luck involved, which means that even if you don't have any experience, you can still get an internship.

**Tips:**

* Stay consistent. This is the best advice I can give anyone, as long as you're consistently applying and consistently studying **everyday**, you'll land something eventually
* Don't overwork yourself. I tried this by studying 8 hours a day and ended up retaining zero information. Just 1-2 hours a day is good enough.
* Don't give up. This is really cliche but I noticed a ton of people giving up after failing one interview or after applying to only 50 companies (I see posts like this all the time). This isn't easy and there's a ton of competition, just keep applying.
* Find motivated people. What helped me a lot was being around people who are constantly motivating each other and studying together (shoutout /r/csmajors discord and [cscareers.dev](https://cscareers.dev)). It seriously makes a huge difference when you realize you're not alone in this dreadful process.

**TL;DR**: Canadian Computer Engineering student. Applied to 159 companies, got 2 interviews, 1 offer at a well known unicorn."

Is a project section recommended for Resumes?,ItInProg,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/j3dye6/how_to_incorporate_relevant_courseworklabs_into_a/,"Hi! Recent college graduate here and I'm wondering how you all effectively leverage relevant coursework and labwork from university into a resume. For reference I got a B.A. in Network and Digital Technology and during my computer network/advance computer network courses I had labs and projects like the following

Configuring -basic Router Settings with IOS CLI,

IPv4 and IPv6 Static,

HSRP, EIGRP,

VLANs and Trunking,

Basic Single-Area OSPF,

BGP

All using Cisco's netlab.  


Using mininet and openflow to make a firewall that allows ICMP and ARP packets while blocking other packets, routing between subnets, stimulating an actual production network  


The issue is I don't feel as though my grasp on these softwares are great enough to put underneath my skills nor would I be able to replicate it on command and without documentation- but I want to express I have familiarity of sorts with it. Would putting the concepts these projects and labs cover underneath my skill section hurt if I don't know these topics to a T? I understand the topics but I think I am overtly paranoid of being asked obscure questions about them and looking like a fraud. I was recommended to put some of these projects on my resume under the projects section which I do not have at the moment but am thinking of adding- how common is a project section of a resume? My resume is a little sparse since I only have two internships in IT and they were doing grunt work despite being internships.   


TL;DR How would you guys leverage relevant coursework and projects onto a resume?"

Like stated in the title, I graduated in May of 2019 with a BA in CS. I honestly got really burnt out my last couple of years of college and did not do well in my later classes, but I’ve always been around computers and never really lost my passion for it. I ended with around a 2.7 GPA, and as one may imagine the job search did not go smooth. Not having any internships did not help either. I guess maybe I wasn’t into software dev in college as much as I am now. Though I was fortunate to find a job, it was in IT and I have since realized how much I miss creating neat little things with code.

I think I have always been into mobile and web development but was unsure which direction to go. I thrived under scrum projects for courses but always struggled with projects involving algorithms and data structures. I don’t feel like I am learning much from watching tutorials on YouTube as topics are either too easy or too hastily covered. Simply put I feel lost in my quest to refamiliarize myself with programming.

Imposter syndrome is something I suffered from constantly, even now. My question for the community is what sort of topics I should be reviewing if I aim to jump back into software engineering? Do I need to touch advanced stuff like red black trees or dijkstra’s algorithm? What are some optimal study methods that you have found to be efficient and successful for you? I feel that the academic setting was so far removed from a workplace environment that it seems worlds apart. 

I wouldn’t mind if people were blunt and honest with me, as I understand that this is a highly competitive field and we all know the state of the current economy. As a side question, with the advent of the popularity of remote work, are the majority of companies aiming to return to an office environment post-COVID?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read, and I will appreciate any advice or criticisms! Thanks and have a nice day!"

Looking for advice.,PacoTheTacoII,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/j3fwmw/update_freshman_in_ee_i_hate_college_want_to_work/,"Wow. Let me just first say I didn’t expect any of that kind of response at all. You guys are great! I read each comment, and honestly there were too many to individually reply to lol. I just want to say I really appreciated it and thank everyone of you.

Now, I’m typing this in my university cafeteria. I just packed my truck full and got some Chick-fil-a. When I finish typing this I’m going to make the 3 hour drive back home. 

I decided to completely drop out. I’ve been talking to people everyday figuring out how to keep my scholarships. I think I’m going to enroll in my local CTC school in the spring. They offer a two year EET associates degree, and they also have vocational school certificates.

If I didn’t have AP classes and a 4.5 GPA forced up my ass for 4 years I would have at least tried vocational school. I was really interested in it in high school but my mom and her husband (long story) told me I have to go to college and that’s where stupid people go. So I always looked as college as the “right” path and anything else was wrong. 

My dad works on trucks, he knows about everything about AC, electrical wiring, auto mechanics. He owns a trucking company with 4 tractor trailers and knows them inside and out. He worked at a coal mine since he was my age running equipment, and his dad worked underground in a deep mine. My whole family’s history is based on the trades and I always felt weird going the opposite direction. 

I knew I didn’t want to go to college for a while, but like I said earlier I was forced into it. I moved in with my dad a year and a half ago and he told me I can do whatever, but I still felt the same way. Until now. 

My dad is friends with a ton of people working as linemen, installing AC units, electricians, etc. I’m gonna talk to a lot them for help. I’m also going to contact my local radio station about an internship. 

I know how good of an opportunity college is for me, but I am honestly sick and tired of classes. People say they get burnt out and stuff, but I 100% do not want to do that. I would be so much happier working with my hands doing/fixing something. 

It is so satisfying helping my dad wire up lights or change a clutch and it finally works. I know I am definitely smart enough for college, no one has ever done so good in school in my family as me. I just don’t feel it for me. And from what I gathered from you guys and my own research, EET would be more suited to what I want to do.

I don’t want to design audio products, or create prototypes. I’d rather be the one building them, installing them, training others how they work, etc. 

I’m still not 100% sure if this is the right career for me, I think there are other things I haven’t discovered yet I’d be really interested in. And I do want a degree in the future, but I would like to work my way up with trade school or something, and get a business degree or something similar. Like my dad, he knows everything about Peterbilts because he’s been around them his whole life, but he lacks the education to really move his business up. My grandpa also opened up a business as well, and I’ve always felt inspired to do that when I get older. 

Maybe in the next year or two I can really find myself. Get an apprenticeship or entry level job in the electrical field, save up some money and network, then head back to school to finish a 4 year degree. Or maybe I don’t and something else happens. I can’t tell yet.

In the meantime, I’m turning 19 in 2 months. I’ve started looking for simple dead end jobs for the time being until spring semester, or if I take the whole year off for one year. I have also been throwing myself completely into music. Since I came back to my dorm every moment has been spent recording and composing with my guitar, and I’m telling myself this is my one chance in my life to really chase that dream until the “real world” starts. 

I don’t have any bills or payments, no debt, so this is the best time in my life for me to screw up. That’s the way I see it at least. If I ever have any more questions regarding electrical work, I’ll definitely come back and ask more questions! 

Thank you guys for your support."

* Passed the CompTIA Security+ last month

I understand that the chances of landing a Cybersecurity Analyst job with no experience is slim (and I'd likely be in over my head at this point) so I figured I need to start with something a little more broad. Despite not having a previous job in IT, I thought my qualifications would be enough to bypass a helpdesk role and move directly into a Jr. System Administrator position. 

But I'm not having much luck. I haven't found a lot of entry-level positions with the title ""Jr. System Administrator"", and many that I have are requiring a security clearance. 

So my question is, are my expectations of bypassing helpdesk unrealistic? Do I just have to keep pushing and searching? Or Is there a better suiting position that I should be looking for out there?

j3hdbu,2,2020-10-01,Beefing up my resume for grad school after a low GPA,buckley_ball,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/j3hdbu/beefing_up_my_resume_for_grad_school_after_a_low/,"My  undergrad GPA kinda stinks. Cumulative 2.8, but if you squint and only look at classes related to my major it's like a 3.3. Not very good.

There's  a couple reasons for this. I entered college totally directionless, with no idea of what I wanted to study or why. I floated around, fell  through the cracks, and ended up being asked to take a year of medical  leave by my therapist to get a handle on a previously undiagnosed  anxiety disorder (now medicated and under control). When I got back I ended up changing major, figured out my academic interests, and did quite well the last two semesters before graduation.

I  know I won't be getting into Harvard or Yale with my grades. But I'd  like to make it to at least a mid-tier graduate program. Over the next few years I plan to improve the other parts of my application,  specifically by:

* Nailing the GRE (I scored in the 99th percentile on the SAT, so I think this is possible)
* Getting  a good job in a relevant field to secure a recommendation (I already  have three great recommendations from previous internships)
* Taking an accredited online course in either CS or statistics to add to my skill set (I'm in the biology field)
* Reaching out to professors and graduate programs through e-mail to try and get my foot in the door

Is  this possible? Am I doomed? I'll probably apply to a Master's program  first. Hopefully doing well in the online courses and the Master's will  beef up my resume enough to land a PhD. I know I'm capable of doing this, but my fear is having my application thrown out before I even get a chance."
j3hyj2,30,2020-10-01,The benefits of attending a less-selective school,throwawaya2cez,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/j3hyj2/the_benefits_of_attending_a_lessselective_school/,"Hello r/ApplyingToCollege! It's been three years since I was last on this forum (on a different account), constantly checking new posts about admissions information and updates, and I'm happy to see that the forum is largely as I remember it: a great resource for focused and high-achieving high school students.

I remember the stress many of you are undoubtedly feeling - the pressure to be among the lucky few accepted to HYPSM schools. I hope that today I can ease your minds a bit. Attending an Ivy League school, although it may offer great opportunities, is hardly essential (especially for an undergraduate degree).

During my application cycle, I applied to Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Vanderbilt, USC, UPenn, Columbia, Georgetown, Northwestern, Dartmouth, and Northeastern. I also applied to my state school (ranked waaaay down at 100-150 in the U.S.). When admissions decisions came around, I was only accepted to USC, Northeastern, and my state school. I was waitlisted and then eventually rejected by Harvard, Columbia, and Georgetown. And I was flat-out rejected by all of the other schools. My dreams of attending a T10 were crushed.

I chose to attend my state college, primarily on the basis of cost. When I made this choice, I assumed I was effectively rejecting any opportunity for an exciting and academically-challenging college experience. Looking back at my decision, however, I am happy I chose the route I did.

By attending a less-competitive college, I have been able to take full advantage of all of the resources available to me while also being paid to go to school. I list my experiences below not to gain validation or anything (I'm on a throwaway account anyway), but rather to allow you to entertain the idea that you can do interesting and rewarding things while attending a lower-ranked school. As long as you are strategic about how you spend your time, and assuming you are at least somewhat motivated like the vast majority of students who utilize this forum, you should have no issue finding opportunities similar to the ones I will outline below - *if* you choose to attend a lower-ranked school where you will stand out above your peers.

The summer after my freshman year, I interned at a federal agency by utilizing an institution at my school that specializes in placing graduates in government positions. Although they generally do not work with freshman, this institute made an exception for me because of my resume and recommendations from a professor I had just met. During my internship, I worked directly with two other interns, a junior from Harvard and a Ph.D student from MIT.

Last summer, a different professor connected me to an opportunity where I did consulting work for the President of a small Asian country. Would I have had that opportunity if I attended Harvard? Perhaps... but I doubt it.

The program I'm majoring in employs professors who have experience teaching at Dartmouth, Harvard, and Northwestern, and I'm working with these professors on their research. They have promised letters of rec for my applications to grad school. Certainly, working with a current Harvard professor would be a bit more valuable, but this is the next best thing.

At my school, it's remarkably easy to keep a solid GPA, even though classes are graded on a B-average curve. If I were a student at Harvard, I guarantee I'd be struggling to keep up with my classmates.

Each spring, I apply for scholarships, and I receive $25,000 each year - extra on top of tuition - deposited into my bank account as a result. The only problem with this is the thousands of dollars in taxes I have to pay lol.

I received an offer for an internship next summer at a top-tier firm in my industry of interest. I thought that, with no alumni connections in the firm, I wouldn't have a shot. But top-tier firms seem to care more about the person rather than connections.

The college I attended was not selective at all. Its acceptance rate is above 70%. Yet, by choosing this program over other more-selective schools, I have been able to stand out in my courses, attract the attention of professors and employers, and find unique and challenging opportunities.

Overall, even if you are accepted into a top-tier school, I would urge you to consider your other options. There's certainly benefits to attending a HYPSM school - I won't deny that - but weigh those benefits against the potential for you to find the top opportunities available at a lower-ranked school. Your overall success in college is absolutely not dependent on the school on your transcript. Instead, it depends on your motivation to find and take advantage of opportunities. A state school can be just as, if not more, rewarding than an Ivy.

Edit: If anyone has questions about how you would go about finding these opportunities, or anything else about college in general, I'm happy to answer what I can."

I saw it advertised on the school website, emailed them about it and very quickly a meeting was arranged. On the day of the meeting it will be three weeks since the last email exchange. They didn't allow visitors to the school for the first four weeks of term so that's why the long(ish) wait.

My problem is, do I email them to confirm that the meeting is still on? Since it was three weeks ago, I am kind of worried that they may have forgotten about it (teachers are very busy people after all), but then again I'm also worried that if I do email them they may say ""actually, we can't do it anymore"" the day before I'm supposed to go in. I'm only worried about this because of Covid, if it wasn't for that I can't see a reason why they would cancel. The number of cases here in the UK has risen quite a bit, although my county is still under moderate risk, not high.

Like I said they haven't contacted me since the meeting was arranged so I would assume they didn't cancel it as they would have told me so, but, like I also said, they may have forgotten. I'm not sure what to do.

NEED HELP (Bad Situation),DexterityIce,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/j3k2sd/computer_science_vs_iti_major_in_a_bad_pickle/,"This topic has been touched up on by many different people on here but, my situation is very specific and very frustrating.

**Currently I am a 28 year old who decided to go back to school at age 25** (spending most of my younger years working for corporate companies doing customer service, basic IT) and graduated from a community college with an AS in information technology.These were courses among others I had to take:*Computer programming fundamentals, accounting, business law, intro to informatics and 2 communication/public speaking classes*

**I was a bit mislead and told that I'd have no problem getting into a 4 year to pursue a computer science degree**. I transferred  in January and much to my surprise I had no requirements, not even requirements for calculus under my belt! Where my frustration really kicks in is in the fact that I transferred in January and was only able to do Precalculus and CS111 towards this major.

*I am now taking calculus and have completely wasted a semester because this was the only class I was able to take.*Anyways, to not bore anyone with more details, I'm planning myself out for BA CS and I can't even give myself a graduation estimate because I'm scared about what others have warned about taking more than two-three classes p/semester because the workload is intense. I am terrified that after Calc 2 I'll be second guessing all of this and have wasted time/money

**Given my circumstance I'm seriously thinking of switching to ITI because I feel like I'm getting old and I just want to do internships, graduate from rutgers and get out into the workforce again. I'm not even sure if I'll love CS  but I'm getting old and don't want ridiculous student debt in my 30s.**

**Is ITI really that bad of a major for jobs?** The whole reason for leaving the workforce to come back to school was to increase my pay to at least 45K+ a year, will this not be doable?

I'm a really hands on, people oriented and artistic person btw"
j3kwps,13,2020-10-01,I feel like such a failure.,AliceKettle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j3kwps/i_feel_like_such_a_failure/,"I just turned 25 years old this past summer, and I *just barely* graduated college a year-and-a-half late with a 2.03 cumulative GPA last winter with a BA in English. I generally did well in most of my English classes,  some other classes that came easily to me, and I rocked my college internship working at a medical center with kids from last September-December 2019. But otherwise, I lost most of my motivation after my freshman year of college.

Since graduating, I have been looking for a job in childcare and can’t get hired because of either the company not getting back to me, the commute, and/or a lack of experience. Oh, I didn’t mention that I also have a disability (mild Hemiplegic right-sided spastic CP) that prevents me from being able to drive, which means I have to work around my parents and little brothers working schedule during the week, so that they can drop me off and pick me up, and I have to be able to find somewhere that’s close to work. It can’t be anymore than 15-20 minutes away, and it would have to be starting in the morning. 

If I had friends who could drive me, then this driving  wouldn’t necessarily be an issue, but I don’t have any friends. If I could go back in time five or six years to my first and second years of college to tell that apathetic, listless, and lost girl I was to get motivated, keep up with her grades by studying, pay attention, go for a double major in English and eduction, and make friends, I would, but I can’t. If I wanted to do grad school, I would need to do really, really, really well on the GRE test, and keep up a perfect 3.0 if I somehow miraculously passed. I already spent the first half of my twenties slogging through college, just barely making it by, and even though I know it was my own fault for not motivating myself to do better and finding the energy to care, I don’t think I want to go through more post-secondary school again. 

I just want to be able to get a $15-$30 dollar/hr job, get my own place, then find a guy, fall in love, get married, have kids, and live comfortably. Right now, I’m still living with my parents, who are both medically licensed psychiatrists. I’ve explained to my mom that as an entry level my starting salary would be $10-$12/hr, and then could potentially get increased to $15-$30 as I advance in my career, but she acts like I’ll never get anywhere without more school. I could see myself getting a CDA, but taking the GRE? Going back to college for another degree? I’m really not in the mood. 

My mom keeps acting like it’s some sort of failure on my part for not getting a job because I don’t have enough experience or because I need more accreditation. She also thinks that working at childcare learning centers/daycares and tutoring won’t go anywhere for me, particularly not as I currently am. It’s like she thinks that if I get a Master’s in education, all my problems will be solved. 

This is at least partially due to the stupid Covid pandemic. People aren’t hiring, are taking more time to hire people, and getting more selective in who they hire because of the virus. I hope once the vaccine comes out, things will start going back to normal.

 I get why my mom is being kind of hard on me because she went to school knowing exactly what she wanted, and didn’t have to deal with a recession/pandemic. It’s still annoying. See, I went in not knowing exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I even tried out for a vocal performance major that didn’t end up working out. It seems that, unless you know exactly what profession you want to be when entering college, it’s a lot harder to find a job afterwards, too. It’s just that I keep looking for a job, but either don’t get hired, and/or get interviewed, then never called back afterwards. It’s really disheartening. Any advice?"

Even before I graduated I was following this subreddit and harbored a lot of the same sentiments about going off into a 40hr work week for the rest of my life... I had an internship for a few months, so I got to experience life in industry and so I already had a feel of what lay ahead. 

After I graduated, I remained without any strong drive to throw myself into the workforce, unlike a lot of my classmates, who seemed to go off into the big name engineering companies, making pretty good starting salaries (\~70k-80k). I ended up working a part time job for a 2 months, quit because the boss was not great and the coworkers were telling me the boss was saying things behind my back. I found another part time job that I was really excited for (very related to my field of study and hands-on) but then COVID hit and they had to shut down (small business). 

Amidst the pandemic I was lucky(?) enough to score a full time job, very stable (\~70k), with lots of room for promotions, and ""climbing the career ladder"", as it's so heartily advertised to us. The problem is I just cannot bear to sit in a freezing icebox of an office for 8 hours day in and day out. To the point where it's only been a few weeks and since week 1 I have already been shaving hours off, taking hours off in the middle of the day, and leaving early, without having put in the full 8 hours. I hate the anxiety that follows me when I'm out of the office, wondering when the supervisor is going to come up to me and have the talk, but I also cannot deal with the anxiety and restrictiveness of being in the office for 8 hours [every.single.day](https://every.single.day). 

I hear all my coworkers talk about how many hours they are working each day, how many they will work tomorrow, what time they will be getting off to the minute, and meanwhile I just wonder when my delinquency is going to come back and bite me. 

I feel like/know people will say I am stupid for treating ""such a great opportunity/good money"" this way and risking my future (I have \~20k in student loans, and this job is not very demanding). But I spent the better part of the year before with so much free time being able to do what I wanted: read, play music, workout... and now I can't do most of that on a consistent basis because of work. And those are the things that really made me happy, the things that I really enjoyed. I know some people say work gives them meaning, or, what would you do with all your free time anyways, but for me I really have other stuff I'd rather do!

I guess I'm writing this just to buffer myself from the inevitable lay off and ensuing shame(?). We have to scan in/out of the building every time but I was told that they weren't used for timekeeping... so... I don't really know how they would find out unless they started to suspect, or one of my coworkers notified them, and then they would have to put in a request for my timestamps. 

I guess I just want someone to give me their thoughts, support(?), tell me I'm not being lazy (again, like someone else wrote here before, it's not that I'm lazy and don't want to work and just lay in bed all day, it's the system, the fact that I have to show up every day, for 8 hours, and forget that I have other stuff I'd like to be doing, forget that I'd like to have time and energy to go to they gym, forget that I'd like to continue to learn and read, forget that I'd like to develop musical skills and play instruments..., and instead just become a worker who works for money to eat and sleep to work again.

Sorry about another laptop post but I would like some insight into whether I should purchase a new laptop for poly.

I'm currently a Y2 student studying EEE at SP, for my school laptop I have a pretty craptacular duo core laptop (8GB RAM and integrated graphics) which absolutely fails the 'recommended specs' that my school has provided for my course. (16GB RAM and 2GB VRAM)

I also have a desktop at home that recently went kaput. I primarily use(d) it for any demanding workloads and as a result didn't buy a laptop in Year 1. As a result I'm currently doing all my work through my laptop.

Would it be worth buying a beefier laptop to just eliminate the desktop? It would help with modification of CADD models on the spot or when meeting up in school for projects.

The most demanding programs that come to my head would probably be CADD or compiling.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that a new laptop would help with quality of life, my laptop is definitely showing its age

However I'm not really sure whether buying a new laptop would be worth it, considering shipping time I might get maybe 2-3 semesters of usage before I head for NS? Do internships require you to have a laptop or will there be a provided work laptop? I think that I have my internship sorted and it does have some sensitive stuff so they might provide a work laptop which would result in 1-2 sems of use for the new laptop.

Maybe I'm thinking way too long term but one option I'm considering is just making do and waiting for university to buy new stuff. I know that new stuff comes out all the time and makes stuff obsolete but I also fear its not exactly value spending 1-2k for a new laptop for 1-3 semesters of use. I'll use it for a while in poly and do little to nothing with it for NS followed by Uni which by then will have new stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

To add on, another question if I were to decide to buy new stuff would be what do I buy?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some options I'm considering: ( I'm sorta familiar with Lenovo's thinkpad series so I'll use them as examples, sorry)

I think my budget starts at around 1k and maybe 2-2.5k if I can see myself using it for maybe 5-6 years.

0) Just fix the desktop and continue using the laptop in school (Buy mobo and CPU etc)

1. Buy a beefy laptop with CPU and dGPU  (X1 extreme/ P1?, alternative might be Dell's XPS)
2. Buy a new laptop with a beefy CPU but integrated graphics (T14 with 4750U)

The problem with this option is that AMD laptops have super stronk CPU performance but no Thunderbolt 3 so no easy eGPU. I think that AMD laptops are better value for the money(?) but no Thunderbolt 3 kinda hurts compared to Intel.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Buy a new laptop with beefy CPU but also an eGPU enclosure (T14 intel)

Unless I wait until next year for AMD laptops with USB4 (LOL) I probably will have to go with intel models which are more expensive and not as powerful CPU wise.

edit: I live in the East and take the MRT to SP so I'm not too sure whether carrying out workstations such as the P15 which weigh around 2.7kg are viable alternatives. I probably will have to pay a premium for workstation laptops which are sub 2kg and their performance due to thermals won't be as great.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I might be overestimating the performance required for possible tasks so any insight from Year 3 or Uni EEE students on programs used in their courses and their requirements would be great! I'm not too sure what applications are going to be used moving forward. I'm also not too sure whether a GPU is really required, Vega 7 igpu on a 4750u might be more than enough?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to fanboy over a brand but rather good products so any good alternatives would be appreciated too!

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry about the wall of text for such a simple post :(

TLDR: I'm only interested in one specific field, gamedev, in computer science and I know it might not benefit me well in the future. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone. I'm a 22 year old Computer Science student who lives in Montreal, Canada. I entered my final year and I'm expected to graduate next year in 2021. 

A little context about me, as you can tell I'm into video games and the gaming industry in general. Currently 99% of my programming has to do something related to games or computer graphics. Before getting into university, I knew well the conditions of the gamedev industry in general. But I also knew that I don't see myself working on other tech fields, like fintech, cybersecurity, etc. I specialize in C++ and C#, but I never had interest in knowing Javascript or any other web tools, for example. 

I know being a game developer enthusiast is sometimes looked down in the tech industry, and I'm really afraid of being stuck in this situation for the rest of my life, in case I see the gaming industry does not work for me. Learning from my experiences in University, I always wanted a work-life balance and a decent payroll that can make me live comfortably. Many have expressed the right opposite happens in the gaming industry and I'm afraid this will happen to me, resulting in a downward spiral of events in my life, ex: overworking, loosing friends, divorcing, etc.

As an alternative, I also see myself working anything related to graphics, like simulations for the aviation and healthcare industry. Although these have been backup ideas for me, they also require a specialized set of skills which I have not extensively practiced as much as developing games.

My goal was to complete 3 internships before I graduate and those internships being different companies on different fields, so I could diversify myself and see what I like. Unfortunately, I was unable to find internships for the first two years of my program and if I don't find one next year, I will graduate without any experience and I will have zero idea about the work culture for gaming and non-gaming tech industries.

I can't deny my passion for what I do. Most of my projects have been related to gamified stuff. And I know this will hurt me long-term if I do not push myself to learn something ""essential"" and be more adaptable. But I can't seem too interested in other fields, even if I force myself to it. What do I do? I feel like I won't have many career opportunities in my life."

my networking skills are below average (i only took 2 courses so far which are focused on networking) 

i feel like im not learning anything just wasting money and time and i have no one to blame but my self I am a terrible student i dont study unless i have to study like if i dont have a homework then i dont study even if i have a homework i do it last minute. all my friends are smarter than me and some of then even did projects last summer break and already lightyears ahead of me which makes me feel defeated and worthless 

and i have to do internship in my 5th semester !!! Im 100% sure i will screw that up 

i legit forgot everything about programming like if you ask me to code a simple  function i won't be able to do it unless i google 

i hate this so much and i hate myself for being like this fuck"

j3pg6s,2,2020-10-02,I'm 23 and had an aneurysm...,G_Steeze,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j3pg6s/im_23_and_had_an_aneurysm/,"I'm 23 years old and had an aneurysm. It was a bit of a wake-up call. I realized that I have been putting way too much pressure on myself and need to learn how to stop. Whenever I do anything, I feel like I need to be the best at it, and if I'm not I get really stressed out about it. I'm in my last year of school taking a business bachelors, I'm involved I several student clubs and am the president of two student bodies. I climb, ski, hike, and make music, and am trying to become a business consultant after grad and for my final internship. I feel like I NEED to be amazing at all of these activities, and if I feel like I'm not it absolutely kills me.

I drink heavily, 2 to 4 drinks per night on weeknights with binge drinking like twice a week on weekends. I have been cutting down on nicotine but still consume it every night. A couple of weeks ago, while applying for job applications, I had a headache It got worse, and I slowly lost the ability to read, tried to call my parents because I was getting scared, but couldn't remember their names/phone numbers, or my roommates names. My face and right arm went numb, so I went to the hospital and they gave me a CT scan and took a bunch of samples (blood, urine, ecg) by the time I had my CT I was feeling okay again. They don't really know what happened and I am meeting a neurologist in two weeks.

I realized that I think it's because I am putting so much pressure on myself to be excellent in so many things, many of which I have no experience in. I'm constantly thinking about 800 things at once, and am so ridiculously high strung and forgetful, I want to stop being this way. After being in the hospital, I rolled back on a bunch of my commitments, but now I feel myself falling into the same panicky, high strung cycles. How do I return to the calm, thinking person I used to be? How do I form a good relationship with substances? How do I put less pressure on myself? I feel like I am unsustainable, and this lifestyle will eventually wear me down to nothing."
j3pufp,1,2020-10-02,Looking for a miracle...,Muffy_25,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/j3pufp/looking_for_a_miracle/,"So I’ve never posted on Reddit but I had a friend recommend seeking support through here so, here I go...

Long story short I’ve been struggling a lot with depression, some suicidal ideation (not like I want to hurt myself but more like I just wish I could disappear or hibernate for a few years) and anxiety, with more frequent and intense panic attacks. The depression I feel is more revolved around self-defeating thoughts such as “I’m a failure” “I’ll never be good enough” etc, whereas my anxiety results in me either smoking excessively (which is a whole other thing I’ll get to) and when I’m at my worst I’ll experience horrible panic attacks that almost feel like trauma flashbacks where I’ll hyperventilate while crying so hard I’m screaming just so I can get some air, and almost disassociate where I can’t open my eyes or control my body, as everything tenses up and my husband has to physically grab me, peel my eyes open and tell me to breathe. Eventually I’m able to get back to reality and can focus on the present moment, but I’m always super embarrassed when my husband has to see me like that because I know I probably look like an idiot and worry that he’s thinks I’m just being dramatic.

To continue this, last month (and a week before my fall semester of my masters program began) I told my husband of 5 years that I had been secretly chain smoking for the past 2 years and fast forward to now we’ve been going to couples counseling which has been great and I set up a “quit date” for the 31st of October, however I feel like as much as I want to quit, I truly believe that I won’t succeed. It’s frustrating because I’ve been in recovery from drugs and alcohol for 5 years (with some relapses in between) and I finally feel confident in my ability to abstain from substances but for some reason smoking has a grip on me like I’ve never experienced. I tried cold turkey which resulted in horrible withdrawals but slowly reducing my smoking has been a bust too. I’ve tried to implement “healthy” alternatives but to be honest they don’t help and at this point I feel like I’ve been fighting the addiction battle for most of my life and right now I’m so tired... I don’t have anymore fight left in me and I don’t have faith in myself and I feel like my demons will never go away and as a result I’ll lose everything.

To put the cherry on top, I reached one of my life long dreams of finally getting into my “dream job” and while it’s only an internship, it’s exactly where I’ve always wanted to be. Right now I’m in school while doing my internship and for most people this would be great. And I don’t know if it’s a combination of depression, anxiety, and then trying to quit smoking, but I’m falling horribly behind in my classes and have fallen even more behind in some of my responsibilities in my internship. It seems as though there isn’t enough time in the day to get things done, and struggling with a mild/moderate form of adhd which I’m on medicine for probably doesn’t help.

Basically, I feel like I’m drowning. With depression, anxiety, addiction, school, internship and then also I feel I’m failing as a wife, daughter, sister, and friend as I put them on the back burner and either flake out on them and socially isolate or let them down in some form or another. Basically I just feel like a giant burden that can’t figure my shit out. 

I know I’m trying to juggle too much but I feel like I can’t just drop anything. I’ve got this semester and one more semester until I graduate, I truly love my internship, I have to quit smoking to save my marriage (another long story) and I don’t have time to actually take care of my depression and anxiety in a way I feel like I need to. Right now, I’m looking for a miracle....

What the hell do I do?"
j3qw2x,1,2020-10-02,"I quit my studies, my parents are divorcing, and mental health",Bello_Wello,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j3qw2x/i_quit_my_studies_my_parents_are_divorcing_and/,"So, I (19F) hope some of you have got some good advice haha

I'd like to write down everything that went on in a nice story, but I think I'm just going to sum it up. I've had mental problems in the past which returned, decided it was enough around February, and have been taking antidepressants since (which work pretty good for me). Around a month or two ago my dad realized he had problems himself (after an incident we had a conversation, in which I pointed out I thought he had angers issues. In the past he punched a hole in the door during a fit of anger, and said some very hurtful things to his sister who has disabilities). 

I didn't expect it, but I think that conversation set something off in him in which he realized he had problems. So he's been seeking help, but he mentally deteriorated. Was suicidal and attempted it, though the way he tried it was impossible to die from. Anyway. That was about two months ago.

My parents marriage fell apart. My dad accused my mom of cheating, I'm quite sure she didn't. They realized they also had some other things they needed to work on. Tried relationship therapy but that didn't help, so they are going to divorce. I do think that's the better option for both of them. 

I realized my studies didn't fit me, and I also had my mental problems and the things above going on, so I quit. 

My personal plan has been working more at my supermarket job and trying to start up a small business in webdesign. It's still unsure whether we can keep the house we live in now, and I just want to work towards getting a studio apartment in the city. I think that would be better for me so I can also just figure some things out for myself. 

But it's a lot. Sometimes I break down and wonder if I can do it, and whether I'm making the right decisions. The corona virus, ofcourse, doesn't help. This is probably not the best time to start up a business. And I'm at home a lot, and being around my parents all the time can be stressful as you can imagine.

I also have problems keeping in touch with my friends. One week I'm socializing a lot, the next week I hardly see anyone. Many of my friends whom I met through my studies live in the city, and it's not really responsible to go there because - corona. Many friends in my hometown are often busy with their studies (online) and internships (luckily for them, it was often still possible to do those). 

So that's about everything that's been happening! It already helped me a bit to write everything down.

Do you think I'm taking the right decision in trying to go live on my own? How do I stay in touch with friends? Do you know any other ways to get away from home every now and then? (Besides hanging out with friends I sometimes go for a stroll or cycle a bit). Any tips in general for taking care of my mental health and stuff?

I hope someone out there might have some good insights. Thanks for reading all this haha."

As of now I am a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering student interested in ML as a career path. 

It looks like that even entry level ML jobs(and internships are scarce) have a steep list of “must haves”, and not to mention in my case, my major (mechatronics) has little to do with ML. It feels almost as though one needs to come from a CS background. 

Besides learning tools and methodologies, What should I be doing right now to get more involved in the ML industry? Do you know of any small programs/companies that help you to get your foot in the door and give you practical experience in this?"

j3t6ls,259,2020-10-02,My personal tips for the behavioral interview/phone screen,ironmantacocat,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/j3t6ls/my_personal_tips_for_the_behavioral/,"When it comes to applying for internships or full-time roles for software engineering or any other technical position, the behavioral interview can sometimes be overlooked. While it is true that coding interviews are a lot less predictable and require much more studying, this doesn’t mean the behavioral interview is any less important. In fact, the behavioral interview is a way for the interviewer to learn more about your communication skills, leadership style and interest in their company. After all, most engineers would rather work with someone who gets along with their team than someone who is a better programmer, but worse communicator.

Especially with recruiting season under way, here are my personal tips for acing the behavioral interview (I've so far passed through every phone screen I've received besides one,  MongoDB):

**1. Know Specifics About the Company**
It’s important to research the company. You don’t want to fumble answering the inevitable “Why us?” during your behavioral interview. To go above and beyond though, I recommend knowing specifics about the company’s technology. Instead of speaking broadly about the company, talk about a technological innovation they’ve implemented that you really like. If there's a tech blog, definitely reference something you read from there.
Another recommendation I have is to speak to people who already work at the company to get more specific information on their projects/experience. With LinkedIn, finding connections is only a search away. Find people who have graduated from your university/have mutual connections, and ask them about their experience. Not only will you know more about the company, but the interviewer will probably be impressed that you’ve taken the initiative to already speak to employees!

**2. Be As Personable As You Can**
While the interview is mainly for the interviewer to gauge if you are a good fit for the role you applied for, this doesn’t mean that the interviewer isn’t a person too. Try to have a conversation with the interviewer about something other than the role. For example, instead of answering “good” when an interviewer asks “how are you?”, I usually add some additional details so that we can have a brief conversation before jumping into the actual interview questions. Talking about the weather or something interesting about your day is a great way to start.

**3. Ask Meaningful Questions**
At the end of every interview, the interviewer will usually leave a few minutes for you to ask some questions about the company or the position. This is a really great opportunity to learn more about the company, and show that you are interested. I definitely recommend asking questions that are unexpected; this could mean something specific from the job description, or a deeper question about the company’s culture. I always try to ask about how a company promotes diversity, and also specific questions on the technology stack (I had a recent interview with Disney Streaming Services, and asked about how they designed and implemented the recent Groupwatch feature, for instance).

**4. Record Your Responses**
The best way to get better at behavioral interviews is to practice. Even if it might be awkward, I recommend recording yourself answering some behavioral interview questions. That way, you can hear whether you are speaking too quickly/slowly, or if there is something you missed when answering a question that you can work on. While you shouldn’t have constructed responses for every question, being able to have a general idea of what bullet points to cover is key to doing well on interviews.

Hopefully, these tips help you during the many career fairs and networking sessions this fall! Good luck :)"
j3uqbd,1,2020-10-02,Should I stay at my job or quit and start a new one?,yell-ow-walls,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j3uqbd/should_i_stay_at_my_job_or_quit_and_start_a_new/,"Hi! This is my first time posting on Reddit so I will try my best here. WARNING: this is long. I have been working at my job for 2 years, 3 in total if we’re counting the student internship (they still paid me). I’ve been working on a COVID unit for the past 5 months. Usually we’re general med/surg. There are several incidents that have rubbed me the wrong way. My manager is not too terrible to me personally, however they treat my coworkers who put their all into the job so awfully. My one coworker is having a heart procedure and our manager ridiculed her saying that she didn’t know and why doesn’t she qualify for assistance.. she’s an immigrant. Secondly a different coworker got into a car accident and she was required to return to work. She asked for a small patient load.. she had the heaviest section assigned to her. Our manager has a way of volunteering her staff to do things without notice.. becoming covid... signing me up to do extra work without extra pay.. mind you I make $13. 
On the other hand this has been my job since I was 17 I went into my job for experience while I was in nursing school and they paid my tuition for a semester. I am no longer in nursing school due to an anxiety attack and being poor. My current job has good benefits and I am prescribed medication that I take everyday. I’m not sure that the new job has good insurance. I love my patients and I love knowing that in some way I am trying to improve their quality of life! It is rewarding because you are constantly thanked for the good you do and I work alongside a few doctors and nurses who I have grown so close with. I didn’t mind being in my position until I watched new nurses (basically our whole staff now) sit at the nurses station and watch me go from room to room (full isolation, it’s hot in there!!) without any help. They even went so far as having me run from room to room.. all while sitting there. I feel like I am in patient’s rooms my entire shift. The beginning of the first covid wave TRAUMATIZED me.. it is hard to watch so many people die and wrap so many people up to put them in a freezer.. their families couldn’t even say goodbye. Don’t get me wrong, there are some lovely nurses who see someone in my position as an aide for them so they understand that they also are responsible for the patient.. considering everything falls back on a nurse regardless of who caused the problem. 
I recently was offered a job at a warehouse that my significant other also works at, they’ve been there for a year. There are many couples there who also have significant others that work there. There are many different departments and I got offered one that’s not in my significant others department which is great. Because they are hiring SEASONAL at $16/hr but they have yearly raises and $600 bonuses after every week if you show up everyday. They say it is repetitive work.. and I didn’t want to work for the man and then I realized that the healthcare system is ridiculous. It is so much less complicated than my job now and I’d be making more. The schedule is Monday- Friday 7a-3p. 
On the hand, my job keeps me on my toes and I’m constantly learning. Next week I am supposed to work 6 12s in a row at my current job and I have no idea how I’m even going to function as a person. I love what I do but management and some other staff that I work directly with have made it apparent that they do not care about me enough to see me struggling and help. I am honored that they want me to do extra things for other people however, I make $3 less to put my life on the line when I could be scanning boxes with old ladies for $16 at least. Obviously there will be overtime as well whereas now I don’t have the opportunity. I believe that COVID-19 has ruined my perspective of many people. I cry often. Stay at my job? Or leave to a warehouse?
If you read all of this, thank you and I hope you have a wonderful day!"

Please I need advice, my contract which ended last month was not renewed from my former work place and by God’s grace I got another opportunity as Night support engineer (paid internship 3 months) with an ISP, Previously I was doing some data entry job but I also got my ccna in august this year. The operations manager was impressed with my profile during interview and now it’s time to show in action the profile and reality.

I started work yesterday and am working during day the first weeks to learn the process and I feel like am drinking from an ocean. There is so much tools to learn and the company offers different services VSAT, Microwave, Fiber among others. The monitoring tools are many and my biggest challenge now is how to help some clients who cannot even tell you the type of equipment in their premises, I plan to request for a few site visits but I don’t know if that will help.  
 Many people say that this is a good foundation in building a career as an IT professional and I really need some help.  
 Honestly I did not expect this situation of having to learn so many things very fast and I had plans to start studying for my CCNP since I will have time staying awake at night and now am not sure if it’s the best option.

There are other subsections like systems and networks department and I thought I should step in a little to learn something from there as well but carrying my own load is now scary.  
 

For the record am not discouraged or anything but I need to guidance towards the right direction and I put in some work. After 3 months they will check my productivity to get some promotion or even see if I can take up some opportunities in other sub section. 

What are some suggestions for materials that I can use to help me learn the dynamics of support role?

Thanks in advance."

There are a few questions I had:

&amp;#x200B;

a) If I apply again to other unis, my original admission which I received will still hold good, right? Is there a policy that students who deferred can't apply in the next cycle?

&amp;#x200B;

b) Since my graduation in May, I haven't had any internships to show or some really good projects to show (I already feel guilty about it). Would it be a really big blot on my application this year?

j3zpqh,6,2020-10-02,The Best Advice You Can Get,SlowResearch2,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j3zpqh/the_best_advice_you_can_get/,"If you're anything like me, then this advice will be good for you:  nothing is as big of a deal as it seems. Yes you're on your own for the first time with no old friends or family immediately with you. It can be intimidating, and you might feel all this pressure to get everything right and do college perfectly. Well guess what: there's no such thing as a perfect college experience. Studies have actually shown that not having confidence that you can do something will actually make you perform worse. If you think you're not going to do well on a midterm or get that internship, you won't. It is good to use those feelings of doubt to work hard and prepare well for tests, presentations, or interviews, but there comes a time where you just have to try to stop worrying about it (way easier said than done I know). 

Even failing a class in college does not have massive ramifications. Communicate with your professor about what went wrong and then retake the class. And a B+ in a freshman and sophomore math class will not make or break the rest of your career. 

Bottom line is that yes it is important to work hard in college, because at the end of the day, that degree costs a lot of money, but grades and awards aren't worth very much. Your GPA is pretty much worthless after you find your first job out of college, and all that matters after that is if you have the degree."
j3ztoi,180,2020-10-02,Job offer paying 3x what I thought it would be and I'm not sure if I'm worth that amount?,ta_Cookie_Monsta,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j3ztoi/job_offer_paying_3x_what_i_thought_it_would_be/,"Some background. I am a junior in college and am currently an undergrad TA for a math / cs class at my school. A few weeks ago I volunteered to help the professor with a small project crunching attendance data in pandas. Because of this, out of the blue, he hooked me up with one of his old PHD students who is now a quant at a financial firm who was looking for someone to help with a project.

&amp;#x200B;

When he contacted me he said they just needed someone to pull data from a SQL database, running it through python/pandas and pushing it back up. I told him I was down to help since from the short description the job seems simple enough and I've used python a lot and have enough SQL experience to query a database. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was expecting to be offered somewhere between $15-$20/hr since it seemed like simple work and that's what I was paid for my internship over the summer. However, I was offered $60/hr which blew my mind. This seems like a ton of money for someone without a whole lot of real-world experience and I'm worried that I'm not actually worth that $60/hr and that if I don't live up to the expectations they may have it would also reflect poorly on my professor since he recommended me.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to take the offer since it seems to good to pass up but I could also use some advice on how to proceed to not make a fool out of myself and the professor?"

I would like to ask you these questions that would benefit me and people in my situation:

- Which certifications are the most relevant in this domain for beginners ? 

- Also is it necessary to be good at programming, and if yes, which languages ?

- What skills are the most sought after by recruiters in the cybersecurity domain ?

Thank you so much in advance for your help!

I hope everyone is healthy, safe and have a stable situation"

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)

c) geography


d) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.

Misusing or trolling the sticky will result in an immediate ban.

**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target program (school + degree where a consulting firm focuses it's recruiting efforts), join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target program undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of strong pedigree, in-demand experience, and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants. 

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the application / interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Time to hear back can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires to never at all.  Asking in this thread will not help.

I studied Computer science in college and graduated in December 2018. The last job I had was an internship that ended in August 2019, but it didn't lead to a full time position anywhere in the company. Ever since then I have been unemployed so it's been a year and 2 months. I basically struggled to find a good job because of lack of experience even for entry level or junior positions. I thought I wanted to do software engineering but realized it's not what I'm interested in so I switched paths. 

My concern is that I don't really have a legitimate reason for my gap other than not getting responses by employers and being indecisive in my career. During my time, I've been studying for an online certification but I only recently started it at end of August. I guess COVID also ruined things but I feel like that's still not a legitimate reason because people are still getting hired. 

I feel like I'm not even being considered since they'll see my gap on my resume. I don't want to lie about anything because I want to go about this with honesty so I feel stuck and hopeless that I won't ever get a job. Has anyone gone through the same thing and ended up finally getting a job?"

I struggled a lot in college and barely graduated. I grew up low income and went to a shitty high school and didn’t feel as prepared as everyone else at my college and didn’t have the same study habits and work ethic of many of them either (I didn’t party or skip class or anything, I just caught onto things slower and procrastinated a bunch). I thought I wanted to major in comp sci but after a year I was on the verge of flunking out because I struggled so much on the assignments and tests. I ended up switching my major to math and did that for a year and a half but also started to land bad grades in the upper level classes. I somehow managed to switch my major to economics during my last few semesters and graduated on time with just above the minimum GPA. (I know many of you may be thinking that STEM type work just isn’t for me at this point but I promise you I’m way worse at the social sciences and humanities, my math scores were way better than my reading and writing scores on my SAT and I have always hated reading, writing and literature more than all the other subjects). This whole time during college, and even now to a point, I felt like I wasn’t good at anything and had no sense of direction career wise. I told myself I would try to get into the data/business analyst field during my senior year as it seems like I could fit those roles more easily since I had some exposure to data work after taking comp sci, math and econ classes. I landed a summer internship during my last semester of my senior year purely off of luck. This summer internship was at a pretty big hvac/plumbing company and basically got the internship because my friend convinced me to join his team on this company sponsored idea pitch competition where the winners are given internships. He and the other team members basically carried our team to the win. The company gave me the internship because everyone else on the team had already accepted job offers. I accepted the internship because I was desperate to land one after trying to land one for months. The summer internship was supposed to give me an opportunity to see what it’s like to work on the capital ventures arm of this hvac/plumbing distribution company which I felt might expose me to some data work but I ended up doing a lot of grunt work, partly because covid forced the internship to be remote and caused our team manager to be laid off so a lot of things they had planned for us was scrapped. I hated working at this company because I didn’t really get to work with any relevant tools or gain the type of experience that I felt might help my resume look good for data analyst positions. They mainly just had me research and write a couple of reports on competing companies in Microsoft Word. Towards the end of the internship they had me gather some sample data for this AI blueprint symbol detection project that another team was working on but this work was very trivial and I didn’t learn much. They simply had me google search for ideal sample images and drop them into a folder. My internship ended at the end of July of this year. They didn’t offer me a full time position at this company and now here I am two months after my internship ended and trying to land a data/business analyst position. I was sort of in a depression for a few weeks after the internship ended and felt like the internship was a waste of time as well as feeling like I wasn’t any good at anything. For about two months, I just stayed in my room and didn’t do much but watch Youtube and play video games. I got tired of feeling shitty everyday and would like to get my life back on track. I would love to get some feedback/critiques on my resume to get more data/business analyst interviews as I’m back on the job hunt. This may be worth noting; I live in northern Virginia, so there should be an abundance of data/business analyst jobs right? Also should I be real worried if there’s a two month gap of employment in my resume as well as no relevant work done?

**TL;DR: graduated a couple months ago with a BA in economics and have decided to go for data/business analyst positions late in my college career, managed to land a summer internship that wasn’t an ideal resume builder, looking for feedback and critiques on my resume to give myself the best chance on landing more data/business analyst interviews and maybe general advice as well**

Feel like I’m falling apart,purplefirefly09,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j4biza/how_can_i_turn_my_collegelife_experience_around/,"It’s late at night but I need to get this out. I’m a junior finance major at an out of state public school on a scholarship (brings it down close to instate tuition) and I absolutely hate it here.

Freshman year I debated transferring out to an instate school for financial reasons (even though I got a scholarship at this school with tuition increases I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it to stay) but decided to stay at my school because I felt attached to it and felt more at home on the campus. However I did struggle with making friends so I thought, hey I’d turn it all around my sophomore year.

Hahah. What a big joke. See, as a finance major I was trying to get an internship for the following (2020) summer and went to all the big career fairs my school hosted in September and kept applying for internships only to get rejected by the only two companies I got phone screenings from. Along with that, was completely consumed with school work and exams. I joined another club on campus (I was on Eboard for another club) to try to make friends but that club like most only lasted for an hour and I had no opportunity to create personal connections there.

So now we get to second semester of sophomore year, and the moment I come back from winter break, I get a realization of a ton of bricks that I feel completely underwhelmed here and have barely any friends, and that I wish I tried harder to get into an elite private school. Couldn’t even transfer out this past sophomore year because I had no idea which professor to ask for a rec letter to transfer.

Which brings me to now: junior year fall. My one good friend who I met through my university’s subreddit completely stopped replying to my Snapchat’s/hasn’t contacted me at all ever since quarantine started and we all got sent back home. The other friend I made freshman year of college...well, my relationship with her is very surface level (we can’t really talk about politics/social issues/what’s on our minds really/joke around freely. I have to think to myself what to talk with her about before I ask.) and I also have to initiate conversation/text messages with her first, she never initiates anything with me at all. I texted her a few times over the summer and she responds, but we never have an actual deep back and forth conversation going on.

I’m living at home due to the corona situation (have all online classes)  and online clubs don’t really help at all with friendship making.  I’ve also been consumed with exams and intense school work. And I’m applying for internships and just got rejected from one that I thought the virtual interview well on Wednesday on my part, but woke up to a rejection email from them today, yay! Come to think of it, the problem was that the interviewers looked bored and were completely monotone through it all and probably weeded me out throughout it. Their part of question asking was only 15 min long and I ended up taking the majority of the time asking them questions.

I just feel like a fucking loser trapped in this big state school. Barely any friends, don’t care much my major (parents made me do it), and get rejected from internships left and right. I always wanted a life transformative experience for college, and I couldn’t even get that. I feel like a loser who is falling apart and I have no idea how to fix anything that’s going on so far.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should try to do to change my situation around? Anyone been in my shoes? (I’ll def try to join more club meetings, just haven’t gotten the chance yet due to heavy schoolwork and exams as midterms creep up.)"

j4bypr,6,2020-10-03,Can I move into Business/Data Analytics? Soon-to-Graduate MIS Student feeling lost,jdkdjgs,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/j4bypr/can_i_move_into_businessdata_analytics/,"Hi guys,

I’m fairly new to reddit and have been a lurker for quite some time, so I’m sorry if this isn’t the right medium to ask this sort of question. I’m just really lost about my life at the moment and wanted some guidance. Please forgive me :-(

I’m a senior at a university majoring in Management Information Systems; focusing on big data and advanced database management. I’ve worked as an IT technician at a small company to pay for tuition during my freshmen year of college where I was promoted to a supervisor role after a year. Then I interned at startup autonomous driving company as an IT engineer for the winter of my sophomore year. After that, I got a job as a full time senior IT analyst at a big medical device company. To me, all these titles were the same because it was essentially help desk work (but I guess I did have opportunities to take on projects). During the start of my senior year, I left the IT analyst role to focus finishing up my degree. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is; can I move to Business or Data Analytic roles with my degree and work experience? I’m really proficient in SQL, Python, Tableau, and even Excel (VB scripting and pivot tables). I have a little bit of experience with project managing and systems analysis and design from my IT analyst role. I feel like I’ve applied to every single entry level to internship level business/data analyst roles in my area, but have hit a dead end with landing any. I want to blame it on an oversaturated market due to the covid lay-off, but I know that it isn’t the case for me. My post graduation future, I just feel... really lost. It really keeps me up at night and I haven’t had a good night’s sleep in a long time because I constantly worry about my future. I don’t want to keep doing help desk work for the rest of my life. What can I do, you guys?!?! I promise I’m a decent guy :-((((( 

tl;dr, guy cries over his future as he worries if his MIS degree and work experience is marketable for a business analytic or data analytics role.

Edit: fixed grammar, me dumb sorry"

I get the concepts individually, but then it comes time to actually utilize them to make a program and I'm just a dumbass who can't do anything but print ""Hello World"". Online learning is hell. My attention span is shit and it is a struggle. I can barely motivate myself to eat much less watch a 60 minute lecture that becomes closer to 90 minutes because I have to pause and take notes.

It's 3am, I have more first midterm tomorrow in programming and I can't fucking sleep.

I knew CS wouldn't be easy, but I thought that as long as I studied my ass off to understand the material I'd be okay. Wrong. I feel like no matter how much I study I still won't understand anything. My mental health is so bad. I'm seeing a therapist now, but idk, I don't think I can do this."

I'm currently an intern where the startup has an analytics and intelligence platform. This is my first time working with data and doing analytics, i'm the only technical person in the analyst teams where the rest of the interns come from a business background, so they usually analyse with excel and pull simple SQL queries etc.

It's been a month and i feel like i haven't made a significant impact with my work at the moment. Mainly because i spend A LOT of time data cleaning from the database and setting up the data before i visualize the data. Even when visualizing the data,i spent a lot of time trying to debug my code, ( working with dataframes is confusing for me :( ). 

I'm having imposter syndrome thoughts but i'm pushing on :') 

i wanted to find out if it's normal to take a longer time to actually analyze using python especially in a startup. What are some ways where i can value add and some ways where i can expedite my learning!

j4hwgl,14,2020-10-03,[Rant] Statistics...,The610___,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/j4hwgl/rant_statistics/,"I am a fairly confident CompSci major, as I feel as though I have demonstrated my skills to myself in a variety of personal projects spanning a multitude of fields. I have had a choice of internships, I have a decent network should I ever need to tap into nepotism. I even enjoy the natural sciences and calculus courses that I was required to take. 

Statistics though... No subject has ever made me feel as stupid as statistics. As a highly intuitive thinker, it just doesn't click for me. Why does so much math go into probabilities and inferences that are only relative in the end anyways? I even got to see statistics applied to my Artificial Intelligence course with Bayes Nets and the like, and I *still* refuse to accept it as a practical means of solving a problem. 

I just look at some of the questions in my Intro to Mathematical Statistics exams and just feel completely lost.

I suppose Computer Science has always taught me to come up with a decisive, fool-proof, bug proof answer to a problem, and statistics is telling me that leaving things up to chance is okay with the correct modeling. It seems like such a stark contrast to me. 

How do I get past this mental block, and see the practicality of statistics that my applied mathematics roommate preaches to me so heavily?"

The most clear example of this failure is our editorial board's nonendorsement of Carl Illustrisimo from the spring 2020 Undergraduate Students Association Council election. The text is currently unavailable (we're having a months-long technical issue with several of our external sites, not just the USAC 2020 flatpage) and has been removed from the body of the text, but preserved in an [editor's note](https://dailybruin.com/the-daily-bruin-community-guide#corrections). On the whole, the original published endorsement inexcusably demeaned Illustrisimo's experiences as inferior to his four-year student opponent's and called his work more fit for ""a picket line"" than student office. 

I offer my sincere and unequivocal apology for our words.

I know I speak for many staffers when I say we were horrified and ashamed upon seeing this for the first time, including several who serve on this year's editorial board. I also know that our feelings are insignificant compared to those of the people we hurt. 

It is my deep regret that there is nothing we can do to take that initial harm away. Instead, I offer my commitment that the new 2020-21 editor team will continually work to improve our coverage and to interrogate our blindspots and biases going into this academic year. The rest of this post is dedicated to outlining the plan behind that work.

**Hiring**

Our first and most recent Diversity Report from 2019-20 doesn't include any data about transfer versus four-year student status. We're making that change for the 2020-21 report, so we should know more about that data in the coming months and release it then.

What has most clearly been an oversight on our part is that we have not historically asked for transfer status when compiling our annual internal diversity report. In the next few months, however, we will have a better understanding of those internal demographics when it comes to transfer students, as we will be expanding our diversity report to include the question of transfer status. 

In our hiring process, we do not consider transfer status as a pro or con in hiring because we generally don't know who is or isn't a transfer student at the interview stage. Transfer status is only listed in the resume section of our applications, so it's hard to keep track of who's who when it gets to the interview stage. This is possibly a shortcoming of our hiring processes, and one we can address once we have data to understand where our problems lie (too few applicants, disproportionately high rejections, neither, both, etc.).

In the meantime, our outreach director is making an extra effort this year to publicize our internships with the Transfer Student Center and Facebook groups, as well as beginning to form partnerships with journalism programs at local community colleges directly to increase familiarity among incoming transfers with The Bruin leading up to their arrivals at UCLA.

I recognize from these comments that we have a long way to go in making the Bruin feel truly accessible to all students, but that is my goal. If you want to send me an email at editor@dailybruin.com, I'm very open to suggestions.

**Training**

The Daily Bruin editorial staff underwent several new trainings this summer to further inform our outlook going into this year. I know trainings are imperfect and too often one-and-done, but we're hoping they were a good first step to set the tone for the year.

We held professional Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training Sept. 19. We held transfer awareness training conducted by the Transfer Student Center on Sept. 21. We expanded our normal sensitivity training to include discussion specifically about our failures with Carl Illustrisimo's student government nonendorsement. 

**Coverage**

We released our first-ever community survey over the summer (another will be coming out in the fall) to solicit input about our coverage and especially what it's missing. Several people noted that we fail to adequately represent transfer issues and stories. 

As a general note for clarity, most of our coverage refers to transfer students as third- or fourth-year students without labeling them as transfer students. We only apply additional labels beyond our standard name/year/major when it is relevant to the content of the story, per Associated Press style. If you see a third-year student's reaction to a concert or sports game, for example, that person's transfer or nontransfer status is not implied in our reporting one way or another. We currently do not track demographic data about our sources for logistical and privacy reasons.

Our two main strategies to address this issue are hiring (see above) and community outreach. No one person can see UCLA in its entirety, and that's especially a challenge for us this year with remote learning. Instead, we are working to build stronger relationships with different campus entities in the hopes that they will feel comfortable bringing their work and events to our attention. The new outreach director position was created in the hope of forging those connections. We also published the Daily Bruin Community Guide to improve our transparency, which we hope in turn can make those early steps toward a working relationship a little smoother.

**Leadership**

Though I don't have any precise data to reference yet, our leadership team glaringly lacks transfer students. This is a tricky issue so, again, I'm open to any ideas if you've addressed the problem with a different student organization and want to send the results our way.

We hire for editorships every spring quarter. Students often reach the increasing levels of editorship (assistant editor then top editor or upper management) in sequential order. If a transfer who plans to graduate in two years immediately joins the Daily Bruin during our fall or winter hiring cycles, they will only get one chance at editorship in the spring. There are no rules barring transfer students from applying to top editor or upper management jobs during this cycle, but the timeline still makes it difficult for transfer students to reach and be represented at the highest levels of the Daily Bruin hierarchy.

**So where does that leave us?**

I am a strong believer in concrete baby steps. The Daily Bruin's history and internal structures are more than 100 years old. It'll likely take more than three quarters to rebuild the transfer community’s trust in our paper – but we’re committed to laying the foundation for a more inclusive newsroom for the years to come. While we only serve one-year terms, I know the 2020-21 editors to be exceptionally talented and thoughtful. With that calculus and this plan in mind, I know we can make those initial steps to bring our service into balance with what the campus deserves. 

If you have feedback on how we can do better, we really do want to hear from you. Contact information is available on our [Community Guide](https://dailybruin.com/the-daily-bruin-community-guide#contact), or you're more than welcome to reach out to me directly at [editor@dailybruin.com](mailto:editor@dailybruin.com).

I think SWE is interesting but I'm really more interested in PMing, but not sure if it's because its extremely extremely selective or because I'm an underclassman (or both).

j4lqd9,3,2020-10-03,I hate so much in my life right now,mentalhelththrowaway,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/j4lqd9/i_hate_so_much_in_my_life_right_now/,"I hate my apartment. I recently moved here for my graduate studies. There's no insultation in my room, no natural sunlight, and the ceilings are so tall that I can't reach the fan. I can feel the wind enter my room through my locked window. Maintenance has said the only thing they can do about it is seal the window with a plastic bag. In the winter, the wind chill causes outside to feel like -19 degrees (-28C). I am so cold and frustrated.

I hate people who can't clean after themselves. I moved in random and even though I don't actually hate my roommates, I hate their actions in the kitchen. Pots and pans will be dirty in the sink for days. Our knives aren't dishwasher safe, so every single one sits in the sink until someone finally decides to clean everything. I've decided to hide a knife in my bedroom so I always have one for when I eat. The countertops and stovetop are always dirty. It's disgusting. I would clean things at first, but it got to the point that I became too busy with schoolwork and my job to have any motivation and my increasing depression (which has been impacted by the mess) hasn't helped. I am so frustrated.

I hate when people use my things. I explicitly stated when I moved in that I like to keep my food to myself (I don't have a lot of money, so I often plan out and buy the bare minimum). Though I haven't had a very big problem with other people eating my food, someone finished all my orange juice. I had been really looking forward to drinking it, especially since I've been feeling under the weather today. In the beginning of the semester, someone kept using my food storage containers. I meal prep at the beginning of the week, so I need all my containers. I asked not once, but twice, for people to stop using them. In the end, I hid the tops to the containers in my room  because respect for people's belongings isn't something they understand. I am angry.

I hate when they turn the AC on. Where I live, night time has been reaching 30-50 degrees (or 0-10 Celsius). If they're in the living room and feeling warm, they don't just open the window, they turn the AC down to 65. Since our ceilings are so high and the thermostat is in the living room (which is much larger than our bedrooms), the AC ends up dropping the temperature in my room so low that not only do multiple layers of blankets not warm me, but I wake up from being so cold. This drastic temperature difference has caused me to feel really ill some days and I frequently have to ask for them to turn off the AC. I am pissed and cold.

I hate how lonely I am. I don't really have friends. I'm really friendly with people in my cohort, but I don't see them very often and I'm afraid to given the virus. The only person from my undergrad that I talk to regularly is my boyfriend and a couple other people, but it's never more than basic snapchat conversations. My friends from high school live too far away to visit and have jobs of their own now. I am sad.

I hate how overworked I am.  I work part time and am a full time student. I always find myself doing some form of work with rarely any time to relax. My classes are in the evening and by the time they're over, I don't have the brain capacity to do anything, so I don't. I am tired.

I hate how depressed I am. Everything I've described, plus who I am as a person, has been ruining my mental health. Some nights I just cry. I can't help it. One night, I called the suicide prevention lifeline not because I wanted to kill myself, but because I needed to talk to someone about how awful I felt. I chickened out and cried myself to sleep instead. Sometimes I sit at my desk or in my lounge chair and just feel sad while staring at Netflix. I am empty.

But, here's the thing...I'm a happy person. Throughout it all, people genuinely perceive me as happy. I do sometimes feel happy, but the past two months most of the time I feel...Meh. When everyone went on lockdown, my internship supervisors told me they thought I was handling everything really well. I wasn't. I've become a pro at putting up a front over the years.

I made it through then, and I'll make it through this. I'm planning to return home for a week, see my high school friends, and spend time with my parents and pets. I've been doing a little extra work lately so I have less to do that week. I may feel empty, frustrated, and sad, but I am resilient. I am a fighter.

It's been hard, but I'll make it through. 

I always do.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Life fucking sucks right now, but I will make it through."

So my situation is as follows - I got hired as a trainee/intern (with a plan to make it into a full-time position) at a big-name consultancy, but after starting I found out that I am going to be doing mostly RPA for the duration of the internship and probably also beyond that. The problem is that I find that kind of a job generally unfulfilling and not at all what I signed up to do. After asking my supervisors about it, I got told that there will be opportunities to advance to more technical roles, but I cannot help but doubt it, because I think that is just a way of them filling their shortage for RPA devs.

Should I stay in the internship to have it on my resume and then go off looking for another job?

Continue working after internship and hope for other opportunities within the company?

Also, what would be a good role to advance to after RPA Developer, where the skills learned here would come to be useful, but necessarily in the RPA field?

Hi everyone,

I will just give a brief about my past experiences: I'm a 23 years old, I started my career at age 18 as a network engineer. So currently I have 4 years of experience as a network engineer and now I'm in a Devops student position (Intern position during my college). I have the following knowledge and certificates: CCNA , CCNA Sec, CCNP, AWS cloud practitioner, VMware cert and a Linux cert.

Knowledge: Networking, Python scripting, Linux, AWS cloud, Checkpoint firewalls, VMware, Docker, basic Git.

My team is a firmware development team, they usually right their code in C/C++, Python and Assembly. They are very reliant on chips and other physical SKUs. This is a small team of engineers. I'm kind of new to the whole Devops concept and best practices (also very young), but I got a lot of experience with infrastructure and also automation and scripting.

My main question is where do you think I should start with? I made a solution for my team regarding containers to their environment (kind of dev containers for compiling code), but I don't know which solutions can I provide further. I guess that there is a lot of ""Firmware Devops guys"" in this forum, that might have a lot of experience and maybe they can give me some tips and hints.

I thought about integrating Jenkins, but I guess that all of those automation tools are kind of hard to implement when my team relies so much on the hardware and chips.

Hope you can give me some tips and thanks to everyone on this forum"

Extracurriculars: This is where the problem lies. I have not been involved in many things out of the school as my parents had always pushed me to do great in school and this area was something i had completely ignored.

Although here are potential Extracurriculars:

• I have a couple of friends in addition to a few potential students in my school who are willing to take SAT classes from me and I have got great teaching skills which I hope would be able to increase their scores by quite a bit. Teaching 10-15+ students for their SAT and actually yielding great results would be something worth mentioning 

• i have high hopes for me winning the elections for the deputy headboy of the school

• i plan on starting a social welfare club and solving a problem that i realized is heavily neglected here (giving stipends to extremely poor parents in order to convince them to send their children to school. These parents don't send their children to schools because they want them to work and earn for them (there are 2 government funded schools in my city which provide everhthing needed at no cost in addition to fully free education uptill class 8). This way there would be no stopping the students from going to school. Infact the parents would encourage their students to go to school in order to get their monthly stipend. Funds would be collected through campaigns

• An internship at NADRA (National database and registration authority of pakistan) 


My family can't really afford the extremely high fees of the universities and so the ones i can attend only are the need blind ones (mostly ivies + NYUAD) and if i get some kind of aid at any other great university within or outside US. Maybe even australia, Uk or Canada

What are my chances of getting into the aforementioned universities with and without my ""potential"" extracurriculars"

Young Global Scholars. I know this sub is for college chance-me's but hey why not give this a shot right?

Yale Young Global Scholars (YYGS) is a summer program for rising juniors and seniors. Its application is supposed to mirror the common app in order to prep students for college applications.

Also, if anyone has any summer program recommendations, please hit me up!

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics:** 16 yrs old Male, Latino Student. I'm from northern Mexico. My family is middle income, as far as I know, I qualify for full need-based rides in most colleges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intended Major(s):** Biochemistry or Cellular Bio (Applying to the Science track of this program). I want to be on the pre-med track.

&amp;#x200B;

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** None, but test scores aren't included in their app process so it's cool. Not thinking about mentioning it in my app but I'm planning to take the Bio and Chem subject tests next year.

&amp;#x200B;

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** Kinda hard to tell because I'm a first-year high school student and my school doesn't publish grades until November, but according to Canvas I'd say I have an overall 98/100. My school doesn't do ranks.  Perfect grades in English, Biology, and Technology so far.Also, high schools in Mexico begins in the tenth grade. So I'm technically a freshman and a sophomore at the same time. My particular school is connected to a local university. I go to the highschool of the University of Monterrey. This will be relevant later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coursework:** My school doesn't do honors or anything like that for tenth graders. Next year I plan to enroll in the Diploma Program. I take most of my classes in English.

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards:** I don't have any science awards yet because I just started high school, but so far I've been awarded two academic scholarships for private high schools.I plan to include this in my application. I got a sixty percent scholarship for academic merit at Prepa Tec, the leading high school in the country. That's the highest academic scholarship they give out. I got a ninety-percent academic excellence scholarship at Prepa Udem, Prepa Tec's counterpart. So naturally, I took the latter award. Said scholarship will renew in college if I choose to stick to the University of Monterrey for undergrad, and finish high school with a min. 90/100 GPA.tl;dr I basically got a full ride to one of the top universities in my state at age fifteen as a ninth-grader. Obviously not the way I will phrase it in my app. I cannot and will not play the bragging card amidst a sea of yygs overachievers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extracurriculars:** My school canceled all clubs for the duration of the semester thanks to covid. I was planning to join the leadership and model united nations club.So YYGS only asks for one extracurricular activity, three tops. These are the ones I'm thinking about putting in my application:

*Coursera:* I want to do biomedical research in high school. The only problem is that labs are super limited with this pandemic and I know nothing about research. After some quick google searches, I learned the differences between wet and dry-lab research and decided that I was going to teach myself how to code in order to devise my very-first dry-lab project. So that's what I'm doing. I'm teaching myself Genomic Data Science and Python Bioinformatics through Coursera. (5hrs a week)

*College Theatre:* I did an audition to join the University of Monterrey's theatre group with zero previous experience and I got in. I'm taking a college-level intro to theatre class with film and drama students. We're making an online anthology about theatre history and I got the Hamlet role. (6-7hrs a week)

*Leadership Internship:* Back when I was in elementary school my parent's signed me up for a youth Toastmasters class. I loved it. I stayed in the group for almost five years until the club director changed the program from a Toastmaster's club into his very own leadership/education start-up.Recently I told him I didn't want to be a member anymore, but rather, an intern. He agreed and offered me an internship position on the spot.

**Honorable mentions include:** Creating the first iGEM club in my school for iGEM 2021, online volunteering (just about to start in October), and model un.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I'm not a fan of rating essays I haven't finished yet. I love writing and am a fluent English speaker though. Hopefully, they will be the highlight of my app.LORs are a bit more tricky though. I'm thinking about asking one of my biology teachers. She's super cool and is helping me with the iGEM initiative. I've been told she speaks very highly of me. The only con is that we literally just met back in September. Kinda hard to ask for letters of recommendation when you are a first-year.I'm also thinking about asking the guy who oversees my leadership internship. We have a close connection and he's basically seen me grow from a fourth grader to a nerdy high schooler."
j527aj,1,2020-10-04,Career shift to HR. Did I get it wrong?,willitsmeandi,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/j527aj/career_shift_to_hr_did_i_get_it_wrong/,"Hello to everyone!  
A brief summary of my professional career to be able to frame some issues that come to ""torment"" me.  
I have always worked in the IT area, especially as a helpdesk / servicedesk operator. Personally, my profile (as person and professional) has always been to solve problems, whether they are technicians, or even helping a friend to get more customers in her store.  
In the past five years, I did a degree in HRM followed by a master's degree in HR development policies, believing that this would give me more practical knowledge in understanding how people / companies acted.  
This year, my seven-year contract with the Air Force ended, where I had been a senior helpdesk operator. Now, motivated to want to help implement improvements in HR processes, combining my theoretical knowledge (university) and technicians (professional), I decided to apply for HR internships.  
I know it is still early, but after two weeks of entering an HR internship, I start to feel that this is not what I want, but I also have a feeling that I am deceiving myself.  
At this moment, my duties include a lot of hiring and termination of contracts, monthly sending of documentation related to employee insurance, that is, something very administrative and that implies always being in front of the computer. I don't feel challenged, much less believe that I am doing something that anybody else could do without my professional and academic training.

Will it always be like this? Should I give it a chance for a few more months? Do I have a more consultative profile than an HR generalist?  
I really wanted to hear from people, tell me the challenges they have to overcome in their company and be able to support them in decision making!"

j542b0,1,2020-10-04,Moving Cities to be Closer to Friends?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j542b0/moving_cities_to_be_closer_to_friends/,"  

So I'm just looking to hear the opinions of other people. For context I'm a 27 year old male who is single, has no kids and works as an Online English Teacher.

So three years ago I left a small city (City A) where my closest friends still live. I moved to a bigger city (City B) for a year to attend casting calls and auditions. After one year I moved in with my parents to a a city (City C) which is smaller than City B but bigger than City A. I worked for one year in a film internship/ learnership program and this ended just as the pandemic hit my country (we went into lockdown at the end of March). 

While I've always longed to be with my friends since leaving City A, that longing has grown immensely during the pandemic and I've recently visited my friends there and had the conversation about possibly moving back. My parents and brother have lived in City C for four years now and I've been here for two years. I've made some good friends during the internship but these people are locals and have close bonds of their own for which I wasn't there so it's not the same. My brother and I are close but he has his own friends as well as a girlfriend now and even though my parents would miss me, they also have lives of their own and are quite busy at work. Life here is easy but I lack a consistent social life and I miss being around people with whom I am close with.

Since I work online I won't have to quit my job to move. I've spoken to my friends in City A about this and they are on board with the idea. We've already started making plans. The only trade off is that I will be leaving my parents home so I will have to pay rent again as well as buy my own food. 

I'm just curious to know what people think about this as I know people normally only do this to be with kids or S/O's."

I went to UMD my freshman year. Since I didn’t know which major to choose, I left and went to a local community college. I’m getting my associate degree in Computer Science. I need to choose a university for Fall 2021 and I have two options : 

1.) Apply for Readmission to UMD. 
- Pros: UMD’s CS program is ranked pretty high. Many opportunities to get internships, network, and join clubs. I’m already familiar with the campus. Since its readmission, I don’t need to do the entire lengthy college application again. 
- Cons: CS is an L.E.P which means I would have to take exemption exams for CMSC 131 , 132, and 250. It might take longer to graduate if I fail an exemption exam. I’d start with a lower GPA due to silly decisions I made freshman year. 

2.) Transfer to UMBC. 
- Pros: All my CS courses transfer. I can enter the CS major no problem. Fresh start with my GPA. I like that the campus is smaller with smaller class sizes. 
- Cons: Tuition is more expensive. The CS program is ranked lower than UMD’s. Harder to come across internships. I’d need to take an extra foreign language courses.

Please share your advice and opinions! How is the CS program here at UMD? What is the average GPA of a CS student at UMD? Thanks!"

I applied to Mathworks' EDG internship for Bachelors engineering majors. Does anyone know whether we can work with Python for the Hackerrank test? I've seen a lot of CS majors say that the language options are C, C++, and Java, but I would assume all the CS majors apply for the EDG internship for CS majors.

We were poorer than poor. Living in an abandoned apartment. My (and I hate even giving them these titles it just feels weird at this point) mom, brother and me. Roaches, rats, lizards is what all I saw. I was just a one night stand baby that I wish she would had aborted but I guess bringing someone in this world just to not have to raise them is better. My (and I hate using this title) dad was in and out of prison selling crack so i would rarely see him until one day he saw me with no shoes on putting water in a water jug at a gas station. Guess the guilt got to him enough to take me to my grandma house. She always raised me. She raised me since I was a baby. So her taking me in was a blessing but also a bad thing. It was one less mouth to feed and I barely saw my ""brother"" like that. I always thought and so did he maybe that I had it better. When in actuality, mom kept u -not me. I ll never have that mom n son relationship with her because she would never be real with me like she will with u because of guilt. I look just like her. So when she looks at me she looking at herself. As I was living with my grandma, my grandad (which he was great too but he had another side to him before he got sick) in which I guess he was trying to toughen me up but i was close to my grandma. Call us ""Foot to Foot"". Every where she went I went. Grandad use to curse me out under his BREATh I remember ""pussy ass nigga"", ""bitch ass nigga"" all that at around 4 or 5 6 or 7 years old. I guess he was right... I never really talked like that at all. Only with my grandma. I remember one day I believe I was 5 or 7, this dude with a black shirt and gray sweatpants wanted to play. Me at the time i didnt know the totality of what was going on. Or maybe I did and did it anyway idk. He wanted me to sit on his lap and show me his penis and he want me to show mine. After that happened as i think of it now, it's like a spirit that was passed from one to another. This is how a victim can become a victimizer. As I start getting like 10 or lil older I remember playing around with my cousin (around same age) and I did the same thing the guy did to me but I stopped that once we got caught by my aunt. (I'm not into guys at least masculine I guess but I have a weird fetish for transsexuals). My grandma was the greatest person in the world to me. It's just when u dont have that father figure in your life and because everything that was going on around u was happening and all my grandma wanted to do was make sure I had everything, she spoiled me. And u know what it says about spoiling someone. But I ll never ever blame nothing on her because she did what my own mom n dad n everyone else didnt-raise me. I blame myself for not being a better grandkid now that she gone. Was spoiled when it came to her. She always made sure that I was ok. I know she is highly disgusted and disappointed with me in the grave and grandma I'm sorry for everything. Because even if I dont directly kill myself, the way I'm living now is just as bad-a slow and painful death. As I got older I became more and more lustful. Especially when grandma was starting to slowly die on me after my granddad pass. Now around that time (still young) around 15 or 16, there were a couple of girl cousins (no force of course as they wanted to do it too) we did sexual things to each other. No penetration as I didnt even begin masturbating until 18. Before then all my dick would do was be hard and I would have wet dreams every now and again. (I didnt have penetration sex until this year and I'm 27 years old now). Now I remember when I moved in with step mom n pops-thinking this was going to be family but that was hell. Especially being that this mf was selling crack and I barely see him like that. Then when he got locked up he left me with that abusive bitch. I remember getting beaten with toy bats and toy hockey sticks. Take off all my clothes. And it can be for something small or something big. I had a problem with keeping my draws clean so I would definitely get whipped about that. Every day or at least every other day. Then my grandparents picked me up because they know alot of things was going on. I had to choose so u know I was going to them. No lie my dad was an asshole (he still is but he ll never see me again. He won. I'm out of the picture and he and his wife and everyone else in that family can live their best life), never was around like that then when he did he acted like ""well I'm here am i?"" type of attitude. While mom n dad were doing them my grandma was raising me think about that. I use to get bullied every day in school. I always smelled like shit and I let people treat me like shit. To this day I regret not standing up for myself 5-8th grade because it still follows me to this day. Fast forward, I started going to church to get close to God. Around 16. Whatever age I was in 9th grade. And things were okay. Then my grandma got sick. She was on alot of pills and she was always sleepy or dozing off. She was in so much pain. Where was her son? Doing him and blaming her for things and being jealous of me because of the relationship me and his mom (my grandma) had. While yo ass was in and out of prison!!!! I remember that time when I was younger 10 or 11 and he took my grandma jewelry, the xbox and playstation i had. She died the day after my birthday in 2010, and I watched her die me n my big cousin. To this day I never gotten over it and never will. To this day a part of me died when she left. To this day I regret ever getting close to both mom n dad because in turn it was my demise. The things I did after my grandma passed.. I smoked weed for the first time my brother turned me on to it. After I got high that first time I never stopped and to this day I will never stop smoking weed. I moved in with my dad n his girlfriend (something I should of learned from before not to do but at the time I just wanted to keep the peace and just never spoke up for myself). I tried to rub on my older cousin butt (who's a pill popper n just nobody fw her but favoritism is mf so they fw her but not at the same time) and she told. I was high af. Then went to stay with my grandma on my step mom side (her mom). The things I did there...i would definitely be in jail. I'm definitely going to hell too because if that opportunity presented itself again i would do it again. Victim becomes the victimizer. Then it was just to where I ended up going to finally stay with my mom. I should of stayed with my aunt but I wanted to stay with my mom because I was planning on getting an apartment with the paid intern job at Gulfstream.  And I did. I couldn't stay with my mom tho because the rent man can have a lot of people in the apartment it was some bullshit she told me. I got an apartment at 18 while I was still in high school. I didnt keep it for long. I just didnt care about life or myself and that was to this day. I ended up getting evicted then having to move back with this nigga again that was constantly reminding of how much I fucked up. That's when everyone stopped really fucking with me like that. I mean they really didnt mess with me like that anyway it was just off the fact that I was with my grandma that they did mess with me. Too much hatred for them. I know if I never gotten close to them, things would have turned out different. How can u be around someone if u deep down hate them, u going to eventually act out and do things to where they dont want nothing to do with. Fast forward 2013 I moved in with my real mom n brother n her boyfriend. Every where I went I was a problem after my grandma passed. I realized my brother was finessing and jugging me like i was some other dude in the streets, fell out with him and that never spoke to him sense. U remember when I said I let people take advantage of me? Yea.. all in all I just stopped really giving a fuck about myself I was always in some bullshit. It just got to the point in late 2015 early 2016 I cut off all ties with them. My life maybe hell now and I will be dead soon but if I had choose to be around them and that-I will choose my body being found on a pavement. I take responsibility for the things I've done. Even if what they did were wrong, the things i did and the way i reacted to the things they did, gave them a way out.  A clean slate from God if u ask me. After my grandma passed i stopped going to church, now I just dont care for God anymore because I realize these past years he never loved or cared about me. I thought he did but he didnt and I feel like a fool thinking about it. Like finding out Santa wasnt real. But in the same breath I can't blame him. I've become an abomination now that thoughts are just full of lust, anger, envy, depression, and suicidal thoughts. You might as well say everything was my fault now since doing the things that I did. When people do u wrong and u reacted in a way- the blame will be on u at that point.  u end up proving someone right about the things they thought about u. Now I will die alone, with nothing, homeless sleeping outside. I don't want to try anymore. I dont want to care anymore. These are my consequences and I'm too far gone to change my ways. I believe God knows this as well. I'm just living at this point until I die. I had to share this with someone who has eyes before I leave this world."

I'm 24M based in Colorado.

First off, I understand where I am in the wrong here as I preface what I am going through. I was intoxicated at the time, under high stress due to other family problems, and as a result, made a poor lapse in judgment for that duration of time.

**For context:**

I decided one night after drinking, it would be a great idea to find someone online to sext with. I retreated back to my old habits, downloaded an app called Whisper - an anonymous app that connects peoples around similar likes and interests, and found some sexual group. I made a post, and a few ladies reached out to me and we started talking. I found out one of them was local (I'm in Denver) and decided to continue talking to her.  She was interested in age play, meeting up, and said she liked doing this stuff to piss her parents off. I thought she was cool, so decided to give her my social to get in touch with me later (this will come around).

Here's where I know I'm at fault (please say what you will about me, I understand I'm in the wrong): I found out she was underage and due to my intoxication, continued to do chat with her. After a few messages, we agreed to send photos of each other. Initially, they were non-nude but she kept on asking for more, and I sent her some of my body, etc. Note - during this time, she did not send anything outside of her face.  She kept on egging me on saying - ""are you a scammer? I want to make sure?"" ""What are  you going to do send me there?"" ""No, I want a full-body photo of you with your face and it all out."" Then, things started getting even more uncomfortable for me and I said ""sorry, I don't do that."" After, she sent an angry emoji. I said have a good night and decided to block her.

**The fallout:**

Two days later, I find that because I gave her my social, I'm removed from one team I'm on since she DM'd the social account saying ""look you have a pedophile on your team with a screenshot of my Instagram account.  Convienetely, she left out the fact that she was open to encouraged what we sent and talked about, and she reached out to me.

I was removed from that team without a chance to defend myself. She also DM'd another volunteer project's account that I founded with the same, and am currently deciding what to do. Now, I'm incredibly worried she may have gone to my workplace where I'm interning now and a few other volunteer organizations I am a part of.

**What I'm doing now:**

\- Seeking therapy for both my addiction to sexting/pornography that I thought I got rid of and my mental health as this has returned me to a stage of suicidality.

\- Have made my parents (who I live with) aware of what's going on.

\- Started to search for an attorney if legal assistance is needed to defend me in a court of law and general direct legal advice.

**Where I need** /r/legaladvice:

\- Outside of the obvious repercussions, which include me having to register as a sex offender, leave the non-profit organizations I am a part of, and possibly lose my current internship, what other possible outcomes of this are there?

\- If you've made this similar mistake, how did you navigate your life at large after this? What did you wish you knew earlier on?

Thank you for your help, advice, and assistance."

I’m based in Centennial (closish to Denver), CO and am 23. My degree mostly worked with Java and C++ with some additional stuff with databases and IT. However my degree was very heavy in algorithms and data structures and their implementations. I’ve done well.

This will also be my second degree, with my first being in Economics. I have prior work experience (most being in sales and management for a gym chain) and now I’m working part-time in education. However, I haven’t done an internship 

I’ve looked at junior/entry level jobs in my area and they cover quite few different kinds of technology. Though I see myself applying for lots of stuff/whatever I can. 

1. What should I expect/what should I be working on at the moment in regards to interviews for entry level stuff?
2. I’d like to stay where I am and there are jobs here. That said, what can I expect salary/compensation wise here and for entry level?
3. Should I wait to apply until I’m done? I don’t feel like I could pass a technical interview yet, though I’ve seen the definition and experiences of such being pretty broad.
4. Can I get by without the internship?
5. Project advice has varied. Should I aim for one complex, solid project or a bunch of ones that showcase things specifically? Either way, what do I try to show?

I’ve got a lot of time at my job and otherwise just go to work and the gym. My program gives me a lot of time to work on theirs and other stuff. I was planning on just making sure I can quickly implement and explain algorithms and more deeply understand Java’s and C++‘s documentation (I’m also interested in mobile dev). I’d like to maximise my compensation however possible for someone in my position."

I am going to share my story and my recent realization that it is time to finally get some help.  


Starting as a child, I did really well with standardized testing and classwork in elementary school. Starting with 3rd grade we did this test called the Iowa Test. I believe we had to do it twice. My teacher in a motivation to get us to do better would give the kids money based on their score. Both times I got into the highest paying category which was like $5 or $10 dollars. I would even finish the in class handouts while my teacher was still explaining the instructions. In 4th grade we had reading groups. Based on what reading level you were in you would be placed in a group with your peers and all read the same book together. I was once again in the top group and we read Hatchet. I hated that book at the time because I felt it was the same repetitive situation of the protagonist eating, throwing up and sleeping. In 5th grade my teacher told me mother I should be taking college level classes. I feel that was a bit of a ridiculous statement as I was 10 years old. So I finished elementary school doing well. For middle school I applied to get into a program at a middle school for the IP (International Preparatory) program which was like the program that led up to the IB (International Baccalaureate) program. I got in! But in middle school, everything went downhill. I loved math as a kid and still enjoy math and do well with it. I joined the mathletics club and we did 5 competitions a year. 3 were among all the public schools in our district, one was a city wide competition and one was at the state level. I got first place in every district competition except for one that I was unable to go to due to my grades being poor. My grades were dropping and dropping quick. The competitions were during school days so to go you had to get a form filled out by your teachers approving it. I wasn't approved for one competition in 7th grade. I was able to make it to all of them in 8th grade because it was the only thing I was excited about so I made sure my grades were just good enough to get approved. All 3 years I took a Spanish class with the same teacher as it was required for that program (all of the students in that program were all together in every class for all 3 years aside from a few electives). I got kicked out of Spanish class nearly everyday and had to sit in the doorway and look at the board and listen to the lecture because my teacher had no tolerance for my behavior. I was unable to sit still in class. I would never sit in my chair properly and instead was always ""perched"" on it and would sit on my heels on top of the chair. I would get kicked out for that. I would tap things and make noise a lot. I would get kicked out for that. I would talk to anybody and everybody around me. I would get kicked out for that. My mother found out and said I had ADHD and I always have but I will grow out of it so I don't need treatment (She was born in the 50s). Into high school, things got worse. My grades dropped severely. I was getting in the habit of not attending classes and just hang out with friends instead. My mother would request my report card which would be given to use in school as a white sheet of printed paper so I would scan it at home, change the grades and reprint it and give that to her. She would accept it because she had no understanding of technology. I almost didn't pass and would have had to repeat a grade if it wasn't for my British Literature teacher who I think knew better than myself what was going on. In my head I thought this was all pointless and a waste of my time and I never did homework and instead played video games or hung out with friends. Anyways, my senior year, I needed that brit lit class to graduate. It was mandatory. At the end of all the grading, I had a 47%. You needed a 59.5% to get a D and pass. My teacher gave me and only me an option for extra credit. He said ""Draw the thing from The Simpsons. A robot with guns for arms shooting a plane made out of guns that shoots guns."" I'm not an artist, it looked awful but I did it and turned it in. He told me to color it and then turn it in. So I did that. For a week he kept telling me to change something and come back. Finally he accepted it and my participation points for the class were like 1000/50 which got my grade to a 59.5% and I was able to graduate. Looking back, I am so thankful for that teacher.   


Graduating high school I needed a career aspiration. I thought becoming a firefighter would be a fun career to have with it's constant excitement. So I started attending a fire science program at a local community college and became roommates with a high school friend. I was also dating a girl from high school which started a couple months before I graduated. I was working towards my associates degree in fire science to become a firefighter. Well my relationship went down the drain. One week everything she did just bothered me to no end and I ended the relationship. I got a couple As in my classes the first semester and then Fs the second semester. I was also working part time at a bowling alley. I decided to stop going to the community college as I needed a break. At work I wanted to do all the jobs. I hung out with every employee in every position and learned how to do their job so I could help. But I let my own responsibilities suffer. I forgot to do tasks that were assigned to me. When that location closed, I was not offered a job at the nearby location and laid off. I went on to work at a Panera Bread. I was a cashier that eventually become a trainer and I did well at making sure orders were done quickly. I accomplished this by learning how to do the prep work, how to make the sandwiches and how to consolidate the orders. It was rather simple work and it lost its appeal quickly. After a year, I left to go do something else. I got a job as overnight security. I worked at Furniture Row and they kept having issues of tires being stolen off the semi-trucks at night. I was hired to sit and watch the yard at night when nobody else was there and call 911 if something happened. So I sat and would watch movies on my laptop or attempt to read a book or even just nap. I absolutely love reading and while I can read words quickly, I have to go back and read things multiple times because my mind starts to wander and I am reading while not comprehending a single thing. I am just looking at the words. During this time I decided to return to college and try again. So I went back and took an EMT course which all fire departments in my state require for hiring and I passed it. I began working as an EMT at a local private ambulance company doing inter-facility transports. I thought that was fun and decided my new focus would be on becoming a paramedic. So I remained in school going through a program where you spend another 1.5 years getting prepared for paramedic school and then you would automatically be accepted into local paramedic school. I switched from one private company to another private company that responded to 911 calls with the city fire department and they basically did all the medical stuff and then you transported the patient in the ambulance since they didn't have their own. I was still doing the prep program in school and we had internships that we had to do where we had to spend 150 hours with an agency and help the paramedics to get prepared for paramedic school. After one 24 hour shift, I stopped going to that internship and failed the class. I also began dating another girl at that time. This relationship lasted a little longer but I got bored of it and just stopped talking to her and I feel terrible about it to this day. She was finishing up school to become a teacher when we started dating at a city about an hour north of me. She finished and moved to my city and started working as a teacher where she knew nobody and I just stopped answering her calls and texting her because I was bored of the relationship. That is such an awful thing I did. I applied to a different paramedic school and got in! I passed paramedic school and became a paramedic and got hired by the hospital that ran that school. I am now a paramedic covering 911 calls for a major city and I am in charge of everything medical and the fire department in that city shows up just to help me. It is a highly sought after place to be a paramedic because of it's reputation. I started going back to school part-time, this time, majoring in a B.S. of Biochemistry. First semester I took Biology I and trigonometry. I know a lot of the bio I coursework from my time in paramedic school and took trig in high school so I got As. The next semester I took Biology II and a general writing class that I failed twice at the aforementioned community college. I had zero interest in the subject of taxonomy and the other stuff in Bio II but I managed to get a B. I was determined this time I would do well in all my classes while getting a bachelor's degree and there would be no more excuses. In my writing class we got assigned our first essay and I went home and started working on it that day. I was not going to procrastinate anymore! I got about halfway through and stopped. I finished it one session later, which was the day before it was due. I wrote all my essays for that class the day before it was due. But I got an A! This semester I am taking Calculus I and public speaking. I took calculus in high school and I always enjoyed math so this should be straightforward right? Wrong. Here I am writing this after spending all day watching Netflix, Twitch streams, youtube videos and even going for a bicycle ride. Meanwhile I have a quiz due for that class tonight online and I am missing half of the assignments. I can not muster up the motivation to do the work.  


I am currently a 27 year old male working full-time as a paramedic and going to school part-time about to start failing classes which is a trend for me. I no longer get any excitement from running 911 calls of people being shot, stabbed and dying. I am bored of one of the most exciting things I could be doing. I live in a shitty two bedroom unit that is part of a fourplex. It had these awful like stone tiles on top of concrete and I decided I was going to fix this place up. 3 years ago I started doing that. I bought a demolition hammer and tore up about 40% of the tiles before giving up. I decided I would just put laminate flooring on top of the tiles. I have done two bedrooms and have given up. Mind you, this is a very small place. VERY SMALL. I decided to remodel my kitchen and had everything torn out and lived out of a fridge and microwave for a year. I recently put in like 4 base cabinets, a sink and a stove but I am still missing most of the kitchen and I stopped again. I have a hard time keeping anything clean and I have important papers in numerous parts of my house even though I own a filing cabinet and it is right next to me. There is a folder in there labeled W2s yet on my desk in front of me are 3 of my old W2s from something I was doing a few weeks ago and I never put them back. To get some excitement in my life I decided to take up snowboarding and bought an annual pass and all the gear. I spent over $2000 on all that. It lasted one winter and I haven't gone again. I decided to buy a motorcycle even after I have pronounced numerous people as dead in the middle of the street from motorcycle accidents. I spent months riding that thing and now I ride it about once every 2 weeks. I bought a gun and was going to the range every week. It just sits in a case and hasn't seen light in a long time. I bought a bicycle and would go riding everyday. Winter hit and then when spring came I never got on it again until summer. I am trying to do good about sticking with this and still manage to go a few times a week. I haven't been in a relationship because I get anxious trying to talk to women and feel I am not good enough. There really is no room for advancement at my current career and at this point I am not sure I will finish my bachelor's degree. I wanted to go to medical school and become a doctor but there is no way I can focus and succeed with that, let alone get in if I can't get a degree. So I have decided that tomorrow on Monday, I will finally set up my PCP after working at this hospital for 3 years and get an appointment so I can be referred to a psychiatrist for help. So here I am, bouncing my legs up and down on the floor as I always do and have always done, sharing my story and my decision to finally get help!  


I know this is a long story but I felt like I would be more motivated to follow through tomorrow if I actually shared it. If you read the entire thing, thanks for listening. Goodbye!"

I've also not received responses from recruiters who similarly in Spring asked me to reach out later, or been told their requirements have changed (which I guess is normal?) or in one instance that they received 1500 applications for entry level role and would get back to me.

Throwaway account here. 

I’m not sure how to feel. I’ve made a post about the situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j4gncd/my_dad_started_a_political_arguement_last_night/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and tensions since then were somewhat remedied but still pretty heavy. 

TLDR: my father started an argument two days ago about politics and then I thought that I was forced to couch surf for a while. 

In that argument, he made a few personal attacks at my character and was the first one to start screaming at me. I had never raised my voice at him back before. 

Afterwards, I left the house and stayed at a friend’s. The next morning my mom had arranged for me to stay at a family friends’ house but then told me to come home that night while my dad was sleeping. 

So today I decided to take the money that I actually earned from 2020 (I’m a student) to create an account that’s only in my name. Prior to this I’ve had a joint account with my parents. 

My dad came into the room and here’s the condensed version of what happened:

* He acknowledged that I never raised my voice at him like that before. 
* I told him that I was yelling because he was yelling. 
* He told me that he didn’t think he was yelling. 
* He told me to point it out if he yells. 
* I told him that that’s exactly what I did but he didn’t listen. 
* He ignored that. 
* He called me disrespectful for me raising my voice, although he was screaming at me first (and I did apologize for that). 
* I pointed out that he thinks it would be okay if he yelled at me but that I’m not allowed to yell back. 
* He said that he didn’t think he was yelling and ignored me. 
* He said that if I can’t be respectful that I should move out, that’s when I told him that I’m moving my money from our joint account and leaving the money he gave me. 
* He told me he’ll take back his money if I don’t want it, then I said that if he thinks that he can scream at me because I’m financially dependent and in his custody, then I don’t want his money. 
* He said I’m his subordinate (he’s a military guy). 
* He said that he’s 55 and I’m 19 and he knows what he’s talking about. 
* I pointed out that he was saying that he was right and I’m automatically wrong and asked why he would start an argument with me. 
* He said he didn’t say that. 

The only thing that I got out of the conversation was a lecture of what to do if he “gets heated” again. 
He didn’t apologize for attacking my character. 
He kept reminding me that I’m his subordinate and that we’ll never be equals. 
He kept reminding me how much he did for me growing up and how he wants to protect me - which is the excuse he’s using to be able to scream at me.  

I told my mom afterwards that I don’t want to touch any of the money that he gave me if I can help it and that I’ll be moved out by this summer at the latest and hopefully permanently. I don’t want to accept money or housing from someone who will hold that against me when I protest to being screamed at and verbally attacked. 

Things are really tense right now. He told me that he’s willing to pay for everything but only as long as I just take it when he screams at me. It isn’t too frequent of an occurrence, but frequent enough to get to me. 

I have a little over $3000 to my name and everything else was given to me, including my car. I’m taking 18 credit hours and my part time is only $9 an hour internship. I don’t know what to do. I have housing plans for the summer on, but I don’t know if I can take it emotionally if I stay in the the house until then or financially if I move out immediately.

Are there any people that could give me guidance? Are there any other parents who give me some advice? What was your journey in becoming financially independent? Is there any money or tax advice that I absolutely need to know in creating an account?"

I'm technically a junior in college, but I figured out a way to graduate a year and a half early :) so I'll be finishing up with my bachelor's in accounting in December. I've never been anywhere by myself, so I thought I finally could now that I'm graduating college. I was able to move out for college after my first semester of commuting from home thanks to my dad. I did come back in March tho and have been here since. My dad randomly told my mom today that I would be going to NYC during Thanksgiving break as my ""grad trip,"" and she was shocked. She started yelling and throwing a tantrum.

FYI, I won't be able to get a job just yet because the job I want requires you to have a 150 college credits. I only have 120 with my bachelor's so I will be enrolling in a. master's of accounting program in August. In the mean time, I will be studying for the CPA exams.  I will also be doing an internship with a Big 4 firm in January, which usually guarantees full time employment as well. I would be starting after I graduate from my master's program in August 2022.

She brought up how

0) I haven't actually graduated yet and that I may not if I dont pass my classes, so I shouldnt be thinking of a grad trip just yet. My counselor confirmed that I'm on track to graduate. Although online classes are kicking my butt, I think I'll be able to pass them just fine :)

1. she's never been on a solo trip or even a romantic trip with my dad, so it's selfish of me to want to go on a trip by myself. I'm like, I never stopped you?
2. We ARE in the middle of a pandemic, however inter-country travel is allowed, and someone like me is not at risk of dying from covid. I'm a healthy 20 year old female, and I will be wearing a mask whenever I go out to prevent any potential infections. I also plan to get tested before coming home. She wants me to stay in a hotel for a few days until I'm in the clear for not having Covid, which I'm also okay with.
3. She wants to come with me. She said that I can't control what she does and where she goes, so she'll come to NYC two days after I leave California. I said that I'm not ok with this, and it's not a solo trip if she comes with me.
4. she said that she under no circumstances wants to get COVID from me. I responded that if she was so concerned about getting COVID, she wouldn't want to tag along on my trip or plan to go to India to see her parents this winter.
5. she mentioned how I don't pay bills at home, which is valid. My parents are well off though, and don't need my help. and I actually tried giving my dad $200 once but he just ended up depositing it in a bank account he opened for me as a kid for college funds. however, i do acknowledge that i should start contributing to the family in some day if I actually want to be looked at as an adult.
6. she said that if I go to NYC in the Thanksgiving, she, my dad, and my sister will go somewhere without me. I was like ok LOL go ahead idc
7. another somewhat valid point she brought up is that as a Californian, I won't be able to handle the NYC weather. i'm like im going for 3 days and it's not like I'm going to Siberia in the middle of nowhere. I think i'll be fine :)
8. she mentioned that from now on I will be paying my own portion for family trips or I won't be going. also fine by me LOL

Tl;dr she tried a lot of manipulation and guilt-tripping but looks like I won this fight and will be going on a grad trip either during Thanksgiving or winter break. I won't give in to her manipulation. It's time for me to live my life and do what I want without being scared of her. :))"

I am hoping to immigrate to Europe with my Wife, from the USA. Currently the places we are looking at are Norway or the Netherlands, but I am open minded to other places in Europe. It wouldn't be for a few more years (3-5), so I have time to get things in order, sell my home, etc. I am currently an Electronics Technician in the Navy, and intend to use my GI Bill to cover a masters degree in Machine Learning/AI &amp; Robotics. I hold a few IT certificates (A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA), and will have a US Journeyman Licenses as an Electronics Technician (6 years of work). I am finishing my first bachelors in History, and a second bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I know that the tuition in these countries are either low, or free, but the GI Bill also allots about  $20,000 in housing payments, which will cover my housing and food expenses (in addition to 20-ish hours of work per week). I'm still in the process of reviewing the government structures, immigration policies, economic standings, etc, so I haven't fully made up my mind on where to go yet. I also am hoping that completing a masters in the country of choice will help the transition from student visa to work visa, and assist with cultural adoption to the country. 

&amp;nbsp;


I do have some questions and concerns though. My wife is a type 1 diabetic and has celiacs, so I want to be sure that we have everything in place to handle this issue through schooling and afterwards. Also, my grades have not been the strongest due to untreated ADHD (now treated). I am studying through Calc 4 (Diff Eq) and beyond, since strong math skills are essential with my field of interest, but I don't know if there is a European equivalent to GREs or application essays where I can show my strengths to overcome my weaknesses.  I'm also generally unfamiliar with the internship concepts of these countries. Any advice would be appreciated, and anything I can do to help myself stand out as a model immigrant would be greatly appreciated."

My question is that after I work an internship for 8 or 12 months, will my GPA really matter at all? As in, will companies just look at my work experience rather than my grades when I apply for jobs after I graduate?"
j5fq8q,9,2020-10-05,I need advice,edward_ray97,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/j5fq8q/i_need_advice/,"This post is all over the place so my apologies in advance.  Im just typing what is on my mind at the momement.

Honestly, I can't do this anymore. Im so overwhelmed with coursework while trying to prepare for assessments/technicals. I feel like a failure. Im about to graduate with a cse degree and I dont have any internship experience nor a job lined up. I sit on my ass the whole day trying to do leetcode problems but I just cant. I recently started to get a bit better at lc easy problems but its kind of late. I failed Amazon assessment for an internship my 3rd year of college which I look back at it now and I think to myself ""wow I could do those questions now, im stupid"". I failed google phone interviews 2 times last year for a summer/fall position. I failed coinbase for fulltime, salesforce for internship and about to fail amazon online assessment part 2. I am a disgrace to computer science. I really want to learn and i've put in lots of hours but im a slow learner. With every year passing by its just going to become more and more difficult to obtain a job. Even if i somehow am able to pass part 2 for amazon there is still part 3 and then another 2-3 virtual interviews correct?

&amp;#x200B;

Have you guys read ""Elements of Programming Interviews c++"" and would you recommend it? I currently use algoexpert which after 1 year of ownership am able to go through the easy/some medium questions.  Basically it took me about 8 months to be able to do some easy leetcode problems on my own and some algoexpert problems. I have also used interview cake which helped a bit in understanding ds/algorithms."

Whether I can get a job in that field, let alone in the UK, is anybody's guess. How hard is getting sponsored versus finding an ordinary job in your own country in a particular field? Programmers of all types are, I think, on the shortage list."

Most of the job/ internship ads. says CS or related field, which one from these two fits into related field category?"

j5iilb,2,2020-10-05,Careers for someone who enjoys reasoning / constructing coherent arguments?,jotdwaetda,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/j5iilb/careers_for_someone_who_enjoys_reasoning/,"I'm a senior studying CompSci at a pretty prestigious university (lower tier Ivy League) and have been applying to software-related jobs for the past few weeks. I have had two internships in software engineering roles in the past two summers, and these experiences combined with my (slowly developed) absolute distaste for CS has made me dread starting my career. As for why I'm still applying to such jobs despite this awareness - I have not had experience in other fields that I've become increasingly curious about (both internship and club activities), I did not take advantage of my university experience to develop an extensive network, and thus a job offer in software is the only thing I can imagine myself feasibly attaining given my current resume / background and what has become of the job market recently due to the coronavirus. 

My idea of a great career is one in which my natural talents allow me to excel in; as far as enjoying my work goes, I tend to like things that I'm good at and can feel myself contributing significantly to, so I don't feel the need or urge to chase a career that is in line with my hobbies. This doesn't mean that I'm looking for a job that will require no effort on my part to become successful in, but rather one that I have some underlying talent for which will allow me to be excel provided that I work hard. 

Although I am cautious about evaluating my own strengths, I would say that my main strength lies in being able to articulate my thoughts relatively well regardless of medium - face-to-face, text, formal writing, etc. I not only enjoy writing papers where I have to construct an argument or propose a suggestion, but have also found that my ideas are fairly well-received / are able to make the intended impact. Apart from this, I'm also quite interested in the behavioral tendencies of humans (I do realize that this is a very broad topic) and am somewhat artistically inclined.  

The self evaluation above has been why I have been looking at leveraging my CS background and visual interests to explore the field of User Experience, but I didn't want to pigeonhole myself into thinking about just one potential career and would very much welcome any input from others on what types of jobs may suit me given the information I've provided about myself. Thank you so much to any commenters in advance."

j5jgho,3,2020-10-05,The startup I interned at asked me to join back if I'm available. I'm available till next year. Should I rejoin? What terms should I put forward and agree to?,Motor-Expression,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j5jgho/the_startup_i_interned_at_asked_me_to_join_back/,"So I interned at this early stage startup in the summer for 4 months as a full stack developer, worked in their core services and have made good connections with them. I've gotten a job + internship offer since then at another company with a much better pay. 

The company I interned at asked me to rejoin them till I join the newer company as they need a hand at their core services. The startup has also increased its internship pay by 30% for new interns. However my newer offer at the other company pays me more as an intern than double than what the startup did. 


And here are some conditions I've set in my head:

1. I'll ask for a raise (not sure about how much, but definitely higher than the newer interns they are hiring) 
2. I'll not be an intern but rather a part-time contract based developer. 
3. I'll have some sort of early exit agreement. 

I am not in dire need of extra money right now, although I can use it to pay for some of the things I wanted to buy. 

Given that I believe I've a lot to bring to the table than the newer interns, especially given the fact that I've more experience in building their systems and have prior experience. And considering that I also have a much better offer at hand starting next year. 

Should I rejoin the startup for the remaining months? If yes, how much of a pay raise should I ask for and also what conditions/agreements would you recommend?"

Hello my beloved Redditors,

I have a problem at my work and am not sure if it is worth it anymore. I am reaching out to you because I seek a professional opinion, I am new to this and would like some help deciding the best path to take.

Background:

I am a civil engineer. I work at a transportation engineering consulting company and I design intersections, like traffic lights, stop signs, and the striping/lines on the asphalt (I did work a salary position, guaranteed pay, 40hrs/week). I have finished my undergrad at an accredited university, 4-year engineering program. I have taken and passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam. Currently I am on my first semester of a 2-year master’s program for civil engineering with an emphasis in transportation. The company I am working for is in California, where I came from. Then COVID happened, and we started working remotely. I applied and successfully got into that university master’s program in New York. I talked with my company and they agreed I could continue working remotley, now as a part-time employee (20hr/week max). They say I will only get paid for the projects I have worked on.

My goal, to further my engineering career by:

Gaining experience working as an engineer. To finish my master’s program. And to eventually have all the requirements to pass the New York Professional Engineering (PE) Exam.

The NY PE requirements:

I found the website that administers the test and licensure. I called them up and asked what was needed: Graduate a 4-year engineering accredited program (Got it!). Pass the FE exam (Got it!). and have 4 years of engineering experience (Working on it)

What Experience I have so far:

During my undergraduate program, I was able to work as an engineering intern for 4.5 years in total, at 2 different city Public Works agencies. I know internships during my undergrad does not count towards my PE experience, although it is still great resume material.

Then I have been at my current Transportation engineering consulting company for a little over a year now. I worked as full-time for 1 year and now part-time for a little more than a month. So, I got 1 out of 4 years in the bag.

When I was talking with the NY PE licensing representative – I asked about my master’s program. Once I complete it, it will count as another year of experience. That will be 2 out of 4 years (once completed).

Also, while speaking with them, I asked about how part-time counts towards experience. They said it would count, but not fully. They would have to put it into a confidential formula to figure out what it is equivalent to.

The problem:

At my current company, there is like no work to do. While I was working salary, I would just be sitting at my desk not doing to much of anything. A project would come around maybe once every 2 weeks average. And I would work on it for a full day, also average (sometimes less than a day, sometimes 2 days). When talking to my company about moving to New York and going full-time to part-time, they said they would not give me aything time pressing! Like needed urgently, as I am not checked into work 5 days a week, 40hr weeks. It is hard to give an average of working ‘a little over a month’ for how often I get work, but it seems like even less now.

When I was salary, I was told by my supervisor to find bogus projects to charge my time on. When there was nothing to do but I was guaranteed pay, I would just throw my work hours onto whatever project had the extra budget – my supervisor knows this and would approve of my time sheet. So, when switching to part-time, I did the same thing, no work, still charge my time (now 20hrs/week) to any ol’ project that had the budget. It would still get approved by my supervisor even though he knows he is not giving my anything to work on.

Now! This has just changed. I tried submitting my time sheet and for the first time my supervisor did not let me charge to projects. So, I submitted what I actually worked on, 8hrs for my bi-weekly time sheet instead of the regular 40hrs (when I was salary, my biweekly time sheet would be 80hrs).

My concern:

I could find a local engineering internship, not what I am doing now working for a company in California, from New York. I do not have to deal with my disliked company.

What should I get familiar with to be an average/bellow average Linux sysadmin ? Which might lead me to get let's say, a half decent job, or be experienced to the point I can do some free lancing


I can probably learn whatever it takes, I'm just not sure **what** I have to learn, I'm used to managing services and some light normal-user troubleshooting, but never had to manage a network of servers or anything like this before


I also have questions like do I need to have a degree to get a job in the field ? I'm not looking for anything fancy, just some entry point job that get me some money so I can afford some Comptia certificates as well as getting a better life


Are there any courses/books do you recommend ? I thought about at least studying for Linux+ without booking the exam, as my financial situation won't help in that at the moment 


Is there any chance to get some entry remote job /internship, as there is no much attention to people who doesn't have degrees in the field where I live


And if you can give any additional info, it would very much appreciated  


Thanks in advance"

Hello my beloved Redditors,

I have a problem at my work and am not sure if it is worth it anymore. I am reaching out to you because I seek a professional opinion, I am new to this and would like some help deciding the best path to take.

Background:

I am a civil engineer. I work at a transportation engineering consulting company and I design intersections, like traffic lights, stop signs, and the striping/lines on the asphalt (I did work a salary position, guaranteed pay, 40hrs/week). I have finished my undergrad at an accredited university, 4-year engineering program. I have taken and passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam. Currently I am on my first semester of a 2-year master’s program for civil engineering with an emphasis in transportation. The company I am working for is in California, where I came from. Then COVID happened, and we started working remotely. I applied and successfully got into that university master’s program in New York. I talked with my company and they agreed I could continue working remotley, now as a part-time employee (20hr/week max). They say I will only get paid for the projects I have worked on.

My goal, to further my engineering career by:

Gaining experience working as an engineer. To finish my master’s program. And to eventually have all the requirements to pass the New York Professional Engineering (PE) Exam.

The NY PE requirements:

I found the website that administers the test and licensure. I called them up and asked what was needed: Graduate a 4-year engineering accredited program (Got it!). Pass the FE exam (Got it!). and have 4 years of engineering experience (Working on it)

What Experience I have so far:

During my undergraduate program, I was able to work as an engineering intern for 4.5 years in total, at 2 different city Public Works agencies. I know internships during my undergrad does not count towards my PE experience, although it is still great resume material.

Then I have been at my current Transportation engineering consulting company for a little over a year now. I worked as full-time for 1 year and now part-time for a little more than a month. So, I got 1 out of 4 years in the bag.

When I was talking with the NY PE licensing representative – I asked about my master’s program. Once I complete it, it will count as another year of experience. That will be 2 out of 4 years (once completed).

Also, while speaking with them, I asked about how part-time counts towards experience. They said it would count, but not fully. They would have to put it into a confidential formula to figure out what it is equivalent to.

The problem:

At my current company, there is like no work to do. While I was working salary, I would just be sitting at my desk not doing to much of anything. A project would come around maybe once every 2 weeks average. And I would work on it for a full day, also average (sometimes less than a day, sometimes 2 days). When talking to my company about moving to New York and going full-time to part-time, they said they would not give me aything time pressing! Like needed urgently, as I am not checked into work 5 days a week, 40hr weeks. It is hard to give an average of working ‘a little over a month’ for how often I get work, but it seems like even less now.

When I was salary, I was told by my supervisor to find bogus projects to charge my time on. When there was nothing to do but I was guaranteed pay, I would just throw my work hours onto whatever project had the extra budget – my supervisor knows this and would approve of my time sheet. So, when switching to part-time, I did the same thing, no work, still charge my time (now 20hrs/week) to any ol’ project that had the budget. It would still get approved by my supervisor even though he knows he is not giving my anything to work on.

Now! This has just changed. I tried submitting my time sheet and for the first time my supervisor did not let me charge to projects. So, I submitted what I actually worked on, 8hrs for my bi-weekly time sheet instead of the regular 40hrs (when I was salary, my biweekly time sheet would be 80hrs).

My concern:

I am getting student loans, so money right now is not really an issue for me, and with super minimal pay coming from my job what is the point? I am getting “experience” from my master’s program. The part-time experience from my work doesn’t even count fully. I still have a ways to go before I have all the 4 years’ experience requirements to take the PE. I never really liked working for the company, not that good, I do not like working with my supervisor or anyone else at that company.

Now I want to start afresh on my own, but I'm lost where to start or even what to choose. I am an outgoing person, I like jobs that make me interact with people regularly, so which do you think is better to go into, web or software development?

Side note: I also just finished my 3-month internship as a manual software tester and I was using DevOps to perform the testing and I quite enjoyed the experience. -in case it would make a difference to the answer.

But I do not own a working permit for Germany.   


With that in mind how hard would you guys say that will be for me to land a job in Germany. Do you have any past experiences and how hard is for companies to ""issue"" a guarantee for me to apply for a working visa (I know that is one way to get a working visa faster). Also, someone told me that if I apply as a student the chances to get in a company are greater because they lack of student internship programs.

  
I would love to hear your thoughts!

I’m a 24 year old male.

A little (lot of) backstory, of course. I met my ex-fiancée, “Allie,” we’ll call her, in eighth grade. We had homeroom together, since our last names are both towards the end of the alphabet. We kind of “were a couple,” but never kissed or even held hands. We “broke up” towards the end of the year, but again, looking back I don’t really count this as having actually dated. 

We went to different high schools (I stayed in private school, and her parents transferred her to the local high school one town over where she lived). In 10th grade, we reconnected via text through a mutual friend (my best friend was dating a girl who knew her from childhood, and she recognized me from Allie mentioning me in the past). We texted a bit for a month or so, nothing serious. She said that she’d never stopped liking me after middle school, etc. I didn’t have my driver’s license yet, and her parents didn’t want her dating, so I basically ghosted her since I didn’t think it could ever work, and I didn’t have the heart to “break up” with her again.  

As the years went by, I would always text her “Happy Birthday” on her birthday, and she’d text back asking how I was, what I was up to, etc., but I’d never respond. She became really successful at school, doing college courses in high school, and ended up graduating with two degrees in less than four years. Junior year of college, I actually responded when she asked me how I was doing after my annual birthday text. We texted non-stop for about a month or so, but at around Christmas time of that year (her birthday is mid-November) she stopped responding. She’d text me every couple of months, apologize for being too busy to talk, etc., but we didn’t really connect again until just before that next Christmas, in our senior year of college. We were friends on Facebook since the summer after 8th grade, so we were relatively up to date on each other’s lives. Of course, I also watched her go from 8th grade girl with acne and braces to a stunningly gorgeous college student. For this time (the year after we re-connected via text in our junior year of college), and the year before/after, I would talk about her with my friends if I’d been drinking, and refer to her as the “one that got away.” 

Fast forward to senior year of college. She was at a university about two hours north of where we grew up, and I lived at home and went to college one town over. She started texting me in the beginning of December, and we’d text non-stop, back and forth for hours, every day. This went on through the holiday, and we talked on the phone while she drove back to school at the end of Christmas break. This was the first time we’d heard each other’s voices since the last day of 8th grade, almost ten years earlier. After this, we started talked every night, usually for 4-6 hours at least. We’d chat, watch synced up TV episodes on speakerphone, etc. I found out that right before she’d started texting me again, she’d been broken up with by her boyfriend of over a year. He’d left in the middle of the night and cut off all contact with her. Of course, I worried about the whole rebound thing, or that she just wanted a “friend” in her time of need, but I was too head over heels at this point to care, or at least to not risk it.

In late January, after much prodding from her, I finally agreed to drive up to her school and spend a Friday afternoon/Saturday with her. This trip, and subsequent trips, became a romantic relationship about a month later. She had a hard time at first, still getting over her ex, but we eventually began dating officially in late February. She had had several serious boyfriends in late high school/college. Her first time was with her boyfriend senior year of high school. She then dated a guy she met on the first day of class in college, and then after him she dated the guy who left in the middle of the night. I mention this because I hadn’t really dated at all. I’d had one sort-of girlfriend in my early college days, but we only go to third base. I’d only even made out with one other girl before Allie. So, needless to say at this point, she was my first everything. Lover, “love,” etc. So, she had me really out-gunned as far as relationship experience. 

By March, she’s already told me that she wants to marry me and be with me forever. We kept coming back to each other, I was always in the back of her mind, etc., and we were meant to be. Now, normally this would throw up huge red flags for anyone. Not me. I was so infatuated with this girl, I barely flinched. I never would’ve said that stuff myself, but I never once said “too fast” or anything to make her think I thought otherwise. I also agreed to move across the country with her for her graduate program. This will be a HUGE deal later on. Basically, she’d always wanted to go to this school across the country, and told me right when we started dating that we shouldn’t be together unless I was willing to move there with her a year and a half later (fall semester of the year after she graduated, and took two semesters off) As I would later put it in arguments: “If you’d been into one-armed guys, I would’ve cut my arm off.” So, being hopelessly in love, I told her I’d move there the next fall. 

The first six months go by, with the biggest obstacle being our families. My parents were fine, other than thinking (correctly) that we were moving too fast. Her parents were something else. They didn’t even meet me until June (we started dating in February), because they remembered me as the boy who broke up with her/ghosted her twice, and they had really loved “Daniel,” the guy before me who left, and thought that Allie had moved on too quickly from him. (They had also been discussing marriage and all that). 

So, come August/September, she’s really pushing me to propose. Again, the blame is partially on me because I never discouraged this sort of talk, and she took my lack of objection as reciprocation. A big reason behind the early engagement was so that we would be engaged/settled by the time we needed to move across the country together. Now, I loved this girl, a lot. I could definitely see myself marrying her, but just not that soon. Also, I was a big proponent of the proposal being a big surprise, like in tradition/the movies, and she wanted it staged (photographer to capture the moment, her wearing the right dress, etc.) She eventually wore me down, and I bought the ring in early November, barely nine months after we’d officially started dating. I took her dad out to a nice lunch, and got his blessing. In hindsight, he spent more of the lunch asking how okay I was with this, and how sure I was, as opposed to the usual “you better take care of my daughter” stuff, with him of course knowing how she could be. 

I planned everything out – a road trip to somewhere she loved, stopping along the way at one of her favorite childhood places, where I would pop the question. Trip was booked, plane tickets and car rental were paid for, everything.

Then it fell apart. My dad offered me a job at his company. Six figure salary even though I had no experience whatsoever in the field other than a six month internship when I was a freshman in college. Allie and I could both tell he was doing it to keep me from proposing/move away. That being said, I still couldn’t resist. My dream had always been to work as an executive as my family’s company, and one day run it. Here was my chance. All I had to do was tell the girl I loved that I couldn’t move away with her (which meant 3+ years apart) and therefore likely end up broken up, and definitely not engaged. She’d applied and had already been accepted/committed to the far-away school, so she was now going regardless. 

After thinking about it for a couple of days, I took the job. She hated me, her parents hated me, and I kind of hated me. We didn’t break up, but we didn’t get engaged (her parents also made it clear I no longer had their blessing). My dad ended up not being able to hire me at his company. Long story short, he realized it just wasn’t right to give me the same job as guys with relevant degrees and years of experience. He was right of course, but it still sucked. 

Allie and I patched things up, and her parents got over it in time as well. Things went on normally for a while, but our relationship didn’t really get better. She was controlling, and wanted to spend every moment together. I was more go-with-the-flow and liked dividing my time up more between friends and family, as well as her.

August of that year comes around. It’s been 9 months since the whole not-moving thing, and the time came for her to move away. We’d already set rules for long distance. I would fly out once a month, maybe twice if I could afford it/get the time off of work. She left, and I enjoyed it for maybe a week. After having someone over my shoulder all of the time, I could stay up, eat pizza, play video games, and get drunk every day for the first time in almost two years. After about a week, I really started to miss her. By the time I flew up to see her for the first time, I was dying to be with her, and couldn’t concentrate on anything because I missed her so much. I decided that I would propose, for real this time.

In November, while she was home for Thanksgiving, I proposed, and she said yes. Everyone was happy except my parents, who thought Allie was delightful, just not the right fit for me (the controlling stuff). I told them they needed to get on board, and to their credit, they did, and everything was fine. For a while. We continued long-distance for the next 4 months, but I agreed to make plans to move across to the country to be with her.

We ended up living together for this first time due to COVID. Her campus closed, so she came home. Up until this point, her parents had refused to allow her to even spend the night with me, other than half a dozen crazy circumstances nights, because they didn’t approve of non-married couples living together/spending the night together. Her (now 24, but already 22 when we started dating) allowing her parents to control her like that was a longtime bone of contention between us. Anyway, since I worked at an “essential” business, and would be exposed to COVID, her parents allowed her to finally move into my apartment, so she wouldn’t expose them after seeing me. Soon after she moved in, we leased an apartment in the city where her school was, with a move-in date of September 1st, 2020. Over the next couple of months, our relationship went downhill. After months of relative freedom 3 weeks out of the month, she was now around 24/7 to be upset about how I would rather spend time with my friends playing golf than with my fiancée. Side note, she didn’t have any close relationships other than her parents and me, so if was busy, she’d basically do nothing except school work and watch TV. What I saw as controlling-ness, she saw as me not wanting to spend time with her. I still agree that she wasn’t necessarily wrong, but I just wasn’t a good fit for her. For example, her parents were both that way (only ever spent time with each other, and neither had any real friends). 

This downhill motion continued until about a week before we were due to move away. I had a job lined up to start in early July, and we would stay in her apartment until our joint-apartment was ready on 9/1. A week before we moved, we had a three hour fight, and I ended up driving her to a park, where we talked for several more hours about the state of our relationship. I told her that I didn’t like where we were, but that we were basically stuck together for the time being. We’d signed a lease, paid thousands of dollars in fees/deposits, I had a job lined up, and I’d already given notice/been replaced at my current job here at home. Not to mention we were two and half years into a relationship, and were engaged. However, I said, I would only do this for one more year. About a year from now (the time of the argument) we would be asked to renew our lease on the apartment, and if we hadn’t improved, I was going to leave and return home. I can’t stress enough that I still loved her at this point, and I wasn’t rooting for us to fail. 

We move to the city. We’ll call it “New York.” Before moving, I sold my car, sub-leased my apartment, and sold all of my furniture, intending on being in NY for 3 years, minimum. 

I ended up spending just over 2 months in NY before calling it quits. We had numerous relationship issues, almost all due to lack of communication. Also, I absolutely hated my job, and living there. Looking back, I think I reflected by dislike of my job/living situation onto my fiancée, but our relationship certainly had issues we carried on from back home. Some things were a result of us seriously living together 24/7 with no friends or family around to break up with time. NY was still in mostly-lockdown due to the pandemic, so even other activities outdoors were limited.

Now comes the part that I really feel like a piece of shit about. 

For years, at my job back home, I worked with this girl who we’ll call “Rachel.” Rachel started a year after me and my best friend got jobs at this large company. By the time she started, I was an department supervisor, but my friend was still at the entry-level spot, so they spent a lot more time together than I did with her. We both thought she was really cool, and super cute, though I didn’t tell him I also felt this way. Long story short, he asked her out, and they dated for about a year and a half, breaking up right before Allie and I got together. 

Now, while they were together, I kept to the bro-code and threw all of those thoughts about her being beautiful and awesome out the window. I didn’t even accept her friend request on Facebook. Over time, my best friend eventually left the company to get a job in his college field, and Rachel worked her way up the ladder at the company, same as I did. By the time Allie and I were engaged, I was an area manager, running 4 different departments, and Rachel was one of my department managers, reporting to me along with her 3 co-workers/fellow managers. This meant that she and I worked side-by-side all of the time, including late nights with just the two of us. In the six months or so before I left for NY, I really started to have conflicted feelings about Rachel. I loved my fiancée, but Rachel just seemed to be everything she was, and more. Basically all of the good stuff (looks, funny, same interests, etc) but without the controlling-ness or other problems. As my best friend’s long-time girlfriend, she’d also seen me wasted and basically had seen my at my worst, and still thought it was fun to be around me. I chalked it up as a work-place crush, or a “grass is always greener” type thing. I was also afraid that if I ever did pursue it, I’d lose my best friend (who by this point I’d asked to be the best man at my future wedding to Allie). He’d taken it really hard when Rachel and him had broken up (she left him, he tried to get her back numerous times, and made a fool out of himself in front of a lot of people at one of the attempts). Nothing ever happened between us during this time, not even a hug or an alcohol-induced close call. I was really careful to hide how I felt, with a few slip-ups here and there after drinking, but for the most part, she never knew. She dated a couple of guys after my friend, which bothered me more than I like to admit, especially when one of them was a guy from work (another branch of the company), who I was sort of friends with.

On my last day at the office, after my goodbye cake and all of that, Rachel helped me carry some stuff out to my car. I came within a breath of telling her how I felt, but fear that she wouldn’t feel the same way and shame about the fact that I was already engaged made me just wish her the best and drive away. It was 4 years almost to the day when I left from the day she started at the company. 

So, back to the day I broke up with my fiancée, two months after moving to “NY.” My parents were visiting, and we were basically bar hopping, just catching up. Allie, feeling ill, and sick of my ignoring her for hours while I goofed around with my dad, went home, leaving me alone with my parents. I proceeded to get pretty wasted, and decided it was a good time to text Rachel, who had asked me a work-related question several hours earlier. I had alluded to having feelings for her in the past while drunk at work parties and stuff. Never anything embarrassing, but starting to say stuff and then catching myself, and other suspicious stuff. 

So I basically told her I regretted never having the courage to ask her out or tell her how I felt, and that her current boyfriend (the guy who I knew from work) was a great guy, and I didn’t want to mess that up, and sorry for putting her in this position, blah blah blah. She was shocked of course, and could tell I was wasted, and told me we’d talk about it in the morning if I didn’t regret it. 

I went home shortly after, and had the worst fight yet with my fiancée, over how I abandoned her, didn’t come home to check on her, drank when she wasn’t there, etc. I was throwing up in the toilet at this point, as she stood over me and yelled at the top of her lungs. After collecting myself a bit, I told her it was over, and I left. I spent the night on my parents’ couch (they rented a condo for the weekend). 

The next morning, I told my parents we were broken up, and that I was going home. My parents asked me a hundred times if I was sure, because if I had better be if I was going to do this. I said I was. Rachel texted me, saying that a phone call was definitely in order. I agreed, and went to my office to put in my two week notice, and tell my boss I was going back to my home state. I told Allie that I would be by later that day to get my stuff (just suitcases of clothes). I remember feeling relieved at this point. Allie and I had almost broken up many times, and I was glad that it was finally over. I sat on a park bench for several hours waiting for Rachel to be on lunch so we could talk, just thinking about how much my immediate life/future had changed in the last 12 hours.

Rachel called me, and I spent an hour relating everything. She said it was a lot to think about and that she’d let me know once she’d had time to take it all in.

I went to Allie’s apartment and got my stuff. She was devasted and crying, and apologized for how she’d reacted. I just sort of ignored her, got my stuff, gave her a hug, and left. This was the last time I ever saw her in person, all the way up until I’m typing this.

My parents flew home, but rented out their condo so I would have somewhere neutral to stay while I did my last two weeks at the office. Rachel texted me two days later. It was really long, but basically said that she had no idea I’d felt this way, and that she was going to break things off with her current boyfriend (not because of me, but because they’d been having serious issues for a while). She said she’d like to go on a date with me when I got home. 

Rachel and I talked a lot over the next two weeks, learning about each other and asking questions. We went out to dinner the night after I flew home, and agreed to take things slow. Be friends first, then see what happens, etc.

In the meantime, Allie and I have exchanged tens of thousands (literally) of words via e-mail and text over the two months following the breakup. We didn’t communicate at all for the first month or so, other than what was necessary to cancel the lease we’d both signed. Basically, we talked about what went wrong, what issues we had with each other, with each other’s friends and families, etc. We talked about a lot of stuff we’d both kept bundled up inside when we were together. It’s made enough of an impact that I do really believe that things would be different if we ever gave it another shot down the road. 

Allie still loves me, and cries every day, and can hardly go grocery shopping or listen to the radio without breaking down because of how much she misses me. She says she knows we’re meant to be, and that we’ve always found a way back to each other. She’s also said she knows we need time apart, though she doesn’t know how long. She wants to see how her graduate program will work out post-covid (it’s still all online), and she wants to see how I’ll do working for my dads company (I got a junior executive job here after coming home from NY). But, in the end, she thinks we’ll be together, and be better than before with all of the new communication we’ve had.   

And then there’s Rachel. In the two months since we’ve started talking “in that way” and the month and a half that I’ve been home, we’ve gone from friends to something else. We see each other almost every day (maybe not seeing each other 4 or 5 days total in the last 6 weeks without at least a quick lunch or something). We haven’t slept together, but we go make out, and cuddle in bed watching TV/reading, and stuff. Rachel has said she’ll know I’m ready for an actual relationship with her when I take the step of telling my friend about us. I know that, if I told my friend, she’d gladly become my “girlfriend” officially. 

But I don’t know what to do. When I’m with Rachel, I feel happy and like we could have a future together. But at night, and while I’m at work, and sitting in traffic, I miss Allie. We (Allie and I) still text here and there, and she keeps me up to date on how she’s doing, almost as if we were still together. I know it’s probably cruel of me to give her false hope, and I have, on multiple occasions, told her that we may not end up together, to try and curb that hope. I’m happy with Rachel, and she’s great, and I don’t want to hurt her. I think she knows on some level that I’m not fully invested yet, which is why we haven’t slept together. (On my end, I’m actually pretty scared of sleeping with anyone except Allie, who it’s the only person I’ve ever been with). 

What do I do?"
j5peaz,0,2020-10-05,Would Taking a 2 Year Gap Ruin My Career Options?,emokii,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j5peaz/would_taking_a_2_year_gap_ruin_my_career_options/,"Hello, 

I am currently a Junior studying computer science with a minor in Japanese and Chinese. I really want to become fluent in one of these languages. One of the best ways to become fluent in a language, is to live in the country of the spoken language. So I was thinking that maybe after I graduated, I would go study a masters abroad or teach english for 2 years. Languages are my true passion. Getting a computer science job in Japan, China, Taiwan, or Singapore seems hard. 

The questions is, would these 2 years abroad ruin my chances of getting back into the tech field in America? The reason for my question: I saw a question on one of my internship applications where it asked if I was a reentering stem who had taken a two or more years of break from the field."
j5pizf,5,2020-10-05,Have Weak Extracurriculars? Look Abroad,Aneducationabroad,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/j5pizf/have_weak_extracurriculars_look_abroad/,"One question that I get asked a lot is the role of extracurricular activities when applying to universities in Europe.  After all, spend any time on r/chanceme, and you soon see that the amount of space spent describing extracurricular activities easily exceeds just about everything else combined.  Wouldn’t it make sense for foreign universities to put a similar emphasis on extracurriculars?

Well, they don’t.

In fact, there’s not even a dedicated spot on the UCAS application for extracurricular activities.  Seriously, [here’s a copy](https://www.ucas.com/file/131431/download?token=LLf-qD0M) of the UCAS application that they offer to those with ‘limited internet access,’ which UCAS takes to mean either those in developing countries or prisoners (really great look there, UCAS).  While there is a spot for employment, it is incredibly spartan, with only 35 characters provided for a description.  If you were wondering, 'delivered superior customer service' is exactly 35 characters.

This means two things for Americans who are looking to go abroad.

First, if you are having to choose between your extracurricular activities and your grades, then you should probably ditch the extracurricular activities.  Every case is unique, and in some rare cases, they can actually help (see below).  However, if you’re only doing something because you think it will ‘look good’ on your application, then forget it.

Feel free to use this if you’re looking for reason #5,925 to convince your parents that the NSHSS is complete BS.

Second, if you do have great extracurriculars, you’ll want to find a way to work them into your application.  Luckily, you get a space to do so in your personal statement.

For UCAS applications (and tomorrow I’ll post why you absolutely should not use the Common App for UK admissions, except in one very specific instance), you get 4,000 characters, including spaces, to make your case.  That comes out to about 600-750 words, depending on how Latinate you’re feeling.  You only have to write one for all five programs, but through it you should look to demonstrate your passion for a subject.

Having pursued quality extracurricular activities that relate to your chosen field is a great way to do that.

If you are applying for STEM, mention your involvement in Science Olympiad.

If you’re leaning towards political science, talk up your Student Council experience.

If you want to study business, describe your internships.

Above all else, you’ll want to make sure that these are high-quality activities; you don’t want to be listing.  Even being a member of a relevant club can be helpful.  As long as they are relevant, they can help, but not having them won’t hurt.

I know, it’s the ‘test-optional’ argument all over again, but this time, as long as you can display your passion for the field otherwise, it’s actually legitimate.

You’ve got to be sure that they are relevant, however.  That can be a harder sell when it comes to certain sports.  That said, there are still ways to register your interest in a university while leveraging your love of a given sport, but these tend to be highly situational.

Finally, don’t forget small talk.  As an international applicant, you’ll be talking a lot on the phone, Skype, and Zoom.  Whether it is simply building a relationship with an admissions officer or an interview, those first few seconds can let you leave a great impression.  Just be sure to keep the conversation flowing; do enough to be charming, but not enough to be obnoxious."

Looking for advice,rachelnoel1234,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/j5rcd0/potentially_leaving_a_contract_position_in_a/,"Hi all,

I'm looking for some advice/guidance navigating contract jobs and employment coming out of university. I landed a 10 month contract internship for a non-profit, which is my desired field; however, the pay is minimum wage and I get no benefits. I also feel that I'm overqualified for the tasks they're having me perform, so I'm having a lot of internal conflict about it.

A bit about myself for more context:

* I'm 24 years old
* I live in Ottawa
* I graduated with a Masters of Arts in June
* I'm lucky enough to be covered by my common-law partner's health benefits
* I looked for a job for 4-5 months to no avail. The pandemic made finding a job incredibly tough, so my current job was the first that I even landed an interview with

What I really want to know is - should I stay in this job that, quite frankly, is underpaying me? Would it be worthwhile, a couple months down the line, to ask for a raise from my employer since my payment isn't really enough to live on in Ottawa? I know non-profits don't have a ton of money to throw around,  and I'm not asking for a huge salary...but I know of many non-profits that pay a living wage.

Should I keep looking for employment that will pay me a living wage with benefits even if I'm not as keen on the field, or should I stick it out through this contract and live frugally?

I hate it when people are disappointed in me, so I'm having a lot of anxiety about potentially quitting this contract in the future and guilt about interviewing elsewhere while I'm under contract. I also feel like my current boss backed me into a corner when I accepted the internship, because he asked me over zoom if I'd stay through the contract ""even if I was offered a job that payed $400,000/year."" But, even though the wage is low, I felt like I had to take the job because I had no other options.

So,  should I keep looking? Should I feel guilty about it? Should I stick it out?

j5s58m,23,2020-10-05,Struggling with Work Skills after a Traumatic Tech Job,bloodandkoolaid,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/j5s58m/struggling_with_work_skills_after_a_traumatic/,"Basically, I had a terrible tech job and now any amount of programming-related work makes me anxious which in turn is bad for my productivity. My ability to remember anything I learned over the past 3 years is terrible because I was living in a constant state of fear the entire time I was working. Now I need these skills for a dream job outside of tech and I am very nervous.  


I transitioned to tech after a successful few years in another field, and my first tech job was incredibly brutal. I was brought on as a glorified intern and was told I'd have a ton of mentoring and that I would mostly work on non-time-dependent improvements to the company's code for the first year or so. Well, within 2 months all but 1 of the 5 people on the team I'd been hired onto, including the manager, had quit their jobs and I was suddenly personally responsible for company-critical production code. There was virtually no documentation for this code, which was badly written spaghetti code, some in a language I had never studied, and I was pulling all-nighters and still not able to get everything working without outside help. A new manager that got hired was actively trying to get me fired because I didn't have a graduate degree (???), nothing I did was ever good enough, and it was an environment of constant mockery. I was expected to perform at the level of a senior engineer and treated like an idiot for what were, in retrospect, completely normal knowledge gaps for a junior employee being paid half of what my coworkers were. My productivity and learning stalled because I was too afraid to ask questions or push code. I eventually left and found another tech job, but it wasn't much better. I quit that job after a year, since my partner's income could sustain us and I hated being alive, honestly.  


I've been unemployed for almost a year now but have a great shot at a job in medical research that I truly find super interesting and meaningful. As I'm going through practice exercises as job prep I'm disturbed to find that I've forgotten most of the skills I built over FOUR YEARS of prior experience, and I feel anxious every time I sit down to code. Every time I don't know something I think I should know I feel panicked and ashamed and certain that new boss will treat me how old boss did because maybe I deserve it for being an idiot. I just don't know how to move past what is clearly a trauma response in order to do a job I logically know I \*can\* do. I graduated from college summa cum laude and I have many academic publications in my previous field, but every time I can't recall a Python command I feel like the dumbest person alive.  


If anyone else has overcome work-related trauma I would be very happy to hear how you did it. Any advice or is support welcome, I'm just \*really\* trying to find a way to work past this so I can help support my family and build a future career!"

j5sbsz,44,2020-10-05,I just got an internship,trakka121,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/j5sbsz/i_just_got_an_internship/,"I just got an internship at a local, very tech-oriented Distribution Center. I will be testing their code for a WMS (warehouse management system) that they bought and translated from one language to another. I will also be writing documentation for using their products. 

I'm really proud I got the job. I worked hard at a warehouse job I disliked for two summers and now I find that hard work is paying off. My experience as a warehouseman is largely what qualified me for the internship. It also gave me much more confidence, which led to a much better interview. All the other interviews went ok, but I don't have anything to sell about myself when employers ask about relevant work experience. 

It comes as a relief since this was the internship I was most hoping to get, although not the best paid. I think it'll give me a comfy introduction to applying my CS skills on the job. And once I have this experience in my back pocket, getting better internships should be a lot easier. 

Do you have any advice on how to prepare, and what this experience might offer me as for future career prospects? Maybe I could eventually get an internship with Amazon?"

j5tpcd,2,2020-10-05,Second guessing myself,dixienormus96,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/j5tpcd/second_guessing_myself/,"TW: mentions of suicide and self-harm

TL;DR: I used to be super successful, and now everything feels like a chore since being diagnosed with ADHD. I wonder if I am just making excuses now because of the diagnosis.

I don't know what is wrong with me. This is going to be a long read, but it's been on my mind throughout the entirety of this year, and I just need someone impartial to the situation to tell me what they think. I don't have too many friends, and my friends at school have only known me for two years, so they don't understand my background as much.

I've always hated school, but have done exceptionally well in it. I graduated as a valedictorian from my high school despite not studying too much. Obviously I had a few classes where I was forced to, but for the most part I BS-ed my way through. I hated sitting all day learning nothing useful and the boredom drove me so crazy I developed suicidal depression and self-harming tendencies. Despite all that crap, I was able to get through high school with straight A's and get a big scholarship.

Partway through college, second semester of sophomore year, I began to realize that there was something up with me other than just depression tendencies and hating school. Once again, I was keeping super good grades (a 3.8+ GPA in biomedical engineering), but I still could barely get myself to pay attention during lectures, and the test-taking environment of college was way different from high school, which made me get super anxious during tests (college kids are so much louder!). I looked into ADHD symptoms of women and realized that I might have it. I got formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist and was prescribed low-dose (10 mg) Adderall. This stuff is *amazing*, it seems to be the only thing other than energy drinks and iced coffee that can keep me sitting and off my phone for more than 5 minutes. I didn't get any major side effects other than some grumpiness after it wears off, so that quelled my fears of becoming an Adderall addict for awhile. I don't take it every day just to make sure I don't develop a tolerance.

However, recently I have been *majorly* struggling to get anything done, even *on* Adderall. I'll be honest, I hate the college major I chose but I can't switch out of it because my scholarship stops after four years. Even then, I don't even know what I'd switch to. I can't think of a profession that would bring me any happiness. The only things that make me happy are cooking/baking and weightlifting. Combined with the financial issues COVID brought me this year, I am completely strung out.  I have no motivation. My friends tell me that it's just the ADHD combined with garbage online school, but I have been through so much worse mentally and I was still able to stick to my schoolwork and be super successful. Now, I can't even bring myself to send an email to a professor.

I'm beginning to think that I'm either becoming lazy or too dependent on the Adderall/caffeine. I was able to power through anything my crappy brain threw at me for so many years and now I'm just a lazy piece of trash. I don't know what to do to get out of this. I am a failure. All of my friends are so passionate about learning and pursuing their careers and I don't give a flying sh\*t about my own. From the outside it looks like I'm still doing fine, keeping my GPA up and getting internships and such, but I can't do homework without planning a whole day around taking an Adderall/chugging coffee and cramming it all into one day, and just looking up all of the answers online. It takes all of my effort just to get myself to do the most basic things. Since this happened after my diagnosis, sometimes I wonder if I'm using the diagnosis as an excuse to not do things that I need to. I don't know what's wrong with me. I used to be able to handle so much and now I am so weak.

Thank you for listening."

j5z02f,297,2020-10-06,"Just got my first job offer after graduating this summer with a 2.8 from a non-target school, here’s what I think helped me",Ebonic,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/j5z02f/just_got_my_first_job_offer_after_graduating_this/,"I landed a systems engineering position as a mechanical engineer, paying 71K in SoCal and I want to talk a little bit about what I think helped me land it and I guess show that it’s not impossible to get one. I had applied to ~100 jobs between June and September and I only landed 2 interviews, one of which turned into an offer. As the title mentioned, I had a 2.8 and went to a non-target school and had zero internship experience. I honestly did not think I was going to get a job within a year of graduation. But I did, and this is what I think helped me. 

1. Just because school ended doesn’t mean that your learning stops. You have a huge opportunity to show that you are a self starter after you graduate. Rack up certificates and work on projects in things you are interested in. I spent $400 on Coursera Plus and it fucking hurt. I did not really have much money saved up but I knew I had to do something to make myself competitive. I started learning Python, SQL, and machine learning mostly because I was really interested in expanding my skillset and I have a deep fanboy appreciation for self-driving car technology and wanted to get a foundational understanding of how that works and see if I could break into the automotive industry as a ML engineer. I had finished some courses and threw them on my resume, as well as some that were still in progress but I planned to complete. I also was working with a team on a startup / project and was able to put that on my resume, and that ended up being a major point of conversation in the interview. If I hadn’t been self-learning all summer, I would not have been a competitive candidate nor would I have had anything to talk about during the interview, as it’s a primarily data science based position. 

2. Use your network. I saw on LinkedIn that one of my classmates started at a new position at the beginning of summer and even though I saw the update a month late, I messaged him and congratulated him. I asked him about his role, how he likes it, and how he thinks he was able to demonstrate that he was a good fit for the role. A few weeks later, an operations manager at his job posted that he was looking to hire more new grads as they were looking to expand and my friend sent me the post. I messaged the OM and told him I was interested and sent my resume, we set up an interview, and two weeks later I found out I was selected. I even mentioned my buddy in the interview and luckily the OM knew him and loved the guy. Even if you aren’t that close, talk to the people in your network, whether they’re doing really well or in the same position as you. 

3. Prepare for the interview. Don’t half ass it for an hour before the interview starts. The second you have an interview scheduled, all of your extra time should be spent preparing for it. At least if it’s important to you. I come from a household where I’m already set to make more than my parents combined, so it was important to me to get this job to be able to help them and help myself. What does preparing for the interview look like? Given that we are in a global pandemic, most interviews are conducted via zoom or phone call, and to me that makes it 100x easier. I make a very organized document containing information about the interviewer, the company, the position I’m applying for, main points from my resume I want to highlight, a scripted elevator pitch, answers to every resume question I could find for this company online (glassdoor) and more general questions, and questions I have for the interviewer. Throughout the interview, I consistently referenced the document and it helped me answer tougher questions smoothly and that probably helped set me apart. It probably took 6 hours to put together and I spent a few hours reviewing it. I also found out that I had another classmate that worked there, so I was able to get the experiences of two separate people on the same interview. This goes back to using your network as much as you can. 

I wrote this in 10 minutes while sitting on the toilet because I just saw a post about a student who was very upset in his job search and I just wanted to share my experience. Maybe there’s something in here that can help somebody.

If there’s anything y’all would like me to elaborate on, let me know and I’ll try my best to help."

A little about me, I have worked at 2 internships, 1 at a FANG, and I have also build a full-stack app where I built the front-end, back-end, setup the servers and networks, and even the database. From this I thought I would have an edge over many undegrads, however, after my recent interviews, I get a lot of feedback from my interviewers saying I do not have enough technical knowledge.

When I was in college, I lost my best friend to a rare illness, my grandpa (who I was very close to) died, and my dad died. I just feel like I'm broken and like things are never going to get better. 

I struggle with anxiety and depression and insomnia and suicidal thoughts, all of which started when all of these traumatic events happened. I got into a fight with my mom and told her that I wanted to die and she told me to go ahead and do it. I had a plan on how to kill myself in college that I was going to follow through with, but ended up calling public safety instead and they called an ambulance and transported me to the nearest hospital that had a psych ward and it was the worst experience of my life. It felt like a prison and it didn't help me and gave me PTSD instead. So now I'm scared to tell people how I feel or to call a suicide hotline or something because I'm afraid of being forced into a psych ward again. 

When I was in high school everyone thought I was going to go on and do amazing things with my life (I was salutatorian of my class), but I haven't. It's been a couple years since I graduated but I've struggled to find a job in my field, and have been getting rejected for two years now. I had job at a bookstore (something I was doing short-term while I applied to grad school), and was laid off due to Covid and now the job market's horrible and I can't even find an internship. I still live at home with my mom.

Earlier this year, I got accepted into grad school abroad and I thought my life and luck was finally going to start turning around but I had to give up my place in the program because of Covid. The person I love and thought I was going to marry one day (and lived in the country I wanted to go to grad school in) cheated on me. I've lost all my friends this year - we've dropped out of touch and none of them wished me a happy birthday this year or checked in on me when I told them I was struggling with my mental health.

I just feel like I'm cursed and that if there's a god, he's laughing at my suffering. I feel broken and alone and like a burden and I've been holding on, hoping that things would eventually get better, but they haven't. I feel like ever since college, things just keep getting worse. Why should I hold on if everything is a struggle and things might never get better?"

As the title states, I am a Senior University student majoring in Aerospace Engineering. I have a competitive GPA at a good school, but have recently discovered my passion for computer science. It started this past summer when I failed to get an internship during covid. At first I was crushed, but I decided to make the most of it and took Discrete Math and two introduction level coding classes. I believe now that this may have been one of the greatest decisions i have made. I am not in a Data Structures class, and am thoroughly enjoying it. I am planning on taking Algorithms and Software Development next semester ( my last semester as a 4th year undergraduate). Now for the career question portion.

Getting a second major is an option for me, as staying an additional 2 or so years in school is financially possible, and the job market is weak for aerospace engineering right now. I am more interested in pursuing a MCS graduate program, however, and have started applying for the program at my current university.

I am fully ready to commit to this new career path, and think that getting a CS INTERNSHIP this summer would be incredibly beneficial to me. The only problem is that I have no extracurricular experience in CS, and I am a senior in college. I am not sure if this will make me a less appealing candidate to tech firms (big and small) that I apply to. I have already been spending at least an hour a day on LeetCode practicing my problem-solving skills, but I wanted to ask you all what the best course of action for me is to have the best possible odds of landing a CS internship this summer. 

I have become incredibly passionate about computer science, and it is practically all I want to do anymore. I am going to finish my current major as it wouldn’t be wise to stop or change paths completely this close to graduating, but man do I wish I could take more CS classes right now.

If anybody wants to ask any more personal questions about my stats and that to make a better judgement of the best course for me, feel free to PM me!

I am excited to hear back from you all find what your looking for in the job market!"

I've looked and applied to FBU, Google STEP, Microsoft Explore, and the popular programs garnered towards freshman and sophmores but I'm preparing for plan B in case those don't work out. I'm unsure when the recruiting process is for these smaller companies/startups for their summer internship positions and what kind of work to expect to do. 

I'd love to hear about anyone who's held a summer software engineering internship their freshman year at a smaller company/startup and how their experience was like applying and working there."

Getting tougher day by day mentally! I have done enough networking to know that people are amazed by my skills and background but no one gives the job! What a sigh 😂
Had to start building up my skills in JavaScript and Development cause apparently I would be skilled enough that way for an Entry level position! Now I'm in a boat where I am developing on Full Stack and not getting a desired interview of my choice🥺 
I am an International student at the US! Pursuing my Masters in CS and I would be kicked out if I do not land any job😭🙂

 I'm Canadian, don't qualify for Cerb or Crb, and I'll try to make this as short as possible but it will be a long story long sadly. TLDR at the end, if it helps.

\-------------------------------  


I was born to get my mother back in the family after she accused her stepfather of doing something horrible, to minimize her stealing 10 grand from him. Police caught her in a lie, but Catholic families with patrilineal lines will forgive a lot for a grandson. Me. My mother also has Munchausen's and Munchausen's-by-proxy. Just as context to what you're about to read. Because I'm humiliated to tell people this.  


I'm currently 26, 6' 5"", and around 450 lbs. I have good mobility, no joint pain, and I'm lucky to not have health complications that you would care about. But I was hidden from the rest of the world, poisoned, and warped socially and mentally. The luck of happening to become introspective when I was younger saved me from being an obese stereotype. There are many other issues with me, but this isn't ask a therapist.  


I was homeless after escaping at 20, before finding work and housing. I worked at two restaurants briefly, before settling into hospitality as the night shift. I struggled to keep that first hotel job after management changed and quit suddenly after a safety incident.  


The savings I was building up were destroyed, I struggled to get work, and fell into debt before relocating for a job. They lied about my hours and pay, and I was fired after I couldn't afford a place to live after my 4 months of employee housing. I came back to my hometown to live with my grandmother, who let(s) me live rent-free. Landed another job after a month. I stayed instead of finding my own place, so I could help with my grandfather. Early Dementia and Parkinsons had made him dependant. He died during my year and a half at that job. I stayed to help my grandmother grieve and lost my job after I was assaulted by a vagrant I had to remove from the hotel. I filed for wrongful dismissal as they didn't follow union guidelines and got a month's wages, but not my job back.  


I nearly had another job after again being drained of my meager savings by time. But the birth father I'd only been talking to for only 2 years invited me to learn eCommerce under him. I should have said no. He didn't teach me anything. I landed an unpaid internship editing ads and text for a marketing company, and my father tossed me scraps for doing some grunt work. I only survived because he bought me food. But I frayed my brain dealing with his spoiled antics and babysitting his two bratty children in the middle of an ugly divorce.  


I ran back to grandma's skirt. COVID took my internship, in March. They gave me a recommendation letter that so far hasn't been useful. My bank account is empty, my credit card is going to be maxed after I pay this phone bill so I can keep looking for work just a bit longer. I haven't eaten anything but bulk rice in two months now unless my grandmother made it to share. I was seeing a therapist but stopped when I lost my job.  


Desperately trying to find work. I'm on application 114, with 3 interviews that went nowhere. Waiting to hear from 2 more. I'm running out of clothes that don't have holes in them. I'm becoming afraid of outside and of people again. I wanted to be an artist, but my brain is so messed up, I'm terrified to even draw. I think about suicide almost every day now. I barely own anything, I live out of two suitcases. I have one friend, and I've never had an in-person conversation with them. They've gone back to college anyway, they don't have time for me, I could vanish and it might not even matter to them. My issues keep me from even having hobbies to distract me. Can't even have headphones on.  


I don't even feel like a person anymore. I'm coming apart at the seams, and I'm just so fucking tired.  


I need someone, anyone, to tell me what I can do to start clawing my way up to where I feel like everyone else is. I don't even know what to expect from writing all this. But if you made it this far, then thank you. And I'm sorry.  


**TLDR;** My life is a mess of mistakes and mismanagement. I'm very fat. Mentally twisted to the point of breaking, and can't relax because of it. I'm out of money, even the credit card. I'm going to die soon if I don't figure out how to pull myself from this hole. I'd like any advice I can get. And I'm sorry."

I completed my masters in December 2019 and started my job hunting since then. I had some job interviews but all of them were cancelled due to covid-19.Since then I have been undergoing many certification courses, then in September i got a internship regarding WordPress but it has possibility of becoming full-time job. So I have been looking for full-time job too. Due to being a 2019 graduate, many of my application are being rejected instantly for graduate program due to this.

So, here are my questions:

1.Where should I go from here? I am interested and very good in front-end(HTML,React,JavaScript,React,Ruby on rails), python, java.

2.What will happen to my visa? Even if I get a job in this(hopefully) or next year, I won't being directly qualified for stamp 4. So what visa will I get?

3.Many of the companies uses HireVue interview system. Can somebody advice me on how to pass those interviews?

I am not greedy about the salary. I am only concerned about getting some experience in IT sector."
j620kz,3,2020-10-06,Have to choose between two really great internships for summer 2021,skriptkidd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j620kz/have_to_choose_between_two_really_great/,"This is my throwaway account because I follow my schools sub on my main. 

I’ll start off with some background: I’m a Junior CS major in a top 20 (or 30 depending on your preferred ranking site) undergraduate program. I didn’t have any internships in my first summer and I did a remote unpaid data science internship last summer (2020).

I was reached out to for Microsoft for a pre-interview screen in Feb and got fast tracked for summer 2021 interviews (straight to final stage) and I was reached out to by Google over the summer and also somewhat fast tracked. Fast forward and I’ve basically been accepted into both.

Now here’s where things get a bit tricky. Microsoft sent me a couple congratulations emails and my application portal has my official offer letter and another doc to sign. This includes the regular salary, housing, travel and visa info. Their offer deadline is in a week.

Google’s is a bit more...puzzling, it’s a bit early and they aren’t even close to starting their project search. My acceptance was basically a call from my (...recruiter) after I told her about Microsoft’s deadline. 

I’ve heard about getting accepted at google after interviews but not getting an offer letter because of project availability. In our discussion she told me that if I accept the offer I would “definitely” be matched with a project but the lack of an offer letter seems something of a red flag to me.

I’m kind of stuck between the two at the moment because Microsoft seems to have their shit together for interns but Google (in my mind at least) has more prestige in SWE. I’d love to have my opinion on this challenged though. I also feel that the covid uncertainty might play into this because of how Google handled intern projects last summer.

Both are pretty much tied #1 on my list and I’d really appreciate to hear some opinions and advice, especially from someone that’s been in a similar position. It might be worth adding that I’m an international student, not that I think that’s much of a factor at this point.

Thanks in advance!"
j63zsh,4,2020-10-06,Network+ useful in The Netherlands?,DiabloLovesSweden,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/j63zsh/network_useful_in_the_netherlands/,"Hi all,

I am studying for my Network + exam with the hopes of being able to find an entry level IT job in Holland. I made the decision about nine months ago to switch careers (I was working in entertainment/events before Covid happened.) I live in Holland, am originally from America, came here on the European passport I possess. I have already completed the A+ exam, and on top of studying for the Network +, I am also learning Dutch, and also experiment with home labs (playing with Active Directory, practicing installing various operating systems, playing with the command line when troubleshooting network issues, ect..)

The thing is, I've already been trying to apply for various entry level IT jobs here, everything from help desk to network administration (just to see if I could even be granted an interview) and at this point I could literally show you about 100 rejection letters I have stacked up in my inbox. It has been incredibly discouraging and I can't figure out what I am doing wrong here. 

I even got rejected for several internships I've applied for (not even *Traineeships*, but *internships*.)

I do not have a bachelor's degree, but I honestly don't see how that should matter in this scenario when much of what I will be doing has to be learned on the job anyway, and yet it keeps coming up as a point when my resume is rejected. That, plus the lack of experience in this field. I don't get it. I am throwing myself into my studies as much as I can in order to better myself, but at this point it feels like it won't even amount to anything what with my lack of experience, plus the current job market that the pandemic has produced. 

Is there anybody on this sub currently located in The Netherlands who could give me some advice or point me in the right direction as to where I could apply that I would actually have a chance of being granted an interview? I'm willing to take a massive pay cut from what I was previously doing in the events industry in order to go through an IT internship, because I know that it will benefit me in the long run. I am also willing to start at the bottom and work myself up, but at the same time I am wondering if it is even worth trying now? It feels as though I am studying for nothing at this point. 

Any encouragement or advice would be greatly appreciated."
j644x6,1,2020-10-06,Should I list my supervisor as a professional reference?,alysmuse,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/j644x6/should_i_list_my_supervisor_as_a_professional/,"Recently I was notified by an organisation that I had made it into the final stage of the hiring process. This is great news, but I was requested to provide a contact for reference checks (specifically a supervisor) in addition to HR.

Now I'm in a bit of a dilemma as to whether I should provide my supervisor's details and have her be my professional reference. First off I would describe our relationship as ""alright"". It had both good and bad moments but things didn't end on a sour note. I say ""good"" in the sense that we shared the camaraderie of people who were on the same boat (namely we had a temperamental boss whom everyone in our team had problems working with and shared a general sense of dislike) and sometimes we'd vent our feelings with each other. 

As to why there were ""bad"" moments, well... I knew this supervisor of mine back when I was an intern at my current company. We had a pretty good relationship and my boss offered me a role which I accepted. Upon graduation, I returned to the company as an executive. Fast forward 2 weeks later, my supervisor made me take the blame for an assignment that I was tasked with and I got a dressing down from our boss. To give more context, our boss assigned us to do it, but she mainly dumped it on me (a new hire) and she was the one who did the briefing and made the decision to do it in a certain way which did not sit well with my boss. Obviously I felt angry and betrayed and this affected my relationship with her. I know I shouldn't have let my personal feelings get in the way of my professional conduct, but it was a difficult thing for me. Thus from then on when we worked together, I would be less patient with her and I'll admit that there were times where I did not give it my all. I realize I should have been better than that and that's something I'll keep in mind in the future.

Again, all things considered, I think that we parted on an ""okay"" note. (She's currently on maternity and I'll be leaving the company soon). I contacted her asking if I could list her as a reference and her response (text) was this:

Yeah.. Okie.. No problem.

It seems a bit lacklustre, so I'm wondering if I should provide her details for the reference check. I don't know what kind of reference she'll provide, but should I take a chance with it?

Thanks in advance!"
j645sf,373,2020-10-06,"You don't have to be spiky, but please don't be well-rounded",CollegeWithMattie,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/j645sf/you_dont_have_to_be_spiky_but_please_dont_be/,"I'm possibly the least well-rounded person you will ever meet.

I mean it. I suck at *so many things.* Just terrible. I can't do math, or draw, or cook, or sing, or act, [or include the unbelievable artwork from my artist, Felicia Tzeng, on Reddit](https://imgur.com/a/KwRdRVc) , or plan, [or make a competent TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJfQ25Pk/) , or lift heavy things, or dress myself, [or promote stuff correctly](https://mailchi.mp/22908a9625d6/why-college-guide), or lightly edit a piece once it's live without the entire Goddamn universe crashing in upon me, or sit through a movie without biting my nails, or be normal even when I really need to be...the list goes on and on.

I also wouldn't necessarily call myself ""spiky."" If I had a spike, it would be writing. But it's not like I'm out here winning Pulitzers. There's a reason I put my stuff out for free on Reddit instead of slamming it into a book. I tried that once before. No one bought the book.

But along with writing, I'd also say I'm quite good at college admissions info, explaining new concepts and ideas...talking about myself, telling jokes, ummm, analyzing handwriting, ummm, Playing *Smash Bros* at bars, ummmmm…

See? Not that spiky.

But I get enough nice DMs to know I'm good at what I do. It makes me feel grateful for all the support I've gotten and proud that I've been able to capitalize on and combine what I am good at to make myself happy and give back to the world.

That leads us to today's question:

*Hi! I'm a rising sophomore. I've read most of your blogs, and I think they're gold and make a ton of sense. But they also freak me out. How am I supposed to find a weird hobby? On top of doing well in school? And having amazing extracurriculars? And family stuff? And how am I supposed to have a unique life so I have ""unique"" half ideas? It's so much work, stress, pressure, everything. I guess my real question is do you have any tips to manage the stress of applying to college or thinking about college in the future and trying to apply all the stuff I read on the internet and be a good, cool, passionate, driven person that gets enough sleep?*

Sorry, no.

- Mattie

...Yes, I have an answer.

This question cuts to the heart of what I find to be the single worst thing about college admissions. It is an objective fact that **getting into college is not conducive to living a fun, care-free teen life**. I'm smacked in the face with this fact every October 31st. That's the night before the first major round of EA/ED applications are due, and it is the first major checkpoint on the college application Grand Prix. For the first couple of years at my job, I would send out some ""fun"" Email congratulating my students on working so hard and demanding they do something to celebrate the holiday.

I stopped after realizing that every student would then report they either fell asleep at 7 PM or were too nervous about submitting things to do much of anything. I extra stopped when a student responded, ""did you do something fun?""

No. I was up until 2 AM copy-editing, and then I watched a baseball game on DVR because I couldn't sleep.

Being in the weeds with you students gives me a crystal-clear understanding of what modern high school life is like. It sucks! But, to be fair, it sucks in mostly the same ways it did in 2009. I played the game just as hard in high school as I do with students now. And in both cases, it's worked. That's why I'm not the guy to tell you a summer job and Flaming Hot Cheetos LORs will be enough. Not if you want to go big.

So that's why I cringe every time there's some post on Reddit that's like, ""remember to enjoy being a teen, you guys!"" It's patronizing because it implies that every student here isn't ""enjoying being a teen"" because either they don't want to or because they don't have their priorities straight. And as College With Goddamn Mattie, I believe most of you have your hearts in the right place, doing whatever you can to achieve your goals.

*So what do we do about this?*

We avoid being well-rounded as hard as humanly possible. And in doing so, we cut out as much unimportant bullshit that makes us tired and unhappy as we can.

\---

I was inspired to write this after reading u/admissionsmom 's book last night. [It's super good!](https://www.amazon.com/Hey-AdmissionsMom-Real-Talk-Reddit-ebook/dp/B07SKLM2FZ) You should buy it and read it and give it 5-stars!

I ended up in the chapter about the well-rounded/spike debate, and Miss Mom described a 5-prong starfish. Instead of having endless stuff, she recommended students pick around five things they care about and go for those as hard as they can.

I think my starfish would have three legs. Or like, two legs and one little toe.

Anyone here ever play *World of Warcraft*? I know the answer is no, but I have to ask. It was the video game that made young men uninteresting before *DOTA* and *League* took over. In WoW, you made your little gnome or goblin or whatever, and then you had three slots to decide.

Class:

Sub-Class:

Profession:

So for example, I was usually a Mage as a class, a healer as a sub-class, and a tailor as a profession. I can feel people back-clicking I type, so I'll now convert those three concepts into what I think they should mean for your application.

Class: This is what you plan to declare as your major. [This was the first piece of content I published](https://www.collegewithmattie.com/the-one-key-difference-between-my-students-who-did-and-did-not-get-into-t20-schools/), and I feel like I agree with it even more now that I'm filling out apps again. You want/need to be spending a lot of time and energy showcasing the skills that you hope to be a professional in one day. If that's CS, I want you taking coding classes and building an app on Saturday. If it's writing, I want you on the school's newspaper and putting together that children's book alongside your artist friend. I also want you to get As in the hardest possible classes related to this subject and study hard to max out any standardized tests related to the subject.

Sub-Class: This is the *other* thing you do. Might be dance, might be swimming, might be working at Target. Your sub-class will usually be -but does not have to be- a *classic* school extracurricular. But whatever it is, I want you to go for it. I like awards and Youtube videos and volunteer positions and internships - I want you to go as far and wide with this as you possibly can. Dare to be great.

Profession: Here's where we can get weird. What do you like to do? Screw college, what are you into? I won't accept *playing* video games or *watching* television. But what else? Do you like to paint maybe? Or grow chia pets? This is where your weird hobby can come into play. [Read this piece. I want you to do this, too.](https://www.collegewithmattie.com/how-to-get-noticed-and-stand-out-during-the-college-admissions-process-have-a-weird-hobby/)

This is literally my job, and I am telling you that if a student came to me and had all three of those sections jacked up all over, we would 100% be in business. All I would have to do is get to know them, and then I would help them build narrative connections between the three + their personality + whatever else they had going on, and it would work.

The key would have to be that this student had gone for each as hard as he or she could. I want the future doctor to have worked at a hospital and to have done lab research, and if she could have cured cancer, that would be great. And because she swims, I want her competing and winning at every damn swim event in the state. I also want her training little kids to swim for free on Saturday and working as a lifeguard each summer. And because she was the one student who actually took my advice to start a podcast on the medical benefits of swimming with her friend, we could get her into Stanford.

(Someone, anyone, please start a podcast with a friend. It can be about college, sports, local school gossip, serial killers, or anything else you care about and want to chat about. Put it out every week, have a website for it, and get it to 100 weekly listeners, and I will happily join for an episode to talk about anything you like. THEN YOU WILL GET INTO COLLEGE BECAUSE YOU STARTED A PODCAST AND THE BOOMERS WHO READ THIS SHIT WILL **LOVE IT.**)

Now, I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend you *enjoy* all three of these ""spikes."" I want you to go as hard as possible, and that's going to be a lot easier if you enjoy the concept itself. If you're a Frosh, I would prefer you to jump ship entirely than spend/waste so much of your time and energy on something you hate. But if you're a junior/senior, Iono. I think I'd tell you to suck it up and keep going. You can quit the second you get into schools. If it involves your major, my honest advice would be to play a good little soldier and apply with the background you have, then switch to another major you don't hate as soon as you get there.

This all sounds pretty cutthroat, right? It is. I know what it takes to get into top schools. It's really hard, you guys.

But here's the fun part: *I don't want or need anything else.*

I mean, it would be cool if you had a personality. And A's in other courses that were fairly-competitive. And if you liked Pokemon or something. We could and would write about all that, too. But that stuff I find comes naturally. I never need to force students to be fun, playful, or to like what they like. I've had too many teenagers be remarkable and different and amazing with no coaching at all to believe that it doesn't come naturally. What I need to do is direct their limited focus.

And that's why I think the concept of ""being well-rounded"" sucks and is a meme. I tend to really, really dislike bad advice. Especially advice that I feel like came from someone who meant well, but not well enough to think about what impact said advice would have in a real situation.

The meme version of well-rounded is: Do whatever makes you happy! The shitty real version is: do as many things in as many subjects as you can until your life falls apart. I see the tragic end-result of an elite student being well-rounded. He or she brings me what I refer to as *the list of stuff.* It's their resume or EC sheet, and it just goes on and on and on. But there's no theme. No story. All it says about the student is that they are inherently excellent and achieve a lot, seemingly for the sake of achieving it at all. Then I ask them about what matters the most to them and why, and they don't know. And then they don't get in where they want. And then their parents blame *them*.

It breaks my fucking heart you guys.

Please don't be well-rounded. Please don't let your parents make you do a bunch of shit that you don't like, aren't good at, or don't see an obvious payoff that makes the time and energy required to seem worth it. I promise it isn't. I promise that it won't help you grow as a young person, and ...more relevantly...I promise it won't get you into the schools you want to go to.

\---

I'd like you to do some research on burnout. It's a concept that we, as a society, have deemed teens impervious to for some reason. FWIW, teenagers in 2009 weren't actually depressed; we were just *moody.* Both concepts are insane and dangerous.

[https://www.verywellmind.com/ten-signs-your-teenager-is-burning-out-2611230](https://www.verywellmind.com/ten-signs-your-teenager-is-burning-out-2611230)

[https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm)

I've burned out at multiple points in my life. It didn't just make me unhappy; it got in the way of my work and made me worse at the things I did care about. I'm terrified of burning out because I know it will lead to my professional catastrophe. I have worked harder this past calendar year than at any other point in my life. I've been stressed, haven't slept well, and been occasionally terrified that nothing I was trying would work. But I have not burned out. Not once. I'm still stressed and can't sleep, but I am so thrilled to be alive and love getting to work with *my* teens over Zoom every day.

(I call them my Zoomers!!!)

The difference is I have goals and motivations, and that I *love what I have to do.* That is my personal theory on burnout: That it is less about hours spent or the ability to tolerate sleepless nights and more about whether you find everything you are doing worth it or not. When you try to be well-rounded, you end up putting unnecessary time and energy into things you either don't like or don't care about. Then you burnout. Then the things that do matter and you do care about start to suffer as well.

So we're gonna cut a lot of that shit out. No, you don't have to learn a second instrument. Do something cool with the one you already enjoy. No, you don't need to learn Italian. You're applying Chemical Engineering; that's stupid. Instead, be that magical starfish wizard. Have a few - carefully planned - passions and go. Gogogogogo.

And then go be a teenager. You are *allowed* to do absolutely anything you want. You wanna work at the mall? Go for it. Want to try baking bread? I love it. But do these things without a hidden agenda. There's no ulterior motive of *how good does this bread need to be?* Do things because they sound fun, or you want to know if you can. Then, maybe, if you like it, keep going with it and see what happens. But you shouldn't need to worry about it because you're already working your ass off at the stuff that counts.

...I do not know if this will work. Or at least, I can't prove it. I was not a Stanford Admissions Officer for three years in the 1990s, so I do not inherently know everything there is to know about modern college admissions. What I can say is that this is how I live my life. I showed up here six months ago and meant absolutely nothing. What I did know is that I can write better than everyone else, I'm funny, I analyze handwriting, I am willing to talk openly about my life to strangers, and that I am good with coming up with new ideas. Anyone of those concepts alone does not make me stand out. But what I did is actively combine the few things I knew I was great at as tightly and creatively as possible to make people notice me.

It worked. I run my own college consulting business now - entirely with Reddit students. It has made me happy and successful to the point that it doesn't seem real. I am so unbelievably grateful to you all here that it **does not seem real**.

But it is. Because half-ideas works, yo.

If it worked for some guy in Palo Alto trying to jump-start his career, it will work for you trying to get into the schools you care about. You all read crappy advice telling you how important it is to ""Stand out!"" and ""Showcase your passions!"" Well, here's how you actually can. I build systems, and this is my system for getting into college. I didn't expect to be dumping my high-school consulting expansion thesis today, but here we are.

I really like this piece, except for the fact that I didn't answer that kid's question, like at all. Let's try again.

*Hi! I'm a rising sophomore. I've read most of your blogs, and I think they're gold and make a ton of sense. But they also freak me out. How am I supposed to find a weird hobby? On top of doing well in school? And having amazing extracurriculars? And family stuff? And how am I supposed to have a unique life so I have ""unique"" half ideas? It's so much work, stress, pressure, everything. I guess my real question is do you have any tips to manage the stress of applying to college or thinking about college in the future and trying to apply all the stuff I read on the internet and be a good, cool, passionate, driven person that gets enough sleep?*

The way you achieve this is by thinking ahead.

First, keep your grades up. That matters most of all. All As will take you further than any weird three-pronged sea creature ever will.

Next, you're starting your sophomore year. That's still so much time to do what needs to be done. Take a step back, breathe, and then begin to plan a bit. What's your magic starfish? What's the stuff to prioritize? What isn't? Which of those activities do you not even enjoy? I think you should stop those activities that you don't like and don't feel contribute to your overall application strength directly.

That should buy you some more free time. Maybe dedicate half of it to doing more and better things that do matter. Be smart about it. I mean it that if you like to swim, you should be volunteering at a pool or a beach. It seems so simple as I write it, but in the chaos of the admission frenzy, it's easy to lose track of the goal and go do a bunch of things that *feel right* without a valid reason why. I am telling you they're not. Well-rounded is such a meme, you guys.

And with that other half? Do you. Download a calendar app for your phone. I use Google Calendar, and it works well except when I accidentally click a popup and get porn spam sent to it. I live through my calendar and have everything I must do graphed out in front of me at all times. It makes me waste zero time or energy wondering what I should be doing; I just do it. I once tried filling in social activities like ""see mom"" or even ""write for fun"" in the empty spaces, but that failed miserably. Instead, I punch in everything I must do and then know and respect that any blank time is mine. I try to build my weekly schedule to allow me as many decent-sized free blocks as possible. I plan and package my week so that every Friday night I have off to go on a date, and every Sunday I'm clear all day to watch football in bed with my cat.

If I didn't, shit would just be everywhere, and I'd spend all week either working or awaiting working. I'm obsessed with efficiency. You should be setting your week so that you cut down on as many unproductive moments as possible. For example, you need to book that theoretical little-kid swim class either right before or right after your regular practice session. Doing so cuts out all the time and energy it would take to get ready and head to the pool a second time. That's an extra 90 minutes each week you just took back. Actively work to create solutions like these, and you'll be amazed just how much more time each week you can reclaim.

**It is possible to be a successful, hard-working, high-achieving person without everything else in your life falling apart.** I try really hard to be an example of that fact.

And weird hobby? Just have it on your mind. The fact that you are on this message board, asking a guy like me, and getting a Goddamn Masters thesis in return is an excellent sign for your future. I love this board so much because it's somewhere for kids to turn who absolutely give a shit about their future, but need advice on what to do. A place like this didn't exist when I was your age, and it pisses me off every day. Merely the fact that you are mindful of the type of content colleges will want to see in three years puts you so unbelievably far ahead of the game. You don't need a hobby nownownow. But try some stuff. Do things you might typically pass off as not worth your time, if only because some random dude on Reddit gave you the scoop ahead of time. Then, if you like it, keep going.

I am not the person to ask how to get more sleep.

And lastly: good, cool, passionate, driven person is not a trait you train for. At least not that I've seen. Instead, every teenager I have ever worked with I have considered a good, cool, passionate, driven person. I think it comes with the territory of the type of young person who cares enough to contact a man off Reddit to help them get into college. But also it's emblematic of a new generation of young people that are objectively incredible. One of my favorite lines is, ""teenagers remain undefeated."" I do not think you will be the one to break up this perfect season.

I commute to 40 minutes each way to school everyday and commute 30 minutes to world every weekend. My family doesn't have a lot of money so this car was from 1990. All of my money went to fixing the car since it always had problems 

Well, yesterday while I was driving on the highway my car started smoking and trembling. 
I got help from my dad and we found out it is totaled. I've had the car for four years and I'm just devastated. 

Now I have to depend on my parents for rides to school and they can be very overbearing and make me feel worse. 

I owe the school $1,500 in remaining tuition after aid and scholarships. And I still haven't been able to find the money for even payment plans. I

I'm just so overwhelmed. I am also a transfer student from last year, so I already have basically no friends in school since I also commute and know no one still. I always feel so alone on campus since Im one of the only minorities. I also have mild OCD, dysthymia, and social anxiety disorder, It makes everything so hard. 

I have an internship three days a week, I'm in my senior year of college. I have so many bills to pay now. I have no car. My depression is getting worse and I'm feeling more alone everyday. I have one friend to talk to but he has other things to deal with and I don't wanna keep burdening him. 

My cousin killed himself 3 months ago and I kind of feel jealous of him since he doesn't have to deal with the stress anymore. I just feel like I need someone to talk to."
j656k7,16,2020-10-06,Feeling like I made it,saint_oogie,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/j656k7/feeling_like_i_made_it/,"Hey folks. Been browsing for about two years now -- in August of 2018 I lost my job as a collections contractor for a large cable company in the US. Always had an aptitude for technology and was just a huge nerd in general so I decided at that point to start a proper career in IT.

I got a job only a couple months after that at an MSP as a Junior Systems Analyst with 0 professional experience, an AA and no certs. This was lucky because the company in question treated the role like an internship, so it was easy to get, and I was compensated/treated like an intern for my first few months there before making my way onto the help desk proper as a Systems Analyst.

**Fast forward two years**: I have just about two years of professional IT experience, an A+, Net+ and some vendor-specific certs that don't mean much. Circumstances have changed in my life such that the Tier 1 salary I'm making is not cutting it and I'm looking to move up more aggressively. I feel like my experience and credentials don't justify it but I start looking at jobs at 60+/year and pursuing professional development specific to my current employer to diversify.

Two months after starting that job search, yesterday I was offered a job with an F100 (that I had originally applied to under the title 'Data Center Engineer' as a kind of ""why not"" though the title has since changed but responsibilities remain the same) that will quite literally pay me twice what I was making on the help desk (~36k to ~73k) with no on-call hours, more PTO and prioritization of industry-standard certs and skills that will help me in my career long-term.

**TL;DR**
Got a 100% pay increase by changing companies with only two years of IT experience, an unrelated AA and my A+ and Net+


**Some takeaways from this sub that I think helped me:**
Apply for everything. If it sounds like a job you reasonably think you can do, apply even if you don't have the ""credentials"". If you don't like this approach, you can reasonably apply for jobs you meet a third of the qualifications for. 

Send out a LOT of applications. Sounds like the same takeaway as above, but it's not. I prioritized number of applications, which means as often as I could I hit that ""easy apply"" button on LinkedIn and the equivalent on Indeed for whatever IT jobs had the option. For jobs I *really* wanted I would maybe tailor my resume and provide a cover letter. For reference, the job I just accepted was one I definitely ""easy applied"" to.

Don't discount recruiters: I was placed at this job through a recruiter. Agencies and recruiters within agencies vary so it can be crapshoot. I had a call with a different agency last month where it was the typical ""they're looking for someone more technical but I'll be in touch with other roles"" -- she never was in touch. This recruiter (Insight Global) was motivated to place me in this specific position and with as high pay as she reasonably could. Humor them and see where it gets you.

Lastly, I'm not special. I worked with other Systems Analysts who were far more technical than me, worked harder than me, provided better customer service than me, more qualified than me. I just put myself out there, maybe got lucky and possibly presented myself well. I didn't embellish my resume and I was quick to let my recruiter and those at the company I ultimately interviewed with know when I was clueless about something."

Specfically, the recruiter mentioned I will be asked about things like how I would deal with a network outage while a VIP is on the premises and generally how I would deal with a VIP support request, aswell as other general support issues. 

The role will be in a Windows and Mac environment.

I do have some experience from a very short internship I did last year but I didn't really get exposure to some of the issues mentioned above.


Also, I have read through the previous posts on this sub and have taken on board the advice but I would appreciate any further advice!

j68085,3,2020-10-06,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/05/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/j68085/weekly_job_qa_thread_10052020/,"Hi all,

Here is the thirty-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

j689b3,138,2020-10-06,my teacher roasted high schoolers she knew who did “research”,Skinelle,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/j689b3/my_teacher_roasted_high_schoolers_she_knew_who/,"My bio teacher talked about a time used to work at a VERY WELL KNOWN lab system. She said that her lab only took white/Asian rich, privileged high schoolers from top high schools. How did they get their positions? Their parents or their friend’s parents, who worked at the place. Connections most students don’t have access to. My teacher said she never saw a black or Hispanic student from a poor school have an internship there because the workplace was racist. People in high positions from the place said “They can’t do it.” (why my teacher left that place). When my teacher asked the students who DID “research” what they did, my teacher concluded they didn’t do SHIT. They didn’t know what they were talking about. They still got published with their names on their paper to look good for colleges, though. People can smell that from a mile away.

So if you ever feel bad for being “average” in this subreddit, it’s not your fault. Don’t let privileged assholes in this sub and other college subreddits make you feel like you’re inferior for just having normal EC’s like school leadership positions. I go to an average high school and having “normal” EC’s is a huge deal.

I'm a junior studying CS in college, and I just got two offers for a summer internship, one from Mathworks (EDG program) and one from Capital One (Technical Internship Program). Which one should I choose? Capital One has significantly higher pay (about $4000 per two week period + housing in the DC area) compared to MathWorks ($35/hour + I have to pay for housing myself near Natick, MA), but MathWorks seems like a possibly more interesting/less scummy/better place to work compared to a financial company like  Capital One. I also have 2nd round interviews coming up for Discover and West Monroe Partners (consulting), but I don't think either of those will be better (but consulting could be a cool career path compared to being a plain software developer).

So for some background , I got my associates degree in applied science and currently work in healthcare, so most of my credits earned are (counted as) electives and (mostly) only have major classes left to take. I’m about 80-85% finished through my CS degree and I am planning on taking math classes beyond the required Calc 1 and 2, discrete math, and stats class. After some “calculations” it would seem like I can get a BS in (applied) math if I stay an extra 2-3 semesters. One of my future goals is to get a masters degree eventually so I’m debating whether I should double major or use that time to apply for jobs/start grad school. Also if I double major, some of the CS and math classes I’ll be taking will overlap and fulfill a data science minor requirement (will only need a machine learning and a python class). I’m not trying to be an overachiever or anything, it’s just that I want to have a lot of options when I graduate. Future fields that interest me (as of now) are SWE, data science, and AI/Machine learning, hence why I really want to take a lot of math classes. Do you guys think it’s worth it to stay for a bit longer? Staying for a bit longer will also allow me to do a second internship as I haven’t applied to one yet nor have I done a major CS project yet."

j68z9o,0,2020-10-06,Is an internship in the public sector worth it?,Zelnz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j68z9o/is_an_internship_in_the_public_sector_worth_it/,"I was offered an internship working on a military base developing software for the aircraft and communications and I’m not sure if I should accept or or keep looking. I’ve heard that the public sector is a lot more laid back and somewhat behind in the tech world. On one hand I really need an internship, I’m in my senior year and haven’t had one yet and I feel like I really need some industry experience so I’m not a deer caught in headlights at graduation. On the other hand I want to get something meaningful out of the experience. I don’t want to leave feeling like I haven’t grown as a developer. Honestly though, I feel like my coding skills aren’t very strong at this point in my degree, and any internship will be good for me.

Just want some opinions from others experiences."
j69zvu,1,2020-10-06,BS or BA: Am I hurting/limiting my success by not pursuing a BS?,cabbage-soup,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/j69zvu/bs_or_ba_am_i_hurtinglimiting_my_success_by_not/,"Just an FYI: This is a cross post from r/cscareerquestions because I have seen more active responses on here and the topic might actually be more relevant to this subreddit anyways. I am new to reddit so I hope that this is allowed. I am seeking advice from people with CS/tech related careers who may have experience graduating with a Bachelor's degree and may know what's important to consider for the decision that I am facing.

Currently I am studying Interactive Design (Bachelor of Arts) and Cybersecurity (Bachelor of Science) as a double major in college. If I complete both programs I will have two degrees. However, as I have begun my second year, I realize that I absolutely do not like studying Cybersecurity. It is far too dry and boring for me and I am very much regretting my decision to pursue the major. I mainly chose Cybersecurity because I knew that it would give me more opportunities for careers and money once I had graduated and it seemed logical to add the major to make my investment in college more worth it.

As I am beginning to have more free time, I realize that my true passions lie in game/app development. I very much enjoy the visual arts side of things and I absolutely love programming. That being said, I find many more in-depth programming/cs concepts difficult to learn on my own and through the internet. This is where I wish I had done a major in Computer Science. With my current program, I do not have the flexibility to add in any CS classes that interest me either. To top of the regrets, it is too late for me to pursue a CS major. I would be adding on almost 2 years to my education and financially, it would be impossible for me to do that. Despite being unable to add the major, I can pursue CS as a minor with my Interactive Design degree if I drop Cybersecurity. That way I would be able to take the classes that actually interest me while simultaneously giving me more flexibility in my school schedule without cramming two majors in four years. However, I am just not sure about the damage I would be doing to my success if I decide to act on this decision. Once next semester begins and I do not have a Cybersecurity class, I will be too far behind in that major to be able to decide later on to pursue it again. (This might sound like I am exaggerating, but I go to a small university and certain classes are only offered during the fall/spring and during odd/even years.. I would need to wait a year or more to take a class that I would skip out on next semester.) Thus, if I make the decision to drop the major now, I would only be able to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Which maybe I could be wrong, but I feel like a BA is lesser than a BS. So that's where I feel uneasy about making this decision..

For further context about my career interests: I am currently working as a IT administrative intern for a school district. Sounds fancy, but I mostly deal with the set up and imaging of district devices, chromebook repairs, and assisting teachers with basic troubleshooting. The job usually involves some networking projects, however this is a strange year due to the pandemic and at-home virtual learning, so this semester I have not had time to gain any networking experience with this position. That being said, the internship is 'indefinite' in length and I can stay as long as I am in college. If I dropped my double major, I would actually open up the ability to hold this position for 1yr+ as I would have more flexibility during my semesters. If I did that, I am not sure if it would be a possibility to then hold a similar career in IT after graduating if my only degree is a BA in Interactive Design and a CS minor. Or if regardless of my work experience, having only a BA degree would hinder my chances of an IT career. I am mostly concerned with working in IT because I feel as though those jobs are literally everywhere (unlike tech design jobs) so being able to secure future jobs in IT is very important to me. To add on to that, I am in a long term relationship and we plan to move away from our current area for a state that is more exciting and family friendly. He is pursuing a graphic design career, and has been successful so far (already holding a permanent position more than 2 years before graduation). It is likely that wherever we agree to move would also have game/app development jobs if design jobs are nearby, however I don't want that to be the ONLY career that I can pursue. From my own job searches, I feel like game/app development jobs are harder to find and are fairly competitive, so securing one would be much more difficult. I also don't know how easily I could make a reasonable amount of money with that career path. I am paying for college entirely myself and I will be about $20k in debt when I graduate. Ideally, I would like to pay that money off within 10 years or less.

Ultimately I am looking for advice on how to approach my college path and career path. Is it worth it to push myself through Cybersecurity if it is boring to me? Will I actually be limiting my options with only a BA or is this all in my head? Should I approach college from an investment standpoint and pursue what will give me the greatest return in the sense of a high paying career, or instead go after what I am passionate about and struggle to learn on my own?

TL;DR: I am majoring in Interactive Design and Cybersecurity and will graduate with 2 degrees (BA and BS) under that plan, however I absolutely do not like studying Cybersecurity. My ideal situation would to then pursue Interactive Design (BA degree) and minor in Computer Science. I also have the ability to gain IT work experience with my current job, but can only hold the position beyond this semester if I drop the double major and open up more flexibility in my future semesters. Ideally, I also want to be able to find a tech career regardless of where I move. Am I hurting and/or limiting my success in the tech industry by only pursuing the BA degree? Should I stick to my double major? Any advice would be appreciated on approaching this."

And the interview went well as they said they'd be sending me on to the next round. I feel like having experience as an IT admin makes me a low risk hire for this internship so I think I have a decent shot. The issue is that I'm not particularly interested in dev ops, I'd really rather find a software engineering role, but don't have many(or any tbh) leads at the moment. And because of this, I feel like if given the opportunity I should definitely accept the Devops internship. Where this concerns me is that the internship is only until mid December, and the person I spoke with expressed that they aren't looking to make this a full-time role. This means after the internship ends I'd be back at square one. I think I'd have to keep applying for SE roles during the internship if I took it, but my question is if having a DevOps internship on my resume will help me in any way when searching for a software engineering role?"

j6ez7q,13,2020-10-06,Surviving a Daily Bruin attack or encounter: A handy guide for all incoming transfers!,ericanthony1999,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/j6ez7q/surviving_a_daily_bruin_attack_or_encounter_a/,"###Dear Transfers,

It’s normal to be frightened when you encounter a Daily Bruin staffer. The reality is that most encounters with the Daily Bruin rarely lead to aggressive behavior, and attacks are even rarer. Remember, most Daily Bruin staff prefer to avoid contact with transfers, and any Daily Bruin editor you see on campus is probably just as frightened as you are!

Remain as composed as possible and follow these simple guidelines whenever you are in Kerckhoff. Soon you too will have more composure when sighting the DB because you will know what to do.

##Avoid, avoid, avoid

The best way to prevent an unpleasant Daily Bruin encounter is to avoid them all together. The Daily Bruin usually avoids transfers, and most transfers don’t even know when they’ve come close to a Daily Bruin editor.

To ensure a surprise or unpleasant encounter with a Daily Bruin member doesn’t occur, avoid moving through Kerckhoff silently and alone. Travel in groups (the larger the better) and make lots of noise by talking or singing. Put your iphone away and pay attention to your surroundings.

##When it happens

Remain calm and ready your Daily Bruin repellent (typically a copy of *Journalism Ethics: A Philosophical Approach By Christopher Meyers Oxford University Press, 2010*). Stay together if you are in a group; you will appear larger and more intimidating if you stick together.

Try to figure out whether the Daily Bruin member is an editor or a low level staffer. As you will see below, editors and writing staff tend to behave differently in a given situation, so it helps to know which species you’re dealing with. 

If possible, try to determine whether there are interns present or whether the staffer is defending an animal carcass or other food source. Editors with interns or columnists defending food sources may appear to act aggressively as they defend their interns and/or food.

Now that you know what you’re dealing with ….

##The Daily Bruin at a distance

If you see a Daily Bruin person in the distance, respect its need for personal space. Do not approach it, even to get a photo, and give it as much room as possible. Consider turning around and leaving the way you came. If you must continue, take a detour and give them a wide berth. The Daily Bruin can cover large distances in a relatively short period of time, so if you are vibing near janss steps, be sure to store your food well out of reach of any columnists in the area.

##Close encounters 

If you encounter a columnist anywhere on campus, especially Bruinwalk, stop what you are doing and evaluate the situation. Identify yourself by speaking in a calm, appeasing tone. Back away slowly, preferably in the direction you came. Walk, don’t run, and keep your eye on the beat writer so you can see how they react. In most cases, the journalist will flee.

If you are in your Boelter or other place Daily Bruin staff shouldn’t be, and you are sure they are only an intern, consider trying to move it out of the area. Ensure the intern has a clear and safe escape route with no people or obstacles in its way. Stand tall and look it directly in the eye. Yell at the Daily Bruin intern and firmly tell it to leave: “Get out of here, shill!” Keep copy of *Journalism Ethics: A Philosophical Approach By Christopher Meyers Oxford University Press, 2010* ready (with the shrink wrap removed) in case the Daily Bruin approaches too closely. 

##Dealing with a ‘defensive’ encounter

Sometimes a DB that feels threatened will ‘act’ aggressively to defend against a perceived threat. This is often the case with an editor with their interns, a beat writer defending a food source, or a surprise encounter with media staff. The closer you are to the Daily Bruin when it becomes aware of you, the more likely it is to react defensively: it may pop its jaws or swat the ground with its front paw while blowing and snorting, and/or it may lunge or “bluff charge” toward you in an attempt to get you to leave.

In this situation, the Daily Bruin doesn’t want to fight any more than you do. It is simply trying to communicate that you are too close. Try to appear non-threatening by remaining still and calm. Ready your pepper spray by removing the safety lock. Speak in an appeasing voice and back away, increasing your distance from the them. Leave the area immediately.

Defensive responses that result in physical contact almost always involve the Daily Bruin being surprised at close range, on a carcass or protecting their young. The very few defensive attacks by the Daily Bruin have been Editors protecting interns (but these are very rare).

If you encounter a staffer on a carcass, get as far away from the staffer's cache as possible; leaving the area quickly and quietly preferably in the same direction you came in. If the journalist is about to make contact, use your pepper spray. Do not play dead and do not act aggressively. Get as far away from the food cache as possible.

If Daily Bruin that is behaving defensively is intent on making contact, your first line of defense is always your I 💙UCLA Transfers t-shirt. That should be enough to discourage it and send it in the other direction. 

It’s the escalation of fear that leads to bad decisions. There have been a number of transfer attacks that I’ve read about that could have been avoided if the situation hadn’t been misread. 

##Repelling an aggressive or non-defensive Daily Bruin

Occasionally, the Daily Bruin will approach you in a non-defensive manner. It may just be curious. Perhaps it’s a young Daily Bruin intern that is simply testing its dominance. Or they are used to hanging around peopled areas in order to access food. Very rarely, it may see you as potential prey.

In any event, talk to the Daily Bruin in a firm voice. Get out of its way if you can, which may be all it wants. If the Daily Bruin follows you and its attention is clearly directed at you, then stand your ground and prepare to use your deterrent.

I am currently a freshman student at a University in Canada. I am currently taking my classes online from outside Canada and I was thinking of looking for a summer internship at the end of my first year. (Hopefully if I can travel),

I understand how difficult it is yet not impossbile to land a tech internship at a company when you practically have no experience. I am looking for a job at any place with the sole purpose of getting experience to reflect on my resume for next year and also learn a lot and make mistakes and grow.

I am currently having no personal projects whatsoever and I am learning python as a part of my school course and have some experience with c++(about 2 years but this was a part of my high school and was a very very very old version of c++. Regardless I am familiar with the concepts and know data structures, stack, queue but don't know about the other sorting techniques, binary trees and stuff. I know of the concepts but haven't applied them in some perosnal projects or anything). I am willing to put in the effort and wanted some guidance on what I should do to increase my chances of being competitive in the time I have.

Any help would be appreciated.

Stay safe and Thanks a ton y'all!"

I'm in my Senior year for a cyber security degree and I'm worried that if I don't get an internship I won't be able to find a job.

Earlier in the year, I've laid out some very specific goals to pursue a career in high-finance i.e Getting elected as president of an elite finance club, winning competitions, landing summer internships, etc.

However, in the past few months, regardless of the intensity or amount of desire/willpower/focus I've had when pursuing my goals, it's like the entire universe has completely conspired against me, and deprived me of even the smallest victories. I've been having on the receiving end of rejections from nearly all the companies (with 1 company left) that I've applied for summer internships to, even though my background in terms of academics/extra-curricular etc are strong. I just got screwed over in the elections for the club, which I'm very bummed by because it was always a dream of mine to be president. Even my search for a GF has gone off the rails, and frankly at this point, I'm very bewildered and flustered by all the shit that has been happening.

I've done a lot of introspection to identify my flaws, and learn from the mistakes I've done, but external factors that I have no control over have just been increasingly derailing my chances of even achieving the slightest of goals. I also do pray a lot, but at this point, it feels like an entire exercise in futility. At this stage, I also feel like a bystander, watching many of my other friends succeed, while I have nothing.

So redditors of this sub, I've got two questions that I really hope you guys can provide perspective on.

1. How did you recover from an avalanche of setbacks, and what sort of mindset did you inhabited to ""stay alive""?
2. How do you draw the line (or if you don't) between ambitions, and misplaced expectations?"

I recently graduated from UCSC with a Major in Spanish Studies (Emphasis in Linguistics) and a Minor in Education. My original plan was to go abroad and teach Spanish (or English) but, due to Covid-19, I had to reorganize my plans. I wasn't sure about studying in a graduate program. I wanted to get out there in the job market and find a job where I could use my degree in a professional setting, but I knew it was going to be tough in the midst of a pandemic. I then decided to apply to a master's program and I was thankful to be accepted into a Graduate Program for Spanish at Sacramento State. However, 1 month into the program and It has been the most stressful, non-motivational thing I have ever done in my life. I know that virtual classes are a new challenge but I feel like I'm doing unnecessary work to a program that is not intriguing to what I want to do, which is to use my Spanish in a professional setting.  I made up my mind already to finish this semester at all costs, stressful as it is because I don't want it to affect my record if I do decide to come back to graduate school. After the semester ends, I want to focus on applying to jobs for my major. 

All through my college years, I had the goal of becoming a Spanish teacher and totally excluded any other options that came into my path because I was just so focused on that goal. Come my first month as a graduate student to become a Spanish teacher and I don't know if this what I want to do anymore. I knew that I wanted to do something with my Spanish (I am a native speaker) but I just didn't know how I was going to achieve that. Linguistics has always fascinated me and I was so invested in it when I was in college. I now know that I want to use my Spanish in a professional setting.

I guess I'm writing this post to call any Spanish Linguist out there that could please guide me into the job field. Get some insight into what they do and what they had to do to get where they are now. Go over my resume and recommend any internships or opportunities that can reinforce my chances of getting a job as a Linguist. I also don't mind moving around the state. Not just Spanish Linguists (although it's my main interest), but I welcome anyone who has studied the same and can give some insight into what they do with their Spanish. 

Sorry if I was all over the place, I've just been going through a lot and I just had to say everything that has been building up inside of me because I'm just not in a happy place and school isn't really helping on that. I'm 23 years old and I just don't know what to do or what is going to be of me. I had this false image that school is the answer to a better life but currently, that's not the case. Although it does enable us to more opportunities, I haven't found the motivation to get me through this program as opposed to when I was learning linguistics at UCSC. School is always going to be there, but life passes super fast and I guess I'm just scared to be left behind. I want to gain experience first in my career and then if it requires it or I find that motivation to continue, go back to school."

I was furloughed in March, and due to being a recent college grad I really couldn’t wait around for the company to *maybe* bring me back. I decided to accept a role at a different company, taking a pay cut from $65k to $60k + overtime. My new job hasn’t been the best fit for me and isn’t what I want to be doing to develop my skills. 

My previous company has started the process of bringing me back to my previous role. I had to reapply for the position, and I listed a salary requirement of $69k. (I didn’t think I had much ground to stand on to try to get north of 70, but now I think I may have shot myself in the foot). 

**Prior to being full time I was an intern at the company for nearly a year, so I was well acquainted with the day-to-day and had been a contributor to a number of large efforts by the time I was furloughed.

This is short but it has to be my most embarrassing moment from my work.

I worked for an internship program for the last four summers. At the time this took place, I had only missed one day of work for a funeral. I loved my work and wanted to spend as much time on the job as possible.

The morning of this incident, things were business as usual. I felt nothing out of the ordinary, no chills, no fever, nothing. The medication I was on at the time always got stuck in my throat, so it was no surprise to me that I started feeling queasy after taking it with a big swig of peach juice. I drive off to work, singing along to the radio occasionally, blissfully unaware of what was about to take place.

I get through the security gates and I'm taking deep breaths to calm my stomach. It really wants to go. I somehow managed to make it to ""my"" desk (I used a second desk in my mentor's office at that time) without yakking. I feel the urge getting stronger, so I take a bottle of water from the palette in my mentor's office and start chugging. My mentor had told me previously that I was free to take one if I wanted one. I chugged about 2/3 of the bottle before I sat down. I thought it would calm my stomach as I prepared to pull out my laptop.

It didn't.

I felt a cold liquid squirt up into my nose and mouth. I barely manage to pinch my nose and ""chipmunk"" my mouth in time, spitting a bit onto the desk and chair. I'm near panicking: I can't breathe, but if I let my guard down, it's over. I could have easily destroyed my mentor's Mac desktop computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse if I wasn't careful, and that was not a bill I wanted to be fronted with. I had to clean myself up a bit before I dared to run to the bathroom so I didn't drip anywhere. I wipe off my face with a tissue. The ten to fifteen seconds it took for my nose to clear felt like an eternity. Finally I can make a mad dash for the bathroom. As I'm running, I pass by someone in the hall, asking if I'm okay. I quickly nod my head without stopping. I must have been quite a sight: hand clinging to my mouth, probably paler than lake effect snow, power walking down the hallway like an eagle locked onto its prey. I felt myself turn red from embarrassment. I finally make it to the bathroom, and I feel a wave of relief as I hurl a waterfall into the toilet, with a little blob of pink color (I never ate breakfast, so everything in my stomach that morning was the peach juice I used to take my meds and the water bottle I chugged). I'm kneeling against the toilet, panting with water dripping down my chin. I can't remember whether I was laughing or crying at that point.

Not too long after, someone came into the bathroom asking if I was okay. I again nodded, just managing a, ""Yeah, I'm fine,"" as I caught my breath. I came to learn from the lady that the person I passed by was her boss, who had asked her to check on me. She brought me a water bottle as I cleaned myself up. Needless to say, as soon as I cleaned up the initial spittle in my mentor's office, I messaged my boss and mentor then promptly left.

I hope I'm not recognized for this if I return to that particular facility.

Tl;dr: I didn't know I was sick until I almost threw up onto my internship mentor's computer and nearly died of embarrassment after passing by another employee in a mad dash to the bathroom."

In college I landed a summer marketing analyst internship at a gaming computer company, on the product team. It was amazing, I loved it.

I got to take data and then develop solutions to make gamers lives better and more fun.

And then I got invited a second time, and maybe it was because I was taking a class at the same time, because the assignment when it was given for the internship felt like data-gathering instead of actually coming up with the solution based on the data Gathering, or my untreated ADHD meaning I missed a lunch meeting because I forgot to set it on my calendar, anyway, it didn't go well.

After college I was offered a job for 40k as a marketing analyst for a cloud computing company.

My dad told me to turn it down that it didn't pay enough, I being young at the time took his advice. 

This was in 2014.

Fast forward to 2020
After working a mediocre retail job
 (I quit) 
I got into a job as a personal assistant
 (was let go due to budget) 
Then I worked at a market research company
 (let go, internal restructure) 
After that it was IT 
(let go, they gave different reasons to me and other employees) 
then I was a marketing assistant for a small start up
(they felt marketing was a luxury they couldn't afford) 


I am now being paid 45K doing work I can't stand because it's just doing what I am told, I just move marketshare around through search engine optimization it bores me to death and feels like mowing the lawn. 

I love the people I work with and I do my best at the job every day despite this, but I desperately want to do something more meaningful with my life.


Truth be told I've never liked any of my jobs because I have always felt disposable and like all I am ever paid for is my time instead of my expertise.


I want to solve problems, I want to create things. I don't mind if the problems are consumer's problems I just want to actually have the ability to DO SOMETHING.

I don't want to be told it's not my department or, deal with that when you've finished all these piddly pointless tasks.

I love technology and video games.
I love food, art, baking, design,
I enjoy complex systems and making sense of them.
I have been told I am a thinker. 

I mainly want a job with some work life balance that doesn't make me feel like I am wasting 8 hours of my life and not making anyone's life better. 

So what should I do?"

I was hoping to grind on leetcode after college and apply as an intern to these companies during every semester they open up applications.

We were friends with popular kids, but we weren't popular ourselves. So we were very drawn to each other and we become close friends quite fast. Everything was quite well up until 2017, I went on a exchange year to study abroad. She made new friends and she started to party a lot. I didn't hear from her for months ( later I found out here phone had been taken away by her parents and she was in BIG trouble).  I still don't really know what happend because I was literally on the other side of the world.

So fast forward to 2018. I came back from my exchange year and I was so ready to meet Charlie's new friends. They were very different from my old friends and I kind of liked that. We went to party's and had fun. So this may be a red flag but they did use drugs (XTC, Molly) and it was all so new and exciting. I did it a few times just because I was curious, but after those experiences  I didn't feel the need to try again. On the other hand, Charlie loved it and did it all the time with her new close friend Lotus. Lotus (F20) is a girl who doesn't go to school and doesn't work, she is nice to me and I even went on vacation with her and Charlie this summer (2020). She isn't really nice to other people tho and there is nothing more I hate then selfish and gossiping people. But this isn't really relevant to my problem. 

Because of Charlie I met my Boyfriend that I am still dating ( 2 years strong), and I'm so thankful for that because he is really my best friend. We have the same mindset and values. So when I started hanging out with my boyfriend more and more, she started hanging out with Lotus more and more. I talked to her about it a lot, making sure I was still spending time with her as well. Still following it? I will get to my point in a minute don't worry! Fast forward to Last week.

Sadly Charlie lost her job due to Coronavirus ( she worked full time &amp; doesn't go to school anymore). And suddenly she has gone COMPLETELY nuts. So she is still very very close friends with Lotus and all the other friends from 2018. I kind of distanced myself from them bc I didn't like that they did so much drugs and they just weren't my kind of people if that makes sense. BTW I'm in college ( junior year) and currently working as a intern so my life is quite busy. She on the other hand, lost her job. And for the past months I've been getting snapchats from Charlie and Lotus getting absolutely shitfaced every  fucking day. Ketting kicked out of bars and fighting with people. I DO NOT like this at all, and at that point I did not wanna be associated with her. But we have been friends for 6 years and I wanted to talk to her, you know like real adults. So this weekend I decided to meet up with her to get some drinks at a restaurant. I met her at the busstation and noticed immediately something was up. She was talking so quick and walking like she was drunk. So we sat down at the restaurant and started talking, well she started talking. About her wild parties, an her new amazing ""radical"" life. She talked about her self and her new friends for like 15 minutes before asking me anything  (we hadn't seen each other in 1,5 months fyi) . I told her I was happy with my new internship and I was still dating my boyfriend. She asked me weird questions like; don't you miss your single life and do you really see a future with your boyfriend. Knowing damn well that I don't like the single life and that im super happy with my boyfriend. I felt like I was talking to a wall, she was barely listening. She ordered some strong spirits (3) while I was still sipping on my Rose and I got worried. I asked if she was ok and she told me she never felt better. I asked her if she was drunk, because I really got that impression. She told me she drank 3 beers and 2 gin tonics before meeting me with some ex coworkers. So yeah she was pissed. She also told me she likes to see the judgement in people's eyes when they poor her a drink?????? whatever that means.........

When I got home I felt very confused. Do I still wannabe friends with her? Not really, not after what happend the last few weeks. But how do I handle this? Its so obvious something is wrong and she uses drinking an partying as an escape but she doesn't tell me anything. I don't want to abandon her right now but at he same time im so done with this bullshit and it's definitely not helping with my anxiety disorder :(. how do I break up with a friend in need, a friend I've known for so long. I really HATE drama but Im just really clueless. Sorry for the long story and maybe the unnecessary details but I just had to get this off my chest :)"

For some private reasons, I need to come back to a city in France where there are few startups and some video game studios (AAA and some smaller ones). I would like to apply to the studios and I have been reading a lot about people with a PhD moving to the video game industry (really scary stuff btw).   


I don't want to apply and then brag about my degrees and resume. And it's not a question of motivation and eagerness to learn, it took me a lot of will power to do what I did and I still got some fuel left :) Another good aspect is that I've been coding a lot in C++ (for the handcraft modules runnings on GPUs) and python (for the training scripts). 

The biggest negative aspect I see is that I didn't get my hands on any production software yet... 

I would like to come up with a way to tell those guys, I understand it's a risk for them to take but they shouldn't worry about me. I'm good at learning stuff (talking about the production aspect of the job here) and if they give me a couple of months to catch up I will be good at what they want me to do. I think I can do one last internship before finishing my PhD (maybe it's a good idea to get some experience in this industry). It will be ok for me to start as a junior and give up what I could get in the tech industry money-wise. 

Cheers,"

I've posted before about my current job that seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. This is my first big job out of school &amp; multiple internships. I'm struggling a lot with this job because my boss is incredibly moody and unhelpful. She doesn't communicate with me about many things and expects me to read her mind. For example, I blatantly told her I needed her guidance on a project yesterday and all she did was send me a pricing sheet that was only half of the project. I asked that we either set up a Zoom call to discuss in further or give each other a phone call, no response. Then at the end of the day she was irritated with me that I did not complete said project. 

I have a meeting with her tomorrow to discuss this communication issue, and worried she will also be very manipulative and make me second guess myself. 

What gives? Any advice?"

It was on Hackerrank’s pair coding platform. I was excepting them to give me a problem from Hackerrank where they give you all the constraints and example input and output. Like the traditional problems they give you on Hackerrank. 

Instead, it was a custom problem he wrote up himself and I had 10 minutes to solve it. I had to figure out if given 3 random numbers, find out if it is a right triangle or not. Return “Yes” if so, and “No” if not. 

I had the right logic but I just couldn’t get my fingers to cooperate. Looking back it was a pretty easy question but in the moment I was freaking out on the inside. I barely remembered what a right triangle was. 

My friend had an interview too that day for a full time position and her problem was actually from Hackerrank and had 15 minutes to find all the duplicates in an array. And I’m confused why hers was so much easier for a full time position. And another friend had an interview for JP Morgan and got a question that made you capitalize the first letter for every word in a sentence and had 30 minutes to complete. Why was I only given 10 minutes for a custom problem?

I have so many questions. How do I control my anxiety? Is getting 10 minutes normal for an internship position? I solved the problem on my own in less than 10 minutes on my own time but the stress of someone watching you and talking through your code is so distracting to me. I’m the type to code without having to talk out loud. 

I’m sorry for the long post. I’m just really disappointed in myself and was really looking forward to getting the position. I worked really hard to get here and I underperformed big time. Any advice would be much appreciated!"

&amp;#x200B;

I had a great interest sa IT related stuff nung teenage years ko  pero since I don't have money para mag aral dati, nagstart ako crew sa mcdo and then I worked my way up to be a Demi Chef De Partie sa barko. I forgot all about sa interest ko since kumita na ako ng pera.  

&amp;#x200B;

 I decided to change career dahil naapektuhan na yung health ko sa demand ng trabaho, so sa mga taong naka experience ng buhay kusinero sa barko they definitely know what I'm talking about, kung gaano ka stressful ang environment.   

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to start kase I've been searching around google, pero mas naguguluhan ako, I can't seem to find the right answer  

&amp;#x200B;

so mga successful IT people out there ano yung advise niyo sa mga katulad ko? Am I too late for a career change to IT and start from scratch? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I need to go back to Uni and get a BS degree?

or ppwede na yung mga vocational courses/ short courses to get an internship ?

How did you guys get internships sa mga companies??

And going back to Eagle there are so many things I wish it has like single key shortcuts for things like changing trace width or layers, double clicking on air wires or nodes to start routing, measurement tool to get distance and spacing of objects among other things 

However I also know I can’t keep using the software namely because you can only use one manufacturer, and it lacks some other important features like differential trace routing. 

But I’m wondering if other softwares like Altium have a better feature set than Eagle or if I should just stick it out and keep working on Eagle and hope that it becomes easier with time."

Just announced today, the ""Patti Grace Smith Fellowship Program"" will match 1st/2nd year black undergraduate students with amazing internships at top aerospace firms (NASA, Blue Origin, SpaceX, etc.), provide them with a mentor who has been a Black trailblazer in the industry (Astronauts, Former NASA Administrators), and cash grants to help cover educational expenses. 

This program is so cool for 2 main reasons:

A) It is focused on students looking for their first internship in industry. Can you imagine your first internship as a freshman being a SpaceX or NASA?? 

B) This is the first year of the fellowship which will mean this will be the best time to apply (smallest applicant pool). The benefits of these programs (Brooke Owens, Matt Isakowitz, Patti Smith) are INSANE and open a silly amount of doors for those looking to work in Aerospace. 

Here is the new website:  [https://www.pgsfellowship.org/](https://www.pgsfellowship.org/) 

Applications are open today until Sun. 11/15. You will need a resume, transcripts, letters of rec and a couple essays but trust me it is WELL worth it.

There is no major restrictions but engineers will have more chances to be matched with a host company due to the nature of the pool. 

If you are too old or are not racially eligible, please please reach out to any black 1st/2nd years you know and tell them about this opportunity, it could change their life.

j6w7ej,2,2020-10-07,"I have a terrible academic history, should go for a Masters immediately or after several years of work?",Yung_Thane,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/j6w7ej/i_have_a_terrible_academic_history_should_go_for/,"Hello all,

I'd like to begin by explaining my situation a bit. There is no one to blame but myself and my naivety for the situation I've allowed to manifest. This might be a bit long-winded and all over the place, but the gist is that I don't know whether I should try to get a Master's immediately after finishing my Bachelor's or if I should go into the work force in my situation. I am wondering if further higher education might convince potential employers to look past my terrible academic history.

To elaborate, when I entered high school I was convinced I wasn't going to go to college. After high school I essentially wasted several years either working part time, attending but not completing trade school, and eventually operating a restaurant for a couple of years, during which I took some business courses at my local college which I ended up repeatedly failing/withdrawing from because I felt that my time was better spent prioritizing the practical experience I was gaining over the knowledge I thought I would gain from the business courses.

Eventually around age 25 I realized I hated what I was doing and all the time and money I'd wasted up to that point. I spoke to a career counselor who helped me decide that I wanted to pursue engineering. My genuine interest in the concepts I'd learned in trade school led me to choose electrical engineer, from which I've switched to computer engineering.

This meant the business and many of the humanities courses I'd taken up to that point were useless. I had put off taking off my math classes yet, so I was at the same stage math wise as I was in high school, which was struggling with basic algebra. I had several Fs and WFs on my college transcript, with less than 40% completion ratio from my ""attempts"" at business classes.

Now a couple of years later I've raised my GPA to a mere 3.2, raised my completion ratio to above 67%, and caught up on all my math classes/prerequisites and am finally able to take a full load of courses next semester, which will be my second semester at University. I expect it'll be another two years at least until I graduate, if not more when considering the lighter loads I'll take when trying to find an internship.

I'll be graduating at roughly 29 years of age with a Bachelor's after over \~7 years in college when counting from the first semester I took a business course. I'm sure my GPA will be lower by then since I am now going to start taking actual engineering courses. I know my academic history will look terrible to any employer I interview with. For someone in my situation, should I consider continuing my education before I enter the workplace? Once I complete a Master's, would what happened the first couple of years in which I failed all those classes even matter to anyone? I would be in my early 30s, with no relevant experience but at least a Master's degree.

Is this a foolish thought or is it something that is worth considering? Would I be better off completing the Bachelor's and trying to find work instead? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this or provide any insight or advice."

**Greetings!** My name is [Nikita Proskurin](https://www.facebook.com/nikita.proskurin.779/), CEO and Co-founder of Rummy Games team, and the [Saturated Outer Space](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054080/Saturated_Outer_Space/) video game, and in within short stories I’d like to share:

**I’d like to share:**

1. My experience and concerns about starting and developing your own video game.
2. My beliefs in creating and developing your game you definitely need a team of driven likeminded people with passion for video games and ready to work hard and learn hard.

You might think that there would be plenty of rewards but the path is still not over yet. So we will talk about it later.

**How this text might be useful?** This is an honest story of the path of the indie team with some plot twists. So if you are indie yourself or do some thinking about joining the game dev industry or just wondering how people create fascinating worlds from scratch I believe this case is worth a look.

**Disclaimer:** I’m not going to tell you how to make video games but how I did experiments, what I learned from them, and my future approaches to management of an indie team while following the path.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Life on the Ship ](https://preview.redd.it/ra82dss43qr51.png?width=1849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=942e944b359e2b26636b51b04e62ce6abb59aee4)

&gt;*A samurai has no goal only path!*

**It all began in late February 2019.** At that time I was eager to get into gamedev but with no luck. So I even wrote an article about my fruitless attempts and soon after I was introduced to the Director of educational program in Russia “Management of Game Projects” who assembled a “Rummy Games” team as a Mentor by the time of the first conference call. They invited me as well as I was looking for an internship in a game project.

Of course, some of you would say that it’s possible to start solo. I completely agree with them but when you have got experience in AAA-projects and looking for some fresh air. Or a genius-introvert. Or you found yourself locked in the basement for 4 years with enough food supply, laptop with up-to-date game engines, access to electricity and no internet to distract you. (Un)fortunately, not in my case.

My basic premise so far is that being with no team behind your back is like being trapped in your own fictional world with unstoppable crunches and 0% of fun. Let me show what I mean by my series of stories.

There were four of us from the start: Game designer, Narrative designer, Developer (plus technical design), Marketing Analyst (me). All of us had some sufficient background before but only Vlad was qualified to compile a working prototype which he had been making for the last 8 months in Blueprints of UE4 and had been looking for brothers in arm to proceed further.

Our Mentor guided us in creating the Steam page of the game and helped to set up first milestones at the very beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Key feature of the game is deep interaction with HNPC \(Hostage NPC\) ](https://preview.redd.it/si5ctp483qr51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b3526bd886ea71f2407b7216fc48656fdab6af)

The idea was to finish the game as soon as possible. First, to announce the game on Steam (in March 2019), and make up channels for promotion. Also, work hard after getting home from daytime jobs, force all decisions and prepare a playable build from the prototype in 6 months. Then, release in August 2019. As a result, get a sweet case in the portfolio for our CVs and move further. Everything is covered up.

According to our plan I started the competitors’ analysis and target audience research keeping in mind how the game should look on release. Rest began to write the plot, develop the mechanics and transform the prototype into the game.

After 3 conference calls it became clear for us that we needed to bring some order into our chaotic activity. So I took responsibilities of a Project Manager: arrange and hold call-meetings with agendas and follow-ups in Google docs, track team’s commitments and other common issues.

Google docs is not suitable for such purposes so we decided to move to Jira and Confluence. Apart from the task management we also had to organize documentation of the project. These also fell into my hands as I had experience with task trackers and managing teams with dozens of people. Even though my expertise comes from a completely different sphere, business philosophy is quite familiar and people are people. If you respect your colleagues, take care of your team and do your best then congratulations you are a decent PM.

As soon as we established our workflow we found a Sound designer who composed fabulous tracks for the game. He is a real catch, that’s for sure!Unfortunately, due to some reasons unrelated to our project our Game designer left the project by that time. So the Narrative designer assumed responsibilities in Game design.

&amp;#x200B;

That is how the story started.It covers the time from **February to April** 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The moral of the story**\*: it’s easier to start as a group if you choose the path of an indie-samurai. Gather into parties, cooperate with people who are on the same wave as you and have common views. Join existing teams, share your knowledge and bring new insights.

I just agreed to an unpaid internship, and they said that after four months, I could either continue on my internship or I could be offered a staff position. However, the staff position would only be in title and wouldn't come with pay either. The rest of the staff also isn't getting paid. It's a recently started non-profit group so money will probably always be sparse. I should also say, that I'm trying to get a career in the non-profit sector. 

Is it worth it to accept the staff position so I can have the title on my resume? Or should I just remain as an intern after the 4 months (if I even decide to stay)?  Is it really even a staff position if you're not getting paid?"

I've started studying CS while in high school and later on did a bachelor as well in Italy, during all this time I had maybe two years collected of various small internships and thesis research internship.

What I found out is that I don't really like developing stuff but I like managing the processes for the development of stuff... How does one from a full on theoretical CS bachelor and future masters degree get into a possible Program Manager or (Google's way of saying) Technical Program Manager?

In my internships I was able to give my personal opinion regarding the development of stuff but I wasn't really on the organizational side of it, so in terms of management skills I'd only have a random software engineering class I had in my bachelor where I basically was the Scrum master of a team of 5/6 other students.

I wasn't going to write this post but something changed after reading comments over the last so many posts about finding jobs and interns. I'm in the same boat as these people and this really sucks. Interestingly, with all the negativity in the comment sections, somehow it is actually calming in our chaotic semesters. It feels nice to not be the only person who's going through this.

But the one thing that's keeping me together is the fact that I am just waiting it out. I was a sophomore last semester and I'm pretty sure I am applied to 100+ companies, and I started early too. My friends were getting coding challenges, interviews, while I was getting rejection emails after emails. I still knew that somehow I would land an internship even though it was already February. By the time we had arrived in February, my friends had already given up. They had given up to a point where they didn't even go to the career fairs for the spring semester. I still believed so I did. That was the best decision ever because I got in touch with two recruiters, one of them moved forward with an interview and I clutched it. Right before college shut down due to COVID. I waited for the moment and when I got it, everything just started to work out for me.

The point being, it doesn't matter what's going on. By stressing yourself about what's gonna happen in the future, you're stressing yourself two times. Just wait out. You got a rejection? Who cares, apply to two more then. But just don't give up. Nothing's wrong with you or your profile. You just need to wait for your chance and then pounce like a mother\*\*\*\*\*\*.

I am a mid-30s lawyer looking to make a career change after doing a pandemic-inspired revaluation.  Other than an intro CS course and Calc I, I haven’t taken any pre-reqs for grad school. (FWIW I spent the last 3 years as the Chief Legal Officer of a (now shuttered) startup and interacting with our programmers and data scientists and seeing what they did is what  interested me in the field and inspired me to think about changing careers). 

Anyway I’ve taken the GRE previously and gotten a really high score and had high GPAs in my undergrad econ and JD programs which were both at top-20 schools. But I’m still paying back the loans on those. I’ve received a lot of advice to just take the pre-requisites at a local college and apply to a grad program after that to save money and not waste time getting a second bachelors or paying for a post-bac. But my local school is a 2 year community college.

Has anyone else done this? With a high GPA, good GREs, and solid work experience, is it possible to be competitive applying to a masters or PhD program at a Johns Hopkins, MIT or Georgia Tech caliber institution if all of your directly relevant coursework and recommendations come from a community college and without any in-depth research or internship opportunities?  In case I need to get more practical experience before applying to grad school, would going this community college route hurt me with getting an entry level job in the field but at an established company?

I have started learning python a few months ago and I'm through with the basics of python after doin the mit ocw 6.0001 course(intro to cs with python). After that, I did not continue with data structures and algo in python (which I suppose is the next step I had to take). 

Rather, I had started working on a small project (a mini web crawler) which made me learn a bit of MongoDB and a bit of http stuff (all the basic things which are required to know for making a crawler). I have completed the crawler just a few days back. 

And after that, I had applied for a college project(making a placement portal website) and was selected, which involved backend dev but the thing is, the project completely involves javascript (react, express and some other frameworks) . The main reason for which I applied for the project is I was desperate to fill my resume(it's almost empty ) as I will be sitting for campus placements(for an internship) in a few months and also I want to explore backend dev. The project involves MongoDB (the reason for which they selected me, as I was familiar with databases) but this time I have to use MongoDB with JS. And for contributing to the project, I need to learn JS(I have to, from scratch). I have to learn JS and start contributing in 1 month.

The dilemma for me here is, I'm having doubts in learning a new language and forgetting python or not getting enough experience in python . I have not yet started learning DSA in python. Should I learn DSA in python and learn JS side by side or should I put a hold on DSA and learn JS and some framework in JS? I'm desperate to work on this project guys. 

Will it be possible to learn DSA in one language and learn another language from scratch side by side? Also can you suggest me any resources for learning DSA in python quickly and efficiently? 

Can you suggest me the next steps I have to take afterwards, for exploring backend dev and getting some experience in it?"

I am currently a PhD student in a science field. I accepted a full time job offer from a tech company (I'll refer to this company as company A) after interning over the summer which I am happy about. I am slated to start June of 2021.

One important thing to note is that I am not able to graduate from my PhD before then. My advisor wants me to stay longer for a couple reasons which I won't get into. The thing I want to mention here is that in terms of having content for a thesis, I'm good in that regard. My recruiter at company A knows of the possibility that I won't be able to start June 2021 so the plan is to push back my start-date once my PhD timeframe is more clear (its looking like spring 2022 most likely). It is a large company so there is some flexibility here.

Now onto the part I need advice on..

Through what I think is majority luck, I have an opportunity to intern at company B for summer 2021 which is known to be prestigious yet very demanding/stressful. I think it will be a good growth opportunity to intern there for a summer. I feel it would be very difficult for me to have another opportunity like this. However, I have no thoughts of joining company B as a full-time employee; I absolutely want to go to company A after finishing school.

Will interning at company B for summer 2021 jeopardize my full-time offer with company A? Would company A even be able to find out perhaps through the pre-employment background check? From the point of view of company A, they will want me to focus on my PhD during next summer so I could start as soon as possible. At the same time, I want to have a choice of what I can do during the summer.

Last thing to note is that it is not clear whether going away for a summer will lengthen my stay in school (due to me having enough material for a thesis). This is something I will ask my advisor about. But let's assume for now, interning at company B will not lengthen my PhD timeline.

Any thoughts would be great!

Thanks"

I am currently a sophomore in college, and I started my CS journey last year. Coming into college I was a business major and had absolutely no experience in CS at all. I always thought “computer science” was something like a buzz word. Eventually after seeing everyone take CS courses I decided to take one intro to Java course. I absolutely loved it, and officially decided to switch my major. Everyone around me told me that I would not be able to handle it cuz I was a “business major” and that I would drop out of it sooner or later. But I kept my head down and grinded through the year. I ended up taking a couple more classes the same year, and really got into it. Everyone around me was landing internships at Bloomberg, Facebook, Microsoft, etc... while I didn’t even understand basic concepts like classes and objects. 

Eventually I got through the year and was able to secure a half business half technical role at a small company for the summer of 2020, but obv cuz of covid everything got cancelled. So here I was sitting in summer having nothing CS related on my resume (everything was business) while everyone got to do their opportunities online. Instead of giving up (which I was v close to) I decided to ask myself if I really wanted to do CS. Eventually it hit me that solving problems like these are what CS majors do! I sat myself down and really just started to set mini goals for myself(example: do one LC easy a day). And yes there were days where I literally could not solve a problem on LC. The important thing to do is not give up.

 To everyone getting frustrated: I 100% understand you. After realizing that my resume was on the weak side I still decided to apply to 100s of internships, knowing that one day I would get my chance. I got few OAs and failed most of them. However I was given one phone screen and I spent days learning about the company and what they do. The best thing I realized was that I needed to channel all this frustration into a mentality of confidence. I began to actually believe I could do coding interviews instead of getting intimidated. As I walked into the final rounds I realized I had nothing to lose and that even if I fail I would eventually find something. 


This last week I received an offer for summer 2021. Literally being a business major last year to being a SWE intern now is something insane AND 100% POSSIBLE. 

DO NOT GIVE UP, KEEP GOING AND BELIEVE YOU CAN."

Is it possible or feasible to apply for an internship in foreign countries like USA, UK, Israel?

I think, I have a good resume and academic scores. 

As 3rd Year Internships are considered to be of great importance, I want this to be good. 2nd Year Internship was ruined by this Pandemic.

I'm (m/29) having a bit of a tough day (and on my birthday yay), because of a small teeny-tiny thing.   
I'm currently doing my internship for the program i'm studying, and for reference i need to mention that i have ADHD, Avoidant Personality Disorder (both of these two have rejection sensitivity as a possible symptom), Dependent Personality Disorder, GAD, and some other issues with mental health.  


Today my coworker who's also my ""mentor"" so to speak really shut me down in a way that made me really sad and I have a hard time dealing with it. It's such a shitty thing to get hung up on, but it made me, a grown adult man (at least by age), really sad and it bothers me how sad it actually made me, and why I am this way.   


I'm extremely insecure about my knowledge (or lack thereof) when it comes to the subject that i've been studying, both because I was unmedicated for more than 2/3 of the program and i got my diagnosis earlier this year, i've been getting passing grades but as soon as i've had the test i'll forget most of what i've done. Second of all the school or at least the program I've been studying at is NOT good, and it's agreed upon by other people in my class so it's not just me.   
So anyway, I tend to make excuses for my lack of knowledge by saying ""oh the school didn't go through this much"", and sure it's an excuse, but it's also true.   
I started my internship just 4 days ago, and my mentor told me ***""okay, can you please just stop talking about that? I just can't/don't want to listen to it.""*** (also to add, he was in the class a year above me so he knows), when i mentioned something again that I wish we did more of this in school because we barely touched on it and i'm ashamed of my lack of skills in that department.   
When I say something like that i'm hoping for encouragement but I know i'm a snowflake who's overly sensitive.   


Now i'm paraphrasing since we weren't speaking english, but the way he said it was a little rude for sure,  but honestly I don't think it he did anything majorly wrong but it still made me sad and felt like a rejection, like being told to shut up almost.   
I AM kinda whiny, but it's just how I deal with things because I always feel the need to talk about things that I experience. I've been doing SO much better with each increased dosage of my meds and my anxiety has really gotten better, but it's been awhile since I got shut down like this. I know I need to be able to take stuff like this and worse, i'm just not used to people being like this in such a blunt way like this.   


I don't want confirmation that what he did was wrong or rude (not sure if it was), I just need some encouragement.   
I need this internship to go well, because I need to find a job after I graduate this december, and hopefully I can get one where i'm doing the internship. I've been so broke and i'm living off around $100 a month for medication, doctors appointments, food, clothing, etc (spoiler alert: it's not working at all), haven't had a job for over two years because i had a burnout and crashed completely, ended up having panic attacks and my anxiety disorder got way worse in 2018, and I really need to get back out there and live my life, and I feel like i'm on the right way but it's definitely a delicate process.   


Anyway I just feel this sinking sadness, not exactly anxiety but just... sadness that I sometimes get when I feel worthless and I have a hard time focusing now.   
I need good vibes pls reddit."

Then out of nothing a sudden burst of anger and he starts ranting that i dont do my job ,that im lazy, he was like ""everyday you trying to shove your tasks onto someone else(which is NOT true)""

And ofcourse i jumped to defend myself and told him that every day im doing EVERYTHING EVERYONE asks me to do , then he said if you have a  problem with how the things are you know where the door is , as he walked away i gave him like angry/annoyed ""Suuuureee"" and then again he said you know where the door is.

My first thought was to give it another shot, should this happen again ill quit immidiatly.

I am figuring out if my rationale/decision is right. So I need to give you guys some context. Disclaimer, English is not my native language and this is a long one.

4 years ago I moved to the US from LatAm, to get a masters degree. On my last grad school year, I found an internship opportunity in my current company. Lets call it ""ABC Inc"" for protection purposes.  I explained to ABC that I was not a US resident and had no papers but my F1 Visa, so I would be needing eventually a work visa to stay. They analyzed the case, liked my profile and aptitudes very much and decided to extend a job offer to me. This job is a mix between Finances and Sales (it has a strong commercial component). They gave me a low ball offer with the possibility of getting into a visa process if I performed well. I obviously accepted, because my priority was to get my visa and stay to work hard in this amazing country. Important to note that I had to sign a non-compete clause that limits me from working in this for any competitor, for 2 years after I stop working for ABC.

Its been 3 years since I started working in ABC Inc, and I have performed in a superb, outstanding manner since day 1. I have achieved miracles for said company. To be specific, I directly increased the revenue of ABC Inc by 7% in my first year in this job/industry. I have outnumbered commercially most of the senior employees (with 7+ years of experience) of the company while being an analyst. I have developed a very substantial client base that generates more than a million dollars of gross profit per year to my company. 

After my first year, they decided to sponsor my visa, which I received 1 month ago (now 2 years later after that day). Obviously, this is an amazing achievement for me and I am happy. However, my first 2 years I was EXTREMELY underpaid. ABC was obviously taking advantage of me not having my visa to underpay me while I got it.  After they did decide to pursue my visa, things changed and I had a lot more negotiation power. Negotiated my salary strongly, by like 75% increase. However, i am STILL UNDERPAID. Just imagine how underpaid I was at the beginning.

I am happy doing what I do at ABC. I am really good at this, I perform like a top employee and I know Ill be this way in any company. However, ABC is a family business. A medium sized shop with 50-60 employees. And they are very reluctant to pay me what I am worth in this niche industry.

So I have been looking to the horizon for other opportunities, and I found an opportunity in one of the big, multinational shops. Take into account that this is a niche market.

I am scared to even apply, because I dont know if this is the right timing to take any risks. I dont want ABC Inc finding out that I applied to another company right away after getting my visa. But on the other hand, I am practically sure that I will be able to make the same or even more and transition into another industry while my 2 years of non-compete transcur.

I would really like to walk out of ABC in good terms. But opportunities in this industry are VERY scarce. First one I see in 6 months probably. 

What do you think? IMO, I should wait a bit to be able to leave on good terms. But i don’t know if i’m being naive. Also COVID plays a factor.

His response was I should own up to my mistakes and that I’m incompetent. He then proceeded to make fun of me in front of the senior grad students. 

I don’t know if I can handle this. I experienced bullying during my undergrad and internships. I’m the only POC in the department and I just feel so alone.

I got into the CS game late and had zero Leetcode prep at the start of this recruitment season. I still miraculously scored about 10 Interviews and currently have two Internships. I am on brink of a nervous breakdown and want to stop interviewing. 

Currently on my resume I have:

-1) Data Science Research Assistant at University

-2) Remote Front End web developer at a Third world startup

My options for my final summer are:

------------------------------------------------------

1- Product and Tech Internship:

Huge HR firm, so I will be working in back/middle office? Not sure what team i get assigned to but I could be doing backend development/front end dev or data analytics.

Pros:
- In my hometown, can stay with parents
- might get Software dev projects

Cons: 
- Uncertain team assignment
- Stiff corporate culture
- Haven't received official paperwork from recruiter

---------------------------------------------------------------

2-  Software Test Engineer (automated)

It is at a software and mobile design focused  mid-size Start up. 

Pros:
- people who work here are in love with this place
- My college town so... 
- Higher pay 
- Have already received the contract


Cons:
- will have to get a summer sublet
- BIG ONE: It is a testing Internship!!!!!
I am personally intrigued by the work but I do not want to do QA for full time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am clueless about what to do here. I want to make the most smart decision here. I am scared by the uncertainty of team assignment at the bigger firm but I am also horrified that I will never get another Software/web dev Interview again by working at the second firm.

Or am I looking at I wrong. Would the testing experience make my resume more diverse"

(iOS/consulting/something else)?",anotheranon17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j7mtkq/hi_im_a_new_and_confused_software_dev_wanting_to/," Hi Peeps!

I have been working at a well-known fintech company as a backend Java developer for the last 7 months now. The people are amazing -- very caring &amp; funny. My issue is that as I compare my work to my internships, I realize I am craving something more. The work isn't fulfilling or sometimes nonexistent. I talked to the senior dev who's been here for 2 years and he echos the same sentiment too. He asks himself pretty often ""why the heck am I here."" A lot of management changes are happening, work isn't distributed properly, and there's a lot of confusion as well. The biggest is that I feel like I haven't done anything in the last 7 months I've been employed here. I feel like I should be learning and doing more. This a completely opposite feeling I've gotten from my internships. I've had 5 internships during my school year (only 3 different companies and one of them is my current company) and I left each one learning and accomplishing so much. The projects ranged from building Alexa skills, AR skills, and full-stack websites to show the company's reach worldwide, for example. I loved each project. I fell in love with coding because of the impact I was creating and also how fun the projects were! At the very least, I want to enjoy what I'm working on. I realized that I like creating tangible things (making pretty websites) is also part of this category. I am utterly grateful for the job I have but I am realizing I need a new game plan for the future. I've been thinking of staying with my current company for at least another year. During that year, I want to ideate on what the next steps could be and prep for that.

Here's what I know I want &amp; love:

* I love being around new &amp; fresh technology
* People are def important. My current team calls me their ""little dolphin"" and things like this are very precious to me. I want my work to be social to some extent.
* Need at least some work-life balance but I suppose I don't care about that too much in my first couple of years of professional life. I fence and dance in my free time so need time for that.

The first idea I've had is to learn iOS. I thought of iOS just cause it's visual and user-centric. Thought it could be fun! I've been wanting to and finally started the famous CS193P Stanford course. But if leaning iOS means just fixing bugs for a company, I don't think that work would be meaningful. Some of my internships were at a non-profit and maybe working at a non-profit is the answer? My friend mentioned consulting. Changing projects every couple of years, people-centric, and coding something visual or tangible, yes! However, I want to be honest that I don't fully know what I want. I thought work would just click if the people were spectacular. That's not true. So Redditors, help me make my future less blurry please by giving some direction.

Thanks in advance for your advice!!"

I jumped the gun quite a bit on going fulltime since I was rather worried about employment and Covid. I have 5 internships (4x Shopify, 1x Microsoft) and now working fulltime at Shopify. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my concern, school is getting rather overwhelming. I obviously need to prioritize work but I also feel like I need to finish my degree. I reached out to my school and asked them about alternative routes to getting a degree and the only other option would be to finish this semester and graduate with a BA general. The other option being to just finish my current degree.

&amp;#x200B;

The question being, is it worth finishing the degree? Does the type of degree really matter? Can I still get a US work visa without a Computer Science degree?"

now i'm here, stuck at home studying in the middle of a pandemic while all my friends went back to dancing in the dance group we were part of, but i'm the only one who can't come back because i don't have the money to pay for college and dance classes, and I can't just drop out of college. dance is the only thing that kept me alive and happy, willing to keep trying even in the worst moments. without dance my life is empty and I would rather just die. 

this may seem like first world problems because a lot of people are losing their jobs in the pandemic and dying of illness, but what can i do if i can't stand this life? i hate that i have to live like others want me to live, i hate to know that soon i won't have more time to even think about dancing when the internships start, i want my life to end because i can't stand it. soon, not even the possibility of ever dancing again will be able to save me. I'm more and more drowned in a sadness that will never go away, and when the day comes and all hope ends, on that day, I will be ready to die. I'm almost there."

I am an Afghan national with a Computer Engineering degree from a Turkish university. I am currently in Turkey and would have loved to stay here, but the strict laws for employing foreigners coupled with the economic situation of the country has forced me to look into other options.

I also have very limited work experience in the CS field, mainly internships at a couple of no name places and some remote IT support work. I have done the odd jobs here and there, but nothing to put on a resume. And I just graduated from my program as I started the degree very late in life.   

I am open to move to any place, but would prefer the EU, Canada, US, Australia, and any tech hubs where job hunting would be easy and I would have decent wages. I speak 6 languages, but none that would help me in the target countries, other than English maybe.

EDUCATION:
So I'm in a weird spot. I have taken 2 computer science classes through my local community college: introduction to programming logic and a programming in python class. I learned some algorithms in the programming logic course (your basic sorting methods) and then in the python course I learned to program in python.

This fall I'm taking a programming in Java course which is more object oriented and a little more in depth. In the spring I'm taking a Java data structures course.


DILEMMA;
I'm not sure if this is enough for internships. I have a few side projects: various twitter bots and I'm currently working on a personal website but that's about it. Next year I'll be in a 4 year college but Ill be skipping a total of a year and a half so I only have 2.5 years in college. I really want to get an internship now so I don't feel behind.


WORK EXPERIENCE:
I managed a pool for the last two summers as the primary manager. I balanced chemicals and pressures and created staff lists and managed a group of people (20 or so lifeguards).

I also was a lifeguard myself for the past 3 years (I still am one at a different pool)


QUESTIONS:
Should I include these future classes I'm taking on my resume for part of my education?
What else should I do to try and get an internship?
Do I even have a chance at this?"

Might not make sense because I'm honestly feeling a lot of things rn so kinda rambling?

In Nitec, I had a 3.7 GPA so I felt confident that I could grasp the content of course and decided to apply for the related Higher Nitec course so that it would save me one year before switching courses in Polytechnic (my Higher Nitec course is only 1 year, as compared to 2 years if I switched courses so my parents told me to just go through with it).

My course is kind of hands-on and of course, Covid hit and we started having online lessons.

We started having group projects once after another at the same time (our lecturers assigned the groupings) which stressed me out a lot since almost no one would be replying me in the group chats (some said they had part-time work). And with people barely replying, there's no way I could one-man tank all my projects while dealing with individual assignments. I voiced it out with my lecturers but they just told me to find a way around it and work with my groupmates LOL. I tried ranting to my friends about it but it was no use haha when we go back to school for practicals, I see all of them laughing and getting along well with their groupmates while my table is just pure silence and tense. I tried joking with my table but no one responded so I kinda gave up trying.

Applied for EAE, got shortlisted, thought I did well in the interview but got rejected. Cried the whole day after that but had to be happy for my friends who did get in. 

Honestly HBL period was one of the worst periods of my life. My first pet died and I was still coping with losing a very close relative from the previous year, plus with the added stress of all the group work. I cried almost every night telling my dad that I wanted to drop out but at the same time I didn't want to because I already wasted what would be 3 years in ITE. 

My dad just told me to hang on and score good marks since my course is only for 1 year.

I thought I did fairly well for my final year exams but I guess my project work scores pulled it down by a lot sigh.

Went from a 3.7 GPA in Nitec to 2.0 in Higher Nitec.

Unless by some sort of miracle I manage to pull it up by internship, I have no idea what to do.

With a 2.0 I doubt I can even JPAE into the courses that I want in Poly.

I have so many questions running through my head 

**1**. my internship ends in early March (with report submission and all that in February) , but JPAE starts in February. I'm assuming they will take my current GPA score of 2.0 right? Because when I asked my lecturers they said they're not sure but will try to pump out the final GPA by then)

**2**. Honestly how bleak is it for me now haha (I know its really really bleak and hopeless rn but wanted to nail it in the coffin by hearing it from someone else). I really wanted to enter social work or ecde but seeing my current results I guess it's no use.. I did have a lot of volunteering in Nitec last year but don't think I can use it for JPAE..

**3**. Do they set aside places in Poly during JPAE for ITE students? If so, what's the %? Or are we basically competing with O level students to get in the course. I could only find information about this for EAE

throughout this course, I really wanted to kill myself. Everyday I would think about how nice it would be if I didn't have to deal with all of these ever again. I'm honestly really really tired. During N levels, my math was 1 grade short of the PFP eligibility, which is something that still sometimes keep me up at night. Going to psychologists or school councilors don't help. I've tried both. Honestly feel that everything is hopeless right now especially after seeing my grades. I would go for private school if all else fails but people around me tell me that it'll be difficult to find work after that so I'm holding out on that idea. 

I'm so tired of everything but I wouldn't go through with actually killing myself so not to worry. guess it's kind of ideation? feels even worse as all my friends scored way better than me and some even got their EAEs so they don't even have to worry about polytechnic courses anymore. I want to mute all my chat groups tbh sigh i'm just feeling really really hopeless now and i don't even know what to tell my parents"

I am 24 F from the Philippines. I am a Certified Public Accountant and have been working in corp since January 2018. I earn 600usd gross but around 500usd net per month.

I live with my parents and I help them pay our bills. I have a younger brother who has special needs and I help in taking care of him and buying his medicines. I spend around 150usd for family expenses.

I earn considerably decently and am grateful I have a job in during this difficult time, however, this job is exhausting. It pays enough to provide family needs but not enough to actually LIVE life and enjoy somehow. 

Pre covid, my life has been commute to work- work from 9 to 6pm at the very least- be stuck in traffic again and then rest for a few hours. I am also tired of staying with my family. I love them, but it’s tiring to be with them. They are not good for my mental health and living with them restricts me to be more mature, independent and make decisions for myself. 

Work/School:
 
I am not a cum laude but I think I did good in school. I was a scholar back then. Despite of that, I had some troubles at work. To be honest, I feel like I didn’t gain enough skills and experience since I didn’t start on the Big 4. I don’t know if it’s just lack of training or maybe I really am not just work smart or what. 

That’s why I am considering getting back to uni and take internship after— maybe in Norway amor Germany since I heard it’s tuition fee free even for international students. However, processing student visa is sooo expensive. I cannot afford it.

I am considering to be an Au Pair as initial step, also to save money and send around 200usd back home. However I still haven’t found hosts yet. 

I also tried searching for bookkeeping jobs in English speaking countries such as Canada, UK and Australia. Unfortunately, I think I am unqualified for some, and even if I am qualified, they don’t sponsor visa. :(

Other info:

I was able to save around 5,000 usd but that’s not enough for student visa in Germany or Norway or permanent residence visa in Canada. I have relatives in Canada but they wouldn’t fo extra mile to help me out.

I also don’t have IELTS yet cause I am planning to take it once I have a solid plan so as not to waste fees for it.

What am I looking for:

I am looking for tips on how and where can I move and start a new life, maybe even just for temporary residence for around 2 years.

- safe country and good quality of life
- combination of lively city and beautiful nature
- free education 
- a place where I can earn decently to pay for day to day expenses, being able to do some leisure activities like art/dance/sports, little traveling or partying and at the same time I can still send  200usd back home.
- kind and friendly people
- good healthcare

This is my first ever post here but I have been reading Reddit posts for a long time. So I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science in May 2020 and also have Bachelor's degree in CS from a state university in Texas and my marriage was due post-graduation and I have been going through a lot of changes off-late. Due to the marriage and moving to another state I started my job search process in July. So now I am unemployed 5 months after graduation. I can not solve LeetCode(where do I even begin?). I have one volunteer internship where I designed a website using WordPress (nothing much impressive). I applied to 300 places (some LinkedIn easy applies) and had one phone screen which I could not pass due to lack of LeetCode practice. What do I do? Will I ever get a job in the field with my given situation and inability to LeetCode? Seems like I have depression and I see no hope. I have had depression several times in college because of which my perfect GPAs would tank. I have zero self-confidence. My mind seems clouded and whenever I see a LeetCode question I just get more anxious and frustrated instead of attacking the problem and thinking how I can not code. Am I not smart? If I am dumb then is there hope for people like me to succeed in life? My parents have sacrificed a lot for my degrees and paid all my tuition and living expenses ( I am an immigrant and my then bf (now husband) is a US citizen.  I messed up big time due to depression. How bad is an employment gap (that is if I take some time off to grind LeetCode)? During my Master's I was more busy finishing school work which was not related to data structures at all. I have known people make get dev jobs 2 years back with easy technical rounds. It is funny how industry changes and now I can only get referred at FAANG companies that's where my husband and others he knows work. But me making it to a FAANG with my LeetCode skills is not possible anytime soon? Is it true anyone can become a good coder even though they are not necessarily smart.

I feel like my entire life was a lie.

Any suggestions or tips on how to deal with my situation would be useful? Sorry, my post is all over the place but that is only because my headspace is messy. I feel like I will be unemployed forever and never make it in the field.

I graduated with a Bachelors in CS in May 2020... I transferred to my school with an associates degree so I only had 2 years at my school to get my Bachelors. I did decently I think.  I graduated with a 3.27. I tried my best in that regard. I went to the job fairs from the very start but I couldn't find myself an internship during my time in school. Going into my last school year I knew finding employment with no internship would be difficult but that was before covid was even a thing. I managed to get a position at my school as a research/technical assistant but that's it.

So here I am... applying everywhere I can work at while doing freelance work. I've applied to full time software developer jobs...  technical support specialists... various other positions and I've gotten nothing. I came close recently. I got to the final rounds of interviews and after the last interview I ended it genuinely feeling like it went really well but I got the rejection message today.

This is terrible... I could make a post much longer than this about how terrible it has been but that's not the point... what I'm interested in finding out what else I can do.

I've applied to a few internships but I have primarily been targeting full time positions... the amount of applications I have submitted is in the upper hundreds.

Since I'm already a graduate would companies even look at me if I applied for internships or is it really not worth my time? I'm preparing to get some certifications and put in some time inn a few open source projects as well but including the time I spend applying to jobs and doing freelance work I only have about hours a day to contribute to these endeavors due to circumstances of life. I'm just trying to figure out what the most effective use of my time would be."
j7uluy,1,2020-10-09,Should I drop out of University?,darthjadus83,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j7uluy/should_i_drop_out_of_university/,"Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post. Obligatory sorry for any format issues as I am on mobile. Anyways, down to the main issue, I will try to keep it as short as possible. 

I (21,M) am a third year law student. The way a law degree works in my country is, you have three options; a four-year bachelor of laws degree, or a five-year bachelor of commerce or bachelor of arts law degree, after which you have to intern for two years at a law firm before you are allowed to practice. I chose the four-year degree, so ideally next year would be my final year. The thing is, and I understand this is coming from a very privileged position so I do apologize for that, but I hate it so much. These past three years have been absolutely hell, and have made me realize that this is definitely not what I want to do with my life. The reason I chose to do a law degree initially, I am somewhat ashamed to admit, was for the money. I grew up poor, my mom is a single-parent to my brother and I, my dad was around despite the divorce, but was unemployed for most of my upbringing but contributed financially when he could. I’m not trying to garner sympathy, just trying to put into context the reason I chose to do law; to me it seemed the easiest way to make a decent living and not be poor anymore. However I can’t continue doing something I know I don’t want to do. Both my parents are obviously dead set on me becoming a lawyer. I have expressed to them my unwillingness to continue, and they have both acknowledged it, but have urged me to at least finish the degree as I am in my penultimate year, which of course seems like the practical thing to do. However they still brag at family functions and say things along the lines of “...when you become a lawyer...” which is frustrating to say the least. I am very conflicted as to what I should do, as I definitely don’t want to continue the law degree, but dropping out would also make me liable to pay back the student loans I took out to study immediately. I have spoken to a couple of friends within the law faculty about my situation, and they empathize, a good few of them have also decided not to continue, however, all of them are doing the five-year commerce-law degree combination, which means that when they finish this year, they will at least have their bachelor of commerce qualifications. The same cannot be said for me however, I would essentially be leaving with no qualifications. 

I have also considered maybe switching degrees. The thing I am passionate about and what I’d ideally want to go into is racing and cars in general. I have tried to become a racing driver myself, however, and those reading who know anything about motorsports can attest to this, it is very expensive, and my financial situation cannot support this, and COVID didn’t help my plans at all either. My maths marks in high school weren’t anything spectacular, so mechanical engineering isn’t something plausible for me either, and it’s not something I see myself doing if I’m being completely honest. The plan I have if I do leave or change, is to take a course to become a mechanic, but at this point I’m not even sure anymore. 

I don’t want to sound all doom-and-gloom and complain the entire the time, but I have watched  my dream fade right in front of my eyes without me being able to do anything about it, and am now stuck doing something I hate, and at 21 years old, I feel like my life is over. I know that sounds irrational and that I shouldn’t feel like that, and every person around me keeps telling me “you’re young! You have your whole life ahead of you!” But at this point I guess it’s difficult to see that as being true. 

I guess what I’m getting at is, what do you think I should do? Should I continue with what I’m doing now, or should I drop everything and pursue something else? I’m sorry if this came off as more of a rant than anything else, and again I’m sorry if this comes off as very privileged, I do understand that there are millions of people who would kill for the opportunities I have. But I really just need some advice on what I should do going forward, as I feel lost. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated, and thanks to those who actually read all this, I know it’s a lot. 

TLDR: I’m studying to become a lawyer but hate it, should I drop out?"
j7v00g,12,2020-10-09,TIFU by revealing to my employer that I've spent one year being unemployed,pingouin_gaufrier,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j7v00g/tifu_by_revealing_to_my_employer_that_ive_spent/,"This happened on Monday.

I graduated in September 2019 from my master's degree (I live in Europe). Most people from my master's get a job from the get go because we conclude the diploma with an internship or apprenticeship, however my company made it very clear that ""we can't hire you at the end of your master's because we don't have the funds"". No problem. I started looking for a job before the end of my internship (and master).

I spent a few months looking into a very specific geographical area, and sent dozens of CVs but received no answer. Then I expanded my scope and sent applications abroad, until I got a positive answer. This was for a position abroad via a CRO firm. For those who aren't familiar, CRO firms work like that:

- the firm hires you as a permanent employee
- they send you on missions (usually 6 to 12 months) at a client's, in my case big pharma companies.

I went abroad (approx. 1000 kilometers) for an interview and met with the client. Everything went well, and the client wanted me, which means that the CRO was going to hire me, and after like 5 months of being unemployed I'd finally have a job. Except COVID happened. I couldn't sign the contract because I needed to go to the firm's headquarters abroad, and the lockdown started. My manager at the CRO firm told me ""don't worry, as soon as the lockdown is over, we're going to hire you and send you to the client"". I kept messaging my manager every week to make sure my position was still holding.

March, April, May... The lockdown rules were starting to get a bit more lax. I called the CRO manager again, and told him that I could probably come sign the papers, take my work computer and start my mission at the client. He told me ""here's the thing... The client said they wanted to continue with other firms.""

So the client choose someone from another firm, which means that my CRO couldn't hire me and give me a mission right away.

I was pissed, at the CRO guy because he kept telling me everything was alright; and at myself because I didn't continue looking for a job during lockdown.

I spent the next few months looking for a job again, sending dozens of applications. I got a few interviews (none in person, obviously). In September I was finally contacted by a firm that wanted to hire me. Similarly, it's a CRO firm that wants me to go to their client. I signed right away. The client is in a city that I hate but it's not  a problem, I want a job.


I started last Thursday! Everything went super well. People are nice, the tasks are interesting, everything goes great. 


On Monday afternoon, my manager's manager asked me to come in his office for five minutes. Very nice person, friendly and all. He just pressured me about the mission. ""This is very important"", etc. Then we chit-chat for a few minutes. He told me that when he was looking for a contractor, he was hesitating between me and another person who had more experience. He loved the fact that I was very keen to learn and adapt so he went with me. We chatted about COVID, the lockdown, and he told me that it messed everything up in the hiring processes. He asked me if it made things more complicated on my end.


I told him ""absolutely, in fact, in March I had a promising position via another CRO firm, and it failed because of the lockdown."" He asked me to continue. ""Well"", I said, ""the CRO firm were positive about their will to hire me and their confidence in the position for months, so I didn't really keep looking for a job. But then the client moved on from them and my hiring was cancelled. I spent a few more months sending applications, and I finally got a position here.""

He stopped for one second. His face turned from ""happy to chat"" to ""slightly shocked and even a little bit disgusted"". He told me these exact words: ""***Wait. Are you telling me you've had no professional experience in one year?***"".

I tried to save the face, and say ""yes, indeed. It was very hard for me and I'm very enthusiastic about finally working on a project that passionnates me."" But he just said something like ""okay, that's all I need for now.""

I think he hates me. And he probably hates my CRO firm that sent me to them.

**TL;DR**: had a pretty awful, unemployed year because of unrealistic expectations, COVID etc. New employer found out that I haven't been employed for a year and he definitely looks at me different now.

Hey I just started my masters in CS in Sweden (targeted towards cryptography and security) and I've been thinking in the last couple of weeks about what I could be doing in the future 2 years.

I've started studying CS while in high school and later on did a bachelor as well in Italy, during all this time I had maybe two years collected of various small internships and thesis research internship.

What I found out is that I don't really like developing stuff but I like managing the processes for the development of stuff... How does one from a full on theoretical CS bachelor and future masters degree get into a possible Project/Program Manager or (Google's way of saying) Technical Program Manager?

In my internships I was able to give my personal opinion regarding the development of stuff but I wasn't really on the organizational side of it, so in terms of management skills I'd only have a random software engineering class I had in my bachelor where I was the Scrum master of a team of 5/6 other students.

Any advice?"
j7vbuq,6,2020-10-09,"Have 1 associates degree, unsatisfied, looking for next steps",CompetitiveControl9,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/j7vbuq/have_1_associates_degree_unsatisfied_looking_for/,"Hello, recently discovered this sub by searching is having 2 associates degrees a bad thing on google, and finding a post from 3 years ago with 600 upvotes of someone asking something similar. I graduated from a private university, full fledged associates degree in IT networking. About halfway through my degree I realized this wasn't what I wanted to do, however decided to stick with it due to sunk cost fallacy or whatever you want to call it. Without boring everyone to death, I do not enjoy the field, hard to find jobs with this degree, whether that's my own fault or it being hard to enter the field without an internship, your guess is as good as mine. To clarify I earned this degree in 2017 and have not had a job in field at all yet, even had one potential employer tell me they don't hire people from this private school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few years to present day, I have discovered that I genuinely enjoy computer programming more than I ever thought I would. I've taken a few courses on udemy, coursera, jumpstart videos on youtube, you name it. I believe the best way for me to learn is to do so in a classroom setting and was wondering what you all think my best course of action would be. I contacted a local 4 year state public college in my area and was told some of my degree could transfer over and I could likely skip out on a lot of the ""freshman year"" classes like basic math and english if I wanted to go for a bachelors in programming and software development. My other thoughts were, what if I just attend the local tech school in the area and get a second associates degree but this time in web/software development. I have a feeling getting a second associates degree is likely a bad move but I am wondering if anyone has experience in this or something. Potentially going to a 4 year university and almost starting over as I'm approaching my 30s seems very daunting, I know people go to school at all ages but this seems very strange to me. I would also likely save $10,000 or more going to the tech school but obviously for a less desirable degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions for me on this I would be glad to hear it. Thank you for your time."

j7wdwa,1,2020-10-09,Question about Entry into Product Manager or Software Engineering Manager,Joshnee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j7wdwa/question_about_entry_into_product_manager_or/,"Ok, so before I begin this might sound pretentious as hell so I apologize if I accidentally sound that way.

So, I have been coding since my junior year of high school and I'm currently a comp sci major in 2nd year of University. Although I have been coding for quite some time, I never started it out of wanting to be a coder but rather just to code up a business idea, so I don't really like coding. Upon going through the CS curriculum and knowing what it entails, I genuinely don't think I want to be a software engineer and do not enjoy coding. I just don't enjoy it for some reason.

BUT, having looked around, I do like the idea of Product Manager or Software Manager, though it could also be referred to as Project Manager? But, so I want am looking to do that as a career but obviously, it is a MANAGER role and having read up on it, I am pretty sure 99% of people who make the jump to that career role started out as a Software Engineer.. IS there a way around this? I don't mind starting from the bottom and moving up, but is there a way to stay in the technological side of companies, without specifically doing the coding and eventually overseeing/managing the software projects? Because that is what does interest me the most. I know Product Managers usually are picked from software engineers because they need to actually understand the limits of the team, how engineering actually works, and to be able to hold a conversation with engineering team.. I do think I am capable of that, having coded(proficient in Java and somewhat have a grasp of C/Lua/Swift) for years now, obviously not as well as a full Software Engineer, but I think to a decent level, and certainly way more than an average MBA major trying to be a product manager, which I know many SWE people do hold disdain towards.

But how do you go about aiming for that role in the beginning? I don't want to switch to a business major even though it might make sense because I don't think I'd position myself for a technical product manager role with that degree, nor does it degree the job safety as a CS degree, with the future need for coders rising and also automation replacing people and such.

But I guess that's my story, and yea my overall question is: Is there a degree I should major in specifically for product management or software management? I don't really enjoy the CS curriculum right now and not feeling passionate about, nor enjoy coding. I have never really enjoyed it to be honest, I just used it as a tool for my entrepreneurship aspirations. And I really hope I'm not offending anyone who loves code, it's just personal taste to me. I wish I did though haha. I'm looking at internships right now and you can't just INTERN as a product MANAGER, right? I have looked for those internships. But yea, I don't want to go into the advertising or finance management internships, I really would want to stay within the technology/engineering sector of management, because I do love tech just I don't enjoy coding 8-10 hours a day, or have it in me to be honest..

Again hope I don't come off as pretentious as hell, I really am not trying to ""bypass the grunt work of SE"" or anything like that or trying to become an ""Automatic manager"" it's just overseeing and being a bit part of everything, steering towards the bigger picture is what excites me more than just coding one specific part. Thank you!"
j7xd8m,0,2020-10-09,Feeling stuck - not going anywhere in life lol :(,madeItInTheIndustry,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j7xd8m/feeling_stuck_not_going_anywhere_in_life_lol/,"This isn't a pity post for myself or anything, but I'm frustrated. Going to try keeping it as short as possible, but I'm tired. I'm a sophomore and I've been tryna get a real good internship for summer 2021, but it feels basically impossible at this point. I was dealing with it pretty okay until I found out my friend (as a sophomore) just made it into FAANG. The recruiting season feels like its over, half the companies don't reply to me, and the few companies that bother to reply will send me coding challenges. **They're not the problem, I am**. I can't do those coding challenges in the time they've given, so I basically never make it to the next step in the recruitment process. At this point, that basically means im **not** getting an internship, because I don't really have the skills. And that really fucking breaks my heart. I'm now full into the semester so its really damn hard to make time for interview prep, but I've just gotta find a way because I don't think I could live with the idea of wasting away another entire summer. I also feel like I'm taking way too long to get good at those leetcode/interview questions, and a part of me knows/believes that I'm never really gonna get there. Am I okay with having a career where I never make it to FAANG? Nah. I know there's other companies out there, but this is what I want. I guess its a hard pill to swallow that there's always gonna be more talented people than you in this field, and maybe just making it to FAANG someday is good enough (and it need not be right outta college).   


I dont know - I don't know how to change my perspective (that mastering thoes leetcode Qs is basically impossible) and stuff. Idk. I just need one good opportunity this summer (literally ANY startup as a SWE intern) and I think that might eventually get me where I want to be. On that note, has anyone else ever felt this way? And if yes, what did you do? How did you pull yourself out of this stupid thought process and how did you move forward?   


Not salty about my friend - they're super hard working. For anyone whose about to bring up my resume, I have a near-perfect GPA and my resume isn't the issue (that much I know). It's my coding skills during the coding challenges."

Excel online keeps switching date formats from British(which I want) to American. So basically, I am using MS PowerAutomate/Flow to add data to an Excel sheet. The data is added(from MS flow/power automate) in the right format i.e. the British format as shown:

[MS flow\/Power Automate details added in British Date Format](https://preview.redd.it/cn54nuqna2s51.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e434264eaf2de8e2c02f796ac175116a9fc83026)

Then, blimming Excel online(hosted on Sharepoint) swoops in and converts the date to American format for some weird reason. For example 08/10/2020 becomes 10/08/2020 as shown below:

[Excel dates converted into American format](https://preview.redd.it/9f3tat5fa2s51.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821280760895f6457f3cdabfbd24db86fb02a80b)

Even weirder the formatting and our locale are set to the British one and so the dates should appear as dd/mm/yyyy. This is shown below:

Could someone please advise on what is happening? This is driving me nuts

I have never had a tech internship, but I'm in a machine learning research lab at school. I am supposed to be graduating in May 2021. However, I can't finish the semester for reasons I'm not going to go into for this post. I've got 4 options for what to do about classes and I need advice on if any of them are going to fuck me over in terms of my career. I want to be a software engineer.

These are my options:

A: Take an ""incomplete"" in my classes to finish them after the semester is over (will look like a normal semester on my transcript by graduation time) take the next 3 months to get better, have a normal semester next semester, and graduate in May 2021

B: Take an ""incomplete"" in my classes to finish them after the semester is over AND don't take classes next semester to take 8 months to get better which would push back graduation to December 2021

C: Psychologically withdraw this semester to take the next 3 months to get better, retake the same classes semester next semester, and push back graduation to December 2021

D: Finish the semester normally and next semester, graduate in May 2021, try to keep up at whatever job I get (assuming I get any offers because right now it's not looking too good for me)

In terms of my health, option B would be the best one for me. I'm worried that taking time off will be a red flag to recruiters. Is that true? Would it look worse to withdraw or to 'skip' a semester? If I didn't take classes next semester, should I apply to internships for the summer since I'll still be a student? Should I keep applying to full-time jobs now if my graduation date gets pushed back to December 2021? Thank you for your help."

I do not know where to post this. But I am very demotivated right now, I don't know what to do. I need to find an internship before December before they have to kick me out of the education that I am trying to do. I recently started school a month ago in the IT field. I bought books, a laptop but it's near impossible to find an Internship in IT. I always get rejected because I need amazing superior communication skills which I obviously don't have. What makes it worse is I have a speaking problem. I do go to a speech coach for it but It might take time before I get where I want.

What can I do? I really do not want to get kicked out of my education. I have been staying still for most of my life and want to change it."
j830gk,1,2020-10-09,Should I wait for the RTX3080?,Kaanymon,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/j830gk/should_i_wait_for_the_rtx3080/,I'm currently awaiting to finally build my first PC after being an only laptop guy. The problem I'm facing currently is that the only 2 items I have left to get is a display and GPU and I kinda have 2 ways to go with. Either I wait for the RTX 3080 to become avaliable in my country (Germany) or I go for a RTX 2060 (been seeing some good deals around for it or ifnInfind something better 2nd hand) and use it until the 3080 becomes more avaliable and than either sell the 2060 or keep it for a future build for my gf or younger brother. I am someone very impatient and I do struggle with choices sometimes too much and I really can't decide what path to go as I really want to build it asap but also I want to have the right stuff in it. The other reason why I'm thinking for going with a 2060 is that I'm only an intern for now and going now for a cheaper GPU now would mean that later (hopefully in a few months) when I get a full time employment and then buying a more expensive GPU would be less painfull as for now I'll only be runing one nvme and get  an aditional sata when I get a full time position.

j84vrk,22,2020-10-09,"Finally got a job offer, wanted to share!",luctiger98,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j84vrk/finally_got_a_job_offer_wanted_to_share/,"***TL;DR at bottom, feel free to ask me questions in the comments too***

Hey all, I'm the guy from a month ago who posted a [somewhat ignorant question about getting an internship after graduation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ijtcgd/internship_after_graduation/) I just wanted to pop in and let you guys know that just yesterday I finally landed a job offer!

After months of job searching, what kept me going was seeing the stories of people in similar situations landing jobs. I know there's so many of this type of post, but I thought I'd provide my experience with trying to find a job in hopes that I can help others the same way that you all have helped me!

Since graduating back in May, I've been applying to about five jobs a day. I was really worried that my lack of work experience would prevent me from ever landing a position, but in the end I managed to find a job. So my advice here is to remember that it doesn't matter how many companies might reject you due to a lack of work experience... **you just need** ***one company*** **to take a chance on you!**

I've also never made it super far into the technical interviewing process before, so going through it to land this position was foreign territory for me. I definitely learned a lot. For one, **I learned that it's important that you verbalize your thought process at all times so that your interviewer knows what your headspace is.** Even if you're unsure about what you're doing, it's better to verbalize that rather than just remain completely silent.

**I also learned that we're our own harshest critics.** I've seen a lot of posts on here from people saying that they just performed terribly during a technical interview. I felt the same way; one of my technical interviews for the company I just got an offer from went horribly, at least in my eyes.  The interview was slated to be two hours long; I was given some ""working"" code and told that its performance worsened as input increased. Was asked to find the reason why and suggest my own implementation. Well, long story short, it took me four hours total to find a solution even remotely close to what the interviewer was looking for. Yes, four! My interviewer was nice enough to stay longer, I guess he didn't have any later commitments or anything. But needless to say, I felt like complete trash after that interview; I thought I had totally blown my chances. But I still ended up getting an offer.

I think the reason for this is because we, as interviewees, want our interviews to go perfectly. So when we run into any small hitches or obstacles, we become paranoid and worried that we've completely ruined our chances. When in reality, a lot of the time these interviews are given to a large pool of candidates; you don't have to perform flawlessly, you just have to be better than everyone else. **If you felt the question was hard, then that probably means everyone else thought it was difficult too.**

And finally, I wanted to talk about soft skills. I honestly think my soft skills picked up some of the slack in areas I might've been lacking: no work experience, some technical question mistakes, etc. After every interview, even technical ones, I made sure to ask questions about the company I was genuinely curious about. I listened to their responses and tried to continue the conversation based on what they said, as opposed to just saying something like ""Okay, thanks."" I think that really helped the company to like me as a person. I'm not saying your personality alone is going to carry you to landing a job; but I do think it's an important part of interviewing that shouldn't be underestimated, as it can give you an edge and make you stand out from other candidates. I won't beat around the bush; I'm sure you all know how socially awkward some CS grads can be... just being able to hold a friendly conversation is probably a huge plus when interviewing with these companies.

So yeah, after an initial phone screen, three technical interviews, and a final cultural fit interview, I was offered a position. After salary negotiations, I was happy that the company settled on the number I asked for.

In any case, I hope my experiences can help you all. Keep pushing, keep sending out applications. If you're in the same boat as me and had no internships or work experience prior to graduation, I'd say that you just need to remember that you only need one company to take a chance on you. It's a numbers game; send out as many apps as you can and one will definitely stick eventually!

**TL;DR: Got a job offer after months of applying, was worried that a lack of work experience would prevent me from ever landing a job but that's apparently not the case! I wish you all luck especially if you're in a similar position as I was!!**"

There used to be Web Programming option in the BA that I was interested in, but they've removed it so I'm thinking of using the General Interdisciplinary option to basically build my own Web Programming option. I would also be shopping really hard for internships and working on projects to build out a decent looking portfolio. The BA doesn't have classes that I think I might need for a job though, like Algorithms which I know are necessary for interview code tests and such.

I'm on my last semester of CS studies and during summer I was looking for job or internship, to start my career and complete practice as a module in university, but I failed to do so, so I accepted internship offer in university. The internship was just to build quite simple information system. The problem is, as deadlines are getting near, the internship manager started criticizing my work and the technologies I use, getting really agressive towards me. The thing is, the whole time of internship, I was communicating and explaining why and how I am doing all the stuff. So the question would be, how do you even deal with managers like this? In my situation, if I fail internship, I have to put my studies on hold till next year, find a job or another internship, or the worst case, if I get expelled, I will have to pay for all studies (government financing works this way in my country)."
j8am2h,1,2020-10-09,Recomputation of Benefits - Indiana,Tee_Kay8991,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/j8am2h/recomputation_of_benefits_indiana/,"I just got a letter in the mail saying that the DWD is filing a Recomputation of Benefits for all the unemployment money I received over the summer due to the pandemic. When the pandemic first hit, my employer told all of us employees to file for unemployment and that’s exactly what I did. I waited and waited (like a lot of people) to hear back about my determination of eligibility. I didn’t hear back from the DWD until early May (after i had voluntarily quit my job due to a summer college internship) when they denied my claim. At that time I called my former employer, he suggested I refile and that I would then be retroactively paid all of the money I should have been given from March-May (the time I was unemployed). After he said this, I called the DWD to make sure this was the correct thing to do, and the agent told me that my employer was correct and I should refile. So I refiled, sure enough I got accepted and money began flowing into my account. So I kept filing each week, thinking the money I was receiving was the money that was being retroactively paid from the time I was unemployed. I stopped filing at the end of July when I thought all the retroactively paid money was paid through, and thought that was the end of it. Until I got a letter in the mail today stating that all the money I was receiving was due back to the state because it was incorrectly given to me. What do I do, I am in no financial state to pay this money back and am starting to think I’m very screwed right now."

Before, I was going to a fairly prestigious school for CS, but was unable to land an internship, and found the general experience of the place to be horrid.  


I have a few projects, and know the basics of web development, how to start an express server, how to set up a basic application (I practically built an entire craigslist-like application (but dumbed down a bit), and had the rest of the team build the front end).  


However, I have been unable to ge ta single interview despite having applied to maybe 1,000+ places.  
I've only been contacted by really stupid third party companies that are more for people that don't have a CS degree, and I don't want to commit 2 years of my life to a contract. Especially one designed for people who don't have a tech background.  
But I would accept an offer if it was my last resort and they contacted me.  


It's been 6 or so months since I graduated now, and I feel like if I go much longer, my chances of getting a job are going to exponentially decrease.  


Should I join a selective coding bootcamp for the connections that they have and  the placement that they can provide?  
THe ones I'm considering are the ones where you don't owe money until you graduate. Being that I already have a freaking CS degree, I very much doubt that I would get rejected by any one of them.  


What would be a logical next best step here, and how long do I have to find a job before it becomes a downhill slide?

j8d451,3,2020-10-09,Learning Data Scrapping Worth the Effort?,Efran25,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j8d451/learning_data_scrapping_worth_the_effort/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**:

I'm a recent college grad (majored in math and statistics) who's trying to strengthen my chances for getting into some sort of data science/analytics role or internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm comfortable with several of the toolsets within data science and now I'm trying to apply that knowledge into projects. In terms of my knowledge:

\- I've coded in python for 4 years, R 1 year

\- Am familiar with and have experience with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit Learn

\- I'm intermediate at MySQL and working towards becoming more advanced

\- Know how to use Tableau

\- And I have a good grasp (I think) of regression and classification supervised ML algorithms. Will be focusing on unsupervised learning projects once I get some supervised projects done.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to now work on some projects that go through the entire data science process i.e. gather data, create a database, explore data, produce and tweak models, choose the best one and form some conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Problem**: So after doing research on project suggestions, I've come across many YouTube videos strongly recommended scraping data from the web for projects. I just spent the whole afternoon today creating a web scrapper with Beautifulsoup only to have it suddenly not work on me anymore (I think the website I was scrapping from flagged me as a bot). I've tried starting from scratch on other websites only for my code to either not work again (infinite wait times for my code to download the webpage info). I also came across Scripy which from my readings seems to be more efficient than Beautifulsoup but is a lot more complicated and I'm not sure I'll run into similar problems. There's also preexisting scrapers but they all cost money and the ones I've used so far were pretty annoying to use or had significant limits.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Question**: After all that effort and frustration, I'm wondering if I'd be better of just using/combining pre-existing data from websites (like the [data.gov](https://data.gov)) and focusing more of my efforts on creating the database, modeling, creating visualizations and analyzing the results rather then spending a couple weeks to understand data scraping. So what do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

**Some More Background**:

\- I feel really behind in my job search. I was actually planning on taking this extra semester so I really didn't do much over the summer. Then when the semester started I realized online classes wasn't very conducive for me and I'd be better off graduating and job searching instead. Because of my lack of planning I'm now 4 months behind in my job search due to the unproductive summer.

\- I've gotten a lot of rejections (which is very understandable and I'm sure relatable to a lot of people here) but it's been quite disheartening. Still I'm using it as a learning experience and it's helped me figure out what things I need to work on (thus the skills I've developed so far). I'd just like to increase my chances of getting into the first round is all (like everyone else haha)

\- I just got rejected at a great internship opportunity I made the final rounds on which was really disheartening

\- In terms of my interests, I guess I'd say I'm more interesting in analytics or ML roles.

\- Sorry if I'm complaining and sound incoherent, I spent the whole day coding/researching so I'm a bit tired and venting just a little.

I'd really like to hear others thoughts on this and maybe get some advice. Also feedback/critique on my approach and thinking is always welcome. And if anyone relates to this in some way, it would be great to hear about your experience too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edits**:

\- Of course I'd be open to learning and developing my scraping in the future. Its just right now I'm not sure if it's a super necessarily skill compared to other skills I can focus on to optimize my job prospects.

\- Also, I guess I'm getting quite antsy because it's been almost 2 months now that I've starting looking for work and I have yet to make a new project  because I've spent most of this time learning/catching up on my knowledge base. Because of this, the things I've currently applied to have been rejected because of my lack of projects so I was thinking I should work on something rather then focus on more learning data wrangling/scraping"
j8dj4b,15,2020-10-09,How do you deal with coworkers that play favorites?,Fuzzy_Frogs,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/j8dj4b/how_do_you_deal_with_coworkers_that_play_favorites/,"The main problem is my coworker with seniority ""Frank."" (We have the same boss.)

We work together, but he is in charge of a group of interns. There is one girl that is young and pretty. Frank favors her and gives the other interns more work, while this girl doesn't have as much and mainly socializes with Frank and the others.

For some reason, Frank likes to pit us against one another. He'll tell Big Boss that she's such a good worker and that I'm not. (Yet in private, Frank tells me I'm a hard worker and that I'm doing a great job.) 

Frank will go to lunch with the woman and then brag to me about  it.  I prefer to eat alone, so I don't care. They go out to dinner and Frank will invite me, but it's more along the lines of, ""Even though you're not an intern, you can come if you want.""

I don't understand why he wants to make me feel bad, but he seems to enjoy doing it....

Unfortunately Frank and I have to work together, so I can't avoid him. He sucks up to the boss and higher ups, so they love him.

Is there any way to deal with someone like this? What did you do?"

I'm in my final year of BSC-IT and the campaign placements are typical TCS, Infosys, with the highest package of 3LPA. The odds of me getting a higher package is very low, I know I deserve more and I don't want to spend the prime days of my life working at a desk doing nothing. 

I have decided to skip the campus placements but don't know how to go forward.

Here is my current skillset and projects:   
[Github profile](https://github.com/purplecandy)  


Tools:  
Javascript, Python, Dart, Flutter, React, Django, Express, MongoDB, Postgres, Github, Docker(learning), Linux.

  
Some of my noticeable projects are:   
Ural - an android app that scans your screenshots and finds the screenshot by searching its content  
Heron - movie and tv show tracker  
Covid19  - app that shows covid metrics  
Nano - a state management library for Flutter on Flux pattern  
Coursera like the app - worked as an intern as an application developer 1 moth  


In progress:   
Supply Chain Management on Blockchain - final year project  
Fille Collector App - a microservice to collect files directly to personal cloud storage  
Urban Clap like app - freelancing for a Banglore hair transplant provider as a full stack developer.

I have other stupid projects too but they're worth mentioning on a resume. I also feel very confident in myself, I can take build complex projects from scratch and learn any tools or language as required.

I'm still OK at leetcode because I occasionally use it but I believe I can easily improve myself with 1-2 months of practice. 

**I wanted to know are my projects enough to get me the job for the salary I'm expecting? If so, how do I find jobs?**  


**Seriously, how do I find jobs or show my self to the recruiters? Can anyone guide me with a clear plan, I'm ready to grind myself.** 

P.S: I live in Mumbai but I'm open to shifting to another place."

I had finished my bachelor’s and needed to take a couple extra classes to prep for my master’s program in CS.

Dave, as he came to share, had spent ages 18-28 playing video games in his childhood bedroom, and from 29-35 he had had an “awakening” and decided to start doing something with his life. He planned on getting his bachelor’s in CS, but had somehow managed to spend 6+ years taking part time classes at the community college.

The guy was 35, had never had a job outside of one summer stocking at a grocery store a decade ago. Never paid rent in his life either.

When we met in class, despite his past I was impressed with Dave for trying to turn his life around. This guy was smart, but over time I started seeing another side of him.

Dave constantly complains about his parents, the ones who pay his every expense, including a reloadable Starbucks card and an annual Disneyland membership, the latter of which he uses 2-3 times each week.

Anytime I offered to help Dave get a good starting job in IT or CS, he’d laugh and say “I couldn’t possibly work even part time with my academic schedule”, or “$30/hour? I’ll be making 3 times that when I finish my degree”. What makes him think that? His 3 months of job market experience from 2005?

At the same time, he always went around saying he knew more than his professors did, he should just teach the class, etc.. He’d tell everyone he’s a computer scientist and a “true academic”.

Well this summer I got an internship-turned-job at a major tech company. I am finishing my master’s next year. The sad thing is, my friendship with Dave was over within 2 months of me getting this internship. He started calling me a “sell out” and saying things like working students didn’t actually care about understanding computer science, they just lied and cheated to get through classes.

When I told him that wasn’t true, and that lots of students work, his response was to ignore me for a week and then write a 4 page letter saying I don’t understand how hard he has it.

The entitlement is mind blowing, for a near-middle aged man who has never supported himself, to tell someone who worked multiple jobs through most college, who now works full time and mentors kids in STEM while finishing a second degree, that she doesn’t appreciate how hard HE has it.

Hope he’s still having a good time spending 40 hours/week studying and being a “computer scientist” at Starbucks.

Tl;dr: My former friend has never worked or paid rent in his life, but thinks he’s better than working students and a “true academic”."

I would really appreciate in people who are in their MSCS now or have knowledge of the field could provide their insight.

My profile:

BTech in CSE, 2020 grad with a CGPA of 9.01/10

1 full length paper published in a Springer LNEE, 2 posters at HiPC 2019 and 4 papers submitted at international journals and conferences, should have acceptances from the same by application deadlines.

Research internships at a tech giant as well as a full time offer that got rescinded due to COVID. Received and took up another offer from a networking giant during the pandemic.

Im trying to write up a decently good SoP, would welcome advice about this too, and have pretty good LoRs.

I think this pretty much sums up my profile, along with 10s of college and a couple of industry sponsored projects.

I had finished my bachelor’s and needed to take a couple extra classes to prep for my master’s program in CS.

Dave, as he came to share, had spent ages 18-28 playing video games in his childhood bedroom, and from 29-35 he had had an “awakening” and decided to start doing something with his life. He planned on getting his bachelor’s in CS, but had somehow managed to spend 6+ years taking part time classes at the community college.

The guy was 35, had never had a job outside of one summer stocking at a grocery store a decade ago. Never paid rent in his life either.

When we met in class, despite his past I was impressed with Dave for trying to turn his life around. This guy was smart, but over time I started seeing another side of him.

Dave constantly complains about his parents, the ones who pay his every expense, including a reloadable Starbucks card and an annual Disneyland membership, the latter of which he uses 2-3 times each week.

Anytime I offered to help Dave get a good starting job in IT or CS, he’d laugh and say “I couldn’t possibly work even part time with my academic schedule”, or “$30/hour? I’ll be making 3 times that when I finish my degree”. What makes him think that? His 3 months of job market experience from 2005?

At the same time, he always went around saying he knew more than his professors did, he should just teach the class, etc.. He’d tell everyone he’s a computer scientist and a “true academic”.

Well this summer I got an internship-turned-job at a major tech company. I am finishing my master’s next year. The sad thing is, my friendship with Dave was over within 2 months of me getting this internship. He started calling me a “sell out” and saying things like working students didn’t actually care about understanding computer science, they just lied and cheated to get through classes.

j8m1cf,0,2020-10-10,Finance in Luxembourg,tapwater04,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/j8m1cf/finance_in_luxembourg/," 

Hello everyone,

I am going to graduate soon and since the [unicareers.lu](https://unicareers.lu/)  career fair is approaching I think this is the perfect opportunity for  me to get in touch with potentially great employers in the future.

Despite  soon having 2 technical degrees (I study in NL), my primary interests  revolve around finance, consulting or investment banking. Even though I  have a great academic record, some cool extracurricular courses and  internships in top oil&amp;gas company, I do not have what you call  ""branded schools"" so based on my experiences so far, I should not put  all my eggs in the consulting basket, given that it sometimes seems so  elitist.

My goal is to find a  place where I can learn a lot and progress quickly, doing things that  challenge me. Since I perceive Luxembourg as a really really diverse  place considered as #1 in finance, I am naturally attracted to it. My  uncertainty is that I am not familiar with the ""big"" names in the  financial sector(corp finance, IB, PE, VC etc) of Luxembourg which would  be regarded as great places to develop yourself quickly and progress on  the career ladder or used as a leverage to go to a top MBA and then  enter an IB/consulting industry.

Don't  get me wrong, but I do not want to end up at an average company or a  bank with a great previous record if I can do much better.

I speak English but I am a few months away from achieving a B2 in German which based on my understanding can be quite an asset.

Could  anyone share their experiences with me or perhaps steer me in the right  direction in terms of what kind of positions in what kind of companies  would enable me to reach my potential?

thanks in advance :)"

Ok here is the scoop. I have graduated in May dual majoring in Information Systems and Finance. I have two internships under my belt one supporting a financial application (solving basic accounting issues/building SQL quires to pull Adhoc data and build SSRS reports). My last one was a more project management role where I assisted the PM for an ERP implementation (a lot of documentation for gathering requirements, testing, and training). 

I have been applying to Business analyst, application support analyst, and general analyst roles for about 5 months now and I finally received an offer but I am feeling uncomfortable about it. It is a data analyst role in Detroit, compensation is $60k plus a 2k bonus which I will not receive this year. 

I looked up reviews about this position and they were not positive/mixed reviews and I can tell the company writes fake reviews. A couple says that the technology is out of date, there isn’t much training that you receive and pretty much no career growth. I also have to pass a Microsoft SQL cert in 6 months or I will be fired due to this position being heavily SQL dependent and will not receive 401k benefits till after 6 months. I have other interviews next week with other companies but I am just ready to work and I am tired of applying and interviewing. I felt this position was also easy to get, the whole interviewing process was fast and I didn’t do the best in the interview. It sounds like there’s a lot of turnover for this position.

I am also thinking about not going into an analyst role yet and just going into more of a support role as to me that sounds more enjoyable rather than working with data all day building reports, but it does not pay as much. But hopefully, I will find what area of IT I enjoy the most.

So should I just accept this position get some more experience for a year or so than go from there or should I decline it and find other opportunities? Sorry for the long post."

I have interned at 2 companies in the past year, developed and maintaining numerous passion projects, and am involved with the open source community. I don't want to sound cocky but compared to an average CS student I am way ahead and industry ready.

I have been applying for summer 2021 internships for the past 3 months now and have interviewed a lot. I was rejected for every single one of them. Normally I wouldn't mind rejection, I have been rejected in the past but I persevere through it. However, I see all my female friends getting internship offers from big companies like Lockheed, Fidelity, Charles Schwaab, Toyota, etc without much effort. I know these people, so I have an idea about how good they are with CS, and most of them don't even know how to call an API.

I feel like sh\*t knowing companies value your gender more than they value your merit. I spent the last 4 years of my life learning and studying technologies, making projects, etc while the girls were roaming around care-free not putting in the effort.

I may come off as jealous here, I am not. I know I will get some kind of opportunity down the line, I just felt like ranting about how easy it is for females to get opportunities in CS regardless of their skills.

Do you guys have any thoughts?

EDIT: After reading most of your comments, I would like to say I’m not blaming my rejection on women. I am just saying that the whole application process for females in tech is way easier than men. I’m saying they have it easy. I don’t know if it applies for everyone but what I’ve observed so far. I just wanted to bring this topic for discussion to see what people think

j8q5ly,7,2020-10-10,CS Grad School for an ME who loves code?,SushiFusion1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j8q5ly/cs_grad_school_for_an_me_who_loves_code/,"
Hello all, 

I have a few cs career questions and am looking for some perspective from you all.

FYI, I read some of the posts in the FAQ on this, but I didn’t see any where the poster had a technical background and was looking to test out of something through self-study.

Some background on me: I have a bachelors in mechanical engineering, and I did a minor in computer science while I was in school. I discovered computer science was my true love late into my degree, if I had discovered it earlier I would have switched majors entirely.

I did some computer science work in two internships in school. The first, big data work (weird for an ME, I know) and in the second I designed a tool (so did all the ME design) and then interfaced everything and wrote a mating software component. So, while I don’t have a BSCS, I have experience programming in C#, java, C, C++, SQL, VBA, and python.

I have been out of school for about two years, working in a different job that is more a blend of EE/ME in test/quality. There are less opportunities to code, but I try to seize every opportunity to automate processes, script, etc. I am also the point of contact for interfacing issues we discover with our embedded systems and software teams, since I can “speak that language” I guess.

I have been considering getting my masters degree in computer science (online) for the last year. My company would be willing to pay for it as well. I am hoping to move more to a systems role long term, which would be a good move in my company. I found an accredited school to do this with and have spoken to the recruiter. Since my background is ME, I have a lot of the requirements, but I am missing three of the prerequisite courses. The highest course I took in CS was data structures, which I loved. 

I have been studying in an attempt to test out of three prerequisite courses to get into the masters program. It is only $60 a test and they provide review material. So far, according to the quizzes they provide, things seem to be going fine. There are less exercises than I would like, so I am trying to supplement with material from other universities that is open source. 

I guess my question is:

Is it crazy to attempt to self-study and test out of three courses? I get two attempts at each. Computer organization and assembly language programming, operating systems, and principles of programming languages are the courses.

Would I be better off trying to find a way to take the full courses from a university?

It is obviously way cheaper to self educate try and test out, but I also don’t want to set myself up to fail in the masters program if I end up missing core content somehow. 

I am generally disciplined and able to commit to self-study, but I want to set myself up to succeed later as well.

Any thoughts?"
j8qb68,6,2020-10-10,Advice/ direction.,WarmFigNewton,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/j8qb68/advice_direction/,"Hello everyone. I’m a newbie in the field of IT and would love some direction. I’m currently 22 and my graduated with a degree in biology in may. After not being accepted into medical school I decided to switch careers to IT (something I have always had a passion for, parents wanted me to be a doctor, I’ll save you the story) and was graciously accepted to a masters of science in Information Technology program that I’m currently in. I am currently taking Python/ SQL/ Management information systems and will be taking more courses the next 8 week block but here’s my question.

I really have no idea what direction I should go with my degree. Healthcare IT makes sense given my background but how do I stand out with NO prior IT experience/ jobs? I planned on getting my COMPTIA certification as my program offers it FREE (so why not). I know I should probably get internships, but so far I’ve had no luck when applying (I’m assuming from corona). I’m currently in MAX graduate level hours right now anyways so maybe classes/ COMPTIA certification is enough for now, but I will likely graduate in the summer and want some direction on how best to set myself up to be competitive 

TLDR; Biology undergrad with no prior IT experience gets accepted into IT Masters program in a career change. Aside from completing my masters degree and getting certifications (COMPTIA, any others that you recommend??) how do I make myself competitive?"

* Newly unemployed (laid off from Covid)
* CS bachelor's degree from a military academy 10+ years ago.
* Wife works and can support us both in the mean time. 

**Where I'm at with programming:**

* I've completed the Python bootcamp on Udemy with Colt Steele and am working my way through Angela Yu's web developer bootcamp.
* I've also started with Freecodecamp and The Odin Project. All of these resources are great.
* I do not really remember many of the applicable skills from my CS degree, but the theory and fundamentals still make sense.  

**Goal:** 

* A remote programming job. I *could* go into NYC every day but would rather not commute. 
* Possibly move on to cyber security (note: i do not have a scholarship to the cyber bootcamp). 

**Question:** 

* Is this worth my time? 
* At my experience level, would I be better off volunteering for an internship / open source contribution over the three months this bootcamp would take? 
* Are there any smarter paths to take to get a remote developer or cyber security job from home? Once complete with this course I would consider paying for PWK for an OSCP cert.

j8rikr,51,2020-10-10,In response to the non-premed chem major rant,forgotpass_wordagain,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/j8rikr/in_response_to_the_nonpremed_chem_major_rant/,"Context: I'm a non premed biochem major aspiring to enter a PhD program. Although this post obviously will focus on what's been brought up in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/j8byhe/rant_being_a_nonpremed_chemistry_major_makes/), I'm hoping that this gives generic advice to anybody going into UTD who's a non pre-med bio or chem related major on how a current junior is approaching things.

First, humans are different and so are pre-med students. Yes most of them care about their grades a lot but that's not mutually exclusive with wanting to learn. Saying that all or even most of them don't care about learning is... strange\~ to say the least. Pre-med snobs do exist, but so too do snobs in almost every category of the school. The only group whom I haven't met any snobs in yet are UTeach people but this is obviously anecdotal. Also, I can't think of any pre-meds who actively go out of their way to sniff out us non pre-med people to dunk on us, so if the pre-med people around you are saying mean things, just don't be around them and find a different group of people, whom are probably also premed students but trust me being bullies and feeling the calling of being a doctor aren't a perfect overlap in demographics. Out of my interactions with at least a hundred pre-meds, I've only been snobbed on twice, and asides from that it's only been either neutral or positive. Talk to people, get to know them, and if you don't like them this is uni; there's no binding contract saying you have to maintain contact with them for any longer than you want. If they're trying to force contact, that's really creepy and shouldn't be ascribed as a pre-med thing as much as it might be a stalker thing that you should get the police involved with.

Second, I want to mention some things I feel like non-premed chem/biochem majors should try to be doing for the sake of ""networking"". You don't have to do all of these unless you want to, but try to get involved in at least one EARLY ON. 

1. Get into a lab to do research and make it obvious you're not premed. It will help your chances especially if it's a chem heavy lab. A lot. Covid hinders the number of undergrads possible but it won't last forever either. Plus you should still be able to come in once a week and as long as you put in effort whether through a lit review project or contributing where you can, that's still a good rec letter to have.
2. Join the chem or biochem student association. Yes there's a huge load of pre-meds in there, but that doesn't change the fact that professors interact with it and it's something to put on your resume. 
3. Talk to the professors teaching your class during office hours about the class. Just because some pre-meds you know hate them doesn't mean you can't learn and network from them. Might be impossible these days due to covid though. 
4. Internships, SURFS, REUs, and a huge host of other research programs exist. Look further than just UTD, and you'll realize there are a gazillion opportunities out there. If you're worried about juggling the pressures of school with these programs, don't worry most of them are summer. If you're worried about financial pressures, most of these pay you 3k-5k stipends and provide housing as well. 
5. \[Bit ranty here\] Come find other non premed chem majors. Yes! We exist! There are at least dozens of us! Just because we live with a bunch of pre-meds doesn't mean we can't find each other. Freaking talk to people even if it only means responding to those who talk to you. To those of y'all who are also introverts like me, being an introvert DOES NOT mean you're doomed to social ineptitude (also shyness and introversion are not the same thing, though the large overlap is understandable). Practice practice practice and you may be able to reach the point where conversing with others is pleasant if not joyful, but maybe still exhausting after a while. That's perfectly fine. What is not fine is believing that the world will somehow magically discover what you have to offer by reading your mind, and using the excuse that you're an introvert to hide away every failure you might have. Please for the love of god do not fall for the reddit scam of ""me introvert=me hate other people=me a hopeless and misunderstood intellectual galaxy brain"". You might be misunderstood, but you're not hopeless. You don't need to fill the room with your voice and presence, but introverts if anything should *excel* at getting what needs to get out, out. 

Third, about enjoying classes and wanting to learn. The fact that there are more pre-med students who don't enjoy their classes than there are CS majors who don't enjoy their classes doesn't mean that you can't still enjoy your class. Of course, humans are social animals so it certainly helps if other people around you genuinely want to learn and get more than a grade. But there are ways to deal with this as well. First, finding friends of any kind of any major who enjoy learning things helps probably the most. A normal person's social world is pretty small, and what you perceive as the general opinion of the ""world"" can be constricted to the tiny size of your friend group if that's the only group you consistently talk to. Once again, as long as there isn't some pre-med student who's actively running around declaring their superiority over the peasants, pretty much every student in lecture become nameless people in a sea of faces. You probably shouldn't be talking and paying attention to other people when lecture is happening, so unless you come in with a general negative and fearful opinion already attached to this hulking mass of students, they really shouldn't affect you at all. Instead once you get out of class you can run over to whomever you usually hang out with and talk about whatever you like instead. Once you get to smaller classes on the other hand, people usually start to get more passionate about the class while names and faces stick far more. Admittedly, it was actually in one of these super small classes where somebody snobbed on me, but plot twist we're actually friends and even though it bothered me a bit, we're still friends even now after we resolved the issue and I don't immediately think of all several thousand premed students as genuinely believing that I've ""got it easy"" and ""took the lazy road"". I'm sure people who seriously believe it exist, and considering the number of premeds plenty of them exist, but even if there are hundreds of premeds (a completely BS'd number which is almost certainly still way too high) who think like that, they're 

1. Probably stuck in their own little echo chambers and don't come out much if at all
2. Not a part of the at least 5 other premeds who don't think like that, which is all you need to form a friend group large enough to occupy your social world. 

And if you can't find those 5+ premeds who aren't snobs, I promise you can find fellow non premeds whether through asking on groupme or talking to people. Once again we exist! There are dozens of us! Dozens!"

I feel like i am not good enough and once I get asked the Algorithm question during the interview I will just freeze and not know it and it will be hugely embarrassing for this reasons I want to cancel my interview should I do it?

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student from an average UK uni (top 20 I think, not RS) and I am looking for doing an internship next summer (I am ok with any country in Europe if the conditions are reasonable). My question is about if I should go with a 2 page CV instead of a one page.

I do not have any profesional experience and not that many personal projects (apart from a recent one that I think it is fairly interesting), but my university recommends going with a 2 page CV so you can include some personal information and references. I have been researching about other top unis recommendation for internships CVs and there is no consensus about this at all, some agree and some completely disagree (saying only 1 page, little personal info and no references).

I have done 2 versions of my CV, one page and two pages. I would really appreciate if you could give me your opinion. Which one would you go for and how would you improve it?

One page: [https://i.imgur.com/9FQVS5l.png](https://i.imgur.com/9FQVS5l.png)

Updated one page version: [https://i.imgur.com/gQxve5Q.png](https://i.imgur.com/gQxve5Q.png) (will add the A levels equivalence to spanish baccalaureate)

Two pages: [https://imgur.com/a/4jztHl2](https://imgur.com/a/4jztHl2)

If someone is curious and want to see the application which is my main CV thing, you can PM me!

I am far from proficient in the technologies and languages I am using and I know anyone with a little knowledge could screw my whole project.

Thank you for your time and I hope you can give me any advice!"

I am currently in my second year at university studying computer science, and as part of my course I will (hopefully) be taking an industrial placement next year. I am aiming to secure an internship in software development, however I am not sure if I'm ready. I can program, but I am not sure if I'm at the level where I can just join onto a project and work on it. On my own it's fine. I can open up Eclipse, for example, and create a game from scratch. Same with Unity and Unreal Engine. But the thought of just joining onto another project that could have been worked on for years prior is daunting to say the least. I feel like I wouldn't know where to start. 

I think one thing that could help would be studying the project for a few days before working on it. What do you think? How did you go from being to program on your own to being able to work on larger commercial projects at a company?"

I’m applying to whatever I can for this year since a lot of places only look for juniors, and the online assessments I’ve done have been pretty demoralizing. I‘ve done some leetcode problems and it just feels like a massive hill to climb and I’m not sure how I can even balance school and interview prep for next year. Schoolwork has been incredibly challenging lately, and I also have a division 1 practice schedule (though hours are significantly reduced for now given the pandemic). Has anyone been able to squeeze time for interview prep and still be successful both academically and in looking for internships?"

I tried doing the OA for the google Singapore STEP internship and the code I’m editor for hacker earth was EXTREMELY SLOW for no reason. It was impossible for me to type anything in the editor. I tried switching my session from chrome to safari and i still had the performance problems. 

So then I tried to solve the problem in Xcode instead of the built in editor and paste it in and it automatically submitted my attempt!!! 

I’m not really too upset Bc I was hoping to get the internship for the step program in North America and was using the Singapore one as more of practice, but it’s still  annoying how everything went down.

It’m on a MacBook Pro 2016 running the latest version of macOS so it’s not like my computer is the best but it’s defiantly not SLOW.

I don’t know what to do now what do you guys  suggest on me doing ?"

j8xe17,2,2020-10-10,"Junior in University, I want to switch jobs or get an internship. Should I get certificates?",JonathanL73,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/j8xe17/junior_in_university_i_want_to_switch_jobs_or_get/,"**Quick Background:** I'm 26 after a 2 year hiatus of getting my associates in nothing, I've returned to University to pursue a Bachelors of Economics. Expected Graduation date 2022

**Work Experience:** My resume consists of 2 driving jobs, a Shipping Clerk job, warehouse worker, and Lowes sales associate.

Even though I had to manage my co-workers at 2 of my previous jobs, none of my jobs dictate management/leadership experience.

**Current Situation:** I'm trying for a logistic coordinator position in my current company or to be a PSE clerk with the USPS, but I'm not trying to get a CDL to be a logistic coordinator. I want to break away from the logistics industry and work in finance or tech.

I'm working a fulltime 45-47hrs per week driving job, and about 6-8 hours part-time driving for USPS. 

**GOAL:**

I do not feel like I'm experienced or knowledgeable to get an internship relating to finance or tech based on the qualifications they ask for.

I've been looking at various sites for certificate programs and courses that teach you Excel, how to code in Python, accounting, etc. Edx.com, ed2go.com, Udemy, Coursera, certificates from Microsoft, Google, Amazon. 

Where should I go to learn, so I can put down skills that can help me get a tech/finance internship/entry-level job?

**Question (Tech):**

In regards to programming, I am 99% sure I'm going to get a second degree, BA in Computer science.

But I want to start learning programing skills, certificates that I can put on my resume. There are so many certificate courses, Coding Bootcamps, some people say *""don't pay for anything teach yourself""*, I'm fine with a few hundreds of dollars here and maybe a couple thousand or so it its really worthwhile. I want to become qualified ASAP to work as an intern or entry-level job so I can start gaining some actual experience.

**Question (Finance):**

Is taking some courses on Excel or accounting worthwhile, so I have something to put on my resume? 

Teaching myself doesn't give me a certificate that I can show anyone.

----

I'm willing to pay money for a structured learning curriculum instead of an open-ended one, if it means it accelerates my learning curve and provide me with a certificate of some merit I can put on my resume that employers will value.

**TLDR;**

What kind of certificates if any should I get to get a job/internship in finance? What are the best certificates to get for tech programming, is coding bootcamp worthwhile?

I want to change to a different career, and would like to fast-track the process. I'm concerned about not developing relevant experience to my major before I graduate."

So i need to restart, and signed up for a Cybersecurity bootcamp through a good university in my city and im about half way through, 6 months left to go.

What would be good certificates to get after the CySA+? Im currently looking for work, even internships, but im not getting any hits or call backs. Anyone have any pointers? Should I get the Pentest+ after? Would that even help someone like me with a good technical of computers (outside of my recent coursework and certs) but no job experience in IT?

I've been applying to business analyst / product analyst type internships for the last month for next summer.

(Might be relevant to the story, I don't really know) 

I've been mentally ill for years, at 13 I started self harming and I slowly slipped into social anxiety as well. When I wasn't able to go to school anymore my parents bring me to see a therapist, I got diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety. Since I haven't been to school for the whole year I had to redo sophomore year, and I stopped seeing a therapist. 

Now I'm in junior year and I feel horrible, I have intrusive thoughts, I still self harm, I want to die, I regularly have panic attacks. 

And now onto what my parents have to do with that. Well, they just treat me horribly. For example a few weeks ago I had a panic attack at school and the nurse called my parents to come get me, I got yelled at. My mom got pissed off because ""It won't be like a year ago, you will go to school or I will make you an intern at school so you won't have a choice"" which made me feel horrible. If I don't do think exactly how she want she calls me dumb, one time I woke up early and I heard her tell my dad ""I can't wait 'till she moves out"" 

And onto my dad. Last year when I couldn't go out in public alone he would say that I was faking it, and ""nobody will pay attention to you anyway, stop exaggerating"" He also recently told me that when I went to therapy and didn't talk to the therapist (because I was so anxious I just couldn't talk) that he wanted to slap me because it made him angry. 

They also keep making mean comments everytime I'm with them, how my room isn't clean enough for them, how I wear too much makeup, about the music I listen to, making racist comments about my friends, making homophobic comments (I'm bisexual) criticizing how I do my school work, the classes I choosed and just everything. The worst was when they told me that I couldn't be sad because of my sister's death ( stillborn) because I was too young when it happenned and it was a long time ago 

I've felt so bad for so long I'm seriously considering ending my life before the end of high school. They don't even know that I attempted suicide at 15 because they make me feel like I can't tell them anything. 

I don't know what to do anymore"

I plan to go into ML/AI and get my masters, but I'm not exactly sure what to do with the summer in between.  Will I be able to get an internship in ML that usually requires gradstudents?  Or is it worth it to spend another summer in regular software.  I'd imagine it's much harder to find anything with this pandemic.

Anyways, I am just wondering if anyone is also making up their mind about this.  The stress of getting into a good grad school and getting an internship is killing me.  Thank you!"

I'm a junior transfer CS student at a T100 school (just transferred from a T20 since I was out-of-state), and the co-founder/principal software architect for an algorithmic trading firm that I started with 2 of my friends in January of this year.

Ever since this summer (when I had 12 credits worth of summer classes), I've invested about 15-20 hours a week into developing the code base and doing research on strategy ideas for my startup as this is a field I am very passionate about. Currently, during this fall semester, the time I've spent on the startup has increased to 20-30 hours a week since my course load is relatively easier. All of my effort towards this firm has been done with the intent of making this my full time job by the time I graduate (December 2021 for undergrad, or December 2022 if I do the 4+1 BS/MS from this school).

However in the process of spending so much time for my startup, I've mostly neglected the internship search process. I've applied to about 45-50 companies so far (mostly through LinkedIn easy apply or the 6 companies I got referrals from), gotten a few code challenges and phone screens, 1 second round interview, and 1 potential offer that should be confirmed in the next 2 weeks. However, for all the companies that I've advanced past the resume screening stage, I've been doing everything (code challenges, HireVues, phone screens) in   
 the last few days before they're due because they've fallen towards the bottom of my priority list. 

So my question to those of you who have been in this same spot: should I continue going all in with my startup (as I think it has significant potential to be a leader in the algorithmic trading/FinTech space based off our approach and end goal), or should I re-prioritize and dedicate some more of my time towards doing more internship applications?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I’m a junior CS student and have my own startup that I hope will become my full time job within the next 2 years, but in the process of dedicating so much time towards it, I've mostly neglected internship applications. What should I do?

What languages do I dive in? Personal projects? Internships are a great one usually, but I looked into it and in tech they seem harder to get than an actual job!!

I have an unrelated degree and attended a 'bootcamp' (it was a 6-month program at a University) pretty much immediately after I graduated. After finishing the bootcamp, I started as a Front-End intern at a mid-sized startup. Unfortunately, they weren't able to hire me full-time due to the economic consequences of Corona. Luckily, I quickly found a position as a Jr Front Developer at another startup.  
(I'm in Europe btw)

My employer is happy with my performance so far. However, I do realize that I (obviously) have substantial knowledge gaps when it comes to things like data structures, compilers, and software design/architecture. Even though knowledge in these areas is not necessarily required as a Front End Dev, I think it would be great to have, especially if I'd decide to go more in a DevOps or Backend direction at some point.

Another reason why I would like to get a degree is that Imposter hits me quite hard right now. I work in Ai and most of my coworkers have a Master's in Computer Science and I feel like I don't know anything when speaking with them.

I've been looking at Georgie Tech's OMSCS and other Online/Part-time Computer Science Bachelors/Master. But they often seem quite theoretical with classes such as Linear Algebra and Statistical Methos, which I am not really interested in (and I'm terrible at Math).

Has anyone experience getting a part-time Bachelor/Master while already working as a Software Developer and can recommend some good programs? Or is it better to just keep self-learning and getting more experience?"
j999k7,2,2020-10-11,reverse chance an international senior!,forthetea,ReverseChanceMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseChanceMe/comments/j999k7/reverse_chance_an_international_senior/,"Posted this on r/chanceme to barely any avail, so I'll try my luck here!

**Stuff I want in any suggested schools:** ""Reasonable"" reaches/hard targets, preferably in **California/**Illinois/New York/New Jersey, liberal artsy education (but still ""reputable"" enough for Asian parents), any T20s-T30s that are pretty international-friendly, and generally just schools that are good for the social sciences, socially progressive, and able to pay off well, whatever that means.  Easy connections and networks to internships/other cool opportunities.  Most importantly, decent aid.  Significantly partial to urban/suburban areas.

**Schools (all reaches because matches/safeties are back home): RD FOR ALL** Brown, Stanford, Barnard, Pomona, and Yale-NUS but feel free to reverse chance me for reach/semi-match schools in the T20s-T30s preferably in California (because my parents wouldn’t send me off otherwise). **My priorities are Brown, Stanford, and Barnard.**

**Demographics:** Filipino female international student from a private school under the [senior high school system (humanities and social sciences track)](https://portal.edukasyon.ph/blog/senior-highunderstanding-senior-high-school)

Estimated Demonstrated Need: Rough approximation but I think I’ll need 30%-60% aid.

**Intended Major(s): These are all dependent on the school’s core areas/offerings** Public Relations/Communication/Marketing, Sociology, International Relations, Political Science/Public Policy, and related majors.

**Standardized Tests:** Going test-optional because testing isn’t available in my country + I’m a minor so I still can’t go out freely because of my country’s lockdown

**GPA and Rank:** 93.78 (constant but slightly upward trend; let me know what this is in 4.0 GPA scale if anyone can help, expected to rise for mid-year/final reports), 9/526 students.

**Coursework:** No AP or IB applicable, but I was part of my school’s equivalent of English honors classes from my freshman to sophomore year. The only reason I’m not taking them anymore is that they no longer offer them in junior to senior year, unfortunately. Another important thing to note is that I’m taking the humanities and social sciences strand because of my country’s senior high school system. Some of my courses under said strand are disciplines in the social sciences, creative writing, politics and governance, trends and networks, world religions, literature, and more.

**Awards:**

* MUN Best Delegate
* Academic Excellence Award 1 (received in sophomore and junior year, maintained straight As for trimesters/semesters)
* Academic Excellence Award 2 (received in sophomore and junior year, had final averages of 90 and above for all of my subjects)
* Some notable awards from the World Scholar’s Cup (regionals-TOC); not naming them in-depth for privacy concerns, but feel free to DM if you need more context

**Extracurriculars as listed in my Common Application (not in “importance” order):**

Current:

* Unpaid intern for the marketing team of a policy competition
* External vice president of my school’s first feminist organization (leads marketing team of 39, spearheaded its rebranding, handles all external relations + promotions)
* Founder and director of a story-sharing platform dedicated to sharing COVID-related stories (social media reach of \~500-700 weekly with peaks of 1000+, leads team of 20)
* Head of the publications department of a local student volunteer organization (oversees \~40 writers and researchers, edits 5-10 writeups weekly which reach an average of a thousand people online, helped organize a masterclass, ++)

Recurring:

* Public speaking (talked to/oriented new students, hosted two workshops with 40+ participants each, paneled for a local high school’s panel, delivered two educational discussions for a local leftist party-list chapter)
* Script-writing (wrote radio plays and batch films/skits that were played to my entire high school since 10th grade up to now)

Past:

* World Scholar’s Cup delegate with 25 medals, regionals-TOC
* Staff writer for two online publications (Affinity Magazine and Redefy)
* Member (grades 9-11) and assistant secretary (grade 11) of school’s public speaking club (wrote the radio plays, organized open mics, collected/tracked documents/reply slips of 20 members)
* Class assistant secretary for grade 11 (collected + organized documents/reply slips of a class of 33 excluding me, regularly coordinated with administrative officers in school to keep track of records, occasionally took down attendance, got familiarized with Google Sheets as a tracking-ish kind of software as opposed to simpler? purposes)
* Forgot to indicate in my initial app (oops) but I was a managing editor for another online publication for a part of my sophomore year (edited and reviewed articles for their magazine and blog)

**Notable Hobbies (for supplements or anything else that isn’t Too major)**: I’ve been studying languages on Duolingo for 800+ days, and I run a low-commitment blog + some relatively niche interests I won’t talk about in-depth here because they’re just personality traits/hobbies I want to shine through in the more unconventional supps)

**Essay:** Don’t want to jinx or overestimate but I really like and believe in my topics.

**LORs:** Using the same two teachers for more or less everything, and I’ve already contacted them last month. They’ve known me since my sophomore year and teach the subject areas I plan on pursuing, and they know me outside my academic activities, so that’s always a plus.

(Most) ECs are kinda vague for a reason; DM for more context if you want to give me more holistic advice. I’m more than aware that I’m far from the perfect/ideal applicant HAHA, but an international college education is not going to be my first and only choice."

While I'm still currently interviewing for some companies, these are the 2 offers that I currently have, and after some research and previous posts I am not really sure what I want to choose.

I will be graduating in December of 2021, and my goal is to either work in a big tech company, or a unicorn, aka, I'd like to maximize my compensation right out of college without working in the finance industry, with that being said, I wouldn't mind working at any of these 2 when I graduate. I also want to be able to do something meaningful during my internship, and not just work on some old legacy code or something proprietary that nobody else will use. Intern salary isn't really a factor for me, since both of them pay similar amounts. 

Which internship do you think aligns best with my goals? Also, if you have worked at any of these 2 companies and later moved to a big tech company or a unicorn I'd greatly appreciate your experience.

It's a rant and I'm looking for some good advice please.,flyy_boi,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/j9b5yx/lost_my_job_and_im_fucking_confused_and_anxious/,"So I'm a 2020 graduate who graduated from a meh college in Chennai, with a B.Tech in ECE.
I got placed in 2019 at a product based software company, the pay was satisfactory and the job location was in Bangalore. By this time I've already received offers from Wipro, Infy, CTS.
As fresher recruiters, we had to go through an internship for 6 months with the firm first and it started in Jan this year. 
I lost my job during the lockdown in March and shit just went downhill from there. I've applied to so many places and all of them rejected me. I decided to mail the HR of the mass companies asking them to reconsider me. I applied at a small stay up in Bangalore but then my peers told me it might be a bad idea joining a start up given the current economic climate. Finally Wipro decided to reconsider me. I've been training with them since April, until now. The training is good, I've learnt things I thought I'd never need to learn (mostly Java and related frameworks). In the mean time I was learning about web apps and stuff.
I aspire to pursue an MS from abroad as well and hope to supply next year for 2022.

Sometimes I feel like I'm super fucked because of all this. Every day I do what's needed by me to barely get by, do Java and practice some questions. Sometimes I can't stop thinking that I'm fucked and I'm done for. I feel like my higher studies will be impacted by this but other times I feel like I should just go for it balls deep. I don't know what it is like out there. Being a fresher who joined a product based software company in the beginning made me feel like everything would go just fine but it didn't.
Hearing several things about Wipro everywhere makes me feel like I've screwed myself bad. Also I've heard it's very hard to move from service to produce based companies.
I can't help but think that I just got fucked bad some times. Sometimes I feel like everything will just be fine, I should just not stop working and perhaps even work a lot harder now but I don't know if it will get better.

I'm just so lost and confused and feel like I'm losing it. I've been trying to get my shit together for a long time but sometimes I totally lose it and feel helpless. Is it terrible out there? Will I somehow make it? Am I doomed? I have no idea and anxiety gets the better of even I ask myself these questions.

TL;DR - lost my first job at a product based software compan. Joined a service company. I feel like I'm losing control of my life and don't know what to do to get my shit together."
j9c4m4,1,2020-10-11,Conundrum: Profile evaluation and related questions,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/j9c4m4/conundrum_profile_evaluation_and_related_questions/,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to get my profile reviewed for admission to MS CS courses in Fall '21 and ask some questions regarding the application procedure.

**Profile:**
1. _Undergraduate_: B.Tech. in Information Technology from a regional Indian college(think MNNIT, NIT Surathkal)
	1. Overall GPA: **8.04/10**.
	2. Two backlogs, both in the first semester, which were cleared in the first year itself.
	3. My GPA plummeted in the first three semesters because of innumerable reasons, and later I had to take medication because of them, due to which it improved steadily. My GPA record is as follows: 7.12(post backlog adjustment), 7.86, 6.67, 8.28, 8.21, 8.38, 8.95, 9.
2. _Internships_:
	1. One month internship as a backend developer at an India-based MNC.
	2. Two months internship and six months internship as a software engineer at a US-based MNC(think Juniper, Arista).
3. _Work experience_: Currently working as a software engineer since 3 months at the above mentioned US-based MNC.
4. _Research Experience_: No research papers, publications or experience.
5. _Projects_: Projects in deep learning, full stack development and image compression.
6.  _EC_: Decent extra-curriculars, though they won't make any difference, I believe.
7. _Test Scores_:
	1.	GRE: 322(169Q/153V/5.5AWA).
	2.	TOEFL: 105 (29R/24L/25S/27W).
8. _LOR_: Can't really say what value they would hold.

---

Apart from evaluating my profile, could you help me by answering these questions?

1. Does mentioning about deteriorating mental health and its improvement, which could be observed from my GPA increase over the next 5 semesters, justify my low overall GPA or rather hamper my chances of admission even further?
2. Since my LORs would be from professors with whom I haven't had a proper interaction after I finished the work given to me after the assigned project, which was a bad call on my part, would they have any value? These won't be your stellar LORs that speak volumes about a person's character or determination to learn so I suppose I could consider them as having moderate or even low value.
3. Usually, when a university asks for LORs, it mentions two kinds: academic(A) and industry(I). What combination is likely to have more value given my scenario: 2A/1I or 1A/2I?

---

Finally, could you help me with shortlisting colleges for my profile in ambitious, moderate, and safe categories? I'd prefer to do MS in CS, specialising in AI or Data Science, but I'm keeping other options open, such as Computer Networks, since apparently I've been working with a networking company."

I recognize that I'm in a great spot right now, having the opportunity to work with a very well-known company with an incredible pay for interns.

But I can't help but feel a little bit sad about having to move away. My dream has always been to stay in the Bay, because I love being with my family. Frankly, I'm just one of those people who have a hard time letting go of home. This attitude is reflected in how I'd take the train home every single week of my first two years of college.

How do you cope with homesickness in a healthy manner at work? And I guess another one that might be just me hoping to get a different answer to the obvious: is there a *huge* culture shock between the Bay and Texas (specifically around the tech hub area)?"

I am writing this post because I will be honest I am scared to take the Security+ Exam. This is my first certification and well, the exam costs a lot of money and as a broke college student, I don't know how many retries I could afford.

**Background:**

\- Currently studying for a Bachelor's of Computer Science (Junior)

\- Interned as a Quality Assurance Automation Intern over this past summer

That being said, I don't believe I have an advantage other than knowing what Agile is.

**Here has been my study plan so far (I began at the end of August):**

\- Watched all of Professor Messer's videos (Great summary of the entire Security+ exam)

\- Read the entire book: Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead by Darrll Gibson

\- Reading all of the certification objectives. (I am going through every single objective and if I can't talk about what it is out loud I am going into the Security+ textbook finding it in the index and reading about it until I can speak about it). I have done up to section 3.0.

**The rest of this week will include:**

\- Reading the rest of the certification objectives and going through them until they are completed and I believe I can talk about anything on those objectives

\- Taking Professor Messer's practice exams (Probably 1 on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday)

That is my game plan. I have been reading other people's posts on Reddit and it seems many different people use many different resources. I was wondering if anyone else had any other tips on what else I should look into? Or honestly any kind of advice!"

My name is Yahya Derbeli. I am a software engineering student, majoring in Data science at the national institute of applied science and technology INSAT. Currently in my last year of study, I am looking for a 4-6 months internship in one of the fields mentioned above in the title. I am versatile , reliable and significantly experienced in solving complex problems both individually and in teams. During my studies, I tackled internships and projects requiring technologies that were absolutely new to me. As I learned these technologies, I developed a sense of autonomy and curiosity to learn that helped me improve personally and professionally.

I hope you find my academic resume and profile interesting and I am looking forward to any possible opportunity.

However, I have not managed to land an internship yet to gain any sort of work experience. 

Applicable areas regarding my major include Business Analysis, System Analysis, Project Management, etc. Classes have gone over databases, SQL, agile method, SDLC, project management, use cases, UML diagrams, etc. My cumulative GPA is average, about 3.1/4.0. 

The question is, should I still look for an internship after I graduate? Alot of jobs, even entry level/junior jobs require 1-2 years of experience. (there are a small number that do not require experience). 

It seems not managing to find an internship has put my career path on hold, as I am under qualified for even most entry level positions...  I am also not qualified for *most* internship positions, as they are looking for current students...

Do I need to go to graduate school? Should I try to complete some certificates? I have done the ECBA and a few basic certificates on Coursera... I could try to find a help desk job and start from there, but I haven't really learned any technical things in my major, just mostly business analysis topics (sort of like the middleman between software development and business), so I'm not sure if that will even help me. 

I guess my problem is fairly common, as a lot of people complain that entry level jobs require experience nowadays... Just wondering if I could find any answers here. Thank you!"

I do have projects from school that I've included in my resume, but I feel like it's not enough. COVID doesn't help the situation. At least I can use it as an excuse as to why I haven't gotten a job yet. I was applying to jobs everyday, but soon got discouraged and now I am inconsistent.

I guess I just wanted to put myself out here to see if there's anyone who has advice or can relate to my experience."
j9klou,0,2020-10-12,My College is a Fraudulent Money Front,WeaselBeer,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/j9klou/my_college_is_a_fraudulent_money_front/,"Hello,
I am a 29 year old US Navy veteran who is stuck working a crappy job that barely pays my bills. After getting out of the military in March of 2014, I started going to a local college starting in July 2014. When I went to tour the school, I was impressed by how the recruiter presented it and all the activities they said their Veteran’s Club did. I was considering other local colleges at the time, but the rep was insistent that I apply that day. The way they described it was that since they work on a Quarter system, their next quarter started in July and I could start that fast, while other colleges only accept applications in Fall and you would only be able to start going to school the following Fall. She was very insistent that I would be waiting more than a year to start at any other school, where as this one was unique and accepted applications throughout the year. I was pretty excited and anxious to sign up right away, but she constantly called me to come back in and apply before I missed out on the next quarter. I applied and got in and happily used my Post 9/11 GI Bill to go. The way the GI Bill was structured, the Bill would only allow me to do three out of the four quarters with the fourth being out of pocket. I filled out my FAFSA to ensure that the tuition from that last quarter would go into a Federal Loan and also talked to Student Accounts ensuring this would be the case; they assured me I wouldn’t owe them out of pocket. I attended for a year and a half. I was disappointed in a few things. The veterans club was NOTHING like they promised, the club didn’t do much at all except have our own little broom closet with a couch, tv, and two computers. The career counselors we were assigned were VERY hands off. I met mine twice; once to talk about my required internship and the second to ask for help creating my resume (which she never got back to me). She emailed me once after I graduated to ask where I was working so they could take credit for helping me get the job (it was a minimum wage, seasonal job that had nothing to do with the degree I earned). I persevered and the day before graduation, my online student account all of a sudden had a bill for approximately $25,000. This was odd seeing as I knew I would have to use loans for the two quarters that the GI Bill wouldn’t cover, and one quarter of tuition was less than $8,000. That $25k reflected on my account stated that that was the sum I owed the school themself out of my own pocket. It didn’t add up at all, the sum should have been reflected as a Federal Loan since I filled out my FAFSA both years and $8,000 X 2 doesn’t equal $25K, and how could I have accrued such a debt in one day? My balance was ALWAYS at $0 until that last week of my courses before I am able to apply for graduation. I went to student accounts and my personal Student Account manager stated that applying for a Federal Loan was on the student to do. This was my third college and for the other two, as long as you filled out your FAFSA, the school took care of putting the balance into a federal loan; and I was assured that’s what would happen when I first applied. The account manager was insisted that it’s the student’s responsibility to get the Federal Loan and give the school the account information for them to transfer the balance to. It was pointless arguing with this guy, so I talked to a different account manager. She was also insistent that it was the students responsibility to deal with FedLoan services. I expressed to this woman that I was upset about the where they got the cost of $25k for two quarters when the tuition was less than $8K. She didn’t give me a straight answer regarding their math but emailed me a breakdown that made no sense (I still have it). She noticed I was very upset because owing the school money directly means I can’t get my transcripts to actually USE my degree. Plus, if I owed them money for a quarter taken the previous year, it should’ve been reflected on my account immediately and would’ve prevented me from signing up for future classes; they gave me that Grand Total the last week of classes before I was eligible to get my BS. She stated she would aid me and lower my total by “awarding” me post graduate scholarships. She was able to bring the total down to me owing the school a little less than $5,000 (I’m sure it’s gained some interest since it’s been 4 years). I asked if she could put that total into a FedLoan. She stated she was unable to because I already completed the coursework and they can’t transfer the balance post education. I figured $5K would be manageable, especially if my Student Advisor could help me with getting a job in my field. As stated, my student advisor  was useless and didn’t help me with anything, but took credit for getting me that minimum wage, crappy job, that had nothing to do with my degree. The next year, I got a bill from FedLoan with a total of $25,000 from said school... how is that possible? I’ve called and emailed the school to no avail. No one will talk to me to explain. I want to go for a Master’s degree and get a government job and I can’t do anything until I get my transcripts. I’m stuck in purgatory and it’s made me really depressed. I can’t pay my school and I’ve defaulted on my student loan and my GI Bill expires in a couple of years. My time is running out and I don’t know what to do anymore. I need to know if I can take them to court and what type of lawyer can help me. They’re currently being sued by the city I live in AND by the college board for similar problems, but it’s not a class action lawsuit that involves the other students who were also effected, it’s just the entities suing the school. I just want that ridiculous amount of debt gone. I’ll happily pay what I actually owe them, but their numbers don’t make sense and I want them to explain and get rid of that extra cost and I want my damn degree and transcripts. They let me walk across stage for graduation and acknowledged I was indeed eligible to get my degree, they’re just keeping it from me and it’s costing me my career. Any little bit of advice will help. Please! I’m desperate."

I will be a sophomore in spring. What are interviews like (questions, interviewers, and what’s the highest round you’ve done)? If anyone could answer this I would appreciate it so much. I feel like I am not on the right track to buffing my resume. I didn’t even think about internships until last week, so I think I’m too late to even be interviewed. 

I’m in a 2+3 program that has me in a school without any cs programs/majors for 2 years and in ba/grad school for 3 years at a college with cs. So I have absolutely no idea how to code... yet. I am going to study on my own before I get to grad school. I’m just scared I’m not on the same track as other cs majors in traditional schools. 

TIA"

I am a second year CS major at the University of Maryland and I'm slowly noticing that I am surrounded by people that have had tons of internship/competitive tech experience (during high school and even during their years at university). 

My only projects consist of a lot of screwing around on my own-- testing my skills, trying to expand on what I've learned in my classes, and I've also been working on a bit of game development on the side for the past year (with great progress, in my eyes). However, I feel like none of this will end up being helpful for a career or applying to internships. I am a hard worker and I'd consider myself determined person, but I have no idea how to communicate that to potential employers (as I have no real job experience in the tech world that would show that). I am in the mindset that I need to get an internship for this coming Summer, but all I've been able to find online is to check out sites like [internships.com](https://internships.com), and to buff up my [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com) profile. 

Does anybody have any advice for me on where I could look for internships/jobs and/or what are some things that I could do to make myself a bit more interesting to potential employers?"
j9sx5l,1,2020-10-12,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/12/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/j9sx5l/weekly_job_qa_thread_10122020/,"Hi all,

Here is the thirty-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will you in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in most every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

j9t4lb,1,2020-10-12,I (24) am having issues with my instructor (61),JackfruitAdditional8,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/j9t4lb/i_24_am_having_issues_with_my_instructor_61/,"I (24) am currently enrolled into Medical Assistant school. The goal is to become a nurse practitioner in mental health or women’s health. I work at night cleaning the local college and then during the day I’m at school online. On the weekends I go to a vocational school. Also I have two kids who are non verbal, SPD. L

When I initially started I kind of dominated the teacher by talking too much and answering too much I realized this and shut up. I have a tendency to do that, sometimes I feel I have to prove myself to people. Any-who. I ask her questions rather than state the answer now. And I  put my head down a lot of the time. Just looking at the desk. 

Now I’m being singled out. She tells the whole class indirectly that she can take one look at me and see i won’t make it as a medical assistant. She’s constantly telling the class I won’t make it. She marked 5 questions on my test wrong (ended up being right) , I was super nervous and excited about injections and so I botched it. I was yelled at in front of the whole class. She tells the class “there was a girl who knew the answers to everything, &amp;amp; I used to ask why are you even here? now she works at Amazon”she then starts laughing. She tells me how she makes 50/hr from her house. How she’s earned the right to do what she wants. How she has 6 cars. How she’s worked for everything she’s ever owned. 

She downplays nursing school, by making little innocuous comments about how it was not for her, how she dropped out of nursing school and how all the RN’s are quitting. how it’s stupid that they teach you conversions. I told her the way I use the Celsius and Fahrenheit formula: 
C*9/5 +32 or
 f-32 divided by 5/9. She tells me that’s dumb and says her MA’s work smarter not harder and showed me an easier way, which I thanked her for. 

She tells us stories about how she’s responsible for so many peoples success. Because of her, these people were accepted to med school, because of her these people became nurse practitioners, if it wasn’t for her type of mentality .She constantly brags about her granddaughter how she’s a forensic psychologist and she’s going to Virginia for an internship. I said, “ I’m glad for your g-daughter, I love to see people be successful!” I was being genuine. I absolutely love seeing other peoples success! She rolls her eyes at me and tells the guy next to me he shouldn’t be an athletic trainer but a physical therapist.

I’ve backed down and just been completely silent. Don’t state only ask, and avoid eye contact. For two weeks now. Don’t talk about my nursing career nothing. Just ask related questions. 

What can I do? I’m just tired of being told I’m not going to be successful. She states it’s because I wanna do things my way. It’s not that. I follow her directions I’m just very nervous, and anxious and have a constant feeling like I’m going to fail. As soon as I got there she started with, “ I know who’s not going to make it, and who will, I can take one look at you at tell”. Because she keeps telling me I am, before even giving me a chance. When I ask her a question or state something she indirectly answers me, she also indirectly shades me. If I make a mistake, she makes an example of me. And ONLY ME. 

I’m feeling discouraged. I bought a fake Phlebotomy kit off of Amazon to practice my injections. :) but I’m scared to go to school I have anxiety attacks in my car everyweekend. She wants me to brown nose her like everyone else. I know she has power so should I just take it?

TLDR: teacher hates me because I slightly upstaged her. Don’t know what to do."

Not even super prestigious like FAANG or Big N but also companies like Chase. It makes me like not wanting to work at a company no one has heard of. It's a strange feeling and I feel like the prestige of working at a very well known company has affected me. It's not at all influenced by my environment as my school isn't well known and isn't competitive. 

I feel like part of my was craving the prestige of working at big company that once I said the name people would recognize. Maybe this came from me never going to a prestigious school or winning any competitive awards. I have to admit I liked the prestige of working at that company and think it's opened doors lol. 

Whenever I look at someone else, the big name companies always stand out. If someone's worked at a ton of smaller companies (that are probably very interesting and amazing) but has worked at Google that experience stands out and I look at them differently. I've noticed after getting my internship and feel like people's perception of me has changed. It's very subtle but I feel like they think I'm smarter and I've felt like I noticed this with my family. My Dad said I really surprised since I've done well, better than he expected (I'm a first gen college student and my other 3 siblings are all doing very well). 

It's not something I'm like to admit but I'd lying if I say I didn't think like this. I know working at smaller companies is amazing to and they're probably tons of people who could code circles around me lol. 

I'm wondering if anyone's felt this way."

So I just graduated college this past spring with a B.S. in Economics &amp; Finance. I was lucky enough to get a full time job in June as a business analyst for a pharmaceutical company earning over $50k a year, but am not passionate about the work I am doing. Truthfully, I took the position because it was one of the few places I heard back from and needed a job coming out of college. 

I have around $28k in student loan debt but have saved about $25k between my savings account, brokerage account, IRAs and 401k.

I want to continue my education but am lost and unsure of what I want to do. Throughout college I had internships in fields such as accounting, supply chain and real estate and If I did go back to school I would want to pursue one of those subjects (accounting, finance, supply chain or real estate). 


I enjoyed the finance, accounting and I real estate classes I took throughout college and also enjoyed the supply chain internship I had my dilemma is that I can’t decide which I should pursue since I enjoyed them all.

My question is how do you realize what you are passionate about and decide what you want to continue to study to shape your career? My company offers tuition reimbursement for employees who are at the company for at least 6 months so I will take advantage of that. I am just unsure of which path I want to take. I know I am young but I am worried about working a job or career that I am not passionate about for the rest of my life ( I know a little dramatic).

I would love to hear about other people’s decisions at my age and how they decide to continue their education and the things they took into account to determine what field to pursue.

Thanks."

I’m slowly forgetting 3D modeling, excel skills, mechanical knowledge, materials etc..... also b/c of stress from my family to get a job (first in my family to get a degree so it’s always been “why did you go to school for 5 years and don’t have a job”) my anxiety is at an all time high. Actually scratch that I feel like I literally forgot everything. I couldn’t solve a heat transfer problem to save my life right now.

I have a strong passion for 3D modeling and mechanical design. What’re some job titles I should look for? What’re some programs/certs to go after? 

A few other questions,

What are somethings I can do to stand out as a recent grad? How bad is the job market due to covid? Should I relearn the topics I was taught in undergrad?"

I'm a senior CS student. As of my trajectory, I can finish my coursework after spring term and graduate in June, then look for a new grad job in the summer. I've never had any internship experience before.

However, I figure looking for an internship is easier than a job, and once I'm done with the internship, it's also easier to get a real job.

So I'm thinking if it's better if I don't finish my degree in Spring, but leave 1 or 2 classes to drag it until Fall, so I'll still be a student and can apply for internships in the summer.

What do you guys think about that? I'm I better off just graduate early and look for a job or I should drag my coursework to get a summer internship first?

I don't really care about that, but it factors into my decision because they said that if I have a successful internship I will be presented a full time offer (especially contributing to marketing a product that is harmful).

Please take your time reading this and give me a realistic answer. Do not sugarcoat.

BU has been my dream school since 7th grade, but looking at others’ stats compared to mine has me nervous, and the school I’m applying to is allegedly in the top 3 of the hardest to get into at BU. 

**Applying ED1** to College of Communications

**GPA** UW: 3.55 W: 3.9
**I only have a “low” gpa because I was handling personal issues (my mother was falsely arrested—later proven innocent btw) in 9th grade, causing me to get a 3.0 uw that year. However, I’ve improved ever since in an UPWARD trend. I got 3.4 uw sophomore year and 4.0 uw junior year. I plan on talking about my extenuating circumstances on the “additional info” section of the common app. In addition, my guidance counselor will also mention it along with the stuff listed in **others** at the bottom of this thread. 

**SAT/ACT**: I signed up for the SAT four times, but each got cancelled due to corona. I have no choice but to apply test optional now and I am worried because I spent the entire summer studying.

**APs**:
Psychology (4), Lang (5), Lit, Gov, Environmental

—I have taken mostly Honors classes, however I have taken 2 CP Sciences and 2 CP Maths. The CP sciences were not by choice, as one class there was no “Honors” level for it in 9th grade and in 11th grade I had to take CP Chem due to scheduling conflicts. I took Honors Bio the year before and had a B as my overall grade. 

**Internship** senior year for a freshman English class

**Job**
—Part-time (sometimes full-time because I work 25-45hr weeks) year round job for the past THREE years. It is at a fast food restaurant and I have been training incoming employees for the last two years. I have also received a raise twice. 

**ECs**:
—Community service club from 9th to 12th grade: Vice President (11th grade), Co President (12th grade). I have led numerous events by myself through this club, and have a total volunteer hours of 300+ 

—Journalism from 10th to 12th grade: News Editor (11th grade), Editor In Chief (12th grade)

—Drama club from 8th to end of 10th grade: Cast as LEAD ROLE in school play for sophomore year

—Founder of an online platform via Instagram that helps teach ESL students English vocabulary, grammar, etc (started May 2020). I currently have 1,500 followers and in the process of creating a YouTube channel. 

—Boy Scouts of America from 5th grade to beginning of 11th grade: I eventually became the “leader” of Cub Scouts for 3 years, the only minor to be a volunteer for Boy Scouts at this location. I washed tables, helped the scouts with projects, helped them earn their badges, etc. My total hours for this are 345+. I included 6th-8th in that because on naviance it let me do that as an option. 
    **Earned several trophies throughout the years doing Boy Scouts, especially 1st place in the Pinewood Derby for most creative design two years in a row.

—Social Media Manager for a Climate Change initiative led by students across 30 different schools in Massachusetts (started in March 2020)

—French Honors Society (10th, 11th) my French class was cancelled this year due to Coronavirus so FHS was cancelled in the process; I was supposed to take AP French.

—National Honors Society (12th grade but we haven’t done anything)

—Have participated in Poetry Out Loud from 8th to 11th, and was a school finalist in 11th grade. I’m not putting this in my extracurriculars on common app but one of my teachers is gonna mention it in their rec letter. 
 **Also in the process of having a poem I wrote myself being published into a poetry book. Don’t know much about it tbh so don’t count it.

—The rec letters haven’t been written soon, but they are coming from my Journalism teacher who I’ve had for three years (and the major I want to go into) and my guidance counselor, who both love me. I am a very energetic student and participate in class discussions. 
**ALSO: MY JOURNALISM TEACHER IS A BU ALUMNI WHO HAD THE SAME MAJOR AND MINOR AS I WANT!

**Essay**: I am writing my college letter surrounding my mother’s mental illness affecting me growing up, but I did not let it have a negative impact on me. Instead, I rose from it and advocated for change (I am the Co-President of Human Rights Club)

**Demonstrated Interest**: Have attended two zoom calls, thats about it. Due to COVID BU is not having any tours. I did sign up for the virtual tour and received an email; however, I could not attend because I was still in school. I am trying to do a virtual tour again for that school schedule for October 25. I am also on BU’s mailing list if that counts for anything, and have listed them as my top school on numerous scholarship websites! 

**Others**:

—Caucasian Male

—First Generation College Student

—Massachusetts native

—Previously in foster care 2 different times (I am now with my biological mom again and have been since 4th grade)

—Low income family &amp; grew up with government assistance

Same thing I did for my undergrad no student loans but a state school. It baffles me that some guys I work has degrees from UT - Austin, Cornell, Harvard. They are not happy with me since I paid 15k for an online degree and doing my job. What do Ivy League students do when they graduate? Do they do more studying or still finding a job. So much studying no internships, is that a reason why they go into public service? I see a lot of senators that went to Harvard, but then this senator think Sinema went to ASU making the same amount of money and influence as Schumer. Why should I pay an enormous amount of money to get a degree just to work after I graduate. I know some friends that went to ASU interning at Goldman Sachs as analysts. I don't get it."
ja2vob,12,2020-10-12,Need Advice on Deciding Between Mandarin or Japanese as a Second Langauge,AzoZyten,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/ja2vob/need_advice_on_deciding_between_mandarin_or/," 

I have done enough research into the various hurdles of each language to understand how much of a massive undertaking learning either would be. I am about to graduate college and likely will start working full time in the United States in a role that hopefully combines both my degrees in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science. For a long time, I wanted to learn an instrument and also a second language. As of a few years ago I started piano and have reached a reasonably high level of proficiency. However, I now want to start working towards learning a foreign language and am prepared to dedicate an average of 1.5 - 2 hours a day of focused practice (more on weekends) for years to come to do so. I ended up casually looking into Japanese starting by memorizing hiragana a few days ago, which took a very short time(1-2 hours?). However, as I began compiling a timeline and approach for learning Japanese using various online resources I began to question if I should be learning Japanese or Mandarin. This decision has plagued me for a long time, so any input is appreciated. I will list out my rationale for both below.

Japanese:

Pro: I could easily see myself being able to immerse myself in Japanese music, films/media, videogames, anime, manga, and light novels. I think this will make MIA more feasible, along with encouraging me to do more listening practice.

Pro: If I had to chose which culture would be more pleasant to live in long term (not that I plan on permanently leaving the US but maybe temporarily working abroad) Japanese culture is at this point more appealing to me.

Pro: There are fewer people who are conversationally fluent in Japanese and English as opposed to Mandarin and English

Con: I do not have much faith in the long term future of Japan's economy due to an aging population, shrinking middle class, and internal social issues. I expect the value of knowing Japanese will become increasingly less in the future (but I am maybe open to being convinced otherwise).

Con: From what I have seen Japanese is objectively harder to reach high proficiency in, and personally I would like to reach as close to native fluency as I can at some point in my life.

Mandarin:

Pro: The international/economic power of China has been drastically increasing, (I do not want to bring politics into it but some poor foreign policy decisions have partially facilitated this), thus I feel like the value of knowing Mandarin will only increase.

Pro: I already enjoy reading translated Webnovels so theoretically I am not totally disinterested in Chinese media.

Pro: My past three internship bosses have all been Chinese, one of my best friends is Chinese, and I can imagine there are many more opportunities to use Mandarin in the US as opposed to Japanese.

Pro: Though I am more interested in visiting Japan as opposed to China, there are way more speakers of Mandarin and places to travel where Mandarin would be useful.

Con: There are tons of bilingual speakers of Mandarin and English, I personally know more than a dozen, so I believe it is a much more common skillset.

Con: I am not as interested in the culture, and there is far-less Chinese media available in the US that I am interested in (though I will probably find more that I am interested in if I begin learning).

Con: I know way too much about the CCP to ever consider having a family or settling down in China, maybe I would work there for a while to learn the language and because I think there is more opportunity for wages than Japan. (granted I am not sure I even want kids)

If you have read this far I greatly appreciate it, I understand this will be a lifelong pursuit so I want to make sure I am using my limited time to start on the best path for me.

TL;DR My heart is slightly leaning towards Japanese but my mind keeps strongly saying Mandarin is the better longterm decision and investment. Also sorry for any grammar errors I am coming off \~6-8 hours of programming and 0 hours of sleep."

I’m on the brink of giving up,Salayexe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ja43f0/how_can_i_improve_my_chance_to_get_an_internship/," I’m a third year cs student in Toronto and I’ve been looking for a winter internship placement in software/full-stack development. But after sending around 100 applications, I didn’t get any call back. I’m so frustrated. I did good on my courses and have some side projects that I can put on my resume ([https://imgur.com/39MuCfT](https://imgur.com/39MuCfT)), but it seems like no one is interested in it.  
 

I’ve always been told that winter is the easiest time to get an internship, but I can’t even get an interview. I’m afraid my chance of getting one in the summer is pretty low. I’m not Canadian, and I’m on a tight budget. If I can’t get an internship in the next summer, I would probably have to give up, go back to my hometown and find a job in other fields. All the efforts and money I paid in the past two years for becoming a software engineer will go down the drain. I would really appreciate it if anyone could give me some advice. What skills do I need? What kind of project should I make? I’m totally lost."

Currently I am out of work due to covid, so I'm using this time to build projects as I keep applying. I really want to find something before this year is over and things get back to normal, but on the other hand it seems like internships are targeted toward traditional computer science majors while all the actual jobs target mid-to-senior level developers.

I'm a senior in aerospace engineering at a really good school for my program, and thus far I've done pretty well in school with about a 3.5GPA. But I just feel absolutely lost and hopeless everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been able to get any intern or research experience in my field yet and its absolutely crushing me. I had a couple decent opportunities fucking crumble last summer thanks in part to COVID, so I had to resign myself to working a shitty retail job to make some money. To add to the fact, my fairly young family pet quickly and unexpectedly developed some health problems requiring we put him down right before I came back to school.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have struggled a lot with feeling badly the past couple of years, but this year and semester has taken the cake. I told myself I would go straight to grad school so I could avoid trying to find a job without any intern or research experience, but now I'm realizing I may not be able to even fall back on that as my school's program is seemingly quite competitive and I somehow need to find 3 professors to write me letters of recommendation. This is difficult, as my program has been so large its been so hard to ever be more than just another face in the class. Of course a lot of it is my own failure as well, which just helps to perpetuate my current state of intense self-loathing.

&amp;#x200B;

Truthfully I hate everything about myself. I am intelligent but waste it due to a seeming lack of enthusiasm or ambition. I find myself to be physically unattractive as well, in addition to a shitty personality that is not capable of sustaining a relationship. I have been in a couple brief relationships in the past, but in the first one I was cheated on, and the second relationship was fairly short and it ended due to my inability to meet the needs of the relationship. Naturally, I was the one who was dumped in both cases. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I wake up and feel the crushing weight of self hate and anxiety. I feel like a complete and utter failure in every meaningful aspect of my life. Oftentimes I wonder what it would be like to jump in front of a bus or jump off one of the tall parking garages on my campus. I know I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself, but I often wonder or wish for the relief it would bring. Too not need to worry about the stress and anxiety anymore. Too not need to feel a burning self-hatred every second of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'll be acting on this anytime soon, as I could never do that to my parents, so I suppose I'm resigned to several more decades of being a living waste of space. I just really don't know what to do, or even why I am writing this. I guess I just wanted to type my thoughts out. Maybe I'm still foolishly hoping there is some light at the end of the tunnel, that I'm not unequivocally fucked for the rest of my life. If you made it this far, thank you for reading this garbage. I don't expect any advice or words of comfort/encouragement, I just wanted to put my thoughts into writing I guess."

I hope my questions are appropriate for this sub. Thanks in advance to anyone taking the time to read this long post.

I'm in my mid-20's, living in Washington state, graduated college with a B.S. in Computer Animation in 2016. I've had very little success over the last four years finding work in animation; besides a few freelance gigs each year I haven't been able to land a long-term job in this field, much less pay the bills full time (I know I know, what did I expect?). 2020 feels like the final nail in the coffin, and I'm finding myself daydreaming about job security, mobility, retirement, etc. Computer Science seems to be better for that than most careers by a decent margin, and I think I could be good at it. I'm curious about what paths I could potentially take to work in this field.

Firstly, this is where I'm at right now. My degree, while technically a B.S., is essentially an art degree. My university offered a really specialized, accelerated program that excluded all but the most essential subjects and as a result I've only had basic math courses, and besides some really cursory Python scripting no programming at all. I'm fortunate to be debt-free, but I don't have a lot in terms of savings. I work as a contract QA analyst with Microsoft (managed service) currently, but will be laid off in mid-November.

I'm trying to get my head around what employers look for in terms of skills and education, and how I could best set myself up for success as someone who is essentially a blank slate. Here are some options I've been exploring, and I'd love to get some feedback from people with real world knowledge and experience:

Pursue a new undergrad degree in CS: this is obviously a huge time commitment to say nothing of finances, but considering my current educational background I'm wondering if this wouldn't be the best plan to develop the skills I'm lacking as well as connections for internship placement and such. When researching positions I get the sense that employers prioritize CS or related degrees in a big way; but maybe I'm just hyperfocusing. How important is a B.S. versus skills, connections, etc.? 

Pursue a graduate degree in CS: getting a shiny new degree in two years sounds really attractive (even if I might have to make up a fair number of pre-reqs first) and I'd love to have the advantage that a master's could bring. The downsides I'm seeing are missing out on a lot of foundational stuff and losing the networking opportunities. Is it a red flag for employers to see a weird degree combo like that, and do post-grad degrees limit candidates to specific fields? 

Non-university training: lastly, I've looked at some multi-week coding courses and the like and I'm honestly not sure what to make of them. My questions regarding this kind of training I guess boil down to: is this a good way to learn valuable skills, and is this something employers take seriously? I'd love to be able to learn a lot of these skills while still being able to work and find that they can carry me where I want to go, but I'm not sure how realistic that is.

I hope I haven't rambled too much. Any input that anyone cares to share is greatly appreciated, and don't hold back if you feel I'm being unrealistic or anything like that. I'm very open-minded right now, just trying to take some concrete steps towards a more secure and happy future. Thanks!"

After being with them for almost a year, I can conclude that I’m doing the same work as the actual full-time employees. I’m working on projects involving Azure, SQL, etc for app development and other uses. In general, stuff that classes don’t even touch. One of my supervisors asked me if I wanted to work on web development or cloud computing, which honestly for where I’m at is very advanced. And I really am lucky to have this job, because after talking to other people in my grade level, I found out that very, very few people have comparable experience. 

I’m not asking if I should get an internship. I already know the obvious answer is yes. Different types of experience is always good. But I want to know if it’s a priority in my situation. After all, I’ve already secured a programming job I can keep until graduation (and possibly after if they’re willing to upgrade me to a full-time position) that compensates me very well ($16 per hour which I know is less than some internships but consider this is a year-round part-time position). I’ve been stressed out recently trying to apply to internships, but then I questioned if I should be pushing myself this hard. I’ve observed that sophomores typically get passed over for hiring so I’m trying to assuage my anxiety.

I got a few interviews in a couple months and 1 offer. Now I am going for my second internship. I only worked 1 year on the first one. But I've been applying for the whole year and only now I started getting rejections lol. Before that, there wouldn't be even an answer.

In my resume I have some intermediate to advanced skills and my github has only a few dumb uni projects so yeah I know I need to make it better. So, is it really that difficult now or is it because my github lacks personal projects?"
jae88x,9,2020-10-13,Don’t Settle For A Job Even When You’re Desperate!,epanoui,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jae88x/dont_settle_for_a_job_even_when_youre_desperate/,"Hi everyone! 

I just had a small event happen to me that I would like to share for others who are in the same situation. I’m a recent graduate, like 2 months out fresh, and have been unemployed since my last internship ended in August. 

It sucks a bit to go through the internships that I did and have bulked up my resume for everything to be a bit tough now because of COVID. I’ve been applying to a lot of applications, and after weeks of no responses, I finally got a reply and interview offer. However, I declined the interview!

The position suited my degree but it was a completely unpaid internship. Current-student me would’ve definitely taken the opportunity, but since I have my fair share of unpaid internship and I’m graduated, no way! I was super close to biting the bullet just to have something to validate me during these though times, but I’m so glad I didn’t settle for something I know I definitely don’t want to do. 

So my advice for those reading, though it’s really hard right now to get into the job market and it may be depressing at times, don’t ever settle! Keep trying your best to find a job that makes sense to you. Don’t agree for a position that will not let you learn something new or where you’re over qualified for. Right now, when it seems like opportunity is very slim, just keep your head up and remember that it’s totally okay for you to say no or realize something isn’t right for you even after you initiated the conversation!

Best of luck to my fellow graduates and everyone out there!"

I've done some machine learning projects in school, using some of the classic M.L. data sets, e.g. the ones offered by Scikit. Despite this, I feel that I could use some advice as I'm entering this real-world project.

**Project information:**  
I've got hundreds of thousands of rows of data, spread across close to a hundred variables in our CRM system - I assume/predict that more than 80-90% of these variables are completely irrelevant for my purpose though. 

**Data types:**  
Most variables are binary (e.g. TRUE/FALSE) or multi-class (e.g. A, B, C, D, E), a few variables are continuous. 

**Class attribute:**  
I have a binary variable, ""customer\_lost"", that I will use as my class attribute, although it is drastically overweighted (90% NO, 10% YES). 

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. What type of model would be best suited for this project? Logistic regression? Random Forest?
2. Given that I have almost 100 variables, is there a straightforward way to determine which variables I should use in my model, or do I need to use all of them?
3. Do I need to re-balance my data so that, in the training data, I have equally many ""NO"" and ""YES"" in the class attribute?
4. Is there anything in particular that I should keep in mind while conducting the project?

Would be extremely grateful for some advice!! Thanks in advance"
jagtn7,6,2020-10-13,Should you choose internships based on future career growth or internship experience?,Ingenuity_Silent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jagtn7/should_you_choose_internships_based_on_future/,"I recently received two offers for a Summer 2021 internship, Vanguard and Asana, and while I'm really happy, I'm also a bit conflicted

Vanguard on one hand may have a little less technicality in their internship, but their internship has a high chance of being followed up by their technology leadership program (a two year rotational leadership program after college with extra mentorship) that sounds like a great career opportunity after college and could be really beneficial for my future career growth.

On the other hand, Asana was literally one of my dream internships, it has a product that's interesting to me, it has a pretty high salary (minus housing), and I'd get a bunch of software experience on the job. It's also in SF, and while there's expensive housing and all that, I've always wanted to visit SF and interning there would let me do so without actually working there full-time.

I had a great interview experience at both companies and their company cultures/people seem super supportive and generally happy, so that's not the issue. Its honestly just trying to figure out whether to prioritize my career growth in 2-3 years vs a software experience internship now

Also, sorry about the long post, but there's a third option, not accepting both and just hoping a few other companies pull through. I'm in the loop with a few another larger companies, some FANG, but I'm not sure if I want to risk throwing away two internships for the chance at a larger company. School also started and grinding OAs and Zooming for 5 hours at companies has been taking its toll :(

I know internships don't define your life path, but it honestly feels like I could end up in two very different places based on what I choose. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

VR gaming via Valve Index. Specifically use with graphics-intensive games such as ENB-modded Skyrim VR and No Man's Sky.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

Ideally, extreme-use case would likely be stable 60FPS with heavily modded Skyrim VR or Fallout 4 VR with 300%+ resolution setting and/or supersampling. Current rig can do ~220% resolution and isn't quite at a stable 60FPS (not many mods, either - maybe 30 or so?). Not sure if I'll get there with only $500 in upgrades, but as close as possible is the goal.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$500.

My goal is to spend ~$500 to replace one or two of the weakest links in my PC to boost my performance with my brand-new Valve Index headset without doing a total overhaul (headset ate most of my ""fun money"" I saved from an internship). At first, I was thinking of jumping from the GTX 1070 to the RTX 3070 (hence the $500 USD budget), but I realized that bottlenecking from my older CPU could be an issue, and wanted to consult some more experienced builders on whether that money would be best spent elsewhere. Additionally, I'm not currently overclocking the CPU, if it would be worth learning how to do that and keeping the current chip."
jakcfp,1,2020-10-13,Torn between going to grad school or not based on current situation. Need some advice.,OneLargeToe,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jakcfp/torn_between_going_to_grad_school_or_not_based_on/,"I am currently a senior at a local, state university and will be graduating in the spring. I have an associates degree in Cybersecurity, am finishing my B.S. in Information Technology, am a decorated student athlete, have excellent grades and have been noticed by many of my professors and coaches (sorry about the humble brags, just want to give you little info about myself). 

I am currently facing a dilemma regarding obtaining my masters right after graduation and could use some genuine advice. I have no work experience in tech; my internship this summer was terminated before it even started due to the uncertainties related to COVID. I love school, love what I'm learning, and am eager to start my career and get some actual experience within the field as I think I have great leadership, communication, and technical skills, and genuinely believe I could bring some great ideas and perspectives to my future employers. My parents really think I need to just go ahead and get my masters full-time while I'm still in the ""swing"" of school, and also because the VA (mom is a veteran) has agreed to pay for the majority of my masters degree as long as I finish it before I'm 26 (currently 23) and I attend full time. So money is not an issue. I also feel like getting the masters out of the way now would not only be beneficial to me before I start my career and family, but would help me move up through management positions and open up potential opportunities simply from having the graduate degree (this is what I've been told, I could be wrong on this). I would be applying to University of Maryland for Cybersecurity Engineering, Georgetown for Data Science or IT Project Management, and Johns Hopkins for their Cybersecurity program.

An issue I'm facing is knowing weather getting a masters degree in my field could potentially hurt me more than help me. I feel as if obtaining a masters in a technical field without any relevant work experience would make it more difficult to find entry level cyber jobs or internships and that many organizations will find me overqualified in my education, but under qualified in my work experience. I also fully understand that I can start in this field easily without a graduate degree and that certs are the way to go (I'm about to take my Sec+ in December).

I need to start applying for many of these programs in December and January, so I need to make this decision relatively soon. I would be more than happy to listen to any advice or insights anybody is willing to give me as I am very split on the situation."

Studying math and computer science. I've been trying day in and day out to land an internship , more than 400 applicantions , networked you name it I've tried it. Not even a bit of progression not a single interview. I'm not the best candidate I know. I know ,HTML,CSS, Python, and some R, and some JS but regarding the languages I'm by no means an expert. The thing is I'm on the same level as people I know around me but they're getting all these Internships and I can't even get an interview. Their resumes are worse than mine because atleast I have work experience not relevant work experience but work experience nontheless. So what am I doing wrong cause my self esteem and general will to want to continue is gone to shit. I have no desire to want to push on because no matter what I do , I can't get even an interview let alone a god damn offer. What can I do to change this ?

Edit: 

Here's my anon resume that I've been using to apply to internships: https://docdro.id/DwLZ2Gk

Edit #2: Just wanted to thank everyone who had actually responded . I got alot of very helpful advice . I will definitely be making a brand new resume and not rushing through it. I'll be spending more time working on side projects and will be spending time to learn Java aswell. Thank you everyone for the help, words can't describe my gratitude but just know I really do appreciate it."

jamxns,0,2020-10-13,What can a student do to build a great CV?,Krauss27,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jamxns/what_can_a_student_do_to_build_a_great_cv/,"Hi, there. I'm a CS university student, born and raised in the 67th avenue of Hell, popularly known as Brazil. I have quite ambitious plans of immigrating to a first world country - and as I'm sure I'll be facing great challenges along the way, I'm prepared to put in the work to make it possible. I'm particularly interested in France and Japan, and currently learning both languages, but that's besides the point. Let me get straight to the point: I wanna have the best of CVs. And I'm willing to work hard for it. But I don't know what the fuck to do. Let me separate this into two questions: I don't know what to do. And I don't know how to do it.

**1)** First of all, what to do. I wanna start working on building a nice CV as soon as possible, but it's so soon that I don't even know what I wanna work with. I always wanted to become a game programmer, but I'm starting to doubt that choice. I really think that doing what is fun to you heavily outwheighs the slightly worse industry and salaries, but maybe it would be way too greedy of a goal in my situation. Maybe it will be all much easier if I choose a path with more job opportunities. The problem is that I'm not quite sure what else I'm interested in. I love programming in general, and I love math, but I'm not sure how it would feel to do work a more ""traditional, boring office job"". I know for sure I hate frontend with passion, but everything else is a mystery to me. Data science/engineering sounds amazing, but I hear it's difficult to get into it without a masters degree - and I'm sure as hell not getting one myself. I don't know how I feel about the other options... backend? Embedded? Mobile apps? Not sure if I'm particularly into any of those. I might be, though, I'm just not sure. 

**1.TLDR;** I don't know if game programming is worth it, or even possible in my situation, and I'm not sold on any other areas. Thoughts?

**2)** Let's say I make my decision about (1). How do I even build a portfolio? To land a job when I graduate I'll need to have gone through a nice internship. To land an internship I'll need a nice portfolio. But what is a nice portfolio? Let's suppose I'm almighty and have unlimited time in my hands: where do I start? Do I look for an internship as fast as possible? Do I work on personal projects? Do I join a professional team working on something? Do I focus on open source projects? If I really wanted to bring great value to my CV and blow competition out of the water, what is the goal I should have to make that possible? Given that I'm capable, what could I possibly do that would wow interviewers? How do I maximize my chances of success?

**2.TLDR;** What's test way to build an impressive portfolio and increase my chances of success?

Sorry if I sound too confused and clueless, it's cause I really am. It's the kind of thing that I'd never learn in university and would need to gamble in life to learn from. Any advice is highly welcome. Sorry for the long-ish post and thanks in advance!"

In what seemed like last minute, I switched to the Computer Science major last year and have started programming ever since.

Now, I'm nowhere near being a half decent programmer. I'm honestly terrible at it but I'm still working my way up and I love it regardless.

Long story short, yes I'm aware that being a senior student and not having much personal projects is an issue and I need to get an internship asap, but my question is this:

I've programmed two little games(C++) and a super basic HTML website for fun and put them in my github. I clearly don't have much and am building more projects at the moment, but I've put my github link to my resume regardless. Should I still explicitly describe what I've built on my resume regarding the mini projects I've just mentioned? If so, I would have to remove some work experience regarding my prior work experiences with kids because if I don't, the resume will have to be two pages.. since it won't fit.. and I know two paged resumes are typically a no-no.

Hopefully my question made sense and I apologize if this was too long. Any help/advice is appreciated."

I'm not good at programming at all and only know the basics of java (some exposure to OOP concepts), how to make simple calculators in python, and have dicked around with html, css and javascript in a web dev udemy course.

I’m really really struggling to adjust to my job,Mort-the-lemur,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jasoq1/does_it_get_easier_im_really_really_struggling_to/,"So 3 weeks ago I started working at a large consulting firm. I just graduated from college so this is my first real job besides summer internships. 

I knew I would struggle to adjust to working a full time “corporate America” job, but I was diagnosed 7 years ago so I felt  confident the progress I have made and coping mechanisms I have developed. Sadly the transition has not been so great... I try to go into every day with a fresh start but I just feel so incapable. I have never this forgetful, disorganized, anxious (I always feel these to some extent but never at the level I am now) everyday I end feeling like I will never be successful at my job because I won’t be able to create quality work or be able to adjust to the demands of an average work day.

My team is very understanding, but the difference in the amount of time it takes me to do a task and the quality of work compared to someone who also started recently is very obviously different and it’s affecting me a lot.

Has anyone else ever felt this way? Does it get better? And any tips for starting a new job and especially having ADHD in a “corporate America” / large company that demands a lot from employees? I’m starting to feel really defeated... I worked so hard to get this job but I wonder if I can actually handle it."
jat9i7,121,2020-10-13,Opinions on employee tracking software,definitionofabasis,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jat9i7/opinions_on_employee_tracking_software/,"I’m currently on co-op at a remote dev job. I’m working on my personal computer, and my employer requires that I install employee tracking software. This software tracks time worked, mouse activity, keyboard activity, and randomly takes screenshots every few minutes of everything on my screen.

It frustrates me a bit because I feel like it’s a pretty big invasion of my privacy, specifically because the screenshot feature captures things like sensitive information or personal email/messages that pop up, and my employer and the software can view these things.

Every time something like that happens I have to either quit the software and restart it after I’m done viewing, or delete my activity for a time interval, erasing my active/paid time. It’s an annoying experience and makes me feel like my employer doesn’t trust their employees to get work done even though they can see messages, video meetings, and git commits.

I tried blocking screenshots in my personal computer's privacy settings, but my employer noticed and specifically requested that I enable screenshots, the reason being ""since co-ops are doing internships for credit, we need to keep records in case the University of Waterloo asks in the future"".

I'm getting all my hours in on the software and I'm having a decent work experience (apart from the tracking software), but the privacy aspect is definitely something that would negatively affect my ratings/opinions about the work experience and my likelihood of returning in the future. What are your opinions on employers requiring employee tracking software like this? Is anyone else on a remote co-op right now required to use it?"
jatwew,34,2020-10-14,I keep screwing up,Zomgambush,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jatwew/i_keep_screwing_up/,"I'm two years out of college in my first post-college position (intern to full time hire) and no matter what I do, I just keep failing. Failing to deliver on time, failing to understand new technologies, failing to understand the code base. What I do deliver ends up having parts that need to be redone by my manager. My first stand alone module finally made it to production (a literal year late) and the first client it processed ran into an error which caused me to roll back.

My manager has made it clear that my performance is not what is expected and I am beyond dissatisfied myself. I have brought up multiple times that I'm not satisfied with my performance and keep getting a vague ""we'll figure out what's not working soon"" response.

I'm terrified of losing my job. I'm losing sleep (which just compounds the issue) and stressed. I'm reading code complete and have read a few other software dev/design books

How can I be a better dev? I don't expect to be a Rockstar over night, I just want to know what habits I can develop to improve my skills"
jau06z,4,2020-10-14,Never heard of a lot of the technologies jobs want. What am I missing?,Vathirumus,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jau06z/never_heard_of_a_lot_of_the_technologies_jobs/,"As the title says, I'm sort of in a bit of a defeated spot right here.  I'm 6 months out of college and on the verge of signing on for a job completely outside of my field working in a warehouse, just to build more work experience.   I graduated with a 3.7 GPA in a major focused on simulation software, but with a lot of additional education to allow for general software design.  I attended vo-tech for 3 more years.  In total this adds up to about 7 years of education in programming throughout high school and college, understanding C++, Java, C# and MySQL, and even some web development in there for good measure.  My main issue, the one I'd like to but find myself unable to resolve adequately, is that I have very little work experience to speak of.  I'm trying to get that experience.  Should I set my sights lower?  I'm looking for junior full-time positions, but is it acceptable to look for internships even though I'm a graduate?

I just got turned down for a job that would've been great for me, all because I lack professional experience in Hibernate.  I am fairly adaptable, I'm confident that I can learn it and apply it as necessary if I was just given a bit of time.  However, that didn't work out, even after telling the recruiter as much.  It's becoming a recurring trend that when I look at jobs, they require professional experience at entry-level in programs such as Hibernate, Azure, React, so on, so forth.  These are all things that were never even mentioned in my education; until looking at these job postings, I'd never encountered or used them.

I'm starting to feel like my education let me down.  If there's all of these technologies out there, why didn't anybody think to inform me?  I would've liked to start learning and using them earlier.  But, that said, I think my more pressing question is: Where are people getting their initial professional experience in these?  Because if my education failed to address these topics, I feel as if others may have as well, but there's obviously people out there who are more qualified than me if they're able to fill these positions.  These are supposedly entry-level positions, but I fail to see how it's entry-level if it requires professional experience that someone at that level obviously doesn't have yet.

I suppose my question, in summary, is: if these are entry-level positions, and they're requiring experience in technologies not covered in a college education, where are people getting the professional experience required for these?  Sorry if I answered my own questions or I'm rambling, I'm just trying to get myself oriented in the right direction here and I feel like taking a completely unrelated job does not seem to be it, so I figured I'd ask for advice.  Thanks, all."

How much are you needing to support your kids in this economy?,doncasternorth,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/jav5xk/parents_of_recent_grads_or_really_anyone_really/,"Have a son who graduated in Commerce in May and hasn't been able to find anything much. Recently he found a possible banking job in Toronto  but it pays about 40000. 

I doubt that is enough to live on there (we live in Calgary), so we would need to subsidize him there for a certain period of time, especially for the large expenses. Not so much of a problem as we earn a good household income (170K) and our other son lives at home (which is a low cost subsidy for us that lets him save tons) so a certain amount would be fair.  I just did not think that we would be needing to do this. 

Anyone else here in the same boat? 

As an aside question, how do you evaluate career benefits vs costs?

My eldest is a software developer here in Calgary who thinks living in Toronto is financially insane (and he would have made a lot more than my other son would make). He thinks his brother should stay here,  live at home, and go be a cheap intern at his friend's Dad's company rather than be a CIBC drone. But my other son thinks that is not as good for his career."

Will I ever be able to forgive myself?,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jaw352/i_emotionally_abused_my_ex_and_this_guilt_is/,"It all started in summer 2019 when I moved away for a summer internship. We had been happily dating for 2 years prior to that.

I became very jealous of her guy friends and when sometimes she's out trying to have a good time with her social group, I kept calling and calling and ruined her nights. I used to say things like Im super drunk and lost so I know she'll attend to me and not her friends. I became a scum essentially.

Sooner or later she told me she needed space. I couldnt register that, I became more pushy, the polar opposite of what she needed. Then, understandably, she began ignoring me. Never replied. I started to drink everyday and before I knew it, I became a full blown alcoholic.

Anyways there came a very dark day, that I still regret and will probably regret always. I was drunk as usual and sent her a message saying I will commit suicide if she does not reply. I thought maybe this is it, i'll get to speak to her and explain everything properly since I was tired of the silent treatment. The outcome was the opposite. She discussed my message with my parents and told them I was harassing her and she was really scared.

The next day I felt the weight of my words and began apologizing. I lost my mind to an extent that I started apologizing about apologizing excessively. This went on for a few months until I guess she had enough of my constant messages. She said she forgave me but will never speak to me ever again.

I finally stopped messaging and realized how hurtful I became. Im still a full blown functioning alcoholic and I feel the guilt of actions everyday. From a small jealous emotion to ruining my relationship with her forever, its all been my fault. Idk where I lost my path and I hate myself for putting her through all this trauma.  


I dont think I can ever date again, I dont want to put anybody else through this. Maybe this is just my personality? 

Has anybody been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it?"

So I just recently graduated with my bachelor's in CS and I'm faced with two choices:

1. Spend a few months learning the tools I will need for a job and grind leetcode and practice interview skills. I really want to work in industry, but I am very worried about the current state of the economy. I worry that even if I'm incredibly lucky to get a job, I will be taking a starting salary that's much less than expected due to much more supply than demand. I could be wrong, but my general intuition is that its almost impossible right now for fresh meat to land a position at all.
2. Play the long game and get a master's degree in CS. Hopefully after 2 years I will be able to exit into a much better market and I'll be well positioned to take advantage of it, though I'll also have more debt.

What seems like a better plan? I'm specifically talking about the Canadian market as that's where I'm located. Thanks.

Edit for background: by learning the tools, I mean I was previously aiming for the embedded market, though most of the market in my metro area was entirely in aerospace. After the aerospace industry tanked recently, I decided to focus in on web dev since it seems like an industry that can handle a remote work force better than others. I have internship experience doing dashboard apps for a utilities company."

jayc8g,0,2020-10-14,How are individuals with severe social awkwardness expected to maintain employment?,Rigolettobassi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jayc8g/how_are_individuals_with_severe_social/,"Quite often, computer science (or the like) [is suggested as a good career](https://www.iidc.indiana.edu/irca/articles/choosing-the-right-job-for-people-with-autism-or-aspergers-syndrome.html) for people who are on the spectrum. (also, [here](https://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/best-autism-jobs-and-careers/), and [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/spectrum-solutions/201007/how-find-your-career-the-autism-spectrum))

If you meet me in-person, you can **absolutely** tell there's something **very** wrong with me within five seconds of our initial conversation. I'm VERY socially awkward, and it's an incredibly pervasive issue when it comes to finding employment. I have a master's degree, but I had the worst time trying to find employment post-graduation. I didn't have any internships, which certainly didn't help. I tried applying all over the US and each ""sure-thing"" interview I got (especially with government jobs) ended in rejection.

I spent a year looking for employment, went to career and interview coaching sessions, and I even got rejected from jobs at McDonald's, Best Buy, Wendy's, and Home Depot--places that were absolutely desperately advertising on the local news stations that they **needed** people, and they didn't take me. I was living with my parents, who were incredibly condescending that I could get a master's degree and not find a job, and it just discouraged me that I'm destined for a life of unemployment.

Eventually, I got a job at a FAANG (not as an SDE, but in a technical role) near the start of the pandemic. Let me say that this pandemic has been a literal **GODSEND** when it comes to interacting with coworkers. My coworkers aren't subjected to the sandpaper friction of dealing with me, because I can hide behind text and a computer screen and *carefully* think about what I'm saying. When I *was* going into the office, my coworkers were all pissed off with me because of the severe social awkwardness.

But I'm not feeling inclined to stay here at this FAANG anymore just because of the cutthroat competition to get promoted (that is, if you're not working towards getting promoted, you're getting fired). I want to transition away from corporate America into roles that aren't so high stress (such as government work), but I'm still no better at socializing than I was before getting this job. Once the pandemic ends, we're going to be expected to go back into offices, and it's guaranteed I'm going to be discovered and quickly terminated. Even if I don't stay at this FAANG, I will still have trouble obtaining and maintaining employment. For people who are socially awkward, how difficult is it for you to procure and keep employment?"

jb0dkl,2,2020-10-14,Chance Me: Political Science and English Major at Ivies and Top LACs,my_one_and_lonely,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/jb0dkl/chance_me_political_science_and_english_major_at/,"No one really responded last time, so I’m posting this again. 

**Demographics:** White (Ashkenazi Jewish if that makes a difference) upper-middle-class female from a small public high school in New York State. 

**Intended Majors:** Political Science and English

**Tests:** I got a 1590 (800M, 790R) on my second attempt at the SAT. On my first attempt, I got a 1500 (740M, 760R). I got an 800 on the world history subject test and am awaiting my scores on Math II and English. 

**GPA and Rank:** 4.3197 GPA (unweighted). For context, my school uses a 4.33 scale which is like a 4.0 scale except it includes A+s. So straight A+s would be a 4.33 GPA. My GPA is indicative of all A+s in all my classes besides for one A. My school doesn't do class rankings, but I'm confident that I'm ranked first or second in my class of 125. 

**Coursework:** AP World History (5), APUSH (4), AP English Lang (4), AP Statistics (5), AP Biology (4). I am taking AP Comparative Government, AP Spanish, AP Calc BC, and AP English Literature this year.

**Awards:** 

National Merit Scholar Semifinalist

First Place in Behavioral Science at County Science Research Fair

Book Award from an Ivy League School

Science Awad for commitment to social justice and work in the social sciences

High School Nonfiction Writing Award (10th and 11th grade)

Club Awards: Book Club (10,11), Academic Challenge Team (10, 11), and Shakespeare Club (11)

**Extracurriculars:** I'm going to try and keep this brief...

This is technically part of school, but I have been conducting a science research project on the impact of media on climate change beliefs for the past three years.

Summer Internship with State Assemblywoman

Created and ran a virtual Shakespeare camp for middle schoolers

Student Congress Vice President (currently, senior year elections to come) and Communications Committee Chair

Virtual Fellowship on a Congressional Campaign

Creative Thinking program member for 8 years, competed at world finals four times, placed in the top 20 twice.

Book Club - President since tenth grade

Shakespeare club - Vice President

Academic Challenge Team - Co-captain

Model U.N. member

Actress in my school's theater productions: two musicals, three Shakespeares, one non-Shakespeare play

Fellow on national program for Jewish teen feminists. 

**Volunteering:**

Volunteer on a soccer team for special needs kids since seventh grade.

Member of my local library's teen advisory board where I co-founded a book club in my county library system.

I volunteered for other things, but I won't list all that.

**Work:**

I am a math tutor and I also worked on campaign to increase voter turnout in 2019. 

**Essays:**

I wrote my main essay on why I love Shakespeare. I highlighted my love of language, drive for learning, and determination. I'm on draft 6 right now. I think it's pretty good, but not really mindblowing in terms of a story.

I write my main supplement for Harvard (where I’m applying early) on how reading helped me mature and I opened with this story about how a fox stole my kindle. It’s a weird mix of unique anecdotes and a typical story. 

**Letters of rec:**

I will have one from my APUSH teacher and Student Congress advisor. He is a very good writer and definitely likes me, so probably 8 or 9/10. The other will be from my  Science Research teacher to emphasize my research. She definitely likes me, but I don't know how this one will turn out, so maybe 6 or 7/10. My counselor likes me, but I don't have a super-strong relationship with her. She still knows me more than she knows most of the other students at my school, so maybe 7/10.

**Schools:** All Ivies sans Cornell and Princeton. EA to Harvard. I'm also applying to top LACs such as Williams, Amherst, Bowdoin, Hamilton, Wesleyan, and Vassar.

Sorry if this was too long! Thanks for reading!"
jb0s5h,1,2020-10-14,I'm stuck and I'm so scared,Transit-Strike,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jb0s5h/im_stuck_and_im_so_scared/,"My boss at my internship had me self train through leetcode and I've reached an impasse.

I started well. Learned Hash functions, sliding windows and some recursion. Backtracking really fucks me up though. I can intuitively tell when I need one of the two, the right time to use them.

In a month, my fear of error conditions died too, I run code, see the error and know what to fix. I started writing read me files too. Just became better and planning out my code.

Then...

There was a program that looks at combination sum. It was way harder than anything I've done. But i grinded, I drew out my trees, planned my problem, looked at my exit conditions and finally got code working. There was days I spent hours and hours on it. One day I spent like 6 hours on it. When I finished it was hella rewarding. I ran code faster than 86% of submissions. I was genuinely proud of myself.

As part of it all, I was watching videos on understanding recursion better.

Then there was an alternate form of the same code, try looked at multiple repetitions of numbers. Tried it with a hashed linked list thing. Couldnt get it working as well. Looked submissions on leetcode. There were people that solved it in 10 lines of code.

That intitially motivated me. I figured I could do a course and learn. So I did this Stanford class that looks at trees, DFS, BFS, Djistra's etc. Couldn't understand shit.

So I tried a similar, but easier course from UCSD. It covered Greedy sums, but explained it better, it didnt assume I knew it. Same with recursion and Big O.

I could understand lecture. Couldnt solve shit. I know how to solve knapsack problems. But my brain isnt coding it well? Something is weird for sure.

Now everything is junked in my stupid brain. I solved the problem four days ago and now nothing makes sense. Trees, recursion, backtracking, everything is jumbled.


I dont know what to do next. And I'm scared to ask my boss"

A little background on me. I graduated from school in May 2020 and I have been working as a full stack engineer since January 2020 at a local company.

Over the last year I have learned a lot but I am finding that I am getting to a point where I am no longer learning and more just pushing code around. Our testing and design standards are sub-par and the tech stack is outdated (.NET and WPF).

I am finding the job market is not the best, and was wondering if I should consider taking an internship at tech companies. I just want to put myself into a position where I can continue to learn and develop my skillset.

How should I go about putting myself in an environment where I can learn?"

I have a background in Java (around 2-3 years). I know that C++ is more detailed in many ways than Java and they have their fair share of differences despite being similar in some ways. Is it even worth trying to attempt the interview? I'm afraid of completely floundering for 1 hour and embarrassing myself, but at the same time I know you miss all the shots you don't take. However, I have other work I also need to practice, and if there's only like a 1% chance of managing it, then it might not be worth me grinding for 2 weeks, trying to learn C++.

jb4xhs,2,2020-10-14,Help with your recent experience landing a SWE job in California/Seattle,mb2bibo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jb4xhs/help_with_your_recent_experience_landing_a_swe/,"Dear community,   
My wife is trying to land a job as an entry level SWE in BayArea. She has a B.S in Computer Science and worked as Teaching Assistant for 3 years. Now after 4 years of staying at home mom, she wants to get into industry. During the last 8 months she took an online course on Web development from Udacity and solving 200+ problems on leetcode. She applied for lost of job opportunities 100+ but only couple got back, one startup the feedback was positive on problem solving but not good on the tech side (lack of modern frameworks, etc..), one of the FAANGs she failed in the onsite after passing the phone interview. The rest mainly need at least a year of industry experience and almost all internships need pursing a degree.  


I think the main problem is that most of the cases the resume doesn't pass the screening and that might be the reason why she didn't get interviews. She considered pursing an online masters or a coding-bootcamp. I'm kind of against the code-bootcamp as most of the feedback is that people still doing job hunting for 6-8 months after graduation so i feel like it'll be wasting of time but maybe masters would be better.  
So let me know what do you think we should do based on similar experiences. Also if anyone willing to make a referral that'd be awesome, she is willing to consider internships paid/unpaid as well to get the industry experience."

I noticed earlier on that the company is pretty disorganized, there were no coding style guides or any thing of that sort, and they allowed me to work on production code soon after a month of joining.

One of the higher execs wanted a feature similar to medium and they assigned me to do it. My direct manager was pretty lazy and he left everything to me didn't even write a spec. So, I started coding, they'd see my progress twice a week and ask me to add features/change things.

This went on for 2 months, the feature was finally ""up to the mark"", my direct manager just needed to review my code, check the feature one last time and push it to production. For some reason he slept on it, until last week when the higher exec basically shouted at him to push the feature in a meeting. That day he finally pushed it to prod.

Next day, the site is down (this site has the most traffic out of all the sites), cs &amp; sales teams are going crazy, my manager gets fired. I check my code along with some other dev, we find out that it was my code that caused the crash.

I felt pretty bad thinking he got fired at such harsh times and has a family to feed, and how its my fault for writing bad code. But now, after he left I'm finding really weird things about the company: my manager didn't include me in meetings even if others asked him to (he was insecure maybe?), he hid things from me, the higher exec didn't have the permission of the CEO to add that feature.

I was pretty fed up of doing web dev and wanted to change my team, I was pushing my mangers for it, I guess that won't happen anytime soon. I also don't know what will my role be moving forward, I've asked other managers but they seem undecided. I really don't know how to navigate this situation and felt like ranting, thanks for reading."

I’m now looking to see if I can do research on the side but most opportunities appear to be associated with current students only. I graduated in 2019.

- I need academic recommendations to get into grad school. I don’t have academic recommendations because a) I was too busy juggling off campus work and my engineering school to forge a personal relationship with my professors and b) my professor’s were too swamped with my massive meche program’s best of the best forging personal relationships that they don’t have time for the middle ground students. I have trusted folks who could recommend me but they’re not big names in academia, which puts me below other applicants. 

I know I’m hard working and willing enough to do well in academia, but it’s so hard for me to break into it when the application criteria is so stringent and I’m immediately pushed out by these things.

I'm a current Berkeley junior studying CS, and I'm considering taking time off from school to create a startup. My idea has been in the works for several years, and because of the online classes/pandemic, I'm considering taking a gap semester to built a prototype. I also have a friend studying CS who is interested in doing this with me. I first thought about this idea two years ago, submitted it to an ideas competition, received positive/negative insightful feedback, and reworked it now.

We are both committed to working hard, learning necessary technologies, and building a finished product. I've been reading a lot of this subreddit, and other stories from founders to see what others have done. I'm looking for advice on this. Within my social circle at Berkeley, I don't particularly know anyone else who has done this or considered this. Mostly, just internship hunting at prestigious companies.

One of my professors indicated to me that pursuing a startup idea is basically all or nothing; it's not worth trying to manage the rigorous courses at Cal with a start-up part time. That's why I'm considering a gap semester as well. My co-founder and I are both competent programmers, and versed in the CS fundamentals. I've been a TA for our data structures course. But neither of us have really any experience with the frameworks, web design, mobile, etc. What are some tools or languages I should be thinking about learning? Lately, I've been looking into progressive web apps for our current design to simplify over cross-platform. Ideally, we'd have a presence on the web and mobile applications, as our idea is initially targeted towards college students.

We are privileged to have capital to support us while we are creating a prototype, and initial money to invest in it if needed.

We've written up pitches, and documents fleshing out our idea - target audience, features, competition, differentiating factors, monetization, addressing which need, etc. If anyone has gone through this process before, and could shed some light on pitfalls or a common path, that would be greatly appreciated. Or a short chat. Thank you all! Go bears

Learn from my mistakes",helpthischairisold,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jbbq8l/the_phrase_entry_level_is_a_lie_you_must_have/,"This is gonna be tailored towards science majors because that's what I know, but the spirit applies to other fields too. To give a frame of reference, I applied to between 80 and 120 jobs from April-August and got a single interview out of it. 

Every single ""entry level"" job that exists will only hire people with experience in the field. I am telling you this because it was not emphasized enough to me, and this is important. People, and especially older people, like to chatter about how a college degree makes you employable and you should make sure you have a broad range of experiences and internships aren't all THAT important, and that is some steamy bullshit.

Every job out there in your field is going to say ""experience preferred"". That is a lie. They will not even vaguely consider you as a candidate unless you have research or internship experience. It's harsh, but you won't get hired with just a bachelor's degree and a winning smile, and if that's all you have then you'd better go see if any of your professors need ~~peons~~ lab techs. It won't be fulfilling work, but it will be enough to get someone who kinda knows your face and can vouch that you're a real human with skills.

You can have a 4.0 GPA, but that weird dude who never blinks and sometimes snorts lines of ramen seasoning off the desk has one too. You might have a super viable skillset from paying great attention in labs, but the heinous moocher who got lucky with lab partners got the same grade in that course. The way you show employers that you're better than them is by having people who can vouch for you. 

Don't believe me yet? Go look at job boards, check how many of the ""entry level"" ones want 2+ years of experience, or even just 6 months of experience. This is, unfortunately, an employer's market, and you gotta do everything you can to stand out. A single semester of research experience can make the difference for a \_lot\_ of jobs."

jbf3hw,1,2020-10-14,"Current mechatronics student, unsure of where to go from here",pspbrad,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jbf3hw/current_mechatronics_student_unsure_of_where_to/,"Hello everyone,

I'm a current mechatronics engineering student at a community college and I'll be graduating in spring.   I’m currently in the process of applying for universities, but I’m unsure of what I want to major in or where I want to go. I quite enjoy mechatronics and getting to play around with robotics, automated manufacturing, PLCs, etc. However, I’ve found that I really love to do CAD work in particular. I design all kinds of stuff in my free time using Inventor and Fusion 360, and 3d print them. I’d love to turn that passion into a career, but I’m not sure what would best prepare me to do that kind of work- and if that would even be a good idea or if I should continue into mechatronics.

&amp;nbsp;

 I’ve thought a lot about switching to MechE as it’s rather broad and I know a lot of CAD work can be found for mechanical engineers. The downside to that though is that my mechatronics courses likely will not transfer to any of the universities I’m looking at for mechanical engineering. My other thought would be to continue into a bachelor’s program specifically for mechatronics, where my courses will transfer, and it won’t take me as long or cost me near as much to finish a bachelor’s. I also don’t really know what my chances would be at getting into mechanical engineering program, though I think I have a pretty decent shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

A bit about my academics: 

* I have a 4.0
* I’m a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society
*  I have a pretty good relationship with my instructors and have already gotten letters of recommendation from two of them, including the dean of my program. 
* I also have an internship with an electronics company that happens to be a defense contractor; and I have two recommendation letters from former military engineers through this internship. 
* I currently hold a certification in AutoCAD, and by the time I’m finished with my associate’s I should also be certified in Inventor and have a Siemens mechatronic systems certification.
*  I’m also doing a seminar engineering project this semester with a couple of other students to design an indoor hydroponics system for growing mature vegetables/fruits/herbs as a solution to accessible self-sustainability in urban areas.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The two universities I’m looking at the most right now are Virginia Tech for Mechanical Engineering (though I would start in general engineering as required by VT), and Old Dominion University for mechatronics as the majority of my credits will transfer there. I live in VA so I would get in-state tuition at both and VT is within reasonable distance for me to commute to from where I live now. There’s also the ‘prestige’ of going to a top engineering school like VT and how that might play into my future career, but I’d have to spend a lot more time and money in going to VT. I’m also applying to a few other ‘top’ engineering schools, including Cornell, Stanford, and a few others; though I think it’s probably a long shot (plus they are also ridiculously expensive). But hey, you miss every shot you don’t take, so I figured I might as well apply.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, if you’ve managed to get through my book, I’d love to hear any input or recommendations, especially from those who have been in similar situations.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks,

-pspbrad"

About  me I consider all other fields are shit and I only allow him to learn  coding because not to develop skills. The only way to be a millionaire  is by learning coding like Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. All I care  about is money I want to give a better life for him. And I want to  teach him to judge people based on their financial status because money  is the best thing in the world. If you're doing a low paying job and you  have other skills living your life as per your wish im sorry to say  this please stay away from me and my child. ( you're not eligible to  live)

Here's my plan

AT  0- 10 I want him to learn all the programming in this old even dead one  and at the same time he needs to prepare for gov and competitive exams

At 11 - 15 I want him to do an internship in a big MNC

AT 16 I want him to be an entrepreneur with $10mill in his bank account

AT 20 I want him to be the CEO of GOOGLE or FACEBOOK

At 23 I want him to marry a woman from a high profile family ( im very strict in this she must be an Indian)

And  I want him to follow my steps to his children also and in my last, I  want to see my millionaire family surrounding me note: only people with  money in their bank account is allowed if one of his children failed I  will disown him and I will die peacefully.

Life  is all about earning money money money if your age is 10-16 and you're  wasting your time in the name of enjoying You're stupid and dumb start  to run right now you don't need to sleep. Sleep only 2hrs a day work  hard try every competitive exam and learn the thing that will make you a  millionaire. Stay away from the useless people on this planet who spend  their time on reading( poems, books, philosophy) and wasting time (art,  listening to music)  and living a simple life and treats everyone  equally.

Minimum You have to earn 2L/m otherwise, I never consider you as a human

Start to run

jbfrrf,10,2020-10-14,Berkeley student thinking about taking a semester off to do a startup.,bearlybearlybears,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jbfrrf/berkeley_student_thinking_about_taking_a_semester/," 

Hi all,

I'm a current Berkeley junior studying CS, and I'm considering taking time off from school to create a startup. My idea has been in the works for several years, and because of the online classes/pandemic, I'm considering taking a gap semester to built a prototype. I also have a friend studying CS who is interested in doing this with me. I first thought about this idea two years ago, submitted it to an ideas competition, received positive/negative insightful feedback, and reworked it now.

We are both committed to working hard, learning necessary technologies, and building a finished product. I've been reading a lot of this subreddit, and other stories from founders to see what others have done. I'm looking for advice on this. Within my social circle here, I don't particularly know anyone else who has done this or considered this. Mostly, just internship hunting at prestigious companies.

One of my professors indicated to me that pursuing a startup idea is basically all or nothing; it's not worth trying to manage the rigorous courses at Cal with a start-up part time. That's why I'm considering a gap semester as well. My co-founder and I are both competent programmers, and versed in the CS fundamentals. I've been a TA for our data structures course. But neither of us have really any experience with the frameworks, web design, mobile, etc. What are some tools or languages I should be thinking about learning? Lately, I've been looking into progressive web apps for our current design to simplify over cross-platform. Ideally, we'd have a presence on the web and mobile applications, as our idea is initially targeted towards college students.

We are privileged to have capital to support us while we are creating a prototype, and initial money to invest in it if needed.

We've written up pitches, and documents fleshing out our idea - target audience, features, competition, differentiating factors, monetization, addressing which need, etc. If anyone has gone through this process before, and could shed some light on pitfalls or a common path, that would be greatly appreciated. Or a short chat. Thank you all! Go bears"

I am an international student planning to pursue my masters in ECE focusing on digital VLSI. I had applied last year and got a few admits in colleges like GT, purdue, cmu, ucsd (and some others).

I currently work as a design automation engineer and aim to move into either front-end digital design, physical design, dv or dft (in that order of priority).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic I was not able to accept the admits and plan to apply again this year. I wanted get inputs on the colleges. Here is my research so far:

Gatech: Very good reputation overall. But less courses in digital vlsi, more on architecture. No courses that deal with design using verilog or verification (apart from one in VHDL which may/may not be offered). Fees is affordable. Apart from a few main courses, other courses seem very irregular. Apparently a very big career fair with a lot of opportunities.

UCSD: I got into Electrical circuits and system so would have to take some analog courses (not as interested in it). It has a quarter system though. The courses seemed good overall, but the courses were not as in-depth as other colleges. Not sure how the projects/labs get affected by a shorter duration. Fees on the higher side but I am told people do get TAs.

USC: Very good courses in all aspects of digital design. Has a processor design course with design using verilog which the other colleges don't offer. General reputation seems to be lower than the others with very high student intake. Not sure how it affects the internship opportunities. Total cost to attend on the higher side. (maybe also consider the case the I get some scholarship in this case)

TAMU: Decent courses overall, but I am told the verification course is the thing that mainly helps given that other courses might not be as good for digital design. Fees is affordable.

CMU: Very good reputation and courses. But, very costly. Is it worth the high cost in the end? Compared to other universities.

Purdue: More focused on computer architecture. 2 Mandatory maths courses, leaving less place for courses related to the intended major. I am told it is excellent for research but might not have as many opportunities as the others in the list. Fees is affordable.

Umich (not sure if I would get in): The courses 427 and 470 as said to be very good and cover PD and comp arch (from design perspective) in great detail. It is as costly as cmu though. Not sure about the opportunities though.

It would be great to get your inputs. I do have an exactly relevant work ex to my target fields so might need to consider doing the courses and projects which will help me."

That is what my app looks like.

My question is this. Do I have a better shot at applying to CAS at Cornell, or CoE?

&amp;#x200B;

Cornell has been a dream of mine ever since Freshman year, and since I'm equally conflicted between CAS and CoE, I'm willing to take the one that increases my chance of admission. So, where do I have a better shot? I'd be applying as a CS major in both cases."

Before asking anything let me just give a brief overview of my profile:

**GPA** : 8.67/10, which roughly converts to 82%

**Courses** : Almost everything related to CS - Database, Algorithms, Programming, Mathematics (Calculus and Statistics)

**Tech Stack** : Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Good knowledge of Python, PyTorch and deep learning algorithms. Also a workable knowledge of C/C++, SQL and AWS.

**Research** : I have 1 publication rn, working on one more, probably will be done before graduation so 2 in total.

**Work Experience** : Since I'm an undergrad, most of my work experience is in form of internship and personal projects.

So I want to apply for Machine Learning/Data Science masters in Canada where curriculum leans more towards AI/ML as oppposed to mathematics of data science. However finance is a big problem for me. I'll have probably have somewhere around 20,000 USD to work with (Overall). Won't have parental support, will probably have to take loans and stuff (I'm also considering Germany for this very reason). Can you guys please provide some suggestions on what I should pursue here?"
jbl1od,23,2020-10-15,Surface Tension,fresh_geosmin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jbl1od/surface_tension/,"I've been an oceanographer for almost forty years, and I've seen plenty of amazing, beautiful, and terrifying things. But the floating tomb we ran across and maybe nearly died in, the ghost ship, is one I could never explain to my own satisfaction.

A few years ago I was on board a forty-foot catamaran, RV S.O. Makarov, in the Indian Ocean near the Maldives. I was there mostly as a mentor for Sam, a PhD student doing research on the movement of the new ecosystem of neuston which appears to be emerging from plastic trash. Some call it ""the plastisphere"". There are organisms who are attracted to floating garbage simply because it grows its own special soup of biofilm and floats for a long time, which in turn attract other organisms which eat them.

The Makarov had just two crewmembers, Captain Fernando and his first mate Mr Kumara, and then there were six of us researchers: I was the senior scientist, and besides Sam the four others were students and researchers from NARA, the Sri Lankan aquatic research agency. We were out for a weeklong session, collecting samples or dropping ADCPs to measure current flows, while on board we mapped our data with the local Argos. Ocean currents are my specialty, so this pairing worked out well.

This area of the ocean, between the Arabian and the North Equatorial currents, has a lot of movement and isn't like the large ocean gyres where the so-called famous ""Garbage Patches"" form. Still, plastic is everywhere, and we were looking at what's going on with the more mobile bits. We were also keeping just south of the heavily-trafficked shipping lanes between the Laccadive Sea and the Gulf States. It's busy enough that you'll see ships on the water every day, and so it didn't seem unusual or noteworthy when, near the end of the day, a rusted cargo ship approached us, a black and red thing with two cranes folded on its deck.

What _was_ unusual was the people running back and forth across the deck, waving their arms and as it came closer, yelling. Our captain became concerned as the ship seemed to be getting rather close to us and tried hailing it, but got no response. It turned out the ship wasn't moving under its own power, but slowly drifting along the currents towards us. We angled to the side, and noticed there were no longer any signs of people on deck.

Captain Fernando peered out at the ship and muttered under his breath that there was no visible name on the ship. Indeed, on the side facing us, nothing was painted, but the flags on each end were red and white—Indonesia.

Evening was approaching and it was decided that it wasn't normal for a ship not to return a hail and also not to simply drift (cargo ships have schedules to keep), so perhaps there was something wrong. The captain felt it was a good idea for someone to board and inspect. The Makarov was brought alongside and tied fast. Mr Kumara threw up a ladder and clambered up the outer hull and disappeared over the top.

About twenty minutes later he was back, looking very confused.

""There's no-one aboard, sir,"" he reported to the captain.

""What? We saw several people earlier!""

Mr Kumara shook his head. ""There's nobody there now. I found plates of food in the galley. Fresh, like people were just about to eat! There's nobody on the bridge, and the controls seem to have no power, so the radio would not work even if someone was there.""

But we all knew we'd definitely seen people on board just an hour earlier, and plates with food meant someone had been there. The captain immediately began scanning the horizon for small boats. They must have left in lifeboats or dinghies. But there was nothing, and the sun was setting.

The captain decided to radio a pan-pan, but the radio seemed to have trouble picking up signals, which was strange. Finally a response came from another ship, saying they were on their way and passing the message on, so we were just going to sit tight near this strange empty ship until others could come and deal with it.

But as it got darker, nobody came, and the ship continued to drift, now pulling us along as we were tied to it. In fact, strangely, there were _no_ other ships in view at all. The captain tried radioing several more times, getting no answer. He switched from VHF to the Iridium Go, but it seemed as though that also got no response. Now we were getting spooked.

""Should we remain with this ship?"" I asked. It was now dark, and we were now quite off-course.

The captain shrugged. ""I really don't like the idea of letting something this size drift around unmanned, but…""

It was then that we all heard the scream of a man, coming from above us. From the ship. A fearful scream, moving from the bow towards the stern as if they were running. And then it stopped with a small cry.

We all looked at each other. ""Someone's still up there!"" Sam exclaimed. Mr Kumara wanted to climb back up immediately, but the captain held him back.

""Not alone. Someone may be hurt. Something's going on."" As he grabbed the large torches, one of the other researchers, a younger man, said he had decent first-aid training and would come along. He grabbed our med kit and the three of them climbed up, disappearing over the edge and into blackness.

The five of us waited below, the lights of our small vessel not reaching the dark waters surrounding us. There were no other sounds from above, not even from our crew. I decided to do a check of all our remaining equipment, and made sure the EPIRB was ready to go if we needed a real rescue. I also got on the radio myself and started repeating the pan-pan at regular intervals. During the pauses, nothing answered us. I switched to other channels, and they were all silent, as if our radio was broken. I switched back to 16 and repeated our message a few more times. You're not supposed to stop, but it felt like I wasn't sending anything out and gave up.

An hour passed and no sign of our crew or anyone else. The looming metal hulk next to us remained mostly silent, except sometimes for a low metal groan or an echoing clunk. It made me shiver. I consider myself a practical, no-nonsense woman, not prone to being spooked by noises. Not at my age, and especially not at sea.

""Should… should someone go up and see if they're okay?"" asked one of the NARA student interns. She was asking me. With our crew gone, being the senior scientist, I was now head of this ship. And I knew the correct answer was ""no"". More people boarding this strange ship seemed clearly the wrong thing to do. Instead, we should watch for the next ship to pass, or worst-case for the morning, keep working the radio, and wait. One thought that wandered through my head was a gas trap. Suppose some gas had leaked out of this ship's cargo and it had caused the crew, and our men, to pass out. More people going would simply add to the body count. Thing was, Mr Kumara had gone up there and come back without noticing anything, and that we'd heard the screaming later seemed evidence against this. The ship also didn't looked anything like a gas transporter.

I hadn't replied to the question when a metal thud reverberated through the ship next to us. It shuddered and made a large groan, seeming to resonate in my bones and my teeth. We were all still as mice, and then we heard voices.

One of the other researchers pointed silently up, and we all strained to hear. It sounded like one person talking, then another voice making sounds. Then silence.

Now instead of gas, I was thinking of pirates. Somali piracy had gone down, way down in the past few years, and we were rather too far east to be in the danger zone, but suppose this ship had been attacked nearer the coast and drifted to us? But none of that made any sense either. If pirates couldn't get crew for ransom or couldn't get the cargo from the ship, they would have just left, or left with crew for ransom. It made no sense for them to remain on a dead ship, if Mr Kumara's observation of the bridge without power was correct.

""I'm going up,"" the words came out of my mouth before I thought I'd decided anything. I grabbed one of the knives for cutting lines, putting it and its leather sheath in my jacket pocket, and looked at the others. ""Someone can come with me, but at least two people must remain here, I think. I'm only going to look around the deck and call out for the captain."" I grabbed one of the Vertel hand-radios (I'm not sure who thought to bring walkie-talkies on board) and tossed it to one of the researchers, then I grabbed the other and turned it on. We tested them.

""I'll bring this, and someone here keeps in touch. Every thirty seconds?""

He nodded. Sam had stood up when I did. I looked at him. ""I'm coming,"" he said simply. I nodded, though I felt particularly responsible for him. Another man, the ocean chemist Udeesha, also stood. I took a big breath, re-checked my Vertel, and started climbing.

Climbing over the edge of the hull, the metal was cold to the touch even though the air wasn't cool. Once both my feet were on the deck, I checked in with the researcher below.

""We hear you,"" he replied.

""I don't see anything,"" I reported back. Udeesha came second, holding a torch, then Sam who also had one. They swung them around, showing a large, empty deck. We stood still, listening.

Somewhere deep in the ship, a metal creak came which turned into a groan, like a large oil drum.

""Captain?"" I called out. ""Captain!""

There were no sounds. I checked in again with my researcher, who replied. I looked at Sam and Udeesha.

""If there's something going on here where I lose consciousness, someone take the radio and keep talking with the rest, and get back down,"" I told them in a low voice. They nodded.

Udeesha started walking towards the stern, where the bridge was. We followed, calling out for the captain and Mr Kumara. The ship continued to groan and clunk at irregular intervals. It was as if it was gasping, or trying to talk. By the time we reached the bridge, I was shivering. But I kept loudly calling the captain and relaying updates through the hand radio, as Udeesha climbed the ladder to the bridge. I followed, with Sam behind me.

When we stepped inside the enclosed bridge, I made another radio update, but this time there was no reply.

""Hello?"" I repeated my message, but again there was no reply. I stepped back out the door and repeated, wondering if somehow the enclosed bridge had interfered. Still nothing. The radio only gave static. I returned to the bridge, where Sam confirmed nothing seemed to do anything when he flipped switches and knobs.

""I don't see a record book or anything,"" he said in a whisper. ""There's always a binder somewhere with ship's information, right?""

""I'm not getting anything back,"" I told them, holding the Vertel up. ""I think we should return.""

""Let's try checking the galley first,"" Udeesha insisted. ""If the food has been eaten, we know the original crew must still be here.""

I don't know why I agreed, but we left the bridge and found a ladder to one deck lower. Every so often, I re-tried contact with the hand radio, but still only static.

The galley was half-open, and Sam and Udeesha shined their lights in as another clunk sounded from somewhere deep in the ship. Udeesha swore, but quietly.

It was just as Mr Kumara had said. Plates and utensils were sitting on a covered table, with what looked like full meals still sitting on them. Rice, vegetables, potatoes, chicken, and cups of cold tea.

""Seriously, what the hell happened here?"" Sam asked in a whisper.

""Let's leave,"" I told them. There were still no signs of anyone and the radio silence was telling me to get out. I have to admit that by now I was quite frightened.

We climbed back up to the top deck when suddenly there was a very loud BOOM from below, causing all of us to stumble. Sam's torch rolled away.

""Back to the ship!"" I yelled at them. I grabbed Sam's arm to pull him up, and ran to Udeesha, grabbing him as he stumbled ahead. Sam ran a few steps to grab his torch. Together we ran around the bridge and back to the side port side. But when we got there, the ladder was gone.

Udeesha shone the torch along the edge as he walked back and forth. ""Where's our boat??"" he asked. 

""What do you mean?""

He looked back at us. ""It's gone!""

I peered over the edge as Sam shone his light down. Nothing but inky black, and a bit of water barely visible at the edge of the light.

""This makes no sense,"" I muttered. Then we heard a voice near the bow, and we all ran towards it, calling out. But when we reached the end, again there was nobody. A low rumbling was coming from belowdecks, and I worried there was something happening below.

We circled the entire deck, hearing only more clunks and groans and now that low rumble as we rounded the bridge and back at the side where we'd boarded.

This time when we looked overboard, there it was! Our vessel, barely visible in the dim edge of our torches. We almost cried from relief.

""Heeeey!"" Sam called down at them. Someone yelled back in reply. This time, when I tried talking on the hand radio, someone replied. I realized I'd been clenching my hand around the sheath of the knife in my jacket.

""Hey, we're here!"" I sent excitedly. ""Give us the ladder!""

We stepped back and someone threw up the ladder, and the three of us quickly descended. Confusingly, there was the captain, Mr Kumar and the other researcher who had gone with them.

""Where were you?"" they asked us at the same time we asked them. We were told that we'd been gone all night.

""What do you mean, all night?"" I asked. We'd been on board maybe an hour at most. But when they showed us the clocks, it was just past four in the morning.

Captain Fernando unmoored us hastily, explaining that they'd kept hearing people talking or yelling, but when they followed the sounds found only empty cabins and passageways. Not just empty, but they had the feeling of being uninhabited for a long time.

We explained how we'd only visited the bridge and the galley, and couldn't possibly have been aboard for such a long time. According to the captain, they had gotten back aboard the Makarov just after midnight, where they were informed that I had gone after them. None of our times matched up, not even with the people who had remained behind on the Makarov.

Another loud boom shot through the cargo ship, and the captain ordered us to get as far away as possible. More explosions were heard, although we couldn't see anything.

""There must be illegal chemicals in the hold,"" Mr Kumara said. ""It's going to sink!"" Indeed, it was already listing to the side.

We hurried as far away as we could, as the glow of dawn appeared. The change from darkness to sunrise is quick in these waters, and I could already see the shape of the ship as we left it. Black smoke started coming out of the bow, billowing between the two cranes. Sam started taking pictures with his mobile phone, and someone else was filming.

Another loud boom, and this time we could see a bit of flame. We headed north, away from the direction of the smoke plume, and we watched in amazement as the entire ship vanished under the water within just a few minutes. Something so large sinking so fast looks impossible when you see it. I was immensely relieved we had gotten off when we did.

It seemed the moment the last swirling currents had settled and the smoke in the sky had dispersed, our radio came squawking to life, suddenly non-stop words spilling out, and Udeesha pointed out not one but three ships approaching us. 

It was as if we had left civilisation and now we were suddenly back. Nobody in the other ships had seen even the smoke of the sinking ship, and nothing could be found to match in records to match our descriptions. Someone had indeed heard our first pan-pan, but when ships reached our position, they'd found nothing at all.

We'd drifted south to the South Equatorial Current and from there towards the Seychelles, meaning our research had ended prematurely and we needed to restock in Victoria and make our way back to SL. Captain Fernando made a whole report, although it seemed everyone we talked to thought we'd had some sort of group hallucination. The video and pictures taken proved it wasn't, but nothing on any records matched up with the ship type or flagged country.

Mr Kumara called it a ""ghost ship"", not meaning it was an unmanned ship floating loose in the seas, but more literally. We never found an explanation for the voices, the prepared meals, or the time differences.

Now when I'm out on the seas, I'm no longer completely comfortable. Sometimes I catch myself scanning the horizons for a rusted cargo ship with two white cranes."

Husband is making my life hell unless I divorce him. I can’t just leave because the car brakes  went out and he makes a lot more money than I do. It would be easier just to not exist and before anyone says people will miss me. I have no friends or family to help. I do have classmates who may help but I don’t want to bring drama in their lives. My mom is unable to help due to mental illness and financial instability. My mom only wants me around if I can take her out to eat and do things for her. Because of her mental illness, she is the meanest person to be around.

I never felt so alone. I thought marriage would change him. He threatens he will find my parents and harm them. I don’t know what to do. I’m in my early twenties and live in SWFL if that helps. Does anyone know any resources that could help? If not then, it’s better if I’m just gone. I don’t have anyone to talk to or trust which is why I am writing on here. 

I really don’t want to die because I will get promoted within three months and I know I will one day be able to afford to take care of myself... Im taking five classes so I can only work part-time. I have been dreaming of leaving him once I go away for my internship but I don’t want to wait 8 more months of living like this.I’ve been suicidal my whole life but I do value my life.

I made the mistake of not breaking things off after he cheated or hit me. I regret this whole marriage... I do have money on my Lyft gift card so I can Lyft somewhere safe and a suitcase to pack. If I do anything, I don’t want it to be in the home where it would remind him everyday."

I'm a sophmore at a british international high school in Spain. My dream would be to get into an Ivy (business school) . I am currently and have been top of my class for many years, I achieve good grades (mostly A , A\*), however I am aware that grades aren't everything and so I want to expand my EC activities further.

I currently do average and normal activities: tennis, debate club... I don't have many interesting or outstanding EC. In the next 2 years before I graduate I would like to engage in the next activities: internship, volunteering at non profit NGO, building a (simple) app, start enviromental club with friends, start a non-profit, do MUN and win prizes and awards outside of my school achievements.

I don't know where to start, I've asked around some shelters where I could volunteer and help out but I don't know how to organize myself and maybe start a robbotics club, tutor math, physics, languages (I'm fluent in english, spanish and partly german) and also have time to study as it is important that I stay top of my class.

Of course I don't only want to do all this to boost up my college application, I truly enjoy and I would like to use my potential to help myself and others. If anyone could help me please DM me.

I have been highly considering applying for the Microsoft explore program, but I’m still working on my resume. I’m curious if anyone knows how they’re doing internships summer 2021, cause I heard 2020 went completely online. 

Also, anyone have any tips for a first time resume writer? I’ve talked to a few people and know that it’s better to have my previous projects on (like building computers and programming on Roblox and such) than to have my work at Dairy Queen but the more opinions the merrier.

Any other first year internship appliers for tech?"

The only regular SWE problem I did was create an endpoint on an api to convert something to something else (can’t go into details) but that was all in python and it was a nice experience.

Problem is I’ll be looking for a new job in February and I really don’t want to interview for big data roles but my resume will be full of big data experience for a whole year, so I feel like recruiters will automatically think I won’t be a good SWE and then if I interview for big data roles and they ask me spark questions, the interview will end right then and there because I SUCKKKK at spark.

How do I market myself as a SWE when applying for new jobs? Any ideas? (Btw I’ve had two internships that were purely SWE with a tiny bit of ML)"

&amp;#x200B;

If you have advice, please let me know. I'm losing my mind here. 

  

Dear Asshole,

I came to this school in the spring of 2018 as a lowly intern. I was 25, bright-eyed and bushy tailed and ready to begin my teaching career. 

That year, you mostly stayed in your room and the interactions I had with you were always brief, but fine. Perhaps a little cold, but fine. 

I came back to this school to truly begin my teaching career in the fall of 2018. I did not have a classroom, as space was limited, and I had to teach in your room. 

Now, maybe I should really just “let it go”, or do as all the others tell me, and “not take it personally”, or, especially, stop expecting my own level of care and consideration from other people. 

I say this because if I were a veteran teacher like yourself, I would have done everything in my reasonable power to help you feel safe, supported, and ready to begin your career. You made me feel insignificant, small, and like dog poop on the bottom of your shoe. I know you likely don’t even give half a flying fuck about that, but hey, man. You hurt my fucking feelings. 

You also violated privacy laws by turning on your projector while I was using the front computer-aware that I was addressing student grades on it in an attempt to get me off your computer. 

The next week, you asked me if I was over not having my own room yet. I responded that yeah, sure, but this is what it is and I can’t change anything so here we are. To this, you responded “well, I am.”. 

I still Had to teach my class in there that day, knowing how unwanted we were and how much scrutiny you were watching me with so you could trash talk me to our colleagues later. How do I know you did that? Because I received unsolicited classroom advice from another teacher in the hallway-about an incident that I had handled -albeit not the best way-but it is my first rodeo and I need to learn how to wrangle. I had already reflected on this situation and decided how to better handle it. Besides, I talked to my on site mentor about it as well-since she is the queen of classroom management. She told me how to handle it in the future and to ask if I ever need any help. This, I believe, is how you should have handled this situation. Since you believe you get to tell me how to behave, then, I too, will tell you this-next time, keep your god damn mouth shut or talk to ME about things. Stop going to everyone else about issues you seemingly have with me. 

I switched rooms after the projector incident. The new teacher was supportive and kind. 

I returned to this school in the fall of 2019 for my second year. I had a classroom this year, so I didn’t have to talk to you as often-except for at team meetings. I ignored your hateful, racist, misogynistic comments and tried to keep my head down. Covid hit so I wouldn’t have to deal with you for the rest of the year.

We all returned in fall of 2020- the most chaotic, stressful year we all are having. You are on my academic team again, to my dismay.

Given the nature of the school year, we all are simply trying to get by. One of my goals this year is to keep my head down and just survive. It’s hard enough surviving in normal times, let alone Covid times. Given the nature of this year, you would think that we all would be nothing but kind, supportive, and helpful. 

One October morning, I awoke an hour early. Being an October morning that was cooler than the others, but knowing the building would be hot as hell, I wore a skirt, a tank top, a long cardigan, and some witchy boots. Threw on a short necklace, earrings, and a ring, and I was on my way. 

Every colleague I greeted said I looked amazing today. Every single person. YOU saw me first thing. I was not wearing my cardigan-as I said it’s hot. There were no kids present. It was 6:30 in the morning, for goodness sakes. I always wear my cardigan when there are kids present. However, if it is hot enough, I simply tell the kids that I’m a human being with a body and so a little arm and some leg (school dress code length, mind you) wont hurt them. They seem to agree with this stance, and I have never had an issue with my clothing or appearance. If kids can get it, why can’t you? What do my clothes have to do with my professionalism?

Back to the interaction. Because this next part makes me squirm with uncomfortable rage. When you saw me, you looked me up and down-and I noticed that your eyes lingered on my breasts. You said good morning. I was busy, so I simply said good morning and kept on walking. You told me to have a good day, and I said “you too”. This must have been the point that you walked to a male colleague in our hallway to tell him that “he needed to talk to me about my outfit” because it is “inappropriate”. 

My other male colleague did not “talk to me” about it in the way you’d hoped. He simply told me what you said-I’m sure as a way to tell me not to rock the boat and be more careful because that is the nature of the beast in education. I decided a while ago I am done with that stance. I rock the boat because not only do we deserve better as teachers, but our students deserve better- they deserve a REAL education. Not this conservative, happy bubble of a rainbow that shields them from the outside world. They deserve to see how real people dress, speak, and think. Not just this filtered perspective we are forced to show. 

That being said, perhaps it angered me more because of the sexist root of this issue- you felt more comfortable talking to a man than to me. This, to me, insinuates that you see me as a child that needs to be “kept in line”, and not as an adult that is your EQUAL. Yes, we are equals in this playing field. You may have a master’s degree, but you that doesn’t mean you get to tell me what to do. You are simply another classroom teacher, as far as I am concerned. Another concern I have with this interaction is that it seems like you felt attracted to me (hence the lingering stare and stumbling over your words when you said to have a good day), and because I didn’t stop to talk to you -or really even stop- you got offended. How dare this woman not acknowledge me? Does she not know I am the alpha (as stated from many,many students that you said to the on day 1 in an attempt to intimidate them)? How dare this woman feel confident in her own skin when she’s fat (remember all the fat shaming comments you threw out about our students??)? 

Let me tell you something. I am not afraid of you. I know you get off on people being afraid of you-much like the immature protagonist of a powerful novel I teach to my students. Perhaps you, too, should read it. 

I am angry. I am on fire-and this fire cannot be quenched. 

Be afraid. It's your turn.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: male colleague spoke to another male colleague about my outfit instead of talking to me and its the straw that broke the camel's back with this person. IF you have advice, let me know.

ETA- admin emailed me for a meeting next week. They said they are talking to staff and investigating due to concerns on “both sides”, so who even knows where this will go. I am scared and angry that I even said anything. Pray for me."

* Have a GPA of 3.75/4.0 (88.5%) [ My university is unheard of , it is in a Gulf country. However,  it is affiliated with Coventry University in UK and the degree I have obtained if from Coventry. I feel this would lower my chances though ]

*Published 4 research papers ( one in IEEE and others in lesser known but still peer reviewed journals)

* Have worked as a research assistant for 1 year.

*Worked on 1 project which is pretty significant. ( Sponsered by the Government , developed a prototype,  somewhat like a smart band for Covid)

*Writing GRE in a month ( Hopefully will get around 165 in Quant and 160 in verbal ).

What else can I do to boost my chances ? Also , There are  literally  zero opportunities for jobs or internships in the field of electronics in my country , should I mention this in my SOP ?  Would really appreciate feedback and advice from people with experience on applications.

Depending on benchmarks, I will be upgrading the CPU to Zen 3 at a later date (probably next year).

At the moment, I use a [BenQ XR3501 35.0"" 2560x1080 144 Hz Monitor](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/2Wbkcf/benq-monitor-xr3501). I will be upgrading to a 1440p 144 ultra-wide later on.

I primarily game though this is also the PC I work on. Let's just say it's for gaming — 144+ fps in ""esports"" FPS titles (Apex, Overwatch), and hopefully a smooth experience in single-player games (e.g. Cyberpunk) on ultrawide. GPU is overkill for this at 2560x1080 but that's where the future upgrade comes.

I have the following notes about the parts chosen:

Case notes:
&gt;6x 120m fans: 3x side intake, 3x bottom intake. AIO for CPU; 360mm rad mounted topside, outtake.

RAM notes:
&gt;Per Reddit, this is THE best value for Ryzen setup, especially at $160. The memory is Hynix C-die, overclocked timings @ 16-18-18-18-32 on a 3800X/X570 is perfect so same on Zen 3 should be easy. Ryzen 3000 performs really well with 3600MHz DUAL-RANK memory and I expect the same from Ryzen 5000.

&gt;Later note: Zen 3 won't have the same ram set spot as Zen 2 of 3200 - 3600 so this isn't so clear now.

Fan notes:
&gt;These can, in theory, be daisy-chained, but I bought splitters just in case of potential under-voltage situation.

GPU and PSU notes:
&gt;As the 3080 requires connecting the dual 8 pin with separate cables (not a single daisy chained one), I went with a full modular PSU to ensure I would have enough connectors and room to use them.
&gt;Also who doesn't want a full modular PSU?

Mobo notes:
&gt;Went with b550 because I don't think I'll be taking advantage of PCIe 4 any time soon.

SSD notes
&gt;While not taking advantage of PCIe 4 with this NVME, I'm waiting on prices to drop for PCIe4 NVME drives and this will be plenty sufficient in the intern."

It was difficult to even go for a walk in my neighborhood without being overwhelmed by panic, let alone start college, find a job, or make friends like I wanted to. Over the past several years, though, I've made a ton of progress; I'm in my senior year of college, I've worked as a physics tutor and a camp counselor, and I've made a handful of friends who I'm at least somewhat close with.

But even though I don't struggle with the acute feelings of panic I used to get, I still find myself stuck in a lot of the same fearful behaviors. I almost never initiate reaching out to my friends, because I'm scared that they secretly hate me. When I lived with roommates last year, who were all great people, I would sometimes go days without cooking food for myself because I worried about having to talk with them in the kitchen. I'll avoid responding to important emails for weeks or months (like to my therapist, who I still need to schedule an appointment with) because sending even a paragraph of text feels too vulnerable. It even ruined an amazing internship I had in the summer of 2019, because I became convinced that my research advisors and everyone in my program thought I was scum, and I eventually broke down and stopped showing up to work for a week or two.

The thing is, actually following through on these actions, like reaching out to friends, sending emails, or showing up to work, doesn't cause significant anxiety for me anymore. Once I push past the initial trepidation, it's usually fine, and often even enjoyable. But it's like my brain hasn't caught up with the fact that these things don't cause panic attacks anymore. Sometimes I feel encouraged by the progress I've made, but often it's just disheartening that I'm still stuck in many of these same patterns.

I am a freshman right now, majoring in CS. I don't think it is that common to have an internship after Freshman year, but I want to look ahead and find out more (or more so i'm afraid of falling behind), and was looking for some advice.

First off, how common is it to find an internship for the summer after Freshman year?

I was also wondering what people have found the best route to be. Is Careers4Terps the best place to start looking for opportunities? Or should I approach it another way such as looking at specific companies?

Also, what resources have people found to be especially useful at UMD for finding good internship/co-op opportunities. Is there anything you have had specifically good or bad experiences with?

Any general advice or tips from experience about this really appreciated. Thank you!"

I’m cautiously optimistic that I might be able to fulfill my graduation requirements a semester or two early provided I stay on track (I’ve heard this is p common), so I have a little room to explore some options: 

- graduating early would be nice because I would save tuition. Not a complete financial necessity though, and I feel like I would miss out on getting to explore courses outside of my major just for fun and also graduating with friends. And I’m not sure if I’ll have enough internship experience to be competitive for software engineering jobs. 
- study abroad would be really cool— maybe a little expensive, but when will I ever get this kind of opportunity again? But I’m not really sure if I’ll be able to fulfill a language requirement, so my options are limited to English speaking programs like Oxford and Cambridge, which require a gpa&gt;3.7/3.8 and are full year programs. 
- an M.Eng might be a good way to get to take some higher level CS courses. Like the study abroad, this requires a higher gpa and competitive admissions, so not guaranteed. Not to sure on this one tbh bc I’m not sure what the benefits would be career wise 
- or maybe I could co-op? Some industry experience is always nice, and I would get paid. I’m not really sure how common or competitive it is. I’m worried this one might be a little isolating since I probably wouldn’t be able to make friends as easily as a regular summer internship program. 

If any upperclassmen have any experience with any of these options, I would really appreciate it if you could share your experience and maybe answer a few questions!"

Anyway, I've decided to apply to master's programs in statistics/data science this fall. I'm looking for more feedback on my current school list, as I'm not quite sure how to gauge my chances at some of the schools. Here's my profile:

**Undergrad Institution:** UC Berkeley

**Major:** Statistics   
**GPA:** 3.74

**Type of Student:** Domestic White Male  


**GRE General Test:** Q: 166 (87th percentile), V: 166 (97th), W: 5.0 (92nd) 

**Programs Applying:** Master's Statistics (maybe some data science programs as well) 

**Research Experience:** I had a negative research experience with a professor, and I ended up not passing the ""research apprenticeship."" Should I address this in my apps? 

**Work Experience**: I was a data analyst intern for a baseball team after my sophomore year (used lots of R and SQL). In summer 2019 I was a business analyst for a pro soccer team (mostly used Excel). Was hired to be a data analyst for a pro baseball team this year, but that got canceled due to COVID, hence why I'm applying now. I've been at home for the past few months and have been working on my own personal projects that I've posted on GitHub and a personal website.  


**Awards/Honors/Recognitions:** I was a TA for Berkeley's Intro to Data Science course, which involved me teaching weekly lab and discussion sections of 25 students and participating in weekly meetings about content and logistics. I taught topics like python, SQL, pandas, linear regression, and PCA. I did this my last semester. 

**Letters of Recommendation:** Should get a strong letter from my Game Theory professor and from one of the professors I TAed for, which will be weaker but still decent. The third letter will probably be the weakest, as I'm asking someone from the pro baseball team that hired me this year (but I never worked for) to speak on my performance in coding challenges/interviews for them. We formed a good relationship at least. 

**Math/Statistics Grades (freshman-senior year in order)** Intro to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (B), Multivariable Calc (A), Calc-Based Probability (B+), Computing with Data (basically an R class) (A+), Discrete Mathematics (intro to proof-writing as well) (A), Theoretical Linear Algebra I took one summer at UCLA (A), Intro to Real Analysis (B), Calc-Based Mathematical Statistics (B),  Fundamentals of Data Science (the class I TA'ed for) (A-), Intro to Time Series (A), Linear Models - Theory and Applications (A), Game Theory (A), Intro to Machine Learning (very theoretical) (A). 

Regarding my grades, I definitely didn't do as well as I would've liked in some of the fundamental stats courses (probability, mathematical statistics). But, my senior year I got all As in my stats courses which I hope this shines through. There may be some weak spots in my math grades too, like my Linear Algebra and Diff EQs class, but that was my first semester and I like to think my A in the summer Linear Algebra class makes up for it. Real Analysis was really tough and showed I don't want to do a PhD.  


**Schools:** Below is my current list of 13 schools, which is already a lot. If you have any recommendations based on my profile, I'm all ears. Basically, I need to know if it's not worth applying to some, if I have enough safeties, and if I should consider swapping out some for other programs. I'm also interested in applying to a couple schools in Europe... please let me know if you know anything about this in general

1. ETH Zurich - MSc Statistics
2. Stanford, MS Statistics
3. UChicago, MS Statistics
4. Berkeley, MA Statistics
5. Harvard, MS Data Science
6. Washington, MS Statistics  - Advanced Methods and Data Analysis
7. MIT, MS Operations Research
8. UNC Chapel Hill, MS Data Science and Analytics
9. UCLA, MS Statistics
10. Yale, MS Statistics and Data Science
11. Duke, MS Statistical Science
12. Rice, Master's Statistic
13. Oxford, MSc Statistical Science

So I have a few questions if you guys can help out:

I wouldn't mind doing frontend/backend but I feel like frontend would probably be easier to get a job in(even though I believe it's more saturated?). But I feel like I need to choose one and stick to one. I have the next 2 years to get myself job ready(as I quit my job to focus on coding). I'm pretty sure you definitely make more money doing backend but I also feel like it would be harder to learn by myself. Which do you guys think I should take? And any advice on how to get internship ready? I feel super behind on that aspect because my school didn't help me at all. I'm going to university for my third year so I'll check out what options they have through like a coop program or something. Any advice would be appreciated guys, thanks a lot! Oh and if you have any really good courses I could take for either side, feel free to share them.

But rational part of me tells me I should get a job that will potentially allow me to have a clear career path and able to provide my family (and my loan). In this case I personally prefer startup to medium size company while my parents strongly advise me to get a job in a more established company in the industry. 

What do you think I should do? Give it a try or gain experiences from actual job first so I get to know how the reality is like as a fresh grad. If the later, do you think established companies are better for fresh graduate with little experience as they might provide more guidance"

\&gt; This program was created by HCL to give back to the tech industry and attract more coders that are just starting their careers.  The intended flow of the program is this: You apply for the program (*YEA! You did that part already!*), you take a pre-join Mettl assessment (*this is the next step, details below*), based on your application and scores from the pre-join assessment a determination of eligibility is made.  If you are eligible we will enroll you into our ***no-cost-to-you*** training course with other coders like you and our seasoned HCL Coaches.   If you pass the course you are ***guaranteed*** an interview with a hiring manager!  If you passed the course, and had a successful interview, recruiting will grant you ***first-in-line priority*** for an open position here in HCL!  Where you will continue with on the job training and begin to support clients.

For some reason I am skeptical about this. Something kind of whispers ""scam"" in my ear and I'm not too sure why. I guess the main things I have to ask is:

1. Would this unpaid training program look good on a resume when I go into the job search? It's a training course based on .NET
2. I'm still waiting on a response from a few other companies for internships, which I would take over this program. The problem is I graduate in the Spring and won't be able to do a summer internship. Would it be wise to participate in this program in since it is offered in the Spring?

Any insight at all?"
jc2ypj,0,2020-10-16,How am I supposed to apply for jobs my senior year when all of my core classes are during my senior year?,minibogstar,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jc2ypj/how_am_i_supposed_to_apply_for_jobs_my_senior/,"From what I've heard, most senior apply for jobs around this time (similar to internships) for the upcoming summer when they graduate, am I correct? But all of my core classes that focus on my specific career (AI/ML) are during my senior year. I have 8 classes that are based around that. Yes, I would have taken 2 software (Java) courses, 2 algorithms courses, and 2 systems (C/Assembly) courses and plenty of math/stats, but I just feel like I wouldn't even be close to prepared for an interview in that field. I am also aware that just a BS in that field wouldn't get you much, but I am literally at the bottom of the food chain without those 8 classes.

Am I worrying too much? I am also having a hard time getting internships (couldn't get past 1st round for 4 of them so far and applied to 6) because I applied to big companies who will actually give me experience, not data entry work. Leetcode is also not helping very much because programming isn't what I'm bad at; I have a hard time presenting the concepts that I've done and making myself unique to other programmers.

Should I just wing for an internship when I graduate for a year and maybe be a TA/grader for my uni, then apply to grad school (if I can even get in), and then take off from there? I am losing a lot of confidence on this subreddit as well as others."

jc3pz2,1,2020-10-16,What to do with a Software Engineering degree when I hated programming...,goldenflames15,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jc3pz2/what_to_do_with_a_software_engineering_degree/,"(TLDR: I have a completed Software Engineering degree/math minor but I never really learned how to code much beyond a ""Hello World"" successfully, what can I do with it?) 

Hey. 23/F here (wow a real girl I know it's a shock!). Not sure if this could be helpful but here I am. To put it bluntly...I need advice. I have no idea what to do with my life. I graduated last December with a bachelor's in Software Engineering (and a Math minor if that matters), but unlike some (smarter) people who did co-ops and internships in school, I did all of my professional experience doing research classes with professors, so just more school and nothing to actually help me understand work environments. Since December, since I don't have my driver's license and don't have access to good public transportation, I kind of just avoided getting a job and moving out of my mom's place for a while when I got back from college. My goal was obviously not to stay in this sort of limbo for this long except that then covid happened and everything except staying home and alive kind of got put on the backburner. 

The problem is that now it's been almost a year since I graduated, but honestly that's not even the biggest issue. I knew when I was in school especially towards the end of my degree that I ran into far more topics I never wanted to see again than anything I could imagine turning into a job. I definitely know I never learned any programming languages well enough to try and get a job using any. I was okay at interpreting code but completely terrible when I had to write code and summon it from my own brain. I try to look at job listings using my degree and I don't meet any of the qualifications. 

I obviously don't want to let my education (lacking as it was) that put me in 6 figure debt go to waste but I'm completely at a loss. Has anyone related to this or was everyone in IT just a genius who actually was good at coding and knew what they were doing and didn't just bs their way through college? If I could go back I can think of 100 careers I'd rather choose, but by the time I realized that I was already too far in debt to change so I just went to the end, to my own dismay. Not being able to make any of my programs run literally ever after my high school comp sci class should've been a clue but...Hindsight is 20/20. I loved coding when it was taught well...teaching myself in college never really caught on. 

I love reading, had great experiences (and way better grades) in my literature classes than any of my tech classes. I worked in my school library and wanted to be a librarian techie and fix their sh\*tty systems, and I guess that could still be fun. I love video games and wanted to work with them and still would but maybe not in the same capacity I thought. I love makeup and would love to do something in that industry but I don't have a clue how you get into any industry. 

Anyway, my mom is rightfully on my \*ss about getting a job but I don't want to get some random job in fast food (like she wants me to) that discredits the 4 and a half years I worked my butt off trying to get a degree that was literal hell for me. I'm proud I managed to finish it and I simultaneously want to use it and forget about all of it all at once. Sigh. If anything thank you for reading this far, because I know it's a mess."

I am currently a Computer Science and Engineering junior, and I want to apply to a couple of internships. I have no prior work experience, though. Neither do I have any volunteering experience (none that you can put in a resume anyways). But I've done projects! And I am currently working on a few interesting projects. 

So here are a few of my concerns:

\- A lot of my projects are works in progress. Do I even include these projects in my resume, then? I don't know if it's alright to include them since they're still work in progress. 

\- These projects were/are done under my college coursework. They haven't been published or anything. And for some reason I feel like they aren't that great. I feel like the titles are impressive but the actual work I've put into the projects, I feel like they're a bit lacking. I feel so conflicted. Should I still put them?

\- I haven't uploaded the project source codes, etc. on any website (like GitHub) nor do I have a portfolio website or anything. I didn't do all of this because, yeah, I feel like they're lacking. I fear my code, etc. is like, average or something. I don't know! Is it still ok to put them in my resume?

\- This a more of a general question: Can I club my projects, course certifications and courses under one section? I have just one extra course and one course certification that I can talk about, and I feel like it'll look scanty if I put just one under each header. 

Please feel free to add more suggestions! Thanks in advance for your time and help!"

Do interns in Germany ever get payed even if very little?
It is a curricular internship so I am not required to get payed to do it, but truth be told it would help out a lot, as ERASMUS doesn't really pay enough for expenses. Also, as it would be full time I wouldn't have time for a part time job.

I'm from Portugal btw.

I am currently an Undergrad CS student and I am contemplating how I should plan to spend my summer for the year of 2021. Due to schedule limitations, COVID and a few other factors; an internship is unlikely (at least not a formal one). So I am contemplating what would be the next best use of my time.

A few ideas I am considering:

1) Looking for the option to perform undergrad research for my university

2) Minimizing my schedule completely so I can spend the time using independent learning resources (like Udemy and [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com)) to really hone in an perfect my coding/algorithm/data science/ and fundamental IT skills. This time could also be used to really flush out a portfolio for the eventual job hunt.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any alternate opinions or suggestions? How can I use the free time in a way that, in supplement with my CS degree, will land me the best job outside of college?"
jc7eh7,2,2020-10-16,The past few weeks have been hell,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jc7eh7/the_past_few_weeks_have_been_hell/,"Hi all, a little intro. I'm a young man and was just recently officially diagnosed with ADHD, but I'd figured I had it for awhile. I always thought things would get better when I switched to highschool, college, college again, and now work/internships... but it hasn't. I cancel all of my plans because I never get anything done (and that's hell for me as an extrovert). In school and now work I would sit at my desk  for hours trying to accomplish my tasks, but making little or no progress, as all of my energy was spent trying to just stay focused, sitting down, and keeping out the irrelevant or negative thoughts.... well, I'm sure you all must know these feelings as well.  


I've been working a new internship after managing to graduate with a second degree (again, just getting by as always with all nighters before the exams) and like usual it started out great with good focus and being prompt with my tasks until.... everything went to hell like always. Now I'm drowning in tasks that are not too hard, but I have been unable to do until I start not checking my phone or email or slack because i'm so scared to see what my managers say. I'm already behind, the adhd, and the stress of everything is just pulling me under the water. Finally sent a message to my dr. again yesterday but I feel like he and everyone else must hate or think so little of me.(something I imagine you all have felt too.) Sometimes the tips and even the medication I tried feel like they don't do anything at all, or they work for a bit and stop, or I just can't keep them up... how pathetic am I?  


 In real life I present myself well, I talk well and know what to say (and really do mean and believe what i say, or intend to do what i say) and so I've been able to get good positions like this internship, but then I screw it up because of this damned ADHD.  


Anyway sorry if its the wrong place to post and sorry for taking your time, but I just needed to get it out. If you have any advice or tips or words of encouragement, they would sure be appreciated. I know the best thing to do is rip off the bandaid and deal with the angry messages.  


Anyway, I'm going to hopefully work and not just stare and my tasks for hours and hours again."

 Hi guys, here are 17 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning internships. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
jc97nu,1,2020-10-16,File format detector/corrector module/package,kking1122,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jc97nu/file_format_detectorcorrector_modulepackage/,"Hi all!

I am an intermediate level python programmer (\~2 years in, 1 year working full time), and I recently started a new job as a Data Analyst for a large logistics company. Even though my title is Data Analyst, Most of what I've been doing has been automation, which the company desperately needs. Anyway, I've wrote some scripts to automate the formatting and analysis of various files, mostly csv and xlsx. So far everything is good and people seem to really appreciate my work. However, at my last job, which was an internship at a small financial company, I made a lot of similar scripts that often had problems because the input files changed in some way. Sometimes it could be that the columns were order differently, or a column name was spelled differently, or the data in the columns was in a different format, etc. I was wondering if there are any libraries/packages/modules that deal with this specific problem and point the problems out, and perhaps even correct them. I have done some light googling but I don't really know what to google and thus my searches produced basically nothing (Data Validation for python gave the best results, but still nothing that matches exactly what I need.). I asked a Data Scientist on my team (the position above mine on the Data team), and he said he didn't know of any.

I'm sure there is something out there that does this sort of thing, but I was also thinking of writing my own module. In that case, I would like to write a module that is general enough to use for a variety of scripts/files, although I would probably focus on xlsx/csv files at first. I was thinking I could improve on it over the course of my career, and perhaps add in some machine learning/AI later since I am in the beginning stages of learning those techniques now.

If anyone has any libraries/packages/modules that deal with this sort of issue, I would really appreciate it if you could link it in the comments. Likewise, I would also really appreciate some input on how I could go about designing a module for this myself.

Thank you!"

In the technical round, my lack of projects were pointed out. In the HR round, I couldn't give satisfactory answers to his questions (usual ones like where do you see yourself in 5 years, etc.).  My questions are:

* What projects can I do and put on my resume to stand out to companies ?
* What kind of answers are the HR guys expecting to those kind of questions ?
* How much should be one practice on leetcode, Hackerrank to make sure that the coding/algorithms section in the test can be cleared easily?"

I am majoring in Statistics. My university doesn't have an open credit system(i.e. students can't choose what courses they want to take. Weird, I know.) I don't have any chance of changing my major now. But I've been doing some Coursera CS courses besides my school-work to supplement my lack of CS courses.

Now I would like to do a Software engineering internship in the US(In late 2021 or 2022) because in my country there are no internship opportunities for students( you need to graduate to get an internship). How should I approach that? Is it possible?

I am pretty proficient in python. What kind of projects I should do to add to my resume? I don't have any experience other than founding a programming club in my high school and teaching programming to other students for free. I'd like to have your two cents on this matter."

jcarjj,2,2020-10-16,No idea where to go next,tech_fu,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/jcarjj/no_idea_where_to_go_next/,"I've been working in IT full time for 12 of the last 16 years (and part time during college) and I've worked for a wide variety of organizations, from the U.S. Military and then the government to a small business, then a medium sized business, now I'm sort of stuck as a Senior Administrator at an MSP.  I kind of hate my current job because I feel like all of my work ends up in one of 2 categories.  1) client needs system refresh/hardware upgrade, I do the work to spec and then won't do any further work for them for the foreseeable future.  Lower level techs handle monthly maintenance so I rarely see those systems again because I did the work right the first time.  2) I feel like I'm constantly arguing with clients to be allowed to fix their dumpster fires.  These are the more common interactions and mostly boil down to politely arguing with morons, many of whom make bloated manager salaries despite being barely functioning idiots. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking for jobs but of course it's still not a great job market in the U.S. and most of what I'm seeing in my area would constitute both a pay hit and be doing lower level work.  Alternatively I've been looking at developer job postings but I'm not quite a good enough coder (nor do I have a Comp Sci degree) so I don't feel comfortable applying to the senior level development positions but it seems like the only job postings I'm seeing are either senior level or for barely paid internships.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just looking for advice. Do I plan on moving to an area with a better IT job market?  Should I focus on getting my coding skills to a higher level?  Do I just bang my head on my desk until I lose enough brain cells to be content where I'm at?   I feel like at this point in my career I should be moving on to doing bigger and better things, either working on bigger/harder networking or server problems/implementations or making the dreaded leap in to management. Instead I just feel very stuck. Any advice would be welcome. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,"
jcat7h,1224,2020-10-16,I remember when a big company had an event at my school,AlmostConsciousNPC,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jcat7h/i_remember_when_a_big_company_had_an_event_at_my/,"This event happened 1 BC (Before Covid) and a throuple Google employees came to my school to talk about their experiences at Google, like they do at company events.

It’s honestly weird reflecting on this sort of stuff a year later, after I’ve graduated. All I can think now is how weird it is that undergrads put employees on a pedestal because they work for a top company. Like during this event students were taking notes, holding onto every word while one of the employees talked about making tie die shirts. 

Anyways, after ending their talk by describing their workplace as “playful” because their desk is within range of a ping pong table that is almost never used, I ask the one question I cared about:

“How did you guys get an opportunity to interview at Google?”

The question obviously tipped them off their balance. The room fell to light hum of a fan. The once proud employees started looking at the floor and one another with unease. It was a long couple seconds of silence.

Mind you, most people at most companies won’t even be able to answer that question, because that decision is up to the hiring manager, but all three of them knew.

To make a short story shorter, two of them said something like “One of my family members works at Google and...”

The last one said that they networked with a recruiter while they were a junior in high school. That relationship formed into an opportunity to intern at Google before they graduated high school. Then through more networking at the internship they were able to secure four more internships throughout university, and even then they could not secure a job upon graduation. They worked for a different company for six months while still courting their Google network until they got an interview.

After all the questioning the google employees ended the meeting by giving us the email of a recruiter. “Good Luck!”"
jcaxht,78,2020-10-16,I'm a December 2019 graduate who has started to realize that I dropped the ball HARD when it comes to my career. I could really use some guidance please.,nmd809,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jcaxht/im_a_december_2019_graduate_who_has_started_to/,"I graduated a semester early in computer science from Maryland. I wasn't the best student (I have ADD) but I got decent grades (3.11 GPA) and I felt like I was always a strong programmer compared to my peers when it came to the kind of programming we did in class. I really put very little effort into career development when in school, and never ended up landing an internship. And after graduating, I was burnt out and returned to my job in a restaurant to take it easy for a couple months before grinding on the job search. Then covid hit which gave me an excuse to put off the job search even longer.

I've known in the back of my mind this whole time I was dropping the ball but now I'm realizing I really screwed up. I'm rusty on my coding, and even more rusty on terminology. The only projects I have to put on my resume are from class and they aren't all that impressive. The only languages I know are the ones I used in class. I feel proficient in Java and Python, and then have 1-2 semesters each experience in C, SQL, R, Ruby, OCaml, Kotlin, and Rust. As far as I know, Java, Python, C, and SQL are the only languages there that are really industry used. I started an online course on HTML and CSS a couple months ago but haven't finished it yet.

Now it has been 10 months since graduation and I have almost nothing to show for it. I just don't know where to start. Is there a good crash course for refreshing my skills and terminology? Should I quit my job so I can grind full time? I'm living with my parents so I don't need the money that badly. I'm just worried it'll look even worse if companies see that I don't have any job at the moment whatsoever. Do I need to work on learning languages that are more widely used in the industry? Or should I just send out as many applications as I can with the experience I have now and hope something sticks? I just feel really overwhelmed and lost and I don't know where to start. Any advice would be a huge help and I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and respond.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I neglected my career development too long and really need guidance on how to recover."
jcb8m9,186,2020-10-16,TAKE A STOP AND SEE THE WORLD BEFORE YOU,KeyMaintenance3,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/jcb8m9/take_a_stop_and_see_the_world_before_you/,"So i dont know why but i feel like i have to share this experience of mine idk its just interesting to keep to kysepf i believe.

So basically i am a mech engg from a tier 2 cllg.
I had an excellent score in 10th(lol like it even matters) so i decided to try for the iits(like every one else).

I gave my entrance exam and voila 0% scholarship, after having gone through 2 months of summer intro classes i did well on my batch tests and got into the top batch(apparently called star batch, lol ikr) and 
every1 here except me had got a max 70% scholarship in fees and had done their foundation courses, this really hurt my confidence but at the same time as compared to before it gave me sense of pride that i am kinda smart(the feeling of an underdog uk)

Fast fwd 1.5 yrs 
5hrs of avg sleep each day+ tons of test+tons of pb solving, dark eyes, thin build i looked like a skeleton but none the less Top 5 rank in every test(dw this is the peak the ride falls down now)

Untill one day my grandfather died not really close i didnt feel worse or anything but just curious as to what do i want to remember when i die and  couldn't really answer the quest, this led to further quest why am i even doing this, why am i taking this much efforts for iit when am not sure what i want and Boom the bubble burst.

I stopped everything yeah literally 6 months remaining for the exam when my profs were telling every1 to change to last gear i just stopped and said fuck this all.

My family had seen me study so much that they actually didnt even question me as to why i was not studying, i stopped telling my results to any1 my teachers called my mom and advised me but heck i didn't budge why would i there was no reason at all for me to study.

The funny thing was the only time i picked up a bk after that was when i was on my way to the exam centre in a car on the backseat, just a last min attempt to see whether i can pull off a miracle(i mean didnt really matter but getting into iit wont be bad i thought)it was so funny seeing myself literally fucking it up and i knew it all the same but didnt even bat an eye once.

The results came out i couldn't even crack the cutoff for advance and had to give cet(funny because none of my batch mates even bother to give it)i got 113 in cetfunny because i didnt have even a  single bk of hsc) my entire batch was shocked from my performance, teachers and parents all the same.(my entire batch except me went to tier 1 cllgs so ig i cant blame for the shock, i did make some good frnds who all study in iit though, a +pt ig)

Some even started saying maybe i have always been cheating in class test, even my parent's confidence in me was destroyed but somewhere i felt serene.

It was like i was in a blind race before but now i can see the world around me qfter i took the effort of not following theose around me, maybe the race still matters in the long run, yet i went ahead to stop and choose whether i want to run it or not. May sound silly but working day and night for god knows what doesnt last long that was the thought. So i decided to think what i want to do first for sure and then do it.

Lol at the end i did choose engineering but atleast i have the confidence that i will do this because its what i want.

My parents dont say much to me now a days its like they know how much studios i am and know that at the end i will do what i want so i feel they gave up on me, lol

The story gets interesting but idk if some1 else is even reading this so ig i will stop here its already so long lmao  this is lame.

EDIT- PART 2 (thanks for reading guys here the roller-coaster)

My parents have relatives who have big mouths and on my accountability my parents bragged about how smart i was and o boi were they disappointed but the tacade had to be kept. 

I was okay with any cllg really because from what i had heard apparently 
1. Cllgs dont matter a lot
2. Except tier 1
(u form connections with awesome guys i mean if u r in iit chances are some of them will become great leaders in future,
And the fortune 50 or so comps visit only these cllgs.
Why- well where will you go to find diamonds, apparently where the chances of getting them are higher by all means even if you are the kohinoor the miners(companies) dk abt that so they wont waste time digging around
Hard pill to swallow but anyways)

My parents told me to lie abt my cet score to my relatives and got me admission into said tier 2 cllg from uk which quota.

The profs are well learned(freshers get new profs so the teaching is kinda relaxed and modern none the less) but the subjects in itself are boring remember bot all are good in pcm so fy basically focuses to bring every 1 to a same start line)



Except ofcourse if you have disdain for these topics and dont attend them just like me. So fast fwd first year i have two backs Engg graphics and python(EG is like bread and butter for mech so i was really scrutinised)

The great thing was being a mechanical engg we had python sub too, and frankly that was the best thing that happened at the end of my fy i failed in python but at the same time i cracked 2000 rank on hacker rank for python algos(top 100 get job opts at google other criteria too but just to give an estimate). 

Increased disdain towards cllg and kinda my guilty pleasure to tell people this irony.(man was i humbled later)


Summer came and i reunited with my school mates and fuck me dead every1 was so different just to give you a glimpse i never went to mcd till then and these guys brought me to a cafe bar along with few girls i dont even know calling it a reunion. And when we met they hugged me as a greet i was like wtf is happening?

At the end of the day i got a girls number fixed another date with her and my frnd ended up having sex with another one. I could hardly believe myself (apparently talking normally is all you need to get a girls number funny i dont remember even trying but i was happy none the less) 


To summarize it was bonkers, my frnd couldn't even talk with girls in school and now this but well it just reminded me 2 yrs isnt a less time and 18 isnt young anymore i literally felt like a young fawn when i saw them ordering drinks and what not i knew i had to catch up.

Anyways the girl and i ended up in a relation ship and i also got a fz for commute from my parents

She takes me too cafes i never even heard like srsly i had a cardamom rose tea for 380 rs will never forget the price and tested like shit.(dip rose petal in water i bet it will test better)

But as if the horror isnt over Now this girl says she wants to learn how to ride a bike i agree to teach she goes off, falls down, forget abt the embarrassment of me trying to console a fallen girl on street but my bike is royally fucked now.

I cant tell my dad abt this due to financial (ahemm and courage) reasons. But i have to go to cllg and my dads gonna come to check up on me someday i cant possibly just let the bike be like that

So i break up with the girl, go to a local maruti suzuki service center and work as a mechanic there. This was the day i got humbled it was literally like a movie scene once they knew i wasn't a customer and was here for a job no one would even listen i was telling them i dont even want  a salary but still i had to go through a lot for it. I came very day 7pm sharp and started pestering them with questions abt transmissions,oils etc untill the manager finally agreed. The reason he was avoiding almost made me loose a nerve. 

Every worksmen had to wear safety clothes and he didn't want to waste one on me because he thought i was some teenager with mood swings and would run away later.

This is when i finally like fucking finally came in terms with reality, We live in a country so competitive that getting an intern job without even getting paid is fucking hard like reality is practically oriented no one gives a shit even more so in mechanical engg.

Anyway everyday 3 hrs in entire sem1 and if that was not enough i got into a fight with a proff in SOM sub because i proved him my solution to the pb was right unlike what he said and things escalate fast and as you must have guessed another back in that sub(0 in internals)
 

Sem1 ends i am humbled af now and i also get dengue lol the only good thing is i managed to repair my bike myself (15k cost st to 1.7k) along with lots of in hand knowledge

Part 3( am sorry for the long post)

Sem2 starts my application for student exchange gets accepted i go to US the food tastes good but then again i dont know what i am eating there. 

Proffs are really enthusiastic to teach and students are the same. I mean its like they came here because they love doing science, its not like you will see any one whos having second thoughts abt engineering. I was amazed but then again i guess its because other subs like arts and philosophy are really respected and encouraged to go to there. 

But alls not bad as indian engg i think the greatest adv of ours is having great theoretical knowledge they have more hands on. But to put it in words, in words we can end the convo and drop the mike like a savant(lol)

I come back surprisingly get mail because of a code i wrote on github its abt a new method i wrote in python for creating random numbers i get an online internship for 1000 dollars if i complete the entire project i was not able to do it in the given span of time, due to proprietary issues they still get to have my code which is like 95% complete and give me 100 dollars payment. Sad life


And i am in 3rd yr now unlike before when i wanted to go to us and used to dream abt all happy go luck stuff i will do after i go there get a house ,get a car, work in cool startups and all ,

today i am more interested to go to Bangalore(apparentlyif you want to open a startup thats the place), meet passionate fellows and work even at the dirtiest of the places if the product is promising.

At the end one or two things i learned/observed is-
1)When u start having older frnd means you are maturing
2)never i repeat never look down on any1, make judgements abt people only on facts
3) To live an extraordinary life, first  u have to live an extraordinarylife.


Damn this was a lot to write, i hope you have something to take from my bit of a story. Good luck to all you fellow savants.

P.s. -lol, my first post and will probably remain my longest even in the far future."

There’s still so much to do for myself; I need to get back on eating 2500 calories a day and exercise more, stop being lazy with my homework, start my business idea to tutor part-time for Spanish, look at college, look at how I’m going to spend my god-damn life- I’m 17 and honestly I don’t feel nearly ready to be an adult. It’s like nobody's really there to help me, and I’m just kinda wasting myself away. I know from my academics and from catching so many Impostors in Among Us (lol) and from what people have said that I have a pretty nice head on my shoulders, but my brain really is going to waste. If I ever have kids, at least I’ll make sure they won’t have to go through the same thing. I’m probably coming off as egotistical and that’s probably not wrong, but I somehow manage to lack self-confidence at the same time and it’s kind of pathetic.

I really don’t know how to go from here, maybe I should try to give some life advices? I guess one thing I’ve learned is to virtually never judge people no matter their background, and to treat everyone as an individual. To me, treating others differently due to their religious or political temperance (I’ve been made fun of for being Christian and both Socialist and Republican when I’m not any of those things, surprisingly) or gender or sexual orientation or whatever the hell other excuses you make to treat others as below you is terrible. There’s also people who assume the poor are lazy or stupid or whatever and it’s a horrible way of thinking. Treating society as a social hierarchy (be it through income, race, intelligence, whatever) is an archaic way of thinking. People all have their own unique beliefs, talents, and goals and should be respected for their differences. Honestly, it’s my opinion that such thinking boils down to human nature, but such bigotry is a limiting disease on this planet. I don’t really judge though. As said in the Great Gatsby, others simply don’t have all the opportunities you have.

I guess another cool thing I learned is that you have to read to be a millionaire. According to my personal finance teacher, the average person doesn’t read a single non-fiction book after college, while the average millionaire reads a non-fiction book every month. Apparently you likely do need to be well-educated to be rich. Another fun-fact I learned is that of the two-thirds of marriages that end in divorce, the majority of those end due to financial trouble. So having a financial manager or being well-educated and responsible with money can have life-changing consequences and create a much more stable life. 78% of people live paycheck to paycheck in America; imagine if those people could wake up and not have to worry about paying off their debts, or student loans, or getting money together for retirement. Imagine they didn’t get divorced because of petty arguments with their S.O.. Apparently, our education system isn’t concerned about creating responsible citizens, and is just struggling to get people to graduate, so never mind about what a damn waste that is, not teaching the basics of budgeting to the common person. You know, conditions like these where people bought shit they couldn’t afford led into the Great Depression. In the 1920’s, people bought houses and cars they couldn’t afford with credit, and virtually everyone had a car. (This is a gross over-simplification; the Depression happened in relation to WWI, which seemed to completely dry up the world’s money supply. Even then it’s still unknown what happened and I’m no history or econ Major).

Veering off, college seems to suck a lot. Remember when I was saying some people couldn’t graduate high-school? Only like 50% of people actually graduate from college. It seems to be a shit-show where people do what they assume a good education is without any forethought; people begin by paying around $10,000-50,000 for general education their first year, not knowing how it’ll help their major, then get a degree without being walked through what job opportunities that degree has or if that person will enjoy a job utilizing that degree. It can be argued that since these guys and gals are 18-22, they should be able to take care of themselves, but I’d say that such an idea is ridiculous; there are many people who simply aren’t taught by their parents to have a good work ethic, or how to get through the college system, or how to get a job, or many other important things. Many are fresh from their parents house moving out, and need an opportunity to learn about themselves, take their first steps in life, and make mistakes. By subjecting young people to a $10,000- 300,000 loan, it severely limits their options. People should, throughout high-school and college, do a wide range of electives and internship opportunities to learn useful skills and what they want to do with their life. I believe that teenagers should learn to do work in fields such as engineering, welding, writing, journalism, fire-fighting, architecture, computer programming, health, whatever floats their boat and teaches them to get a job they enjoy and can work hard towards. Again, it seems that our educators are struggling even to get people to finish schooling, much less teach them to competently be able to work a job or function as responsible adults. Then they have the balls to ask for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, even though two-thirds of graduates are under-employed and don’t use their degree (keep in mind 50% of students don’t even graduate, meaning only 16% of students to go to college fully use their degree. Scary for a teenager like myself). I don’t really know what’s making it so hard for educators, but clearly they’re doing something wrong. Maybe a mindset change for both the teacher and the students would help a lot. There’s so many teachers who assume themselves at the pinnacle of education who think there’s nothing else for them to learn, and all they teach their students is basic algebra or English when there’s so much more to life. I know some people might find my tone very rude and disrespectful, but frankly, I don’t think that the students can be largely to blame for what I’ll call the “education crisis” in America. Therefore, the only other possibility in my mind is that educators or parents are failing to teach their children how to be independent and live their lives. Even though I myself have had wonderful teachers, I’ve heard a lot of bad stories and seem to have just been really lucky. I wonder if this situation will resolve itself, or just become worse over time...

Well, there’s a lot more I’d like to write, on my opinions on climate change (really bad), nuclear weapons (somehow worse), fitness (good), anime (also good), whatever the hell else I can type out (by the way, Danganronpa is an amazing game/visual novel I’m considering creating a fan game for). However, I just realized I can do some homework via my phone and 3G, so I’ll just do that. This really hasn’t been properly proof-read, and if you’ve read through the whole thing I’m amazed, but any thoughts you have on myself, my opinions, or my writing would be great, because it’s been too long since I’ve gotten an outside perspective and would love honest opinions and criticisms. Cheers."
jce6xa,1,2020-10-16,Getting internships as a 35 year old,SadScience322,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jce6xa/getting_internships_as_a_35_year_old/,I'm pursuing a Computer Science BS at 35 and I have a couple of more years before graduation. I've been looking for internships with little luck. So I'm starting to wonder that maybe it's my age? Do companies avoid hiring Junior Devs and interns if they're in their 30s? My previous career has nothing to do with tech either so not much help there. I'm just questioning if there's any point in pursuing a SWE career if I'm already too old to be a junior dev.
jceco4,18,2020-10-16,Security+ 501 Exam Passed as a Junior in College,peterbaker0213,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/jceco4/security_501_exam_passed_as_a_junior_in_college/,"Hello everyone,

Today I am happy to announce that I passed the CompTIA Security+ 501 Exam with a 796/900. Below I will share what I used to study, how long I studied, and my background. But first, I want to say thank you to this entire subreddit. I created an account about a month ago when I was so unbelievably stressed out about passing this exam and many of you allowed me to calm down. I cannot thank you enough.

**My Background:**

My background didn't really give me any advantages. I am in my Junior Year of my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, but my degree is focused on programming, not at all anything cybersecurity or network related. This meant that the only things I knew prior to anything I learned for this certification were what Agile was and what an MD5 and SHA hash algorithm looked like in coding. That is all. Nothing about ports, servers, IAM, or anything else. As I am sure many of you reading this that have passed the exam can attest, that doesn't really give me any advantage.

The only hands-on experience I had were that I was a Quality Assurance Automation Intern over the summer, but again I was just doing testing for coding and I wasn't messing around with anything else besides code so that didn't give me any kind of advantage.

**What I Used to Study as well as how I used them:**

Below is a list of everything I used to study and below that is how I used them:

* [Professor Messer's YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy)
* [CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead Book](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Get-Certified-Ahead/dp/1939136059) by Darril Gibson
* [Professor Messer's 3 Practice Exams](https://www.professormesser.com/sy0-501-security-plus-success-bundle/)
* [CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam Objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/Security%2B%20SY0-501%20Exam%20Objectives.pdf)

I also purchased Jason Dion's exams, but never actually used them due to some reviews on reddit saying they were not at all like the actual exam. Looking at them now after taking the Security+ exam his questions are vastly different then the actual exam. I also purchased Mike Meyer's videos on udemy, however, I never got around to using them, but many others on reddit have said they are a great resource as well.

So how did I use all of this stuff? I began studying in the middle of August (just before my classes began) where I would watch 2 hours of Professor Messer's videos a day to get an idea of what was on this exam. This was an amazing introduction to a lot of these topics and really helped when I began reading Darril Gibson's book later on because I actually remembered a lot of the topics. I did not take notes at all while listening and watching Professor Messer's videos, I just used it as an introduction.

Next, once I finished the videos I began Darril Gibson's textbook. I would read 15 pages on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. And that made me finish 2 chapters every week. I would then take Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off to do my actual school work in college. I would read a chapter and then do the exam. If I scored a 75 or more I would just move to the next one. If I scored less (this only happened on the networking chapter where I got around 3 correct), I would reread the entire chapter and take notes. 

When I finished the textbook on October 2nd. I took the end of the book test and I recieved a 57%. As you know you need an 83.33% or otherwise known as a 750/900 or more to pass the actual exam. This was insanely discouraging.

I knew I needed to do something so after reading a bunch of Reddit posts. I downloaded the pdf version of the certification exam objectives. I printed it out and highlighted and of the objectives that I was even a tiny bit unclear about. To say the least, there was a bunch of stuff I was unsure about. I then spent every day taking one section and looking up a phrase I highlighted in the index then going to every page it was mentioned and reading about it. Then creating a flashcard for it with what I learned on the back. By the end of every day, I would take all of my flashcards and go through them and explain what it was out-loud. If I couldn't do that, I would continue to go through the index cards until I was fluent.

This last week I took all 3 of Professor Messer's exams on top of reading new sections in the Exam Objectives. Here are my scores. (Take note that I was studying new sections every day, and by Exam 3 I had now finished all of the certification objectives)

Exam 1: 53/90 | Retake: 83/90

Exam 2: 64/90 | Retake: 81/90

Exam 3: 69/90 | Never retook this exam.

The day before my exam, I took the day off. I felt that I was so overly stressed about the exam that I would actually fail it from being to stressed. So I didn't study. The morning of the exam I went through my flashcards and then took it and passed.

Again, thank you all for helping me here and I apologize for the lengthy post, but I wanted people to really see how I studied to pass this exam to help others in a similar situation :)"

jcftmk,8,2020-10-16,"Success story of a December 2019, No-Name School, B Average, Grad.",Aystogon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jcftmk/success_story_of_a_december_2019_noname_school_b/,"Long time lurker who absolutely hated lurking. I started lurking around my freshman year of university. So many of the posts made everything sound so daunting, and still do at times. I hated seeing people from top schools complain how there 4.0 average wouldn’t convert to an offer at Google. It sucked.

I wasn’t the worst of students. I had a B Average for my major (Computer Science). I was told things like GPA wouldn’t matter as much as long as i had other things to show on my resume. My grades were a product of having hard courses like Calc, EXTREMELY boring courses like Networking, and a few courses I could do in my sleep.

I remember falling asleep in my networking class, but I was always in the back so it wasn’t nearly as bad I guess?

So, I knew what type of technical CS job I wanted. It’s just I felt that I could get that by my own terms. I felt that courses like my architecture classes were neat and all but just not *necessary*, at least for me. 

Every semester from sophomore year I made a personal project. It wasn’t out of feeling to better myself, I just genuinely enjoyed everything about it and was told by Reddit that Jobs love’m. Also, I enjoyed looking like Hackerman in the cafe’s. I would do that frequently and was incredibly easy to do at a liberal arts school with a small CS path.

Looking back, I hated how I could like NEVER get any Collabs for projects with any of the CS students. I asked around a lot too.

These personal projects were nothing crazy at all. No crud or web apps. All mostly Python and/or Java. Small 2D games where I added a lot of different features to some utility applications for things like helping me study.

My first Internship and second Internship during university. None of them through the school (Since they’re no required or ever even pushed on us). I would like to contribute the first internship to my projects and second internship to my projects along with my first internship. Both internships in-state.

I received good feedback from both companies and would have been able to stay full time if I Wanted to. However, I felt that because my path was going to be a little different, it was probably best to change companies each year to bulk up my resume. 

Senior year comes. Rona hits. I got a few interviews and don’t pass them. Even got the fabled Google interview and of course didn’t pass it. Was a System Design question which I didn’t think they’d ask for a new grad/senior. And a leetcode medium. Months later, I had interview with another company and BAM. A whopping six figure salary. 

GEEZ, I never thought my first job out of university would be six figures. It’s kinda like a dream when I think about it. They asked what was equivalent to leetcode mediums.

Anyways here’s the deets. Did like at least an easy question a day (Leetcode). THEN, during the times I had an interview come up I would start doing like 3 mediums a day, MAX. Also, days I had tech interviews, those counted as my leetcode questions for the day. I was grinding for about 6~ months and was about ready to settle for just another IT job. Over 400+ applications. No referrals. Bunch of Luck.

Also, I was doing side projects during this time, but not the whole time. Made a small game to see if I could break my max-lines-of-code-for-a-program score. It was for fun, and I didn’t intentionally bloat it either. Stopped working on it past like 11k+ lines, which broke my previous score of like 5k  :^ )


Hopefully this will motivate people who are / were in / similarly close to my situation. I would have settled for less, especially with Rona. I Just got super lucky in the numbers game. I did set myself up a little though.

I would say if you took away anything from this, it’s to ensure you apply yourself. You might not have everything the next guy has, but setting yourself up seems like it might be the next best thing you can do. 

 Feel free to ask anything if you guys have any questions."

My question is whether I should pursue an IT Development/Rotational program, or just secure a regular full time IT position as opposed to one that has rotations. 

I have had three internships across technology, but I’m not yet sure which branch of IT I want to specialize in, so I feel like a rotational program would be really beneficial, however, I haven’t heard any testimonials from people that have been through one themselves. 

Thank you to anybody that offer guidance!"
jcgbkc,2,2020-10-16,Is it wrong to need a break from everyone?,feeeeeeeelllsssss,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jcgbkc/is_it_wrong_to_need_a_break_from_everyone/,"

Last year I was going through some stuff and I needed a break from everything. I didn’t really understand what’s going on at the time, just that I wasn’t happy whenever I hung out with anyone. My best friend felt that I was ignoring her. I should have told her straight away how I felt, but instead I would just cancel plans if I didn’t feel up to it (which was always). I know I went about this the wrong way and I apologized to her and we talked it out.

Flash forward to this summer, with everything that was happening with Covid, I was getting into a lot of fights with my dad. I wasn’t really emotionally stable and I told her that I needed time to myself. School is my priority, as well as my internship. Every time that I would hang out with anyone, I would just feel exhausted and didn’t want to be there. I knew that I needed to work on being happier, but I also needed time to focus and get good grades. I knew that if I had still hung out with people, I wouldn’t have done as good in school nor be as happy. 

Recently (after a few months of radio silence) I tried to reach out to my best friend again (after resolving things with my dad). She told me that she was upset, because she didn’t think it was right that I kept taking time off from her. At first I felt bad, and I understood what she was coming from. I won’t be able to run away from a family if I have one when I’m older or all my problems.

However, I spoke to my other friend and she said that everyone handles things in different ways. I have my priorities and I have to stick to them. I would not have been happy with myself if I had forced myself to fake happiness and hang out with people.

I know that I have to fix how I handle things, as I can’t run away from everyone for months when I feel like it, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong here. Do you think I am?

I can be too logical at times and I don’t want to put less emphasis on our friendship , but I also have other things that are important to me."

I got a sweet gig at top tech company, started beginning of this year. Been wfh since pandemic started.

I really don’t have anything to compare it to though except internships. It’s kinda hard to tell about performance. It’s so hard to gauge anything. These project have been lasting forever and it’s so hard to even TELL if I’m focusing or getting work done or if I’m slacking. Am I just getting bored? Some days I feel like it’s really chill. Some days I get a decent amount done. Some days I literally just don’t get much done I feel like. I mean we’ve been making progress on our projects but I guess I feel like I’m getting carried?? But then sometimes I don’t. Or like I can’t put in a ton of effort and feel one way or the other. Or I can just not stress to hard about it kinda take it easy and still feel either way lmao. So I just have been choosing to kinda relax bc it’s so hard to focus sometimes. But like I still get things done I just feel... slow? So much information my brain just doesn’t want it anymore. Idk bro haha.

Does anyone feel similar?

Edit: I feel like the only way I can avoid that feeling is if I grind grind grind. So that I know for sure that I know everything that’s going on. But that’s exhausting as fuck goddamn. And means I can’t allow myself to relax. Tf.


Which I think I was doing at the start, but it was a lot easier. And I not having fun anymore? Am I lazy? Am I not cut out for this company anymore? Do we quit?

Tell me your thought."

Internship 2: Corporate Finance Internship at a Fortune 500. This internship is a Financial Planning &amp; Analysis internship and will involve more hands-on work than the first one. I feel like I would learn a lot more but the company's name is not nearly as prestigious as the Big 4 firm. Also, this internship is more similar to what i want to do further into the future.

jcoop6,0,2020-10-17,How do I get a job as a math major?,Swiftness1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jcoop6/how_do_i_get_a_job_as_a_math_major/,"So I graduated last semester with a BS in math. I graduated with a decent GPA (3.63) from a typical state school. I didn’t do an industry internship but I did do an REU during the summer after my junior year. These are kind of like internships except they are at a university and research-based. Now I’m doing a MS in math.

Here’s the problem. I decided that I don’t want to teach I want to work in industry. I looked up what kind of jobs math majors do and the most popular ones that came up were data scientist and software engineer (or something similar to these two). I have only taken one CS class. I have self taught a bit of coding over this last summer as well and occasionally have had to use a bit in my research or in some of my math classes. But other then that I have very little coding experience compared to your typical CS major.

I do plan on doing some research next semester on “RNA-sequencing data analysis” which will require me to self teach some more R. By the time I graduate I will likely have a cryptography thesis, that RNA project, some stats classes, and a bit of coding experience that probably amounts to no more than what a CS major will dave done by the time they are in their second year of undergrad. I obviously don’t have time for extra side projects during the masters because as a graduate student my schedule is just ridiculous.

My question is. What kind of job could I even get after graduating? Are there others in here that came from a pure math heavy background. What did you do to transition into industry? Am I screwed? If so, how screwed?"

I’m an international student living in the US and a CS freshman at university, so I’ve just been doing my course work so far. Today, for the first time, I found out that I should be actively looking for internships even as a freshman. As a freshman newbie, I’m not really sure where I should be looking for internships, and how I should find and apply to them, so I’ve a few questions:

1) Could you guys give me some advice on what I should do from the get-go as a freshman to find and apply for internships?

2) I found about the Google STEP program and Microsoft Explore programs today. Is it worth applying to these programs even though they’ve been open for some time now?"

I just went to college because I thankfully received enough financial aid to go for free. As I got to my junior year, I switched from marketing to finance and added a CS minor simply to have a 4 year college experience, as I was a little ahead in my finance curriculum. 

As junior year went on, I began to develop a real interest in CS, to the point that I had regretted not majoring in it initially. Meanwhile, I’m taking business internships and realizing through each one how much I really don’t enjoy that field of work. 

A few weeks ago, I finally came to terms with the fact that I enjoy my CS curriculum so much that I couldn’t not try to pursue it as a career. The odds are against me, as I lack experience through internships and upper level coursework in CS. 

So here’s the question: what steps should I take in order to be a competitive candidate when applying to CS jobs? I graduate in March 2021, which gives me about 5 1/2 months to prepare myself for the job application process. Thanks in advance for reading this far, and any help would be greatly appreciated. I genuinely love this field and just want to be able to do this stuff for a living."

I swear if I get a B+ in the first progress check of Junior year I am going to be pissed.  Please just let me get an A- in AP Music Theory for the first semester--it's the one thing I am just not naturally good at.  I swear--please let me have annotated that score properly in the last assignment.

Good grief why did I not remind my teacher to send me that really crucial document for my project that is due in three days.  What--am I supposed to email them on a weekend?  I already emailed them but they have two emails--good grief I knew I should have sent my reminder to both emails.  They're going to have meetings all day on Monday--how are they supposed to send me the document?!

I swear if I get a B+...Or worse...a C if I don't get that document from my teacher on time.  I swear I swear I swear if I get a C for no good reason in the first progress check I am going to cry.

I still haven't finished my book for summer reading.  The summer reading project is due next month and I have 20 hours of the audible book left.  Good grief--just let me be able to catch up by next weekend.  Pleasepleaseplease.  I feel like I'm going to fail everything.  Why have they not finished calculating my GPA yet--I wish they would just update my transcript with my dual enrollment courses from this past summer.  Then I could see...Gee wiz half the semester is not even here yet and I might have a B+...just give me an A- please please please--I swear.

My SAT prep course is not going well either.  I don't remember this stuff from math.  I am going to have to study forever.  Why are these word problems so difficult but so simple?  I've had no time to take a practice test either.  I'm dumb.  That's it--I'm dumb.  It's algebra for goodness sake--algebra!!  I have been doing algebra since 5th grade--why do I not even know where to start constructing a quadratic equation from this word problem.  \*\*I'm toast.  I'm toast.  I know it--am I ever going to MIT??  Why can't I do it like the other kids?  Why can't I just be like them?  I bet they're not pulling all-nighters until 8AM to finish overdue homework.  They make it look so easy.  Is it this hard?  Should it be this hard?  Guys--I'm seriously asking--\*\****Should it be THIS HARD???***  **I feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes.**

I can't handle 4APs and an honors math class and 5 electives and co-found a club and do technovation and sign up for internships and look for scholarships??  What is wrong with me?  What if I don't get a 4 or a 5.  Good grief--what if I get a 2??  I'll have wasted a whole year.  I already missed out on half of high school due to family stuff and being put in the wrong school freshman year and now this year, my last year--my last GOOD year--will be wasted if I get a gosh darn 2 on an AP exam.  I'll be crushed you guys--you know I'll just be crushed.  I'm so stupid.  How could I have let this happen?  If I had just sent two emails instead of one.  If I had just not been so sleep deprived that I got up at 9AM instead of 6--I would have been able to talk to my music teacher about that score.

I'm failing myself.  I'm failing my family.  My family is depending on me.  And I could graduate with a 4.2W GPA and 1130 SAT or something?  What T40 CS school is gonna take that?  What am I gonna do?  Do you think even purdue will take me?  Purdue would make me happy--just give me purdue please please please.

I'm so stupid--how could I let this happen.  If I get a B...if I get a C...does this mean I'll have finally encountered something that I just...can't do?  I believed in myself--I thought if I set my mind to anything I could do it...but there's that possible C+ for the first progress check.  Failure.  Failure.  That's it.  How could I fail?  I honestly cannot believe this--I truly believed in myself.  I'm not kidding when I say that 95% of the goals I set for myself, especially in terms of academics, I accomplish.  I've got grit.  I never gave up--I never stopped trying--I really did try to give my all.  I did almost everything right.  And I still might lose.  I guess captain picard is right."

However, I feel like I still know nothing, and definitely not enough to be 'good'. I'm looking at going back to 'coding school' to get the fundamentals really mastered. Flatiron's self-paced option seems like it's also (unintentionally) mastery-based learning, which definitely suits my style of learning. And the 'career counselling' portion is definitely a big up-sell as I'll be looking for a remote job.  
However, Launch School seems like it really does help you 'master the fundamentals' which is incredibly appealing to me.

I always see people listing their ECs as “soccer captain, T20 research, etc” but they don’t go into detail. Is just being able to say that on your app impressive? If you do research, is the assumption you’re working under a professor at their lab? *Do colleges only think it’s impressive if you get co-authorship?* Is there an important difference in the eyes of admissions when it comes to whether it’s a structured HS-geared research internship vs something you got on your own that isn’t part of a program?

I'm not completely decided on my major but I'm leaning towards a major in Business / Entrepreneurship  and a minor in Psychology, here are my grades and extracurriculars:

* 10th grade approximately 80%
* 11th grade failed 2 subjects but got in the high 80% almost 90% in the retest (which I was told would be on my report card but I'm not really sure anymore)
* 12th grade got around 75% in my Midterms (based on which will be the expected grades) and more than 80% in cs and English and maths (if my friend is right it's around a 3 GPA in the US scale)
* Missed my SAT because of Covid-19
* pending to take an English Proficiency test (contemplating whether to take the Duolingo or TOEFL)
* Now the extracurriculars:
* Developed and launched my own video game which was to raise awareness to a cause available on android and this was featured on multiple national level newspapers with half-page articles (I'm very google-able but I'm not including my name because I don't want someone I know seeing this)
* Currently working on my NGO which is establishing Mental Health Resources for Schools which I'm co-founder and president of
* Got selected to talk about my work on sustainability at the UN headquarters in New York (this was an opportunity around 1000+ people tried for from various schools around the globe and around 40 got selected 7 day-long programs)
* Got selected for a leadership camp by SEG (Swizz Education Group) a week-long selective workshop (this is currently going on)
* President of the tech club at school
* One of 5 founding members of student clubs in our school ( we made the process, functioning and established the first clubs)
* 2-month long Internship at a top video game company in India
* A certified course in bread baking if that counts for anything xD

I am 21 years old, living in third world country and about to be a senior Computer Scientist/ Computer Engineer in my university. My grades are not great at all. Even though my overall grade is 2,92 my area gpa is around 2,5. That should tell something about my past efforts and interest level about my field. 2 years ago I tried switching my major to psychology since I was interested in it. But, facing pressure from family &amp; friends and never-ending doubts on my side, I decided to keep majoring in CS. 

I am also working in a tech company as a part-time intern back end developer, thinking it will have some positive effect on my career. But, I feel somewhat lost on what I really want to do in the future. So, any minute I work in there feels like I am actually deviating from my possible passion.   


Like I said I am interested in psychology. More specifically, how the human brain functions, why we decide to do certain things in daily-life etc. Closest I can think of a field related to this is artificial intelligence. But, I really don't know what to aim at specifically. I want to have a concrete goal at hand. Like 'I want to be an academician who works on neural networks...'  or 'I try to make robots who try to think like humans...' etc.

Doubts&amp;Questions:

\*Even if I did decide to be an academician at this point, my GPA is mediocre and my CS background isn't so shiny. So, why would any top institution accept me as a master's student? 

\*\*Am I losing time doing my part-time internship since it's just random back-end stuff in C#?

\*\*\*Is there any field of specialization in CS you can recommend to me regarding my interests?"

What degrees should I get? I was planning on an MBA or a Ph.D. How will these degrees benefit me? What chances do I have with the GPA that I currently have? What should I focus on for the remainder of my undergrad to get into a good grad school? It is also worth mentioning my major related GPA is more like 3.7-3.8 while my breath courses is near 3.5.

jczqum,2,2020-10-17,I'm not sure this field is for me.,Ancap_Free_Thinker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jczqum/im_not_sure_this_field_is_for_me/,"This is something that has been on my chest for awhile. It's a bit of a rant/advice seeking post.  And probably the 5'th one this month alone. 

Let me give some background on myself. I've always had a natural leaning towards mechanic-type careers. As I've always admired people who could fix machines, and equipment in the real world.  Truth be told, I'd rather do a trade where I am in my life. In spite of what I've heard about it. (Shitty people, hard on your body, etc). 

Yet everyone in my life seems to believe I'm solely interested in CS work, just because I use a Desktop for all of my daily activities. I don't have any real enthusiasm to be a SWE. Sure the pay is nice, some may get to work on fantastic projects....but I never practice in my free time. Never take free online courses, etc. 

For awhile I thought I wanted to do this, but I was just lying to myself.  Seeing the stories on this subreddit where people with real passion for this industry go all out (Projects, Internships, Networking, etc, etc) and still struggle to get jobs. If at all. It seems everyone and their Uncle's Mother in Law's Cousin's Step Child wants to break into this industry. If you ask me, it seems like saturation is inevitable, as the number of grads being churned out in the US alone will soon catch up with the growth of the market. Lets' not talk about foreign workers being churned out at similar rates.

To drive the nail deeper into the Coffin...the idea of working in a corporate office setting makes me want to scream. Salary be dammed. And if my experiences from coding classes I took in HS were any indication, I'd soon hate what I was doing. 

My family gets agitated with me if I even suggest a trade as an option. As they have some bizarre fascination with White Collar Jobs, despite almost never working one.  They tell me I'm ""Not interested"" in repairing vehicles, or machinery. But I am interested in Coding just because I post on Reddit with a desktop... 

Am I just being foolish? OR should I really pursue something else?"
jd0dtu,6,2020-10-17,Approached by facebook recruiter for software engineer intern role,VariationAcceptable9,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jd0dtu/approached_by_facebook_recruiter_for_software/,"Hi all. Out of the blue I got an email from a recruiter who works directly at Facebook to say they had seen my CV and asking me if I want to interview for the role of software engineer intern for next summer.

I'm not sure how they found me, I didn't apply directly at any time. I'm also not sure if this is something I should do/go forward with at this current time at least. Yes I can program and have worked on lots of projects, but I am definitely still learning and my work experience at a company amounts to only 6 months in a technical role and I kind of got involved in starting up a company but we decided quite early on not to pursue it due to feeling the idea was not strong enough. So I have no accomplishments there. I pretty much just have irrelevant work experience but lots of competitions/extra curricular accomplishments.

I'm going to be studying comp sci as of September 2021 and this internship role is for next summer. Are they looking for people who are graduating soon, rather than people like me who have not studied computer science for any number of semesters? Also if I don't apply any further, how do I go about turning this down without burning bridges for the future?

Another thing to mention is that I currently have zero experience in algorithm style questions. Would I have enough time to prepare if I were to start now?

I would only be interested in this role for what I could learn from their engineers. Would I learn a lot in a 12 week internship with them?

Appreciate any help."
jd0ovz,0,2020-10-17,"[NY] A few weeks ago, I took off a religious day without notice. Might be fired this week. Advice?",Somejustsay237,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/jd0ovz/ny_a_few_weeks_ago_i_took_off_a_religious_day/,"Background: I've been at this company consecutively for 8 months (mostly WFH), and non-consecutively for 1 year over the past few years (summer internships). 

I'm not normally religious but I'm living at home with my parents (because of the pandemic), and they're more religious than I am. They recently started threatening to evict me when I didn't want to go with them to religious events. My parents end up shouting very loudly at me, and I'm trying to avoid a physical fight and domestic violence (which has happened). 

A few weeks ago it was a very important holiday and I took the day off at work, to avoid another situation. Unfortunately I had to do it without notice, I literally sent an email the early morning of that day. This is the only religious holiday I ever took off, and I was clear it would be the only day I would take off for this reason. 

To make matters worse I had to take the week off sick before then, and I've been under a new manager for 2 months. 

My manager told me to give better notice, I apologized and didn't provide any further explanation or context (because I am at home and one of my parents is always there so I didn't want them to hear me). 

I have definitely noticed that the amount of workload given to me since this has dried up. In fact I now have a ""performance review"" this week with my manager and HR. Well I can guess what that means. 

This is a large company and in my state [NY] there are certain protections against firing someone for domestic violence (in addition to disability and religion). 

However I understand this is America, and for the most part I can be fired for any reason. And not providing adequate notice is always grounds to fire someone, even for a sick or religious day. 

Assuming I'm not fired, but placed on ""probation"", what should I say? Or what should I avoid saying? I want to keep my job."

jd2aet,11,2020-10-17,"Homeless, lonely, dont care about myself n life, and ready to die. I wont have to kill myself though. Me being out here will be inevitable",fffeeertyt3tt5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jd2aet/homeless_lonely_dont_care_about_myself_n_life_and/,"Let's start with when I was younger. We were poorer than poor. Living in an abandoned apartment. My (and I hate even giving them these titles it just feels weird at this point) mom, brother and me. Roaches, rats, lizards is what all I saw. I was just a one night stand baby that I wish she would had aborted but I guess bringing someone in this world just to not have to raise them is better. My (and I hate using this title) dad was in and out of prison selling crack so i would rarely see him until one day he saw me with no shoes on putting water in a water jug at a gas station. Guess the guilt got to him enough to take me to my grandma house. She always raised me. She raised me since I was a baby. So her taking me in was a blessing but also a bad thing. It was one less mouth to feed and I barely saw my ""brother"" like that. I always thought and so did he maybe that I had it better. When in actuality, mom kept u -not me. I ll never have that mom n son relationship with her because she would never be real with me like she will with u because of guilt. I look just like her. So when she looks at me she looking at herself. As I was living with my grandma, my grandad (which he was great too but he had another side to him before he got sick) in which I guess he was trying to toughen me up but i was close to my grandma. Call us ""Foot to Foot"". Every where she went I went. Grandad use to curse me out under his BREATh I remember ""pussy ass nigga"", ""bitch ass nigga"" all that at around 4 or 5 6 or 7 years old. I guess he was right... I never really talked like that at all. Only with my grandma. I remember one day I believe I was 5 or 7, this dude with a black shirt and gray sweatpants wanted to play. Me at the time i didnt know the totality of what was going on. Or maybe I did and did it anyway idk. He wanted me to sit on his lap and show me his penis and he want me to show mine. After that happened as i think of it now, it's like a spirit that was passed from one to another. This is how a victim can become a victimizer. As I start getting like 10 or lil older I remember playing around with my cousin (around same age) and I did the same thing the guy did to me but I stopped that once we got caught by my aunt. (I'm not into guys at least masculine I guess but I have a weird fetish for transsexuals). My grandma was the greatest person in the world to me. It's just when u dont have that father figure in your life and because everything that was going on around u was happening and all my grandma wanted to do was make sure I had everything, she spoiled me. And u know what it says about spoiling someone. But I ll never ever blame nothing on her because she did what my own mom n dad n everyone else didnt-raise me. I blame myself for not being a better grandkid now that she gone. Was spoiled when it came to her. She always made sure that I was ok. I know she is highly disgusted and disappointed with me in the grave and grandma I'm sorry for everything. Because even if I dont directly kill myself, the way I'm living now is just as bad-a slow and painful death. As I got older I became more and more lustful. Especially when grandma was starting to slowly die on me after my granddad pass. Now around that time (still young) around 15 or 16, there were a couple of girl cousins (no force of course as they wanted to do it too) we did sexual things to each other. No penetration as I didnt even begin masturbating until 18. Before then all my dick would do was be hard and I would have wet dreams every now and again. (I didnt have penetration sex until this year and I'm 27 years old now). Now I remember when I moved in with step mom n pops-thinking this was going to be family but that was hell. Especially being that this mf was selling crack and I barely see him like that. Then when he got locked up he left me with that abusive bitch. I remember getting beaten with toy bats and toy hockey sticks. Take off all my clothes. And it can be for something small or something big. I had a problem with keeping my draws clean so I would definitely get whipped about that. Every day or at least every other day. Then my grandparents picked me up because they know alot of things was going on. I had to choose so u know I was going to them. No lie my dad was an asshole (he still is but he ll never see me again. He won. I'm out of the picture and he and his wife and everyone else in that family can live their best life), never was around like that then when he did he acted like ""well I'm here am i?"" type of attitude. While mom n dad were doing them my grandma was raising me think about that. I use to get bullied every day in school. I always smelled like shit and I let people treat me like shit. To this day I regret not standing up for myself 5-8th grade because it still follows me to this day. Fast forward, I started going to church to get close to God. Around 16. Whatever age I was in 9th grade. And things were okay. Then my grandma got sick. She was on alot of pills and she was always sleepy or dozing off. She was in so much pain. Where was her son? Doing him and blaming her for things and being jealous of me because of the relationship me and his mom (my grandma) had. While yo ass was in and out of prison!!!! I remember that time when I was younger 10 or 11 and he took my grandma jewelry, the xbox and playstation i had. She died the day after my birthday in 2010, and I watched her die me n my big cousin. To this day I never gotten over it and never will. To this day a part of me died when she left. To this day I regret ever getting close to both mom n dad because in turn it was my demise. The things I did after my grandma passed.. I smoked weed for the first time my brother turned me on to it. After I got high that first time I never stopped and to this day I will never stop smoking weed. I moved in with my dad n his girlfriend (something I should of learned from before not to do but at the time I just wanted to keep the peace and just never spoke up for myself). I tried to rub on my older cousin butt (who's a pill popper n just nobody fw her but favoritism is mf so they fw her but not at the same time) and she told. I was high af. Then went to stay with my grandma on my step mom side (her mom). The things I did there...i would definitely be in jail. I'm definitely going to hell too because if that opportunity presented itself again i would do it again. Victim becomes the victimizer. Then it was just to where I ended up going to finally stay with my mom. I should of stayed with my aunt but I wanted to stay with my mom because I was planning on getting an apartment with the paid intern job at Gulfstream.  And I did. I couldn't stay with my mom tho because the rent man can have a lot of people in the apartment it was some bullshit she told me. I got an apartment at 18 while I was still in high school. I didnt keep it for long. I just didnt care about life or myself and that was to this day. I ended up getting evicted then having to move back with this nigga again that was constantly reminding of how much I fucked up. That's when everyone stopped really fucking with me like that. I mean they really didnt mess with me like that anyway it was just off the fact that I was with my grandma that they did mess with me. Too much hatred for them. I know if I never gotten close to them, things would have turned out different. How can u be around someone if u deep down hate them, u going to eventually act out and do things to where they dont want nothing to do with. Fast forward 2013 I moved in with my real mom n brother n her boyfriend. Every where I went I was a problem after my grandma passed. I realized my brother was finessing and jugging me like i was some other dude in the streets, fell out with him and that never spoke to him sense. U remember when I said I let people take advantage of me? Yea.. all in all I just stopped really giving a fuck about myself I was always in some bullshit. It just got to the point in late 2015 early 2016 I cut off all ties with them. My life maybe hell now and I will be dead soon but if I had choose to be around them and that-I will choose my body being found on a pavement. I take responsibility for the things I've done. Even if what they did were wrong, the things i did and the way i reacted to the things they did, gave them a way out.  A clean slate from God if u ask me. After my grandma passed i stopped going to church, now I just dont care for God anymore because I realize these past years he never loved or cared about me. I thought he did but he didnt and I feel like a fool thinking about it. Like finding out Santa wasnt real. But in the same breath I can't blame him. I've become an abomination now that thoughts are just full of lust, anger, envy, depression, and suicidal thoughts. You might as well say everything was my fault now since doing the things that I did. When people do u wrong and u reacted in a way- the blame will be on u at that point.  u end up proving someone right about the things they thought about u. Now I will die alone, with nothing, homeless sleeping outside. I don't want to try anymore. I dont want to care anymore. These are my consequences and I'm too far gone to change my ways. I believe God knows this as well. I'm just living at this point until I die. I had to share this with someone who has eyes before I leave this world."

But anyways,  need some advice on what I can do to improve my chances of landing a job. (SWE or data science related role)

A little bit about myself. I graduated in May, and originally was planning on going to grad school. (Did the gre prep, applications, etc) Sadly, things didn't work out. Took a couple months off during covid, and started to apply for jobs in July. In the meantime I was practicing leetcode to get myself back in the groove.  I have sent out many applications, some being referrals too from people I know.  Whenever I come across something on linkedin or whatnot I apply. So far out of the 60+ applications, I have gotten 4 ""interviews"". I am counting online assessments as part of these ""interviews"". 2 online coding assessments (amazon and codesignals), 1 take home, 1 phone call. These results have been even worse than when I was applying to internships prior to graduating. I don't know if its just me or because of the current situation. I know that I am no rock star programmer, but I do believe that my skills should be around average in terms of new grads. I am able to solve all but the hard questions on the weekly leetcode contests pretty consistently, for my codesignals assessment I scored 842/850. Then again these things that I am basing off my skill is constrained to these coding problems. 

I understand that I am probably not getting any responses from companies as a result of my lack of internship experience. What can I do in this regard? Where can I find roles that are less competitive? I have been applying to roles I found on Linkedin, Angellist, Indeed, companies I know off the top of my head.  What are some good temp/staffing agencies? Will this be a good route for me? Do companies take interns like me?

Is it better for me to just focus on presenting myself as a ""data science"" person? I want to work in software too, but is that just too impractical? In the meantime, I plan on continuing to apply to roles and continue to keep my programming skills warmed up by dabbling in personal projects.

I dislike Turkey's religious pressure and the economy is getting worse day by day. I want to go out to a developed country in either America or Europe, English-speaking country preferred. Currently America, Canada, Finland, UK, Germany(because of my job) hover around my thoughts.

I have participated in a robotics student project team for a year, went to a competition in USA with the team. I have done 2 internships, which were required to graduate. My English level is unofficially good, as I commonly speak it with friends IRL or in Discord. No other languages, currently. Budget should be about 2k-4k dollars, but would become 6-8k if I work for a year.

My plan for going abroad is to apply to a job abroad as a mechanical engineer. If possible, I will do my last internship abroad. If you think of a better way, please do tell. Read some threads here, but they didn't address some anxieties of mine, so I created a post to ask for your information.

\*Few edits to expand my info. Sorry for editing a few times, I went from being minimalistic to ""I should expand"" mentality.

Questions:

1. How much importance does; targeted applications, working in student project team for a year, having 10 years of USA tourist visa, being in top3 uni of Turkey, matter?
2. Would companies take me at this level? How hard will it be to find any job? If not, what must I do?
3. How much of money will I need to bank, and, how much will I be able to save/year?
4. Will I get a permanent residence visa? What will I lack until I become an official citizen?
5. Any recommended countries? Any recommended paths to take?"

For the past 6-8 weeks I've been working temporarily in a manual-labor technical job doing water damage/mold restoration just to make some money while I look for something more fitting.

Recently I've thought about trying to pursue work in data analytics as it's something I think I would be interested in doing, however for all intents and purposes, the only real credibility I have to my resume is my degree.

I learned a bit of python and did some java app development in my courses, but I'm not proficient enough to use them in a work setting without learning a lot more on my own. I didn't really pursue internships as I spent most of my time in college working as much as I could and moving back home in the summers to be able to afford my degree at all.

  
So now I have a BS that I feel isn't really enough on its own, and I'm looking to improve my skills so that I can pursue a target direction. I have seen a lot of these jobs look for experience in R, Python, SQL, and some others, as well as tools like Power-BI.

At the moment I can afford to spend a few more months with family working on my career qualifications without worrying about going homeless, so I want to use that time wisely and set my self up to be able to get a job and support myself soon.

My question then is really, what should I be focusing on right now if my goal is to spend the next few months learning a few new skills or working on projects that I could use on a resume and hopefully work in data analytics sometime this year or the beginning of the next? Should I try teaching myself more Python and R, and use personally interesting subjects as the basis for some projects? Are there any certifications that may be helpful that I should consider pursuing as well?

jd7cxh,92,2020-10-17,I got the chance to interview a Berkeley grad on Uber's Data Science team :),ibsurvivors,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jd7cxh/i_got_the_chance_to_interview_a_berkeley_grad_on/,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do &amp; where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard &amp; interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing &amp; analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization &amp; efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

jd7lzj,3,2020-10-17,Airbnb Internship or Mid-tier Full-Time After Graduation,jordanvhn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jd7lzj/airbnb_internship_or_midtier_fulltime_after/,"Hey all,

I feel like I'm in a bit of a unique situation, and I'm not sure what career decisions to make going forward. I'm currently finishing up my last semester at a top 5 CS university (graduating Fall 2020). I have completed a few internships with middle-of-the-line companies, and I have a return offer from one of them, with a start date of March 2021. On the other hand, I have a 2021 Summer internship offer from a company I really love, Airbnb. I originally landed an internship with Airbnb in Summer 2020, but that was deferred due to COVID-19. If I were to go with Airbnb, I wouldn't have a return offer for Airbnb until 2022 (and I'm not sure that even that is guaranteed).

There are a good number of companies (maybe around 30) that I would prefer over my full-time offer. I've been recruiting for New Grad positions for these companies, but I haven't been doing so aggressively (just online applications, not many referrals or cold emails). I think I started recruiting too late this time around (I started mid-September when it seems like most companies wrapped up recruiting around that time). I either haven't heard back from these companies, completed the coding challenge and then haven't heard back (2 companies), or been outright rejected with a referral (Google and Facebook, although the Google one wasn't for a New Grad position).

As far as I see it, I have a few options:

* Option 1a: Take the full-time offer that starts in March 2021 and work for that company for 1-2 years before transitioning to a different company (not risky, start career ASAP, but work for a company I'm not very excited about)
* Option 1b: Take the full-time offer that starts in March 2021 but still actively recruit, and reneg on the offer before starting / a few months after starting (not risky, start career ASAP, involves more work, and I'd have to reneg)
* Option 1c: Take the Airbnb internship offer for Summer 2021 and try to delay my full-time offer until August 2021 (not risky, delay full-time career by 5 months, have a ""Big"" name on my resume, i'm not sure my full-time offer is willing to delay)
* Option 2a: Take the Airbnb internship offer for Summer 2021 and actively recruit for another company, and reneg on the Airbnb internship if I get a start date around March 1, 2021 (risky, start career ASAP, involves more work, I'd have to reneg a company I really like)
* Option 2b: Take the Airbnb internship offer for Summer 2021 and actively recruit for another company with a start date around August 2021 (risky, delay full-time career by 5 months, involves more work)

""Involves more work"" isn't much of a factor, as I'm willing to put in the work. I've been really hesitant to turn down the Airbnb offer because I'm worried I won't land a company on that level to start my career (although I'm fairly confident I could later in my career). On the other hand, it seems very uncommon for people to do internships after graduating, and it would be delaying my full-time career for about half a year.

Could anyone offer some advice on which path I should pursue? Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

jd88r0,25,2020-10-17,"I am not an anti-work person, but a certain post in a different sub reminded me of a story that I thought maybe you guys get a kick out of.",Yungsleepboat,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jd88r0/i_am_not_an_antiwork_person_but_a_certain_post_in/,"I once did a junior bachelors in international green business, a course that was to teach me in running a global trade company in consumables. I had to do an internship two days a week.

I had trouble finding one, but a hardware store near my house had an opening for me on the gardening department.

I showed up for my interview, and had to start working directly after. The manager reiterated that it was an unpaid function, and that if I called in sick or was late three times in the year's financial quarter that I'd be fired. After a lack of any careful concideration I took the job. Not that any concideration would have changed the outcome of that day, as my options were set in stone.

I was prompted to change into my workers outfit. There are no changing rooms. Nor do they have outfits for 203cm tall people (my dad made me eat a lot of broccoli as a kid). The manager instructed a girl, slightly older and more seasoned in this line of work, to give me some XXXL gear, pilfering her of her early morning coffee. I looked like a clown to nobody's amusement, especially after changing clothes in the managers office right there with him since there were no changing rooms.

My casual wear is neatly gathered in a stack. Not that I much cared for their presentation, I was much more preoccupied with looking busy with something while the manager also pretended to be busy as not to make me feel watched, so I folded my clothes. I asked where the lockers are. ""Where are the lockers?""

""Six euros"" the manager answers.

The lockers were six euros. I did not have six euros to my posession. I was 16 and unemployed because was busy with college and internships. To my fortune, the manager was kind enough to let me purchase a plastic bag at the cash register for 35 cents. I had to carry my clothes around with me in a plastic bag.

A brittle plastic clock likely older than myself strikes 07:30 and my shift is about to start. All employees gather in front of the manager, who made his way to the cash registers and was standing on an improvised pedestal. It's almost christmass and so we're selling christmas trees, I expected as much. I drift off in my mind, preparing sales speeches.

When I felt the manager's speech coming to a close I suddenly snap back to reality. He's reading off some sales numbers that are completely arbitrary to me, though they might bear value to some of the workers. The older gentlemen in the workforce even look rewarded while these numbers are read aloud. I thought to myself that maybe they hit some ceiling in their career, and hearing the sales numbers may feel to them as if they advanced in some way. This made me feel sad and demotivated for the workday. Being tired didn't help either but I found some comfort in the fact that not a single soul in the room was well rested, except ofcourse that of the manager, of which it only then occured to me wasn't reading these sales figures, he had them memorized and spoke from his heart. This act, that was supposed to inspire motivated workers, did nothing but instill melancholy in me.

# 

The manager assigned me to one of the older men who earlier seemed so proud to hear the sales numbers, a senior floor worker, who seemed very eager to take me under his wing. I assumed this was because maybe he liked being in charge of someone for once, but I held some hope in the fact that maybe I was prejudiced by his bushy eyebrows and wrinkly face, and that maybe he just loved to teach and share his knowledge.

There was some solace to be found in the truth, which was that he was just happy to have someone to unload a menial task to, which was to occupy me for the coming 9 or so hours. ""It's better than having someone on my back commanding and controlling me like he has been looking forward to doing just that for some years"" I thought.

However that thought quickly faded when I discovered the nature of my Task. For the coming 9 hours I was to take a broom, and brush the rainwater out of the parkinglot, which was about 250m^2 all together. It should also be noted, that the Task was to be performed in the rain.

I did this without break or interruption until the end of my shift. Nobody went outside to me to tell me the day was up but I kept a sharp check on my watch throughout the entire day. My spine was reduced to a stack of pebbles, my fingers were white and I could feel my joints creak when I moved my fingers. My ears were red, but on the bright side, they were still attached to my head, which I often had to confirm by poking my head with my numb fingers. The rest of my flesh was frozen too, as my trousers that were big enough to fit a two children in each trouser leg did not isolate my warmth very well and a jacket wasn't part of the workers uniform either.

# 

My clothes in the plastic bag were soaked and covered in wet pine needles which somehow made it into the bag. I contemplated on how I *should have* bought a second bag to put over the bag, but I didn't feel as stupid when I realized that I did not have another 35ct to spend on the second bag in the first place. **Not even after a month of agonizing work like this would I be able to afford that second 35ct plastic bag**.

I quit the next day."

I went back to school for Software Development, and my degree path is fast tracked so I’ll be done with my second bachelors by next October. 

That doesn’t give me a lot of time to do an internship before I graduate, and although I’m learning fast I’m still a beginner. I want to start looking for full-time positions as a SWE as soon as I get out of school, I’m just worried thats unrealistic without a software internship on my resume. Anyone have a similar experience? 

It’s mostly the technical interviews I’m worried about. What are the main concepts I need to have down to have a chance at passing those?

jddx26,1,2020-10-18,My parents are never satisfied,lemon-phine,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/jddx26/my_parents_are_never_satisfied/,"I'm so annoyed.

Two weeks ago I had a job interview at a local company that builds airplane parts. I am still in school and I graduate last summer and I had been torturing myself with what I want to do after school for the past years. I did an internship there two years ago for three weeks and I was dreaming about working there ever since. They pay really well, the work  is interesting and it isn't too hard and it is in my hometown, which is very important to me since I don't want to move. Also, my partner works there as well. This company is the most popular among young people here because they pay so well. 
Some of my friends work there as well and their families were extremely excited when they got accepted. 
On Tuesday I received a letter from the company stating that they are happy to inform me that I can start the professional training as an airplane mechanic there next summer. I was so excited and happy, I haven't been this happy in years. I couldn't stop smiling. I immediately sent my parents the letter via text (my dad was at work and my mom doesn't live with us). When my partner came to pick me up, I ran outside and told him and he was just as excited as I was and hugged me and wanted to celebrate. 
My dad called me and said congratulations and all, but he wasn't too impressed. But my mom straight up texted me that she had hoped they wouldn't accept me since I'm ""overqualified"" for that job and she would want me to go to university. I'm so mad. They are never satisfied with anything. From the many people that applied for a job there, they chose me among a few others. If I can continue working there after my training, I will be earning quite a bit more than my dad while most of my friends my age will still go to university. 
Why can't my parents just be happy for me? This is career-wise literally one of the best things that could have happened to me. Why can't they just be satisfied? I don't want to become a doctor or a lawyer and go to university for several years. This way, I don't have to live just to work and still earn really well. 
My parents only ever exspected the absolute best from me and took everything for granted. 
This isn't fair."

I read through the things my professors work on, looked at previous theses they advised, read all information I found of them on possible future theses. I tried to make up my mind for the past months on which of them I would enjoy the most, but didn't come to a conclusion.

Today there are two options I want to decide between:

- send out two enquiries on whether these chairs (automata theory, simulation sciences) currently are open for applications and would like to schedule a meeting to discuss a possible thesis. Both have had theses I found interesting, both work on topics I like and a friend of mine will do her theses at one of them. On the other hand, I don't know a lot about these two chairs and am unsure if I will enjoy the topics enough. I would do this today, start with my thesis early and have the 6th semester free.

- wait till December when I've had lectures on three other topics (ml, graphics, complex networks) I might also enjoy and decide then if I want to work with one of those chairs. I might be more enthusiastic about their work, but interesting theses might be already taken (e.g. the ones from the first option) and I wouldn't have the free time in my 6th semester.

I'm looking for some second opinion on this. I'm hard working enough to make both things work, but how motivated I am will have a huge impact on my mental health and somewhat big impact on my grade. The free time would be great for internships, which students in my country rarely have time for. How certain about the topics where you when you applied for your theses?"

And where do I go from there?,TripleLeveragedPOS,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jdi904/did_i_mess_up_my_career_path_am_i_on_the_right/,"Hi everyone, I am 24 years old and graduated this May with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Finance and I am having trouble finding work (United States). I am asking any student or financial professional to give their opinion on my situation as to my past choices, current situation, suggestions for the future, or relate on any level with me from your own choices.  I have labeled this post with my past, what I do present day, then ask the question, what can be done to better myself tomorrow (Future). And finishing the post off with questions, some you can answer without reading my story.

**Past:**

Starting off with my education, I was very undecided my first 3 years at a community college. While, studying whatever was there, I took my first accounting and econ courses. I did not do poorly in school, but I retained possibly 0 information from those classes because I had no sense of direction in life. Leaving community college with an Associate of Arts and measly 3.0 GPA, I then transferred to a very small liberal arts college for some reason because my parents pushed me just to apply (I didn't like school). I finally declared myself a finance major my 4th year where I actually become enthralled by the finance courses I was taking. That was a shot in the dark because I could not imagine doing anything other than finance. Then graduated with a 3.5+ major GPA during my 5th year of school (3 years at community college, 2 years at a 4-year college).

As for my situation, because I was undecided, I never got an internship so I have no relevant work experience, and I have a BA degree which is different from a BS degree.  I don't know if that matters, or how different they are from one another.  I had a shot at a job as a tax analyst my 4th year of school but I ended up not getting the job.  I would say the only experience I have in finance is participating in this financial analysis challenge for my school which I thoroughly enjoyed doing.

If I could do it all again or at least change one thing, I would have gone to a bigger school.  My school is again, a small liberal arts school that has only 2000+ students enrolled. Luckily they had a finance department. Finding all of this out very late, a lot of networking has to do with your school.  I think you call a school like this a 'Non-Target', so the only connections I would find from LinkedIn are from the metropolitan area my school resides in. I don't mind working in the area, the only problem with that is it limits my options for potential relocations.

**Present:**

Anyways, I cannot for the life of me find a job in the field of finance, I want to break in as a financial analyst but everything requires experience, even the entry level jobs.  I will take almost any finance related jobs other than a Help Desk Analyst or a ""Financial Advisor"" like NWM or AXA Advisors.  I don't want to do scammy stuff like that or anything sales related. Not to say I would be a bad salesperson, but it is something I would NOT enjoy. I have relatives in sales and they are always between jobs. I don't know if this has anything to do with Coronavirus, as in making the job hunt more difficult, but it's frustrating not even hearing back from employers. I feel educated in the field and no one is giving me a chance. It seems like my only hope is from a recruiter I am currently in contact with.  I want to start as a financial analyst and possibly do equity research as like the ultimate goal, but I need to start somewhere.

In the mean time, I was told doing nothing is the worse thing to do, so I am studying for the CFA examination everyday. Waiting on my passport to arrive so I can register. I try to treat unemployed life as if I am employed. Sometimes I practice modeling on Excel or google how to incorporate new Excel skills to my repertoire. Occasionally apply for jobs, I am pretty burnt out at this point (Discouraged Worker). I also enjoy trading stocks and ETFs, mostly triple leveraged ETFs hence my username. I try to stay current in the financial world and read either my old subscription of WSJ provided by my school, or just browse finance stuff on Reddit in the mornings before studying. I've also considered coding, like with Python to extract data from financials. Studying is taking up most of my time right now so that'll have to wait.

Lastly, a brief emotional scan of myself in case anyone was wondering but probably not, I am not depressed nor do I have anxiety. I have no prior mental health issues aside from ADHD, but who doesn't have that these days. The only feeling I have is being behind, if that makes sense.  I don't think I'm a ""fuck up"", but I do believe my past choices have set me back. It's not fun living at home at 24.

**Future:**

The advice I am seeking is along the lines of, what more can I do to better myself and/or my situation, or give general advice to those who are in similar situations as me because I don't think mine is a unique one.  In hindsight, there is a ton of things I would have done differently, choosing finance is not one of those things. I believe finance was one of my better decisions that I've made.

Maybe I am applying for jobs incorrectly. I use the same resume for every job application, so do I rewrite my resume for each position? How does that work when I have no prior professional experience?

**Questions:**

* Is a BA in Finance worse off than a BS in Finance?
* What is the difference between a BA and BS degree?
* Did I shoot myself in the foot going to a small liberal arts school and study finance?
* Am I able to relocate from the state my small school resides in? (Small network pool)
* Is breaking in always this challenging?  Or is it because of my background and/or because of Coronavirus?
* At this point, is it a far fetch to break in as a Financial Analyst with my background?
* Adding to the previous question, are there smaller/similar roles that are better suited for me? (e.g Credit Analyst, do not even mention sales)
* What are some things that you guys and gals do to go above and beyond that employers look for?
* Any general tips and advice for improvement from here on out?

Thank you to those who took the time to read this. Sorry if this is the inappropriate tag for this kind of post or if this is an inappropriate post all together. I just need a sense of direction, something more to work towards. If anything does not make sense or is confusing chronologically, feel free to ask, I'll try to clarify.  Hopefully this does not violate rule 2 of this sub as low quality.  Otherwise, I will delete the post if it does."

I've done some research internships and taken a lot of courses through out my years in college.

However, when I look back on it, I really just enjoyed the parts of it where I had to write a program to solve a particular problem, or think of very real ways to approach something (not the big picture mindset).

Now is the time when I should be looking for PhD programs. But I find myself looking for alternatives, maybe because I hate reading papers, maybe because I feel I'll never make it as an academic or have a stable life, I don't know. 

So, it would be a great help if someone shares their experience if they went through something like this.

I'm also thinking about doing another masters in a field like data science or computer science. If anyone knows of such courses with which a switch is possible, do let me know.

TL; DR - Physics Masters student in India(willing to move anywhere), and looking for DS/CS course suggestion, any place where the fees are not... well... astronomical."

I'm a student at a state school that is known for their elementary and secondary education department but not so much for their computer science department, although it is pretty good. I've been applying like crazy the past month with two years of interning experience so I thought I might have got at least a single interview. The last two times I went to find an internship I only got one interview and ended up with an offer in that company luckily.

I recently got confirmation that fidelity completely ignored anyone applying from anywhere but top schools up until this year. I was wondering if anyone else could confirm this about any other large companies (mostly wondering about faang+).

I honestly don't think its my resume because I've had it reviewed by multiple people in my schools career services, current software engineers and technical recruiters I've come into contact with and they've said it all looks good. Just for reference [here is my resume](https://pdfhost.io/v/sjRf4sgak_Redacted_Resumepdf.pdf), but identifiable info and links are replaced."

The interviewer told me how to sum the elements in an Array. I just told him ""Well I'll do a foreach loop and sum each element in a variable"". He said he doesn't want to know how I implement it and said to simply explain to him logically how it's done and that it's pretty much University 101 stuff.

I tried again with different wordings and he said that's not it and then proceeded to show me how it's done. I STILL don't remember 100% what he did but: He drew a 1 column vertical table and stored each element in it, then said we take the first element and read it `arr[0] = Read` store it in a variable then return the element, then we take the next one and so on.

I felt so embarrassed, I just can't believe what I'm doing with my time, I'm self taught, not good enough I'll admit but not to the point that I don't know how to sum a fucking array.

What and where should I learn to improve in this?"

Ethnicity: Bengali 

Religion: Muslim 

Age: 16

State: NY

Sex: Male

Income: My dad’s income spiked sophomore year, making us low-income no longer. So like, 100k. Welp.

Fluent in Bangla (home language, ngl I forgot how to write it but I still count it bc I can read and speak it), English

LoR: I’m confident one is gonna be top tier, one is gonna be pretty good, and the last one might be a bit stale ngl so 9/10 since most colleges require 2 recs 

SAT: 1550

AP: 5 on World History and Environment Science, 3 on English Lit (kinda sad, I expected 4) and 4 on Comp Sci A

Average: ~96

HS: among the best in NYC; is that good nationwide? Idk. But it’s a decent school, tbh I didn’t like it in the beginning but it has grown on me.

ECs: MSA (Muslim student association) President for 2 years, pretty epic ngl, in MSA I met my first friends in Freshman year and stayed till the end 

German Honor Society for 2 years, pretty nice place, though it’s sort of a circlejerk at my school imo and not as good as it could’ve been. I’m pretty good at german. I aced my classes, and though my school doesn’t offer the AP, I can confidently say I’d get a 4+; I’ve been top of my class for 3 years in the subject and I really like it. 

I was part of JSA (junior statesmen of America) until quarantine; i was not rlly participating until sophomore year, and ngl it was a great experience for me. My teacher for USH was also the JSA counselor and I’m getting a rec from them bc they know me well so i hope it works

I had a job at Khan’s tutorial as intern, was gonna be an instructor but then quarantine happened, I’ve been working first as a volunteer beginning in Soph Summer, and then getting paid starting last September, over 220 hours worked there total, before quarantine of course. I got “laid off” I guess you could say. It’s a rlly nice place and I made a ton of connections. I’m tryna get a rec letter out of someone i know there, would that help? They are a current student at NYU (I want to go if I get good aid!)

I volunteered at the local library at my mom’s insistence I do something, but I eventually started liking it way more than I thought I would and now have an internship which has been going for a year almost. It’s actually really great and I sorta want to get a job there; idk. Like, maybe 100 hours there. I’ve represented the library at official events too. Well, a few. Fine, like 3. I felt pretty “famous” doing it, idk how else to say it with English words. I’m pretty committed. 

I have done a ton of work with a local organization called Grassroots Dawah, and incorporated their work with my school’s MSA. I think I did a good job with that. I’ve dedicated almost 200 hours of my time to this organization too, all before quarantine. We basically spread accurate views and literature about islam, yk, to combat stereotypes and all. 

My essays: oof. I’m not the best writer, I’m not the worst either though. Maybe average. I’m still writing them. Yes, ik, I’m a slacker. A little bit. It’s just rlly difficult for me.

What I’m looking for in a college: I prefer nearby. Open curriculum, with lots of choices; my interests are varied (programming, environmental science, history, public policy, economics, literature, foreign languages) and I want to try different choices before going towards a specific area.

What I’m gonna apply to: Columbia University, Harvard, NYU, UPenn, Stony Brook University, UConn, Macaulay Honors (Baruch and Hunter),  Tufts University, Wagner University, UBuffalo, Hofstra, RIT

1. Are my college choices good? I think they are okay. I’m absolutely bad at choosing colleges; if the selection is bad, please let me know.
2. What are my chances? At Harvard and Columbia especially?
3. Should I do early decision for any of the above 2 I just mentioned? I don’t want to, but, yk, parents. Yes, ik, parents aren’t everything, be independent, but still.

Edit: reasons to prefer Harvard: it has more choices, is considered “better” by my dad, and it’s very nice, I visited once.

Columbia: my mother prefers it, it’s nearer to where I’m doing most of my work (at KT, library, Grassroots Dawah, etc) and so i can maintain many things and grow them while at Columbia."

Currently, I am a little insecure about possible career paths, and I wanted to hear the opinion of internet strangers.

I was fortunate enough to recently intern at MBB consulting company as a data scientist. Somehow they liked me enough to give me an offer to return after I have completed my masters...
I enjoyed the company a lot, as well as the fast-paced projects we worked on. Nonetheless, hours can be rather long, and I don't believe I would progress the career later until making partner.
Therefore, I wanted to ask you how the exit opportunities are as an MBB data scientist, after 3-5 years? 
I would (of course, like every one else on this sub) favour large tech companies (i. E. DS roles or PM roles) . I am a little unsure though, if they wouldn't see the previous role as ""not technical enough"".

Let me know your thoughts, and I appreciate your time for answering :)"

also, since i’m doing online school this year i don’t know any of my teachers so that’s not an option...

I am doing my final project to get my practicum mark (because covid, it is hard to find a place i can intern at so my school made up a practicum course for me to complete) and i would like some help on things that i am missing for my project.

I am starting up a new office on a business that is recently expanding. So i am tasked to make up an office infrastructure. So far I've got to make certain decisions on what i should do to start up a new office.

I have to use cisco's packet tracer so I have the basics of CLI (Like setting up DHCP servers, security measures and trunking  from the top of my head). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started making a list of things i need and what kind of infrastructure i need to make. please this is just the stage 1 phase and i am just doing initial planning. I have fellow classmates i can collaborate to but so fat this is just my end on what i came up with.

&amp;#x200B;

Company: ABC Company – **a Mail Delivery Service**: a Company that expands country wide. Has 2 warehouses/offices. **One year old, recently expanding**

\- **Main Office/Main Warehouse**: Vancouver, BC Canada

\- **Warehouse/sub-office**: Edmonton, Alberta

**SOHO?**

**Items in need:**

**Licenses –** Windows server, workstation,  

**- RFID Scanner**: To scan the parcels that has customer’s personal information

\- **Wireless Access Points**

**Servers:**

**- DHCP Server:** Has many workstations that need to send information across the network

\- **Mail Server/FTP Server**: Immediately sending information scanned from parcels to sub-office and main office.

\- **Security Server/Systems**: ID card scanners to punch-in and enter the building.

\- **File server**: Hold employees information

&amp;#x200B;

This is just the bare bones of what i got, I've recently got this project basically not 20 minutes ago and i am currently discussing this with my classmates."

This has accelerated my plan to leave in a year to in 3 months. I'm financially secure having about  10k saved for  the move to a bigger city.

I'm looking for some guidance in what job's I should seek. So here is a summary of my revelant info in chronological.

Worked as an intern for 1 year at a library as tech support. Big accomplishments automating an update procedure that would update every machine at once. Setting up an IDS.

Worked at a nonprofit organization as helpdesk for 8 months let go due to budget cuts. Big accomplishments serving my coworkers with kindness  and respect and enforcing password policies. Writing an update guide.

Started teaching college level computer classes lasted about 5 years. Big accomplishments 80% pass rate known for being tough but fair and willing to work with students. Also making class interesting. Helping students and basically other soft skills.

I'm comptia network plus certified, security plus certified. I have a  security lab/network lab in my home running on a labtop as vms and Pi boxes.
I have a bachelor's degree in computers.

I'm afraid to put older jobs because it would make it clear that I'm not a young adult but a 30s man. Age discrimination is a big fear in IT.

So any advice on what kind of jobs I should seek?
Any advice on skills or training I might want to do?

One problem I need to avoid physically intense jobs so no construction or on your feet for hours. I damaged my spine awhile back and while I have made improvements such as no longer needing a cane or such I'm still struggling to make it on my feet for hours without sitting down regularly.

i dont know how to do school anymore. i simply cannot handle it. i'm a senior (that will be taking an extra year) who has had a very troubled school experience. i have gone part time and taken medical leave in the past because of being hospitalized and getting treated for my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder. now i'm recovered from my eating disorder since that's what my treatment focused on but my depression and anxiety have never left me and i'm struggling to keep up in life again. 

first i was enrolled in 2 of my major classes and one minor elective. i dropped the minor elective (and the minor, for now) because the course difficulty was off the charts and i was completely unprepared. so i swapped it for some ""easy"" GE full of freshman so it couldnt be that bad, right? well wrong, i was a week and a half behind when i got in and i missed 220 points worth of assignments and attendance. so even if i got 100% in everything, i'd still only be able to get a 78% and let's be real, there's no fucking way i'd be able to get 100% in everything. the course material is mostly physics which i have never taken because my shitty high school never offered it which i didnt know when i enrolled because it was never mentioned in the syllabus or course description. then suddenly, on all the homeworks, i had to know physics to complete it. 

so i'm trying to get the documentation to go part time again, but since my therapist dropped me over summer because she felt like i wasnt getting any better and i have not been able to find another therapist, my documentation that the school had was voided. so all of my disability accommodations and qualification for part time is gone and i have to get new documents. the deadline to sumbit for part time is wednesday and it's sunday. i have an appointment to see someone from my schools health center on monday but they failed to inform me that this person is an intern and is virtually powerless in my situation. so i dont know what the fuck im going to do. i already changed my enrollment in the class to pass/fail but i cant do the work to even get a pass at this point. i have 2 jobs and before anyone asks, i tried to qualify for part time using the fact that i work 30 hours a week as an excuse but they wouldnt take it because i work 15 hours a week at each job which is less than their ""minimum"" of 25. so i need to get it based on my health instead. 

i feel so hopeless. this school is going to be the death of me. i think about dropping out every time i open my books or my laptop to work. on top of everything i am prone to chronic migraines so sometimes i wont even get 30 minutes into a lecture before staring at the screen causes me to be in complete agony for hours or even days. I had to watch 4 hours of lectures (2 2 hour classes) this past thursday and i was involuntarily crying the whole time because my head hurt so bad. when i ended the day it was the worst pain of my life. i took excedrin but i was still in so much pain i thought i might puke or pass out. im usually never on the computer for this long and ive tried the glasses, the screen dimmers/filters etc and nothing works. if i use it for more than an hour im guaranteed a headache at bare minimum. so im kind of fucking myself right now because i can feel the pressure building in my head but i just need to get this out.

ive tried to talk to the disability people at my school. i was on the phone with them for 45 minutes on friday but everybody says their fucking hands are tied. i tried to go to my professors and ask for anything, any extension, any possibility that i can handwrite/upload, have extra time to do quizzes, literally anything but they all say their hands are all tied. it makes me feel like im drowning, i feel like i have weights on my feet dragging me down and im SCREAMING for anything, any help, just someone to care, please at the very least just fucking NOTICE me and ACKNOWLEDGE that i am suffering right now and cut the shit they theres totally nothing that can be done for me. its like everyone would rather see me drown. one less email in their inbox, one less uncomfortable phone call where you have to pretend to care, one less person in the class asking questions when everyone else seems to understand. 

i dont know what im going to do. we are only on week 3 and this is the worst academic stress i have ever faced. not to repeat what everyone already knows but WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. expectations of us have not changed and we are forced to do it all online. everyone says its so easy! canvas is so easy, zoom is so easy and intuitive! it's fun! it's different! we make it work! but ITS NOT WORKING. ITS NOT WORKING. I REPEAT IT IS NOT FUCKING WORKING. just to stay on top of my assignments, i have to check my email, my spam sometimes, canvas files, canvas assignments, canvas modules, canvas announcements, zoom, yuja, piazza, gradescope, m-h connect, google drive, google classroom, hypothesis, and 4 online textbooks. this is absolutely absurd, i dont care how tech savvy you are. please understand that it is unacceptable to not have a single common platform from which to view and submit work. i can't keep up and i cant handle it. 

i cant take a leave because im already going to have to take a 5th year to make up for my past missed coursework. i cant imaging having to stay at this godforsaken school for fucking 6TH YEAR. and im not crazy intelligent so i cant drop out and start a business or whatever. at this point i honestly think i might just not be meant to be alive. i feel like a constant burden to everything and everyone and i'll never be fully self sufficient. it makes me feel like a fucking idiot. i dont know what to do anymore. i sometimes get stuck in loops of thinking i should just kill myself but im not gonna fucking do that. honestly? i like who i am. i believe that school aside i am a pretty smart person. i have great common sense, i am empathetic, i am emotionally intelligent and kind. other than the chronic migraines i am healthy and it took me so long to get here. i went from starving myself to the point of near death to binging uncontrollably but with time and consistent effort despite the discomfort i have reached a point where i am fit, active, strong, and healthy, no longer plagued by thoughts of food and my body, or compulsive exercise or purging. and for all that im grateful. i've worked too hard to give up now. i have so much going for me right now and the only thing weighing me down is school. 

the thing is school just has a way of defining your whole life. i need it to get a career, i need a career to make money, i need money to afford the cost of living, etc etc. it all comes down to having to just suck it up and do well in school for 2 more years. but i dont know if i can. school wasnt meant for people like me. i know other students are stressed but they don't get so anxious they become paralyzed. they dont get headaches so bad they puke. they dont get so depressed that they have to live another day just to spend it on zoom that they fantasize about killing themselves the whole 8 hours they should be catching up on sleep. when im not in school i actually pass as a functional person! i go to work, i do my chores, i run my errands, i engage with others and in my hobbies. school just turns me into a fucking wreck and a sad excuse for a human being. it's so sad because i actually love learning. i was always the most curious kid growing up and still, even now i just have an unshakeable curiosity for everything. i want to learn. so i dont know what to do. i dont know if ill get approved for part time. im probably going to fail one or more of my classes this semester. maybe that will be a relief though. it's gonna be confusing for me to throw this in at the last minute but i've made the deans list every quarter since i came to school for every semester i've taken a full course load. maybe i need to fail just to know i still can and it won't be the end of the world for me. when grades get published im not going to suddenly combust if i see an NP on my record. i'll see it and move the fuck on. i'll take another round of classes next semester and try again. repeat as long as it takes to get my degree and get out. and if any future employers or schools want to know, man what the fuck happened to you in 2020? how do you explain how bad you did? then i have no words. it speaks for itself. 2020 has been a shitshow of a year. 2020 doesnt encapsulate who i am as a student and as a person. 2020 doesnt mean shit. 2020 can suck my ass because i'm going to show up to 2021 in spite of it all ready to keep on going whether that means success or failure. i'll keep failing for the rest of my life if i have to but im not giving up, and thats a promise. 

but right now my fucking head hurts. it's a sunday night so im giving myself a tiny break but tomorrow morning im going to get back on the phone, write those emails, whatever the fuck i need to do to get the support i need right now. because i deserve it or something like that. and if i don't get it? fuck them. fuck the admin, fuck professors, fuck em all. it's not the end of the world if/when i fail and imma still be the same great person. none of my achievements and successes will go away from one dumb failure.

love you guys, if you made it this far then damn im sorry i guess lol. take it easy and if you're in school right now and feeling the stress you're not alone. im right there with you and we are gonna get through this shit no matter what."
jdt069,2,2020-10-18,New Approach or Walk Away?,ANAP_Rocky,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jdt069/new_approach_or_walk_away/,"Hello all,

Just some background before I get into my real question, I never studied finance in undergrad and had very low to no interest in the field before/during my internship/employment with one of the top firms. I was GIVEN an internship my junior and senior of college by my uncle, which I took because I had no other opportunities. After seeing the my uncle's and his top client's net worth I realized how lucrative a career I hated could be. Each day consisted of cold calling an endless list of companies and I inevitability became decent at ""sales"". Before the end of my senior year of college I was offered an FAA position with my uncle's group where I was required to pass the SIE, Series 7, and Series 66. I was warned up front I would get one attempt at the SIE and 7 and 2 max at the 66. Having never studied or really applied myself in school and only putting in real effort at various paid jobs throughout high school and college I was unaware what it would take to pass any of the professional exams.

I was able to pass the SIE by frantically reading the STC book, taking over 40 full practice exams, and god's gift that is Investopedia. I had no plan before beginning studying, I just showed up and from 8-6 everyday and let my fear that I would fail drive me to not take my eyes off the material. After passing the SIE, my anxiety of failure began to drop and I was told I would become one of two brokers for his top client pending my exam results. I soon started calculating how much I could realistically profit my first year out of college and was almost brought to tears. I spent a majority of high school and college working/applying to internships because I was hell bent on becoming successful/rich, I had thought it would bring me happiness and still do. When I began studying for the 7 I had noticed it covered most the same info it just went a little bit I deeper than the SIE. After passing my first exam I gained a sense of false confidence and really only skimmed the 7 book. I was given almost a month and a half to prepare and failed the 7 by 5 points. I was let go by the firm the following business day. Three months later after reaching out to multiple recruiters and spending 9-5 m-f applying to jobs in marketing/fashion (what I had studied in college) I was unsuccessful at finding a new full time salaried position. A finance recruiter reached out to me and connected me with 3 insurance/finance companies willing to sponsor me for whatever exams I wanted but couldn't offer any guaranteed money. I took a job with an independent bd with mostly insurance based reps. I had no intentions of learning anything my employers taught me because from day one they were pushing me to call everyone in my and my mother's phone book to try to sell them insurance. Oh yeah I passed the life, accident, and health exam before being hired. It was nothing compared to the 7 and I took it way before I was ready, only passing by a point or 2.

After 6 months at the new firm I had added 3 advisory clients to my boss's book and wrote a few insurance policies for family, friends, and a warm lead. I understand thats not a lot of business for a 6 months but for a majority of the work day I was simply pretending I was calling family/friends and really studying. During this time I was also still on the job hunt in a completely different field and was connecting, emailing, and interviewing with folks in the marketing field but was unsuccessful at landing a job. I was doing 3 things at once and was unsuccessful at all 3 as a result. I had no long term or method to how I was going to achieve my goals, I was simply waking up every day and trying the hardest I could (not much thought, just do). I took the Series 7 twice while at the 2nd firm and I failed with a horribly low score the first try due to an anxiety attack and failed the second time by 4 points.

Just some background before I get into my real question, I never studied finance in undergrad and had very low to no interest in the field before/during my internship/employment with one of the top firms. I was GIVEN an internship my junior and senior of college by my uncle, which I took because I had no other opportunities. After seeing the my uncle's and his top client's net worth I realized how lucrative a career I hated could be. Each day consisted of cold calling an endless list of companies and I inevitability became decent at ""sales"". Before the end of my senior year of college I was offered an FAA position with my uncle's group where I was required to pass the SIE, Series 7, and Series 66. I was warned up front I would get one attempt at the SIE and 7 and 2 max at the 66. Having never studied or really applied myself in school and only putting in real effort at various paid jobs throughout high school and college I was unaware what it would take to pass any of the professional exams.

I was able to pass the SIE by frantically reading the STC book, taking over 40 full practice exams, and god's gift that is Investopedia. I had no plan before beginning studying, I just showed up and from 8-6 everyday and let my fear that I would fail drive me to not take my eyes off the material. After passing the SIE, my anxiety of failure began to drop and I was told I would become one of two brokers for his top client pending my exam results. I soon started calculating how much I could realistically profit my first year out of college and was almost brought to tears. I spent a majority of high school and college working/applying to internships because I was hell bent on becoming successful/rich, I had thought it would bring me happiness and still do. When I began studying for the 7 I had noticed it covered most the same info it just went a little bit I deeper than the SIE. After passing my first exam I gained a sense of false confidence and really only skimmed the 7 book. I was given almost a month and a half to prepare and failed the 7 by 5 points. I was let go by the firm the following business day. Three months later after reaching out to multiple recruiters and spending 9-5 m-f applying to jobs in marketing/fashion (what I had studied in college) I was unsuccessful at finding a new full time salaried position. A finance recruiter reached out to me and connected me with 3 insurance/finance companies willing to sponsor me for whatever exams I wanted but couldn't offer any guaranteed money. I took a job with an independent bd with mostly insurance based reps. I had no intentions of learning anything my employers taught me because from day one they were pushing me to call everyone in my and my mother's phone book to try to sell them insurance. Oh yeah I passed the life, accident, and health exam before being hired. It was nothing compared to the 7 and I took it way before I was ready, only passing by a point or 2.

After 6 months at the new firm I had added 3 advisory clients to my boss's book and wrote a few insurance policies for family, friends, and a warm lead. I understand thats not a lot of business for a 6 months but for a majority of the work day I was simply pretending I was calling family/friends and really studying. During this time I was also still on the job hunt in a completely different field and was connecting, emailing, and interviewing with folks in the marketing field but was unsuccessful at landing a job. I was doing 3 things at once and was unsuccessful at all 3 as a result. I had no long term or method to how I was going to achieve my goals, I was simply waking up every day and trying the hardest I could (not much thought, just do). I took the Series 7 twice while at the 2nd firm and I failed with a horribly low score the first try due to an anxiety attack and failed the second time by 4 points. I did pay about $800 in tutor fees before my second attempt but I feel I may have not gotten the full bang for my buck because I only had her review specific questions with my in 1 hour intervals a few weeks leading up to the test.

The problem is that I think I can get better jobs and I'm still very early in the process with other companies. Most importantly, I don't even know where this internship will be. There are three possible locations, one of which is downtown Chicago, but the others are in the middle of nowhere.

I am getting 60s and 80s inconsistently and I don't think I will end this course with something more than a B. I am so discouraged because I am also applying for a bunch of internships (FBU, UberStar ,...) and I haven't seen much positivity. Sometimes I feel like I am too stupid for CS and maybe it isn't for me. But I genuinely love coding and want to use it to greater applications...

I'll get straight to the point, I am a 2018 graduate and none internships and work experience. I really didn't need to work until now and was exploring my other interests and I am currently enrolled in the Database and Analytics program at a govt college.

I am really much confused about what to do and how should I prepare myself for the job world, I really like data science and AI, I get it that I have to build projects based on data science to showcase my knowledge but I have no idea what I should work on.

I have good programming knowledge in python and AWS also ( thinking of getting the certification too )

I only have six months remaining of my course and I need to start building my portfolio asap

PS- I want to move to Canada and I am 24 YO if that is of any concern.

any help in the right direction I will be thankful"
jdu39d,3,2020-10-18,Searching for an internship as someone who recently switched majors &amp; transferred universities,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jdu39d/searching_for_an_internship_as_someone_who/,"So to keep it short, I recently transferred from a large public university where I was pursuing a CS degree to a smaller private university with a solid business program. I'm now majoring in finance and I will pick up a minor in CS.

I'm trying to look for internship opportunities for Summer 2021- I'm interested mainly in Corporate Finance positions (my sister went down this route and is doing well in her career now). I'm a bit intimated, I don't have any work or internship experience thus far, and I don't want to fall behind. I've joined the Student Finance Association as well as the Entrepreneurship club at my university and I've spoken to our career center to try so I can get myself aimed in the right direction. What can I do to try to secure an internship, I really don't want to fall too far behind and end up with a finance degree and no experience (I've seen how bad that can go).  I'm doing very well in my courses thus far, and I've gotten semi-involved in clubs, but that's all I've done here thusfar.

One good thing about transferring is that I can delay my graduation by a semester so I have two summers to intern. Am I behind and should I be worried? Please give any advice. "
jdu6l1,1,2020-10-18,Is this too much work? Am I being overworked?,Waffles38,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/jdu6l1/is_this_too_much_work_am_i_being_overworked/,"Edit: The answer is yes, we are understaffed, well, based on a coworker but I think that's the best answer I can get. I may delete this post.

Edit2: My employer is slowly fixing the problem and I am happy about it

I hate my job, it's retail, I do maintenance I guess. I feel like I am being overworked, I can always barely meet the demand at my job but it's so hard, and my coworkers are also often unable to (take in mind that lately we are not put to work together, when we are working together we are able to fulfill our duties). I am paid minimum wage, I work part time, it takes me two months to make $400 I think.

A duty I have is to get carts in front of the store. All the cars are gone if I go for my break (15 minutes). I seem to always bring a lot of cars, and I seem to do a very good job comparing myself to others, but it also seems like there's never any progress, and at times there's a risk of causing damage due to how many carts I have to carry to meet demand.

Another duty I am being given, if someone else is put to do carts, it's to always keep sanitized tissues at the front door, so the customers clean their carts. Ironically, this is a lot harder. At the same time I have to greet customers(I am like a tape recorder sometimes), I have to make sure they are wearing masks, I have to pull paper and rip it off, I have to spray them, I have to always have extra paper so I have time to refill the bottles or get more paper (I have to walk all the way to the other side of the store for that). There's never enough tissues, the janitor was surprised at how fast I was at doing this, all I am doing by having extra tissues is getting time or preparing for the worst, a bunch of people coming in at the same time and taking multiple tissues. This job is so hard because I have too many responsabilities and too many things to do at once, there had been times where I was reprimanded for not telling someone to wear a mask, but I don't even notice sometimes because I am too busy doing everything else (or worse, maybe I wasn't even there).

Today was a very bad day and today is not gonna be the only day like this.... today the managers expected the store to reach maximum capacity (I guess not just because of covid, but also this is a precaution in case of a fire. All buildings have a maximum capacity I think.) Now I have the added responsability of keeping note of how many people are inside, pressing a button when people entered and when people left. All the while there's an even higher demand, and I can't make tissues while I count people coming in and out. Then I have to stop people until someone leaves the store so we are not at maximum capacity. My device ran out of battery or something and tough luck! Now I have to keep count myself, speaking out loud, while customers think I am a mad man. How did I refill my supply if I had to keep track of the people coming in? Only once I had to ask someone on the radio to do my job for a few minutes, I mean, my partner was pissed that I kept asking him to do it whenever I had to leave. At one point I gave up on keeping count because the device died and a lot of people were leaving anyways. It was never possible to meet demand, especially due to the pauses I had to take to count people coming in and out.

Anyways, am I being overworked? Because I feel like I am, and when doing carts you should have two people outside, and when making tissues you need to have someone else keep count (It's still too much work, but I am not sure if you need two people making tissues).

Sure, for tissues I get two 30 minute breaks. But I am paid minimum wage. Is this really worth it?

At first I was holding on to post this, why? Because people say deal with it if you hate your job (and it's not your career), but fuck it, I am a pussy, call me a pussy, embarrasing but fuck it. I can't take this. I am posting this. I need to know if this is fair or normal for people. I spent the rest of my day fallen asleep at bed because of how tired I felt. I am pressured by my college too because I owe homework by tomorrow and I can't even use my pc because it's occupied doing a task. I hate my life now because I am 19 and I am losing hope on being able to be happy, at this point I feel like I have to be an online entertainer in order to be happy but you know how long that takes? At least people say I am good at it. I feel like shit, and I even feel depressed now, and today was sort of like my breaking point. All I wanted to do is sleep for the rest of my life and I slept for the entire day today (unintentionally, I wad watching youtube, I don't think I even got through the first minute of a video before falling asleep). I don't want this to be my life, and sure I am studying a nice well paying career, but it's not a passion, I am not happy doing it, it's just something I am good at. Worse, with the company not caring at all about my performance and unlikely to promote me because companies think with numbers? So, is this my life now? For what? Nothing. I literally don't have anything that makes this worth it. Then why live? You think this is ok? I am not going to fucking live a life that makes me want to kill myself, what I am living through right now makes me want to kill myself, please tell me this is not normal. I want to live, not just be a slave. Every second I am breathing is hurting me right now.

Why do I need to know? If I am being overworked, I am going to quit my job. Why is this maybe a good decision? Because I only need to work like this for 7 months more. After that, I need to take internships for my career. I had only been working here for 3 months (only 1 month doing tissues though). I don't feel compensated for doing this madness, and I am constantly frustrated by the company not making sure that clients are provided with carts and tissues. My motto is to not work for a company but for the people, because if we stop caring about strangers and we do the bare minimum the world goes mad. That's why it frustrates me that the company is not doing enough. I can't expect a promotion anywhere in 7 months. Because of this, I believe quitting is fine, I am gonna get a job where I am not going to have this much work.... right? I don't know. You guys know, maybe. I'll see if I can get good money by typing fast, I can do more than 88 wpm. I think that's pretty good. If I am not being overworked, I hope I can get advice on me hating my life, or for someone to tell me to suck it up. I will really want to kill myself if I don't see any signs of being able to make progress in the following years. What's the goal? to not be miserable, maybe focus on a passion once I am old or make enough money that gets me time. It doesn't have to be something as unattainable as youtube or twitch tbh, it can be anything.

I wish I could make a TL;DR, but I can't, I am not sure of what things people don't need to know.

This is a long rant, I am sorry"

Long story, but really need a piece of advice.",overthinker1or2,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jduwaa/does_it_worth_to_exdiplomat_to_start_finance/,"I am 28 years old guy from post soviet country. Got my B.B.A degree from local university- which didn’t teach very much (But I was always self learner and initiator, so time spent well). Then I got my M.A in International relations and got professional diplomatic internships in Brussels and worked in other key places, have been involved into politics. But never liked it that much, don’t even know how it happened. So for that reason I wanted to be back into more corporate environment and last year I was graduated from MSc International Business program of well known UK university. Program was very broad, general, I thought it would be soft transition. Besides that I always had entrepreneurial soul, have been involved into tons of projects, launched startup and did a lot of business and finance related stuff. So since the start of pandemic I felt lack of technical skills I have  and also I have decided to deeply dive into finance career and become an financial analyst. For that reason I have registered for CFA Level 1. I thought as it is hard (due to pandemic)  to find internship jobs and practice being an analyst, now it would be better to have profound achievement -like passing CFA L1 (together with my education and experience) for finding an analyst job in western countries (mainly UK). Sorry for making it very long, so in my 28 I just took my life and changed it dramatically, I gave up my political career, gave up my personal business projects and teaching career (I also was an instructor for one semester) for becoming financial analyst. I really enjoy while learning CFA material, learning many stuff about finance and with my political economy knowledge and experience in startups I do now understand things more clearly and it makes me believe that with my mixed background, multicultural values, multilingual skills and adding new deeper quantitative and qualitative finance learnings(CFA), I might become a valuable analyst for corporations. So, here is the question - My only fear is that- I am afraid being too late. People normally start their analyst career just after finishing undergraduate (22’s) and until 28 they already become full analyst (sometimes associate) and then go for MBA. I really afraid of being late and unsuccessful in this career path just because of my start time. The thing is that I always believed that my age of 20’s is time for trying many things and then at the end to find out yourself, so that is why it took time to self determine myself. Also, there are many ideas that finance may disappear as a career in next couple of decades because of technological advancement. 
So considering these all and plus stress of the pandemic, now I am really confused and need some good advice and clarity."

Bc of the heavy load of work, I haven't been sleeping, and eating, and I love food. But I can't eat it. 

I tired to go to the university's therapy office, and finance office. And they told me they couldn't really help me and the financial office told me, that ""you worked hard for your scholarships, but some people worked harder, maybe you should have done the same, and worked harder"" when my finacial aid didn't cover the all expenses for this school semester. 

Ik college doesn't value you as a person, only as a wallet, but I didn't expect the people that worked there to treat me like one too.

Ontop of that my school, is making us find internships for the next semester, and orginally if you don't get an internship, you'll have to repeat a year in order to graduate. But they'll let us do a self-learning thing instead. But the stress is killing me bc I'm paying thousands of dollars for them to tell me, ""go fetch"". And I still have to give my school money for my intern-ship semester, if I get paid for it or not!!!!

During an pandemic!!!!

I dont expect for them to do the work for me, but like shouldn't I have a list to choose from atleast and prove my worth, I don't have connections, that's the point of college, that college has the connections for you. ;-; 

I still want to do animation, but I don't think I'll be able to supoort myself financially when I graduate. And I don't want to be a burden to my family. I can't drop out bc I'll have a bunch of student loans to pay back with no degree for it, but I don't want to stay here anymore. It's so stressful. What should I do?

Any advice would be most appreciated."
jdwgts,6,2020-10-19,How is the MS in CS? UCF vs UF?,GreyPhantom77,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/jdwgts/how_is_the_ms_in_cs_ucf_vs_uf/,"Hey guys i am interested in applying for MS in CS  fall 2021( India).  I am interested in Machine learning ,Deep learning and  some  computer  vision.I am interested in pursuing internships/jobs in  those areas  during summer/post MS and not much into research,more into a project option. 

I am searching for univs  that are moderate or safe( currently i have shortlisted 5-7 univs :2 moderate, 2 safe, 1-3 ambitious). According to csrankings it looks like UCF has more activity/faculty in my interested areas than UF and UF is a bit expensive and moreover i hear that location wise UF is not that good. I am serious about doing internships and OPT in ML related areas so location matters i guess.

Can anyone tell me the pros and cons of these two univs and also the pedagogy like is it more hands on or theory?"

I go to a top CS school where all the gaming companies heavily recruit. So, i have internships in chemE, but no experience with CS. How can i best secure an internship for the summer and set myself up for a software dev role at a company like Raven software? 

I’d describe myself as a novice programmer at the moment, but by the schoolyr-end i’ll have taken programming, algorithms, machine learning, computation structures. So basically i’ll be better equipped to apply for internships/ pass coding challenges in spring. Next (5th) yr I’ll be able to take courses more specific to gaming like Computer Graphics. Will a most likely rando CS internship combined with great programming skills but minimal experience otherwise be enough to get into those types of companies?

I largely work with images even though I’m inclined towards numeric data and the data science aspect. I’m expected to build whole ass deep learning models even though I’m just an Intern.

jdxj3p,1,2020-10-19,Where is life headed to?,lostdirectionless,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jdxj3p/where_is_life_headed_to/,"Hello fellow friends, 

I don't know what to say and I don't know what to write. That's the story of my life. I am one messed up person who isn't progressing anywhere in life. I have good education and I am quite smart (I hate to say this but I am very good at picking up a lot of things quickly). But I am going nowhere. My life is rotten, my friends are nowhere to be seen and I am in my mid 20s sitting at home unemployed. 

I accept personal responsibility that I have truly screwed up a fair few times in the past when it came to university, internships and even extracurriculars. I wish I could go back and change but I have only recently realised that I have anxiety and have suffered from ADD all my life. I am not sure whether to seek help or not because frankly, I am hopeless. Sometimes when I step outside, I seriously wish that I end up in a road accident of some sort and I die. I am quite religious and still believe in my faith but I am struggling very badly to hold it together. I have so many hopes and dreams and I am so ambitious and I still believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel but I am close to giving up on digging the tunnel any further. 

I do want to acknowledge that perhaps, I'm in a slightly better position than many of you financially. I am nowhere close to rich but my parents can support me just about. But even they think I am a loser at the end of the day, maybe not entirely but their patience is wearing thin. 

I don't have friends, never been in a proper relationship and haven't been able to find a job for at least 5 years now. When people say that times will change for the better, I don't think they anticipate it going on for this long.

I am on the verge of giving up altogether. I won't even wish this life onto anyone else. 

The only thing I wish for is for a friend like me."
jdxvre,7,2020-10-19,Look for an internship or short-term contract/freelance for the summer when already having 2 years of work experience and currently doing a masters?,MrGommo,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/jdxvre/look_for_an_internship_or_shortterm/,"My original intent was to proceed with a masters straight after I finished my bachelors degree in CS in 2018. I did in an internship as part of my degree, and my plans changed and I staid afterwards at the same company as a fulltime developer. Due to the pandemic my job position was terminated in September, so I've decided to go back to grad school to take up my masters (expecting to graduate in June 2022).

I'm looking for what kind of gig/internship I could do during summer 2021, July-September, about ten weeks till three months). Although I have some work experience (fullstack, although I prefer backend), but I feel like I have still a pretty junior profile. I think this'll will limit the feasibility of shortterm freelance contracts. 

I'm currently located and studying in Belgium, although I worked and lived in London for those two years. I'm open to relocate to anywhere in Europe.

Should I look for a short-term contract, or should I try to find a decent internship?"

Perhaps it was because I was younger and it boosted my self-esteem? I would apply to lots of places and got internships and even a really great job doing social media work. 

In fact, I was even making money streaming music online and making money podcasting. 

I’m assuming a lot of you probably had tons of projects that you’ve started gained a little bit of traction but, for some reason, didn’t end up panning out. 

I have commitment issues for sure. I can’t stick to one thing. I keep switching to project after project. But lately, I haven’t even been doing any projects because I turned 26 and started having to pay for my own insurance—which resulted in not being able to afford my adhd medication. 

I’ve been paying over more a month for half of what I used to get under my parents plan. So—I’ve just been out of energy and out of money. 

I stream on Twitch now—but I make very very little money doing so. Like dollars a week. And I work part time at a library. But, I feel as if I’m inevitably going to lose my job. 

I don’t make any money streaming music anymore and feel super anxious about it now. 
Partly because, perhaps, I will tell my supervisor I’ll stream a show and then cancel last minute and feel anxiety about talking to him? 

I’ve gone back to streaming music multiple times and my supervisor always welcomes me back, but I inevitably feel as if the next time I try to come back the platform is going to say no thank you? I can’t even hold a job even if it’s singing and playing guitar in front of a camera from home. 

Well, that was perhaps one of the most discombobulated configuration of words I’ve ever pieced together. I think I might have just needed to vent my unordered and non-sensical thoughts out into the open. With any luck, they will float away into the Reddit abyss far far from my unconscious mind."

I have some ambitions and I can't see myself living with a shitty salary whatsoever, so, as a Portuguese citizen, living here will probably go against my ideals. Don't get me wrong though, Portugal is an amazing country, but now situation and CoL is getting out of hand. 

So you can have an idea, minimum salary here is 600€, and rents for T1 apartments are around 400-600€. So this means that even if you work full time and earn minimum wage, it's impossible for you to be independent. 

As a newly graduated student in SE, you're expected to start earning 700-900€, so as for me it's still ridiculous, that even companies like Mercadona, and to be a cashier pays around the same. Obviously working as a SE will get you some increases along the years, but still, this is not a decent salary if I want to have a nice house, nice car, nice vacations, etc. And I'm ready to leave my country if I have to so I can get all of that.

I've heard about Switzerland, Germany and USA, but well, having big salary doesn't mean you can save much if the CoL is extremely high as in Switzerland. So I was hoping someone could give me some real life example, or from past/present experiences, so I can have some hints and decide which path to go when I finish my uni. I might even consider doing my internship in one of the countries that might be ideal for me if it's worth it.

Besides the money, I also take in consideration the fun I can have in the city/the weather, and how nice people are. 

Any suggestions?"

The problem is, iam the youngest of my brothers and I think in everywhere the youngest one is the most spoiled and most loved,will that have been certainly my case.

All my family loved me and they were overprotective of me ,and I've gotten used to the easy life of just everything at hand and whenever something happens I could air out my problem whenever possible even if it's a stupid one.

I don't want to blame my parents of what they did but I guess some of the blame goes to them, the consequences of all this that iam now 23M who does have no personality or opinions in whatsoever , lost in life doing whatever I want to do and iam also beggining to cultivate this childish attitude of always complaining and doing nothing with my life, as if I live a fairy tale waiting for whomever to come rescue me and love me unconditionally what ever I do.

I see people around me even my friends they are beggining to take life seriously and going to internships and jobs and whatever , so I have got some social phobia also because now there is no a material of communication between me or anybody , I feel like I just want in my life is people to treat me with friendliness and always give me compliments while I do nothing.... hilarious right?

So I searched about it and I figured out I have something called dependent personality disorder and iam also an highly sensitive person(HSP)  , I don't what to do I feel like my life is going straight to hell because I finished college from July and I have been sitting my ass off at home with depression, to worsen things alot my mom the angel of my life is dieing of cancer and I can't stand one day with the pain she's in, my dad is working abroad and he is coming back permanently this next year and when he comes back to see his son in a rut like this doing nothing in his life and just being overly self criticizing of himself and being psychologically defeated as i am I don't know whats going to happen to him or what he is going to do with me.i feel alot that I want to run away from everything and go to a distant or remote island to just live there.

je38zi,7,2020-10-19,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/19/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/je38zi/weekly_job_qa_thread_10192020/,"Hi all,

Here is the thirty-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will you in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in most every role.

All the best,

Unfortunately, I did not make it past the online assessment portion of the hiring process at AWS.

My interest lies in cloud computing and ideally I’d like to find a job in this field. However I feel that I lack a lot of the in depth understanding of networks and troubleshooting which is a concern for me because a lot of entry level jobs in IT and cloud require it. 

I’m working to strengthen my understanding of these topics by working towards Network+ and AWS CCP certifications, but I would like to find work so I can gain real world experience.

Any suggestions for alternatives? Perhaps I could contact someone and let them know that having to pay for housing poses an issue for me? Or perhaps it is possible to negotiate doing my internship in the Boston office (much closer to home where I would be able to commute)? I need some advice.

Note: I'm a college freshman, so I'm lucky (especially with Covid) that anything has happened to me at all hence the anxiety. Also, Company B is aware of the situation because I put Company A on my resume when applying.

I was recently offered a Winter internship. I'm currently working 20 hours/week for a different company for less pay than what my new company is offering. However, my current company offers tuition reimbursement of up to 5k which is a big deal for me since I'm paying for my uni 100% on my own with no financial aid (only merit). So my big plan was to cut down hours at Company A to 10 hours a week, while also working at Company B for 10 hours a week. That way, I can meet the minimum time required for both positions and maintain a normal schedule of 20 hours/week while still being a full-time student.

As an additional note of consideration, I'm a high-tech kind of guy, and Company B aligns more with my interests.

My question is... is this feasible? Have people done this sort of thing before? As a college freshman is this a good idea at all? The biggest thing I'm worried about is the workload, but I know there are also other points of consideration that I just don't know yet."

In the first few months ,the Engineer gave me trivial tasks and I didn't feel challenged ...this went on for like 2 months until he quit and left the company with no one but me..the intern.The CEO then decided to make me the senior Dev(I only have 1 year of experience as a Cs student) and hired 2 other interns but ultimately made me the boss of the other 2 new interns. 

The contract I signed before was for an unpaid internship for a 6 dollar stipend a week bc we work remotely. I've already built the website for the company and now the CEO wants an app made...as I am still a junior Dev ,I have had to transition into a senior Dev and work for 30+ hours a week (and even during weekends when they request for work) just to map out the software architecture, design patterns...all that gist... 

The initial contract was to work for only 12 hours a week but now that I'm working well over that ,I feel that I do a lot of work for the company as the depend on me for their finished professional products. This being so ,I feel like I'm now more than an intern bc I'm doing real work that will impact the future of the company and need to get fully paid.

Also as I'm from Kenya ,I would need a stable internet connection in order to work remotely in a comfortable manner ,I asked the CEO (since she is now my supervisor and btw she comes from a nontechnical background so she doesn't mentor me technology wise) and she refuses to pay for my internet ,meanwhile I'm working to release products for her company. 

I have learned a lot so far from this internship but the learning has been by myself and figuring out things by myself ,no one has taught me any new skills. The CEO also promised me a 10% stake share in all the earnings that the system will make ,I asked her for a written contract but she refuses and says that a verbal contract will do. 

She doesn't also seem to understand the technicalities of building software and that it requires a good plan and a lot of time for quality products bc she wants a fully functioning app deployed and finished in 5 weeks ,I mentioned that it is not possible unless we do a lot of buggy work but she doesn't seem to understand. 

She now threatens that I can leave if I want to and that she's giving me a great opportunity that anyone would not give up and that finding student interns will not be hard for her.Am I being taken advantage of? Should I quit?

In the early 2010s, I know of two senior engineers who switched careers early on and became software engineers:


1) One software engineer attended an early bootcamp and had a tremendous advantage over other new grads applying for entry level jobs because he knew the MEAN stack, and most entry level jobs in our area preferred experience with the MEAN stack, while most new grads in the area were graduating with only Java/C++ experience.



2) Another was an art history major who only took CS up to intro to CS/data structures before quitting his CS major since he was getting all C's up to that point.  Using only the knowledge of introductory Java, he was able to get a programming job after graduation as an art history major by studying interview preparation and filling in the gaps in his knowledge about databases and networking when applying for jobs and on the job.




Now, in 2019, I will compare it to 1 acquaintance changing his career:



1) He is a physics major going for an MSCS.  Competition for internships was very competitive, and he only got one internship offer at a mid-sized tech company.  Even during interviews for full time, one recruiter reportedly lost interest when they found out he did not study CS during undergrad.  He mentioned his MS in CS seemed less valuable than it would have been five years ago."

I am in a dilemma, and I'm sure many of you will be able to offer valuable advice.

Some facts about me:

* Live in Europe
* I started a Computer Engineering degree sort of late (25)
* Finished with great marks
* Did 3 month internship in Android company
* Went to work for Intel, did 2'5 years in assembly language Firmware
* Changed my position, went to work as Linux driver developer (6 mo)
* Have great performance at work, have done stuff with C, C++ &amp; Java especially

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation:

* Just started a Master's in Systems Control Engineering through a remote university
* I will continue to work, of course
* Master's is tough, has subjects on robotics, signals, automation, control, math oriented programming
* The materials &amp; teaching styles go from mediocre to very bad; as usual, YouTube will be my teacher
* It's a very significant time investment
* I am skeptical as to whether this very important amount of time I need to devote to studying would be better put elsewhere
   * Improve knowledge of C &amp; C++
   * Build expertise on Linux Kernel, drivers
   * Take courses on programming
* The fact is I'm building my experience around Software; going in the direction of Robotics and control systems makes me a noob again, plus it's difficult to find jobs demanding these skills which will take in people with little relevant experience

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma:

* I can leave this Master's at very little cost now, since it's just started
* I have to make a decision before the end of the month
* I need to settle on what my area of expertise will be, and FOCUS on that
* ...but I do not know yet what that area should be
* As everyone, I am interested in job stability &amp; money
* I am interested in growing skills which are marketable and profitable
* I am not interested in flushing hundreds of hours of my life into something I can't monetize

Cons: Have heard horror stories about work life balance (though friends there right now enjoy it)

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft:

Pros: Seattle, solid brand name, great work life balance, swag/fun intern program, cool tech

Cons: Heard work moves a little slower here and may not learn as much (not sure how true this is?)

Bloomberg:

Pros: Good work life balance, solid brand name 

Cons: Work doesn't interest me as much as other companies, On the east coast

Hubspot

Pros: Loved everyone I talked to interviewing, culture seems really fun

Cons: Work interests me the least, On the east coast, weaker brand name then other 3

I started to apply in August, and I only received one phone interview so far, but I got rejected since they were looking to fill the position immediately. I'm kind of disappointed I didn't make more progress so far. It has got me thinking about what my plans are if I don't get a job immediately after graduation. I certainly want something where I can apply my skills and get paid for it since I'll be in need of some money.

jewihx,2,2020-10-20,The Research/Job Dilemma,neelzer6,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jewihx/the_researchjob_dilemma/,"I'm a junior year student studying Computer Science. My research interests span Machine Learning and NLP. I truly do love working on this, and my future goal would be to, at least in the short term, pursue a thesis based masters. I do have a dilemma with my situation right now though. 
For a brief background, I have published 1 paper and have a couple of solid ML projects, few smaller ML projects,one app dev project, and I'm currently a DL research intern at a large government research organisation. 
Being in the 3rd year, I'm pretty stressful about what I should do later in the summer. I'd love a good research opportunity, but that of course comes with its own problems. It's pretty hard to get into, because I don't think my profile is good enough. But the larger problem I have, is between working at a company vs working in research labs. 
If I do work for a company, assuming I pass the tests etc. I'll mostly be doing an SDE job, something I'm not too fond of, but also haven't had experience with. Also, an internship now could potentially help me secure a PPO from the company. 
If I do get into a research lab, I'd be pretty happy because that is what I personally think would be good for me given my goals. However, there is a lack of security because I'm not sure if I'll get into the masters program I want, or if I'll be able to fund myself straight out of college. I could apply to be a research intern for a longer term in my 4th year, but I'll probably be sitting for companies also. 
I'm pretty unsure what to do now. If I do get an opportunities in the near future for a research lab, should I pick it and then lock myself out of the corporate sector for a summer? If I do get a company, do I give up my chances at researching in the summer which would massively help me with my further studies? 

It's been a recurring problem for me, and I'd love some advice from individuals who have maybe gone through this same dilemma, or who have experience in the field of ML and SDE jobs as well. 

Just to be clear, I am applying for both now to diversify my opportunities, but I really am pretty scared about getting pigeonholed for the next few years in something I don't like."

jexfyv,0,2020-10-20,I found a job! + Stats + Advice for undergrads,beastofbang,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jexfyv/i_found_a_job_stats_advice_for_undergrads/,"Graduating in December with my BS Finance. Only applied for a handful of positions (&lt;10) that were local to me. I wasn't trying too hard mainly because I knew I'd at least get some bites from my former internship managers.

My stats: 10 applications, 7 callbacks, 3 ghosts, 3 offers (as of today).

Did not apply to 2 other positions BUT former managers called me back directly wanting me back in their office after graduation. I said nah, sorry.

Moved to the final interview stage for 5 of the companies. Got 3 offers in fields I was interested in.

Leveraged each offer against each other in terms of salary so I'm getting a very comfortable amount (for a new business grad in my area). Good (for now) benefits (WFH, generous PTO, 401k, flex time, too many vacation days, pay for further education, right down the street from where I live).

**My advice for fellow college peeps?** 

* If you're still in college the best time to network was yesterday, especially if you're pursuing a business degree/eventual corporate roles. Does nepotism suck? Yea, it sure does buddy but the truth is that a manager would rather hire someone they know over a complete stranger. Get over it.
* Find internships. I worked part-time for a semester while balancing a full course load and an unpaid internship (I know, yikes!) but I was able to leverage that internship for other higher-paying internships. Was that semester tough? Yes. But better to suffer for a few months in a semester and be on easy street for the rest of college in my opinion. 
   * Subpoint: Having leadership and competitive internships on my resume made behavioral questions all that much easier.
* Use r/jobs and other career subreddits to ask pertinent questions. For example, I was pursuing Underwriting roles in the insurance field, so r/insurance was a huge help. If you're looking for CS, go to r/cscareerquestions Accounting? r/accounting Finance? r/FinancialCareers, just to name a few. There's individuals on there with years of experience, and I've even gotten some cool LinkedIn connections out of posting.
* USE YOUR PROFESSORS. Yea that 65-year old geezer is boring and monotone in class, but guess who he is outside of class? A highly-respected individual with a DOCTORATE with over 40 YEARS of experience in the industry you're looking to enter. My professor was the former (now retired) VP of his company, and his recommendation to HR held a lot of weight when it came to interviews.
* Bruh, are you seriously not using your campus resources? Your resume and interview skills are wack as hell. Why are you wasting part of your tuition? Sorry, not sorry.
* Career fairs. Yea they're a waste of time outside of college but not when you're still in school. If you're pursuing a worthwhile degree, recruiters will LOVE you. Wear a suit, get a leather padfolio/porfolio, brush up on that wack ass elevator speech (see point above), and research a few companies you're interested in before attending.
* And FINALLY: It's not your fault you get a rejection. It's the company's fault for missing out on YOU. Sucks to be them, huh? Keep trying, champ. You got this.

After 3 years of hard work, constant hustling through working part-time/leadership positions/internships, busting my ass kissing up to recruiters/managers, I found a job. Now to take it easy and relax in my final semester of college. Good luck everyone!"
jexja5,1,2020-10-20,To Quit or Not to Quit,Soul-Music-is-Life,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/jexja5/to_quit_or_not_to_quit/,"As a four year part time government (subsidy) employee I have learned how very little they care about me, my input, or my desire to crawl out of the rut I am currently in. And it's really pushing me to the end of my rope (maybe literally? I don't know).

I'm going to preface this by saying that I have a College Degree and 6 years of experience in this particular field.

I like my job. I like what I do. But the problem is that I don't *do* much of anything. I have tried numerous times to ask for more responsibilities, but I'm shut down every time. It's insanely difficult to climb any kind of ladder.

I told the department head that I wanted more responsibility (Pre-COVID). I put together a brief presentation to explain how I could expand my role (to bring me on full time) that would be very beneficial to them, as well as myself. I was told ""There's not enough money in the budget"" when I know it's a lie, because they had *just* promoted/hired an intern...AN INTERN to full time and that intern hadn't been there as long as I have. And they just spent millions of dollars on building and renovating new facilities.

I've also seen favoritism for the full timers and higher ups. I belong to a pretty decent department. I like my coworkers. My supervisor is a nice person, but not the greatest teacher. I never know what I'm supposed to be doing half the time, and when I take initiative and do something outside the box due to the lack of direction I am criticized for it.

COVID has only worsened the situation. I was furloughed back in April and didn't go back until August (pulled some odd jobs during those months). I wasn't allowed to work from home when I was furloughed because it wasn't ""in the rules"" that a part-timer could do their job at home, even though I had everything I needed to do the job.

Going back in August wasn't something I was looking forward to doing. I could easily do my job from home. My track record and work ethic speaks for itself, so I requested to work from home, which was denied by the department head, because part of my job requires me to travel. I stated explicitly in the request that I have the capabilities to work from home, but would still be able to go out on location if requested, but my department head was like, ""I'm denying your request. I don't foresee any reason why you shouldn't be able to come in to the office.""

My reasoning is that I didn't feel comfortable packed together in a poorly ventilated building (which is actually still under construction) where not all of their departments (or the construction crew) are wearing masks or social distancing. I also felt I would be better able to focus at home where I'm not packed into a shared work area with several other people with no extra protections (I was more professional than this in my request).

What really irritates me is that the whole time I have been working on site since August, the bigwigs and Admins worked from home. And even now that we're going back with more people at another site they will *still* be isolated in their people-free bubble, in their offices. I feel like canon-fodder (and I think a lot of others felt that way, because over 50 people have quit since the start of this).

Several other coworkers in my department have been working from home and get to continue to do so. They're all full time. They get leeway, but I don't (while I do try to take into account that other factors are at play...parents having to stay home with kids, etc). I feel like I'm being punished because I'm not full time and I'm not forced to be home for any solid reasons (kids, etc), other than it would be safer and I'd be able to concentrate better.

On top of all of this, I have been denied COVID emergency pay after having to be tested and sent home. They changed the rules about being paid stating that you need a doctor's note, when *their* county compliance packet stated that the employee experiencing symptoms was to go home and get tested (I had a fever that I didn't realize I had, I felt okay). There was no mention that getting the test wasn't enough sufficient proof that I was told to quarantine. I was never told to contact my doctor. My HR department told me to go straight to one of our county testing sites, which I did. My doctor can't give me a note when they haven't seen me for it, and why should I have to pay for an office visit that I don't need (asymptomatic, and I was negative, too). So I missed several week's pay (because this happened twice and I was not allowed to return until I had my test results in hand).

To pour salt into the wound: I went to an interview for an open job within our system for another position recently (remember the 50 people who quit? Yeah). My interviewers/coworkers know me. I went through their questions, and was more or less told that my interview was a waste of time because I didn't go line by line through my resume...that they had right in front of them. They know me and that I'm qualified for the job. They've literally seen me perform the duties, as I've learned and shadowed with their department. They not only had to make me feel like I failed, but that I *am* a failure. I always get my hopes up and I'm always stupid for doing so. I've seen this happen before. They know exactly who they plan to hire, but because of county rules they have to ""interview"" other people to make it seem fair.

I'm so fed up with my department's bullshit, and I don't know what else to do. I've tried branching out to other departments applying for jobs, but the system is rigged.

I want to quit, but I can't get anything else lined up. And it's really starting to take a toll on my mental health. I wake up and dread going in. I've called out twice the past month, because I'm just done. Mentally and emotionally. They don't give a shit about me or they'd show it in their actions.

I'm tired of it. Am I an asshole for wanting more here? For wanting fairness and equality? For feeling jaded and ready to just stop showing up and be like, ""Sorry, I'm denying your request for me to come in today. I don't forsee myself ever coming in again."" I'm not one to burn bridges, but it's hard not to feel salty about the way I've been treated.

I've been trying for *years* to get a job elsewhere, but I'm told I'm either over-qualified or under-qualified. I do tailor my resume and cover letter to each individual place I apply.

I don't know what to do at this point. Do I quit for my sanity, but risk not finding something else? Or do I stay and continue to be treated like a cog in a machine?"

I've been back and forth on what I wanted my major to be throughout high school. I wanted it to be a finance, comp sci, engineering, physics, or something math related but then I was like....... who is stopping me from applying as a math major. And in theory it sounds awesome. I haven't enjoyed an extracurricular or class even a fraction as much as I have my math classes and math extracurriculars and if I could choose one thing to study for 4 years it would absolutely be math. I've also considered minoring or double majoring in comp sci for that extra security that would still give me the problem solving fun and little serotonin release I have doing math. However, I must ask the question: what would I do with it? A lot of math majors on here seem to say that a lot of math majors want to be actuaries but I hate anything finance, I think I would much rather be involved in research/analysis. And any article about what math majors can do don't seem to give clear answers. Furthermore, general consensus seems to be that floating around a BS in math isn't gonna do me much good as a career goes. Also, I am only now taking Calculus 1 so I really don't know what being a math major would require from me but it sounds like something I'd like but until I get crushed by those Abstract Algebra and Advanced Calculus courses who knows how I'd feel.

I should add that I fully intend to go to grad school. I am taking a lot of AP and DE classes and may have my AA before becoming a freshmen to accelerate my undergrad experience. I think my question is: Am I in over my head pursuing this? I know only I can evaluate whether a risk or major is worth it for me but I'd just like any feedback from math majors if internship programs like Handshake could really prepare me to find a job with a math degree and overall how the experience in the department there is.

Thank you for reading this whole thing if you did and I'd appreciate any response!!!"

Id enjoy finance more, but I’m worried about my job prospects. I hear an accounting degree is almost a guaranteed solid job right away. I’m currently a sophomore at a 4-year in the United States and I have a 3.81 cumulative GPA and 4.0 major GPA, although those are both young and they’ll come down shortly as I’m not doing very well with online learning this semester. They’ll both probably be below a 3.5 after this semester unfortunately. 

I’m also almost positive I’m not at a target school. Just from a quick google search, top result says the school I’m at is 16th in the nation for Finance Degrees, but I don’t know how reliable that is. At the moment I’m considering switching my minor from economics to accounting so that if I want to get my CPA as a non-accounting major in the future, I’ll already have a head start. 

By graduation all I know I’ll have on my resume besides a degree is:

- Two domestic business internships
- Microsoft Excel Certified

By biggest fear is shooting for the stars in finance and ending up either burnt out working long hours trying to make it or not finding anything and having to resort to waiting tables or something instead of taking the safe accounting route. 

Any suggestions here?"

Im unfortunately in a existential crisis now? I study in germany and Im in the 7th semester process engineering now. Im searching for a company now where I can write my bachelor thesis. But because of corona its very hard to find a place and maybe I have to write my thesis in my university. Besides that I have only my mandatory internship under my belt and It was on a wastewater plant in the lab. When Im not able to find a company for my bachelor thesis, I have zero significant work experience and will maybe never find a job after my bachelor.

So because corona is wasting the job market, I plan to do my master after that. And one masters program is ""Computer Aided Process Engineering"". The modules are mainly over simulations, MATLAB and programming with C. Of course there a engineering significant modules like higher thermodynamics and mechanical process engineering. 

I think its very interesting to solve every engineering problem trough the computer tools and I wanted always learn programming but I postponed it to learn it seriously. Im also afraid that the harder modules like thermo, numeric and programming will overwhelm me. But I have the motivation to rock it.

But how is the employability of Computer Aided Process Engineering? Here in germany after you completed a study in Computer Science, its very easy to land a job. So will I be more wanted when I have the computer tools for process engineering on hand? I will try to land a job as a student trainee and do a 3 month internship as well to get the working experience."

I may just suck it up and do a thesis and try to finish in 18 months if the non-thesis isn't financially possible, but this is my last choice.

The editor has had some extremely insightful critiques on the photos I’ve submitted so far, and,  honestly, my biggest complaint is that I wish they’d give me more work to do. The other photography interns seem pretty cool as well. 

I went out drinking with the rest of the interns after work yesterday afternoon. It went well, with exception of this weird guy I saw as we went walking through a part of Old Town. I looked over my shoulder and caught sight of some guy in a fedora and overcoat staring directly at me. I grabbed the attention of the other interns to point him out, but when they turned back to look, he was gone. I still had my camera, so I decided to take a picture of the empty alleyway anyway. 

It was unsettling, but the weirdest part happened when I developed that picture today. Somehow the fedora guy showed up in the photo I took! I mean, maybe he popped back out of an alley while I was getting my camera ready. That doesn’t make much sense to me, but it’s the only thing I can think of.

**PHILADELPHIA JOURNAL ENTRY #2**

Should I start with the good news or the bad news? The good news is I’ve been going out a lot with Jenny, a girl I met on Tinder. We’ve gone on a few dates and she seems like a genuinely good person, so here’s hoping I don't screw it up. 

The bad news is that I saw the guy in the Fedora again. I was walking up to my apartment and saw movement in the hallway that leads up to my place. I tried to make out what was happening in the darkness, but it was just too dark. I pulled out my phone and took a picture with the flash. When the light illuminated the hallway, it partially blinded me, but it was enough for me to see him standing up the stairs with the same hat, the same coat, and the same stare. The paint must’ve messed with the white balance of my phone because he looked *extremely* dark in the picture. 

[THE MAN IN THE HALLWAY](https://i.imgur.com/6M9U2Y3.jpg)

 I immediately ran back to the street and called the cops. When they arrived a half-hour later, I showed them the photo. Two officers walked through my apartment and the surrounding area but found no sign of him. God, it gives me the goosebumps to think some guy might be stalking me. I don’t even know anyone from this city!


**PHILADELPHIA JOURNAL ENTRY #3**

It’s 11 PM as I write this. I feel… Uncomfortable, on edge for some reason. I think it’s my apartment. I read a reddit post a while back about a guy who thought he was going crazy because he kept discovering post-it notes that he didn’t remember writing. In his case there was a carbon monoxide leak that made him forget. 

I don’t think that’s happening to me, but it’s the only thing I can think that explains what I’ve been feeling. A few minutes ago, I was laying in bed and fiddling with my 35 mm camera when the door to my bedroom swung open. 

I’m still not used to this apartment, so I figured there had probably just been a change in pressure, maybe a window opened somewhere that caused wind pressure to push the door. But something about that opened doorway with nothing but darkness behind forced me to keep staring. 

I picked up my camera and took a picture of the doorway then a second picture. My entire body broke out in goosebumps and I had the distinct impression that something was standing *very* close to me. 

I got to my feet and walked to a nearby shelf where I keep a processing kit alongside some chemicals I use to develop pictures. I gathered all the supplies I’d need and walked into my bathroom. 

I want to see what's in these two pictures I just took, so I'm going to create an improvised darkroom to develop them. Here's hoping to God that I didn't capture anything interesting 

**PHILADELPHIA JOURNAL ENTRY #4**

I’m writing this entry from Jenny's couch. It’s a little after 1 AM, and my hands won’t stop shaking.

Shortly after writing the last entry, I created a makeshift darkroom using a lot of the same techniques I’ve used to make darkrooms in my other apartments. I set aside the equipment alongside the different chemicals I’d need, then sat for a few minutes to let my eyes adjust so I could eliminate any unnecessary sources of light. 

A significant amount of light was leaking from under the door, so I took a towel and stuffed it along the bottom. Once I was satisfied with the level of darkness, I started the process of developing the two pictures I’d taken. Working in the absolute darkness was difficult, but I knew my way around the chemicals and supplies to stumble through.

I was almost done when someone in my living room began laughing.

My phone was in the bedroom; I’d left it for the fear that a random notification would spill light into my makeshift darkroom. That meant calling the police was out of the question. A part of me wanted to immediately throw open the door and make a dash for the phone, but if I left now, the light would ruin my pictures. I grit my teeth, reached over to lock the bathroom door, and waited for the process to finish. When the pictures were ready, I flipped the light on and looked down at the negatives. The man in my living room continued to laugh. 

Here are the two pictures I developed:

[PICTURE 1](https://i.imgur.com/BEzt1ro.jpg)

[PICTURE 2](https://i.imgur.com/FlXwxZ8.jpg)

My stomach dropped, but I pushed open the bathroom door anyway. I crept to my bedroom, grabbed my phone, and called the police as the man in the living room continued to give sporadic crazed guffaws.

911 told me that the police would arrive in a few minutes, but I decided that wasn’t soon enough. I picked up my desk chair in one hand and held my phone's camera out in the other. 

“HEY!” I called out. The laughter stopped. 

I walked down the hallway to the living room, taking pictures with my phone the whole time. I flicked on the lights and raised the chair, ready to strike. 

There was no one there. I waited in the living room with my hands on the chair until the police arrived a few minutes later. They took my statement, then accompanied me to my car. Calling Jenny, the girl from Tinder, to ask to spend the night on her couch was awkward, but I’d take awkward over spending another minute in that apartment alone.

When I arrived at her place, I told her the story and showed her the two pictures I’d taken of the man in the hat. 

She asked about the laughing man in the living room, and I told her I hadn’t seen anything. When she asked about the pictures I’d taken on my phone, I realized I hadn’t checked them. I pulled out my phone and opened the app, then broke out in a shudder.

[PICTURE IN MY LIVING ROOM](https://i.imgur.com/xvpye6H.jpg)

I don’t know what I’m going to do about my apartment contract. I don’t know if I can stay in this city. If I find anything else out, I’ll update you all here.

The other classes I'd be taking alongside them are CS 61C and Data 100 + breadth (though if I do choose 170, I may drop 100 because of 170 + 61c's workload).  I'm very torn between whether to take 170 or 188. On one hand, I know that 170 is an essential core CS class, and I hear it's important for internships. On the other, CS 188 looks extremely interesting and I'd like to explore AI sooner rather than later. It's also apparently a lighter workload than 170, which is nice since I'll also be taking 61C alongside. Also, I took CS 70 this past summer so I feel like if I wait too long to take 188, my probability skills are going to atrophy and that wouldn't be good. Thoughts? Any input is appreciated"

I was in college. Saw a girl sewing/crouching while sitting in the back of class. Thought she was pretty. Then realized out she was pretty intelligent. Shared some classes but they contained over 300+ students. 

Tried to introduce myself in a completely attempt when I passed by her while noticing her by chance while she was in a computer lab. Some short time later, overheard her and some other folks talk about the incident and how odd it was, given there’s so many people in the class. 

Decided to never speak to her again thinking I’d never run into her as college went on. But as luck would shave it we ended up being in the same major graduating in the same year and the major graduating glass had like probably less than 50 students to it? Never found out if she remembered me and never reached out to her.

Still heard about her through gossip though. Someone I thought was smart turned out to be pretty motivated and successful, getting an internship and working on a cool successful science project. Ended up Facebook stalking her at times learning she was into swing or jazz, and given the small class size, can still tell she seemed friendly when interacting with other classmates.

Graduated and Facebook stalking shortly stopped a few months after graduation. Still I learned she went to grad school. However she did have a YouTube presentation on advice on time blocking, aka how to manage your time properly which I found out about and saved years ago.

Cut to over 5 years later. I have no idea what she is up to now.

But I’m currently struggling with time management (and a bunch of other stuff. Bipolar, socially awkward, overly anxious, though I’ve always had those thing, just in downward spiral at the moment). Decided to go back and rewatch the video I saved off to remind myself of those tips during her presentation all those years ago. And that led me to writing this post.

My question is did I cross a line with how I handled that relationship? If I did, how do I forgive myself? What do I do with these lingering feelings of anxiety in terms of how I handled this lack of relationship with this girl?"

Yeah I'm a young guy on here I guess, but I feel lied to and need to vent a little bit. So here it goes...I think I was raised pretty similar to any other kid growing up in the midwest. I had and still have a pretty good home life, my whole family gets together really well to be completely honest. I was raised a pretty happy kid and I think I just stayed that way. Because I know everyone in my family has my best interest in mind, I never gave what they said a second thought. I always did it because I trusted them and know they love me. They said go to school and obey your teachers, it'll go a long way. They said do good in school and you'll go to a great college where you'll learn even more. They said once you're in college and get that degree, finding a job will be a easy! Well seeing as I am about to end my academic journey, I can honestly say...I was lied to and so were you. I don't think they were pushing me in the wrong direction purposefully, I just think they were trying to push me in a direction they saw everybody else succeed in back in the day and wanted me to get some of that. Unfortunately that old model of success doesn't work anymore. Many of my teachers never really cared about me, and looking back probably used me more than anything else. My college education academically was useless. Professors didn't really care, most aren't even experts in what they're teaching. If you ask a remotely difficult question, it becomes obvious. I suppose I could have overlooked all that if finding a job post graduation would have been easy, but it's not. Now I get the whole pandemic thing, but I was told by pretty much every news source out there that if I got a degree in anything STEM I'd be ok. Besides, it's not like I got a gender studies degree or anything. I got a computer science degree for crying out loud! I can't find openings anywhere. All the jobs that pay half decent say I need my degree AND 1-2 years of experience. What am I just supposed to work an internship for free for 2 years? Forget that! I have loans to pay back! I got curious and started checking other majors and fields and saw the same thing. What it looks like to me is that there is too much saturation in the work place, more graduates each year than jobs available. It sucks, but that's what I've been discovering being in the trenches. I am not all that confident in my ability to land a job, not because I suck or anything...but because I'm average. The only thing that sticks out about me I guess would be the hard work ethic instilled upon me as a young kid, but how many places actually care about that huh? I don't know guys, my paradigm feels pretty shattered tbh, for the first time in my life, I don't know what my next move is. What do you guys think?"

I messed up by not taking an internship, so really have no relevant work experience. I was getting some interviews in February and March but then we all know what happened.

So recently interviewed and got an offer for a desktop support type role from a very small MSP. The problem is... $17 an hour and no benefits. Its also in the middle of nowhere and the commute from where I currently live would be an hour and a half each way. If I moved to the other side of my city (bad part of town) that would make the commute more like 45 minutes each way.

Soo I'm all for paying my dues and getting some experience for 6 months to a year but I'm just not sure this is the one. What you guys think?

TL;DR Have cybersecurity degree. $17/hr and no benefits worth moving 45 mins to then commute 45 minutes?"

1. I think there is some advantage to double majoring in Business Administration (Haas), in the case that I want to claim a managerial software engineering spot in a reputable firm.

2. However, this will slow my major declaration, which is a big problem for me because: 
    A. I have to serve my compulsory Korean military duties, which really needs to take place at least after my sophomore year
    B. Consequently, it will conflict with my internship interests–I want to intern at a firm every break throughout college.

3. And finally, is there even an actual advantage to double majoring in business if I know I am only going to pursue a software engineering career? Moreover, I'm an international, so it would be near impossible for me to pursue a start-up or enter the finance industry."

Divided They Rise

Part 11

“Are… are you sure about this, sir?” I ask the human recruiter.

“You joined the xeno-exchange program. You signed the consent forms. This will just be a simple test to check your eligibility. Don’t worry, since you already got your immunization, and we were provided your profile, this is the last item required for entry. So, begin when you are ready.” The human gestures with his hand towards the strange set-up in front of me.

I am sitting in front of a desk with a datapad, a deactivated red light above me, a slider showing different levels of voltage, a microphone, speakers, and a big red button. I have been instructed to ask questions into the microphone, where someone on the other side will answer them. If they get it wrong, I have to shock them, and increase the voltage with every wrong answer.

My feathers shake and pale in color as I pick up the data pad to read the question. I recite it several times in my head in preparation. *I need to do this perfectly!* I tell myself. *They must be testing me for a re-education job, probably for criminals.* Gaining some level of confidence, my feathers calm a little and color returns to them, but only slightly. After spending a few moments to prepare myself, I lean in close to the mic.

“You should be receiving an image on your datapad. That symbol is a piece of the Common Language, which you will be learning.” *Ooh, teaching sava-primitives Common, I can get on board with that.* “Your options are letters from your own native language. You must pick the correct answer or be shocked. We will repeat this form of question for the entirety of the test. Now, which letter provided is equivalent to the Common symbol shown? Is it number one: A? Number two: B? Number three: C? Or number four: D?” I recite off of the datapad as I curl my talons, hoping that I won’t be hurting anyone today.

*“Ah…uh…what?…I don’t even…you know what? This one…”* The person on the other side says through the speakers. A second later, I hear a loud buzzing sound and the red light flashes. I look at the recruiter with concern.

“He got it wrong, you know what to do.” He says to me without even looking up from his datapad.

As my feathers begin shaking and turning pale again, I lean in close to the microphone once more. “That… was incorrect.” I say with a shaky voice. “15 v-volts.” I reach over with a taloned hand and push the big red button.

“Oh!” Answers from the speakers, although sounding more like surprise than pain. So I continue.

“Alright, next question. Is it one: E, two: F, three, G, or four: H?” I tap the desk in anxiety, eyeing the 300 volts with the universal symbol for danger, and 450 volts with the human symbol for death.

I am startled out of my dark thoughts by the buzz and a flash of red. As I have determined that it is unlikely that I will really be hurting him, I move the voltage slider on my own. “That was wrong, 45 volts.” I speak into the mic while moving the slider. Immediately after I push the button, I get a reply.

“Ow!” Yelps through the speakers.

My heart instantly drops as I look at the recruiter. “I just hurt him.” I tell the human, horror visible on my plumage’s pattern.

“It is perfectly safe.” He tells me, only barely putting in enough effort to pause whatever it is he was doing.

“But… I… I can’t in good conscience hurt an innocent person! I-I greeted him in th-the volunteer room! I can’t do this!” I get up from my chair to exit the room, but the human recruiter has something to say about that.

“So you are forfeiting the program that you have signed up for?” He asks me, turning to me and looking up to make eye contact. “By failing to complete this test you have failed the entire program. Are you sure about that?”

I stand there for a few moments, trying to think about how this is acceptable. *I should quit now to prevent harm to that person, but I would be failing the program because of it? How is that fair?! Why would anyone do this? Even Dili recruitment tests focus on asset protection, not toture! My comrades in the Thousand Star Federation will understand why I had to quit the program, but… command won’t like that. Oh Stars! I could get fired for this! No, worse: I could get court-martialed for this! What do I do? What do I do?!*

Admitting defeat, I hang my head low, all color drains from my feathers as I sit back down in the chair and read out the next question. “…next question. \*deep sigh\* i-is it-”

“LOUDER PLEASE.” The recruiter calls over from his desk behind me.

I clear my throat and restart. “Th-the next question… Answers are; one: I, two: J, three: K, or four: L. Which one is the right answer?” I brace myself for the response.

\*Bzzdt!\* The machine sounds off as the red light flashes. “I-I’m so, so sorry… But, 100 volts.” I move the slider and push the button.

“Ah fuck! Shit! Damn that stung. Ow.” Call through from the speakers.

“I-I don’t think this is-” The recruiter cuts me off by raising his hand.

“Just, continue with the test. Everything is perfectly safe.” The human says.

Defeated, I continue with the test. I spend the next half-hour reciting words from the datapad. Everytime, the person on the other side gets it wrong. I always hesitate to go through with it, but the recruiter always counters with either pressure, or stating that he would be held responsible, not me. So I increase the voltage and push the button. Whoever is on the other side starts growing more and more agitated.

With every shock, he either screams or shouts things like “Hey, get me out of here!”, or “This hurts, help me!” and so on. I start crying as I reach the 300s in voltage, as he will be going beyond just pain, but he is now in actual danger. I plead with the human in the room. I beg him for another test that I can do to finish the xeno-exchange program. Something, anything that doesn’t include torture that borders on the lines of execution. And everytime, I am answered with the same set of monotone responses.

“Well, you need to finish the test, or you fail.” “No, there are no other tests.” “Just, keep going. Keep going.” “It is perfectly safe, I promise.” That is all he ever tells me. However, when I reach voltage level 400, I am shaken to my core by what happens.

“Okay… Is it answer one: A, answer two: C, answer three: P, or answer four: Z?” I wait expectantly, talons already on the slider and the button. But there is no response.

I wait a few more seconds, but nothing happens. I slowly turn my head all of the way around to look at the recruiter, dread filling my completely.

“He’s not answering…” I tell the human weakly.

He looks up from his datapad, then at the light that is still off, then to the silent speakers, and finally to me. “Take silence as a wrong answer.” Is all he says.

“But he’s-! I…! Is he dead…?” I look at the human as my body itself--not just my feathers--begin quivering in terror.

“Con-tin-ue th-e te-st…!” He stares deep into my soul through my eyes as he spells out every syllable.

I look back at the equipment in front of me. With shaking arms, I reach for the slider, move it to the right, and push the button. No response. I slide to the next question/answer set on the datapad, but instead I receive a message telling me that I have completed the test.I curl onto the floor and begin crying to myself for what I have done. *I killed him.* ***I. Killed. HIM!*** *Why?! Why!? Why did I go through with that?! He was a non-combatant, he was innocent! And I just* ***murdered*** *him! Nevermind court-martial, this is punishable by euthanization! My family, friends, associates and descendants will all scorn me for eternity if they even remember me! Oh Stars, what have I done?! No…!*

As I lie on the floor of the small room, sobbing and chastising myself, I don’t notice that the human recruiter has left the room. Nor do I notice that the volunteer that I greeted for this test, the one that I saw enter the electrocution room, walks in. At least, not until he pats me on the shoulder.

“Hey, you alright Miss?” A soft, yet familiar voice calls to me from above. Startled, I look up at the face of the man that I have killed bearing its teeth at me.

“A-are you here to ha-haunt me…? For k-killing yo-you?” My shaking intensifies, almost becoming a full-blown seizure.

However, a warm hand strokes the top of my head, calming me down almost immediately. “I ain’t dead!” the volunteer tells me.

I look up at him, confused. “Y-you’re not? But, the speakers…”

“Those are all just pre-recorded voice lines. Nobody got hurt. Not so much as a zap, Miss. Promise!” He looks at me with kind, honest eyes.

I nod lightly, despair giving way to embarrassment for how this situation has turned out. Just moments ago, I was wailing like an abandoned child for killing an alien stranger that I have only met once. Now I am lying on the floor in a puddle of my own tears as said stranger strokes my head soothingly to calm me down, like a mother would. I lie there for a few more minutes before I can compose myself again. When I get up, I try to regain a level of professionalism, but my feathers betray me with hues and patterns of embarrassment and shame.

“So… I finished the test?” I ask the human volunteer, trying to add in a cheery tone.

“Yup! The recruiter oughta give you the results. Bradda’s waiting just outside.” The volunteer points to the door with his thumb.

I use a few more seconds to collect myself before I open the door.

“Good luck.” The human calls from behind me, waving excitedly.

“Thank you.” I respond, waving back in kind. When I exit the room, I stand at attention to receive my results from the test. “So, how did I do, sirrrrrr…” All color flushes from my body and my feathers droop down as I see who stands before me.

“Damn fine test results, kid. Good enough for you to play as my assistant for a little while. So, let's start with names. You may call me Admiral Smith or just Admiral. What should I call you?” In front of me stands the infamous human admiral who has attempted fratricide on three different accounts.

Tall, light skin, well groomed, and carrying his favorite sidearm, Admiral Smith would be unassuming, even by human standards. But he is dangerous and lucky enough to disable two guards in mere seconds with a well outdated weapon and destroy a Qua’Vinchi armada. I gawk at him, lost for words. Now I want to do another test after forgetting it was fake then to work under him. *He’s going to shoot me, I just know it!*

“Hey, kid! Your name.” The human admiral sneers at me while resting a hand on his sidearm.

“I-I am First Lieutenant Va’arlien Chechivauk, sir! You may call me Chesh for short!” I give him a sharp salute, because I heard that humans don’t care what military you come from, you always salute someone higher or equal to you.

Admiral Smith salutes me in return. “Alright Chesh, come with me. I’m going to show you how to defeat the Qua’Vinchi.” With that, he turns around and begins walking down a corridor, off to… somewhere.

I hurry behind the Admiral as his entourage begins to move out as well. I try my best to keep pace with the humans, attempting to not get left behind but also not step on anyone. After several minutes of walking, I finally get the right rhythm and pace to keep up with the Admiral. Now that I don’t have to focus on that, I decide to ask him a question.

“Admiral?” I start.

“Yes Birdie?” He replies.

“Birdie, sir?”

“Sorry, nevermind. \*clears throat\* What is it, First Lieutenant?”

“Where are we going, sir?”

“We’re gonna get onto my command station. Then we’re gonna enter my command deck. After that, we’re gonna go to the Aromure system. The Krauts spotted a Qua’Vinchi armada approachin’ ‘em, so they want help with that.”

“I’m sorry sir, but who are the Krauts? And how do they know that the Qua’Vinchi are going to them specifically? Wouldn’t that mean that they found the enemy outside of the system? How would they know it is them that is going to be attacked? And, do you really think that you can take on the Qua’Vinchi again? Wasn’t it luck last time, sir? We were told that it was a pure miracle that you managed to pull that off.”

At my last comment, Admiral Smith stops dead in his tracks and turns towards me. My feathers rattle in fear and my plumage patterns convey worry and fright, the Admiral looks like he is going to kill me.

“Now listen here, and listen good, kid. That wasn’t dumb luck last time. That statement only shows how impotent folk in this ‘Federation’ really are. No, we won against them Qua’Vinchi bastards because we used something called strategy. And we had a technological edge against ‘em in a very specific field. Now…” The Admiral resumes his pace, forcing me to spring after him. “As for the other things. Kraut is an old name for Germans that goes back to ancient times, it may have meant something in the past but now it is mostly a derogatory term. As for how they know, well I can’t tell you. A combination of confidential stuff and things even I don’t know, so let’s break even and say Kraut magic, yeah? Yeah. How’s that sound?”

“I-uh, okay sir. So, when do we get to your station?”

As we pass through a bulkhead, a heavy door slams shut behind me and everything starts shaking.

“We already did, Chesh.” The Admiral looks down at me and grips an indention in the wall.

After realizing that they are bracing rungs, I hold onto them for dear life and wince as the station detaches from the dry-docks, everything shaking violently. When the shaking stops, I open my eyes and see that the Admiral is already moving on.

“Don’t you guys have safety procedures?!” I call after him, trying to catch up to the group of humans.

“We were fine, kiddo. What’s the worst that could happen?” Upon answering me, he picks up the pace, and so do the personnel around him. “Come on kid, chop, chop. We’re gonna be jumping soon and you really don’t want to be standing when that happens!” Admiral Smith shouts over his shoulder.

*Are they all mad?* I ignore my own thoughts as I try to chase after them, needing somewhere to secure myself before we do a hyperspace jump. After a few minutes, I am eventually seated and strapped down in the Admiral’s command deck, where I get a general overview of the layout of things.

Admiral Smith is in the middle of an upper deck. Behind him is the wall-chairs for his personal detail that I am seated in. In front of him, on the lower deck are rows and rows of personnel and screens. And in front of everybody is a giant screen showing rows and columns and tables of data that I don’t even understand. Overwhelmed, my translation software tries to translate everything, but it takes too long so it is translating nothing. I now sit patiently, waiting for the breach.

“Jump in t-minus 10… 9… 8…” A booming female human voice calls down from the station’s speaker system. Looking at one of the screens to my left, I see that 48 corvettes and 39 frigates are preparing to jump as well. *That… is a lot of ships. Where were they being kept this whole time? I didn’t notice them while on the drydocks.*

“7… 6… 5…” I grip the straps holding me down, praying to all known and named Stars that I have memorized. Looking at another screen, I can see that 20 cruisers and 18 destroyers are beginning their jumps sequences as well. *Just how many ships does this Admiral have? This is approaching armada level in size! And they are just primitives, how do the Humans have so many ships?!*

“All battleships from Alabama to Colorado are showing green, Admiral!” One of the humans yell from down below as the countdown sounds off. *Wait, they have battleships too?!*

“4… 3… 2… 1…” I brace myself, shutting my eyes as tightly as possible, expecting the worst from primitive technology.

“Admiral, sir! All 23 escort carriers are ready to jump! All fleet carriers from Fort Payne to Munro are good to go! Sir!” Another human shouts at the Admiral. *What’s a “carrier”?*

“0…” Everything becomes bright, too bright, overwhelmingly bright. My senses get all confused and I don’t even know what is real anymore. Then the lights go out. I start to feel my body drift away. And everything fades.

When I open my eyes again, trying to refocus, the humans are no longer strapped down, and Admiral Smith is pacing around, shouting orders. Then, the booming female voice that announced the countdown calls in through the speakers yet again.

“Subspace hyper-current breach complete. Congratulations! We have successfully made it to the Aromure system without incident. Due to the use of experimental technology provided by the Legion Smith Corporation, we have skipped approximately 426 hyperlanes. Affordability, Dependability, Reliability. Legion Smith. TheLegionSmithCorporationisnotresponsibleforanysideeffectsexperiencedwhileusingoff-marketproducts.”

*What in the Stars is going on? Did she say subspace breach? But, that is not possible! Hundreds of organizations have tried to enter subspace, and only a select few have succeeded. But… what  does she mean by hyper-current? What is that?*

“Hey, kid! Get off your ass and get over here already!” Admiral Smith yells at me, startling me out of my thoughts.

I hurriedly undo the straps to my seat and jump to my feet. After folding the chair back into the wall, I walk towards the Admiral to stand by his chair as he paces around.

“Yes Admiral?” I ask while watching him walk from one end of his command deck to the other.

He stops pacing and stands right in front of me, almost staring me down. “I would like to know what it is you or your Federation would do to fight the Qua’Vinchi.”

“Well sir, it is unlikely that we would be able to defeat them in open combat, given the technological disparity. I would recommend that we retreat from here and reinforce our-your fleet with Federation ships, sir.”

The Admiral lowers his head a bit. “Fucking impotent incompitence… No. What we’re going to do is-”

The Admiral is cut off as a set of doors slam open and in rush a full honor guard. The lead guardsman, upon entering the room, immediately shouts: “CAPTAIN ON DECK!” This causes the whole room to stop their tasks and stand at attention, even Admiral Smith. So, I follow suit and take the position of attention.

The honor guard takes a few seconds to fully enter the room, presumably because the Captain is a bit slow. However, when the last guardsman enters the room, they part to allow the Captain to enter. But there is no captain. In between the parted guard is a… black disk? A kinda small hovering--*is it hovering?*\--disk with a knife fixed to its hull, rather haphazardly at that. As soon as the Admiral sees the small droid--*or at least I think it’s a droid*\--he salutes it, as does the entire room.

“Greetings, Captain Stabby!” The Admiral says.

I lean in close to the Admiral and whisper into his ear. *“What is going on, sir?”*

*“Shut up and wait for the Captain’s orders!”* He growls in a hushed voice.

*“But you’re an Admiral!”* I reply in an exacerbated toan.

The Admiral responds by stepping down in my foot rather forcefully. I muffle a yelp as he informs me why we’re showing this lesser construct respect. *“Experience outranks position, kid. And Stabby here has been in service for longer than I’ve been alive.”*

By this point the tiny little droid has crossed in front of us, turns to us, then begins its slow approach. The “Captain” points its knife rather accusingly at me, and cries out a faint beep.

“Oh, she’s just a cultural exchange intern, sir. *Go on kid, introduce yourself to the senior officer.*” Admiral Smith rests his hand on his sidearm.

“M-my name is Chechivauk, Captain! First Lieutenant Va’arlien Chechivauk.” I gulp, this deployment going from horrible to worse, from crazy to insanity.

It… the “Captain” stops crawling towards us and now moves towards the Admiral’s command chair after beeping twice.

“…um, what…?” I look at the Admiral for help.

“She’s here to observe how humanity conducts warfare. I’m sure you’ve gone over the reports that I’ve sent you, sir. They really need to step up their strategic game.” The Admiral begins to slowly walk alongside the droid.

The Captain--*I’ll just have to accept that as its title now*\--pauses to turn towards the Admiral. What follows are a set of beeps in a seemingly random pattern, before the Captain resumes its course.

“Uh, yeah, sir.” The Admiral states.

*Does the Admiral have a special link with the machine? What in the Stars is going on?!*

“Admiral, sir! Krauts are calling us!” A communications officer calls out.

“Patch ‘em through.” Admiral Smith orders.

The large screen empties itself of the data being displayed mere moments ago and now just displays a… an audio line?

“Ah, wie wunderbar. Die Amis haben beschlossen, sich uns bei der Verteidigung dieses Systems anzuschließen. Was hat so lange gedauert? Die Xenos sind fast schon da.” Upon these foreign words being spoken, the line on the screen comes to life, dancing and distorting with every syllable.

It takes my translator a little while to find what language this is, as I only downloaded English, not expecting to encounter other languages. When my software finally finds the right one, some sort of similar dialect called German, it begins translating what has been said.

“Ah, how wonderful. The Yanks have decided to join us in the defense of this system. What took so long? The xenos are almost already here.” Is what comes through.

Admiral Smith however, seems to need no time to understand the language. “Wir mussten einen Praktikanten für einen guten Glauben abholen. Und ich hoffe, dass sie ein oder zwei Dinge über Taktik lernen kann.” The Admiral gestures to me.

“We had to pick up an intern for a good faith deal. And I'm hopin' that she can learn a thing or two about tactics.” Is what is translated.

“Also hast du einen Xeno aufgehoben, um zu sehen, wie wir mehr Xenos töten? Nett.” The radio says. It translates too: “So you picked up a xeno to watch us kill more xenos? Nice.” I notice that my translator is picking up speed.

“Admiral, who are we talking to?” I interject myself.

“Germans.” Is all that the Admiral says.

“Oh? Was ist das? Hey, wir haben gerade eine Nachricht erhalten, Yanks. Qua'Vinchi incoming. Get Ready.” My translator is now approaching real-time translation speeds.

“Understood, Krauts. Go do what you do best.” I finally get a real-time translation from the Admiral.

“Will do, Yanks.” The Germans say before cutting comms.

“…So, what now?” I look expectantly at Admiral Smith.

Almost as if in response, the Captain loudly scrapes its knife against one of the corners of the upper deck after drifting towards it.

“Astute observation, sir.” Admiral Smith says.

The room descends back into yelling and chaos. Unable to handle the mess that everything has devolved to, I move towards one of the windows on the station. Why someone would even have something so fragile on a station designed for combat is beyond me. *Oh wait, I know who would do this: humans.* Gazing out of the structural weak point, I catch a glimpse of what appears to be a sequence of ships that are just… appearing and disappearing at different points in space.

As I try to focus on this strange phenomenon, a phrase reenters the foregrounds of my mind: *“Kraut Magic”,* whatever that means. As my eyes wonder, trying to predict where the “magic” ships will appear next, I get a decent, yet limited view of the sheer size of the fleet that the Admiral has brought with him. Just out of this one view port, I can already see upwards of 56 ships.

My eyes begin to drift even more towards the blackness of the void, when I see a large mass of faint shimmering in the distance. Then the shimmering turns to flickering. Then to a shining light. Then, I see space/time fold in on itself as an armada of ships emerge from the hyperlane. In a panic, I turn to the Admiral to inform him, but… he appears to be sharing a crimson colored beverage with the Captain?

The Captain beeps a few times while rotating slowly to the left of the Admiral’s seat.

“You’re correct, sir: they landed right into our trap. Let’s see if they also play themselves right into our hands.” Admiral Smith says from his chair, taking a sip from his drink.

*Am I safe here?*

I've hated living in Singapore since primary school, it's soul crushing and not a place for anyone who is remotely creative (IMO).

I spent 5 years in the UK, did 2 years of ALevels and graduated with a BA Hons from a good design university in London, July 2019. Unfortunately, like most international students in the Arts, I couldn't find a job within the 3 month time frame before my visa expired and I had to come home. I had an internship at a big media agency here in SG, but they couldn't hire me after, due to covid. The internship was from Jan 2020-Sept 2020. I've been without a job since then and my mother is starting to think I'm useless.

**Here are some things about me and what I am currently doing:**

1. I have a BA Hons in Graphic Media Design
2. I've done internships in London, Singapore and Shanghai
3. I am currently learning web development (HTML, CSS, Javascipt)
4. I am currently updating my portfolio to include more UXUI projects as I see lots of opportunities for UX/UI designers to work remotely.
5. I am learning German and am going to take my A2 exam in December.

Perhaps if not UK/EU, what other places should I consider? If anyone has any advice for me, I would really appreciate it! Thank you."

It started on Wednesday when my sink was falling out of the wall, and maintenance came to fix it. Except they didn’t actually fix it, they just removed it and put it in the hallway of the building. For 6 days.

Then, because of the water damage in the wall plus the GAPING HOLE, fungus gnats began to ingest my apartment, with hundreds of them appearing in the bathroom and also popping up here and there in other rooms. Not only that, but there were hard to see holes in the window panes, allowing centipedes and spiders to roam free.

In addition: my dog had cancer. Emphasis on “had” - I got a call from my mother on Friday saying he had a stroke and wasn’t going to make it. I couldn’t get home in time so I FaceTimed in from my room to watch his last 15 minutes of life and say goodbye.

Right afterwards, I got a call from my boss at my internship. I work for the company’s YouTube channel and I needed to post before midnight, so I literally sat there editing videos for like two hours hysterically crying. 

It’s now Wednesday at around 4am and I’m about to ask for an extension on a third paper, and to be honest, I don’t know how any of this work is going to get done as my brain is fried and I haven’t had more than 4 or 5 hours of sleep per night. I’d love to sleep more, but the amount of work I need to finish keeps me awake. It’s a vicious cycle of “your brain can’t function and you need sleep, but you can only get more sleep if you finish the work, and your brain needs to function to be able to do that”

I feel like the situation is really shitty, but I’m so fatigued that I’m not even feeling the panic I usually do. Which is kind of bad because that’s how I usually pick myself up and finish like an hour before the actual deadline.

So that’s it for now! Thanks for reading this far if you actually did LOL 🤠"

I have also been a part of 3 internships, out of which 2 were InfoSec related with Government organizations. I have a keen interest in InfoSec and good troubleshooting skills. I also plan on getting at least 2 certifications before starting my job search and am thinking of Network+ and Security+ or CEH and CCNA. Now for my first job out of college I want to land a SOC role and if not a Sysadmin role, or is it asking for too much? And which cert path would be better for me and why?"
jfcsyb,18,2020-10-21,How hard would the transition be? Analyst -&gt; Engineer,ivantf15,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/jfcsyb/how_hard_would_the_transition_be_analyst_engineer/,"Right now, I work as a data analyst at a relatively big company. A lot of what I do is developing dashboards, statistical analysis/visualization/modeling in R and Python. Due to the nature of our department, we get little analytics support so I also end up building a lot of data pipelines to actually get what I need. They're not overly complicated, usually things ranging from standard SQL queries to Python scripts that construct tables via data from APIs. 

After 17 months, I've realized I tend to enjoy the engineering / pure code side of things more than going back and forth with program owners daily. During undergrad, I spent 15 months as a software engineer intern with two companies, so my background is sort of in the dev side of things. Curious for those in the field, how difficult would it be to transition to a role in data engineering?

For context, 23yo, degrees in Data Sci &amp; Math, minors in Stats &amp; Comp Sci. Use R, Python, SQL daily and used to write a lot of Java and C#."

I've been working on some projects to put onto my resume, and I need for some clarification on what employers will expect from these projects. Do employers expect more than just command line programs (or web equivalent) for projects? I am a new grade this May and I'd like to land an entry level role. (or internship if I can't break into entry level.)

For example: I have a text-adventure-like game I made in C++. However this game is a command line program. Is this the level an employers expect from a C++ project, or do I need to make a leap towards a complete project which has a full windows UI and possible mobile support?

Another example: I have a  front-end website which will generate a medieval fantasy character. Aside from a few libraries, it's a basic websites which easily runs on Chrome. Is this the level to aim for, or do I need to more like deploying this website to AWS and adding some back-end functionality? 

And finally, are these projects up to par or will they be considered elementary. Do I need to step up my game? Thanks!"
jfefez,3,2020-10-21,"Got an offer from a Unicorn, but imposter syndrom is making me reconsider. I don't want to move across the country to get fired if I am not good enough. Can anyone give me a sanity check?",CsImposterSyndrom,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jfefez/got_an_offer_from_a_unicorn_but_imposter_syndrom/,"Hi there,  
   
I come from a no-name college have a few internships at no-name companies, decent GPA and a few projects, I think I have good skills, but I am by no means an excellent software engineer. I can't even get interviews at FAANG, so I know my profile isn't very competitive. For some reason, I managed to get through the CodeSignal of a few unicorns this recruiting season and managed to get a full-time offer at one of them.  I won't name the company, but it is a fintec unicorn.   


I really enjoyed interviewing there and would totally love to work there. However, I feel like I am not qualified enough. I looked up their employees on LinkedIn and they all come from top schools, have 3.8+ GPA and plenty of prior experience at FAANG. Although I managed to pass interviews, I feel like they might be making a mistake. I don't feel like I am on the same level as these guys. While this would usually not be a big deal if this was close to my current location, this would involve me moving from the east coast to the west coast and leave other offers. My other offers are good, but not nearly as good or as exciting as the one from the unicorn.   


Basically, I would really love to work at this place, but I am afraid that I will not be good enough and end up getting fired. Getting fired would be pretty bad since I would have moved across the country for no reason. I would also lose other good opportunities that I might not get back.   


What are your thoughts? Is getting fired from unicorns something common? How competitive are these jobs once you work there?"
jff9fu,0,2020-10-21,Gut feeling tells me to quit. What should I do?,garysen95,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jff9fu/gut_feeling_tells_me_to_quit_what_should_i_do/,"The situation at work life is ruining my peace of mind and mental health. Background:

I interned for 6 months under a different manager at  one of the largest fintech firms in India. The internship was pleasant and the manager was a gem of a person. During my actual conversion from an Intern to an Employee, my manager changed and so did my work profile.

I was made a Jack of all trades and master of none by the new manager and initially as a novice (read n00b) that was fine as I was happy to learn bits and pieces of everything. But after an year or so, he feels that I am not capable and dedicated enough and slowly started to move projects away from me when the truth is I have always tried to give my 100 in each and every project that I was made a part of (ranged from coding/network engineering to hardware engineering) and once even joined office at midnight in-spite of being officially on leave and been driving for 22 hours straight and once managing the entire network stack (with millions of transactions/day) for a a couple of weeks when everyone else was on leave.

Coming back to the question. These days, my manager is not responding to my calls/messages and emails. I was also given the lowest raise among all the employees in my team. When I requested for a review and feedback from my manager, he said I was doing a good job. But the treatment is saying otherwise.

This is bothering me for the past couple of weeks and driven me to the point of insomnia and panic attacks. I am having a gut feeling that I may be fired and it would be wise to put down my paper before I am fired. And on the second hand, I don't have enough knowledge about any of the things that I have worked on as I was a sort of substitute and never had a project that I was deeply involved with and know enough of the tech so applying for new jobs is also a headache.

Thanking people in advance. Please don't spread negativity on this post as I am already dealing with enough of that S hit."

1st interviews: 12

2nd interviews: 3

Job offer: 1

Don't give up everyone! I graduated in May 2020 BSCS with no internship experience...and I finally got full time employment that I'm starting tomorrow :)

It is IT support... but I am gonna be working with SQL so I'll be getting back end experience! I'm happy with it.

My advice is if you're like me... and you graduated during one of the worst years ever AND you don't have any professional experience be okay with broadening your job search a bit. For most of the time I was trying to be picky with the job title/description which is probably why I sent out my first 400 apps without getting any responses... every interview I've gotten has been in the past month.

With the job market right now... getting a job that isn't necessarily the pay or work that you want is better than a big gap of unemployment... you can re evaluate later once you get some experience and the job market isn't the way it is now. 

I've been lurking here for my entire search and I know there a lot of you out there. Thank you for the support and the info during this time."

However there is one thing I do not understand, million dollar companies, who do NOT have a good website. Sometimes it's even absolute trash. It frustrates me in a lot of ways that these big companies are paying people who do not know what they are doing, while there's lots of people who would love to and are actually capable to.

I reached out to one of these companies ( it's a zoo, one of the biggest of my country), and offered to redo a specific part of their website as my graduation assignment for my education.

They have agreed to let me do this, I now am working on with the idea that when I finish this and they are happy with the results I can do the rest of their website for a fee.

This will not only help me create a good portfolio, but also help me in dealing with big companies.

Since September 1st, I’ve been on a 4 month long internship at company that I really enjoy working at. It is a student internship, and I’m on my 9th semester, meaning that I only have a single semester left after the current one.

I know, partially because my company supervisor told me so back when I had my initial interview, that they offer student jobs (flexible part-time jobs of some sort) to interns that do really well. Now, approximately three weeks ago my company supervisor told me that he thinks that I’m one of the best interns they’ve ever had. 

I have a meeting scheduled with my company supervisor next week to discuss some things. Since I want this job really badly, I’m in doubt whether I should start to bring this up to him at the meeting and ask whether I’m on a good path to being considered for this job or whether I should ‘work harder’.

On one hand, I think it would be a good opportunity to receive some feedback since I’d still have 2 months left to adapt to his feedback and they would know that I would be interested.

On the other hand, I’m afraid that I will seem too pushy if I bring this up now, when there are (almost) 2 months left of my internship.

What do you think? Should I bring it up now to have time to adapt to eventual feedback and see if I’m even close to being considered for a position, or should I wait till close to the end of my internship to not seem too pushy? Or should I wait for them to bring it up eventually and just stfu about it if they don’t? 

Honest opinions and tips are really appreciated since I don’t want to miss any opportunities here."

jfj5ur,1,2020-10-21,Advice for an incoming CS Freshman in India,0v3rr1de,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jfj5ur/advice_for_an_incoming_cs_freshman_in_india/,"Hey, r/csMajors! 

I'll be attending a reputed private University for Computer Science this year. My goals for the next four years are as follows -

1. Building a strong understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Landing an internship in a good company (Including, but not limited to, FAANG Companies)
3. Exploring  my research interest (currently primarily interested in Distributed  Systems and concurrency, Databases, Distributed Ledgers, Blockchain,  etc)
4. If  I find myself more inclined towards it, landing a research internship  in a good school (again, including, but not limited to, the CS Ivies and  similar schools) sometime around my 3rd year-4th year
5. Building  a heavily backend-oriented capstone-level project (something like a  database or a VCS, which involves heavy use of Data Structures and  Algorithms)

TL;DR - **Given  what I now know and what I plan to do, how can I make the best use of my time in the next 4 years to meet as many of my goals as possible?**

Now, read on.

For the rest of the Indians here, worried about why competitive programming is not a part of my goals -

1. I  have tried it before. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of the whole thing, but I'm not a big fan of rat-race-ization of the whole domain that's happening.
2. I  Intend to learn DSA on my own well enough to do the interviews at the  end of the 4 years (if I don't opt for higher studies straight out of  college, that is)
3. I prefer project-oriented learning

Now,  Here's what I'm already doing to align myself with those goals, and prepare myself to meet the challenges that I'll encounter along the way -

1. I'm 90% done with Harvard's CS50x 2020
2. I'm  following MIT's Mathematics for Computer Science on a regular basis,  and once this is done I'll be following MIT's Introduction to Algorithms  (for which Mathematics for Computer Science is a pre-requisite)
3. Occasionally reading research publications (mostly blockchain related stuff, but I'm not restricting myself. I did spend quite some time on the Libra whitepaper, as well as the Bitcoin Whitepaper. I'm looking to exploring  the IPFS whitepaper next)
4. Following the Computer Science track on Brilliant

Here's what I already know, and what I can already do -

1. Python (Intermediate - TDD, OOP, Making API Calls, Websockets, Decorators, etc)
2. Javascript  (Amateur - I learned by using React and Vue, writing a few applications  along the way, making a few small websites here and there)
3. C (Amateur - Know how to use malloc, free, structs and how they work - Most of this was learned from CS50x)
4. Certifications  in Django and Django REST Framework - Built a few small applications  for my school with Django (election system, guest pass manager, etc -  mostly from Udemy
5. SQL (some from school, but I've got a certification in it from the Web Applications for Everybody Course (U of M)
6. Linux (using Ubuntu since 14.04 as my daily driver)

I'm interestedpretty serious. I love reading and want to make the best use of my 4  years in University so that I can meet my (admittedly pretty ambitious)  goals. I am very interetested in the field of Computer Science, and would love to learn more - I enjoy the more theoretical, mathematical,  and low-level parts as well.  If you've read till here, thank you for  the time! I appreciate any advice the wise greybeards of this subreddit  have for me. What projects can I do that will help me reach there? are  there any books I can read to make the best of it? Any specific material I should follow?

Thank you in advance."

 I've heard that it might be bad to be applying to a lot of companies but why would that be an issue?

 I really only have experience in web development, one of them being a coronavirus tracking website that is hosted and I think is a pretty solid project. The other one was making a web application for a non-profit during the JPMorgan Chase Code for Good Hackathon.

I'm not sure if my resume is the issue, I feel like it shows my strengths pretty well and has everything I can put on it, but wouldn't it be better to be applying to more places for a higher chance of getting an offer?"

Maybe it has to do with the fact that ever since I was a kid whenever I've been too willful/talkative during stressful times, they've always accused me of 'wanting to kill them by stressing them out even more'. 

So now that we're all stuck together during lockdown and we also have other stress factors, whenever I complain too much I get this numbing anxiety that me talking too much would make them have a heart attack or a stroke or something and I shud up.

This is especially bad at nighttime when we all go to sleep and I just feel stressed out if one of them will die in their sleep or something (we've all been through too much stress, not even counting this year's pandemic - new country, my mum lost her job, we were on the brink of becoming homeless, my grandma moved with us and left everything she knew at 83). And she's 83 even if she's in great health. I just worry about her. 

My cat will also have a neutering surgery next week at the age of 4 (she was on hormonal injections before that). Both me and my mum have a fear of surgeries because my granddad and my uncle died during a surgery and my mum almost died when she gave birth to me because they didn't give her the proper amount of anesthesia. So I'm extremely stressed out about my cat. 

I also just finished my studies and will be graduating this March and I'm just so stressed out about finding a job after my current internship ends and I had a major falling out with my childhood best friend, and another one of my best friends sorta did a disappearing act and I realised she didn't care so much about me. I also feel very frustrated with my love life and I think I might fancy one of my guy friends but he's so, so, SO different from everything I've ever found romantic but I just find his personality so... intoxicating and so refreshing. He's just so... lively. But a part of me still thinks I want someone I can idealise and romanticise. 

So my questions are: is hypochondria for other people possible and how do I stop feeling terrified all the time?"

Edit: I got the offer and accepted it. Hmu if you are also interning at Pinterest :)

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking about the Karat so here it goes:
You will have to go over your code from the OA. Then, as many coding questions as you can, up to three - the more, the better. I have heard Karat doesn’t care for optimality as much as correctness so you should try to solve as many coding questions as you can, not putting a lot OG emphasis in correctness. I was able to solve 2 and then half of the third one. 
Difficulty is random. I’ve done many Karats for different companies and it’s just randomized. You can get arrays, strings, anything."

5. Building   a heavily backend-oriented capstone-level project (something like a   database or a VCS, which involves heavy use of Data Structures and   Algorithms)

TL;DR - **Given  what I now know and what I plan to do, how can I make the best use of  my time in the next 4 years to meet as many of my goals as possible?**

Now, read on.

For the rest of the Indians here, worried about why competitive programming is not a part of my goals -

1. I   have tried it before. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of the whole  thing, but I'm not a big fan of rat-race-ization of the whole domain  that's happening.
2. I   Intend to learn DSA on my own well enough to do the interviews at the   end of the 4 years (if I don't opt for higher studies straight out of   college, that is)
3. I prefer project-oriented learning

Now,   Here's what I'm already doing to align myself with those goals, and  prepare myself to meet the challenges that I'll encounter along the way -

1. I'm 90% done with Harvard's CS50x 2020
2. I'm   following MIT's Mathematics for Computer Science on a regular basis,   and once this is done I'll be following MIT's Introduction to Algorithms   (for which Mathematics for Computer Science is a pre-requisite)
3. Occasionally  reading research publications (mostly blockchain related stuff, but I'm  not restricting myself. I did spend quite some time on the Libra  whitepaper, as well as the Bitcoin Whitepaper. I'm looking to exploring   the IPFS whitepaper next)
4. Following the Computer Science track on Brilliant

Here's what I already know, and what I can already do -

1. Python (Intermediate - TDD, OOP, Making API Calls, Websockets, Decorators, etc)
2. Javascript   (Amateur - I learned by using React and Vue, writing a few  applications  along the way, making a few small websites here and there)
3. C (Amateur - Know how to use malloc, free, structs and how they work - Most of this was learned from CS50x)
4. Certifications   in Django and Django REST Framework - Built a few small applications   for my school with Django (election system, guest pass manager, etc -   mostly from Udemy
5. SQL (some from school, but I've got a certification in it from the Web Applications for Everybody Course (U of M)
6. Linux (using Ubuntu since 14.04 as my daily driver)

I'm pretty serious. I love reading and want to make the best use  of my 4  years in University so that I can meet my (admittedly pretty  ambitious)  goals. I am very interetested in the field of Computer  Science, and would love to learn more - I enjoy the more theoretical,  mathematical,  and low-level parts as well.  If you've read till here,  thank you for  the time! I appreciate any advice the wise greybeards of  this subreddit  have for me. What projects can I do that will help me  reach there? are  there any books I can read to make the best of it? Any  specific material I should follow?

Thank you in advance."

To begin, I honestly hate studying for math, circuits and difficult irrelevant topics, I legitimately put in a lot of effort into these courses but have no tangible results. Additionally I have ADHD (I already have gotten treatment but it doesn’t help my anxiety), it’s very stressful for me to write exams, this usually results in me scoring worse even if I study hard. I talked to my school, faculty. they don’t give a fuck about me.

However, I’m a good programmer, I self-taught myself through college programming, built side projects, I’ve landed an internship lasted year and currently work as a backend engineer at a local IT department. I’m seriously considering dropping out of school after my final internships, and just faking my degree. I have an intern offer at a fast growing startup based in the Bay Area next summer.  Keep in mind, I’m already as intelligent as your ordinary 3rd year CS student, i know all the fundamentals including data structures, algorithms, SDLC etc. I do well on assignments and homework, I just fail my math and statistics exams. 

I feel like if I can enroll in 1-2 electives during the last year of college, improve my software skills, then there’s no point of torturing myself with anxiety, stress and depression with school. Plus I think employers wouldn’t go through the process of verifying my degree if I get a return offer, or have 2 years of industry experience by the end of my degree. 

Curious as to what you guys think, I’m on the fence of doing so and haven’t made my mind up."

I was a rising 1L who was way out of my depth and she took me under her wing. We chatted several time, she offered some amazing advice and I thought we really clicked.

After the internship ended I moved to the city where the firm was to start law school. After settling in to law school I reached out and asked if she would like to get coffee and catch up. She agreed on a time and date. But not a location. She said we can go to a place as long as there was outdoor seating and it was in a certain part of the city. I asked if there is any place that she wanted to go and she said no and left it up to me to find the place. Problem was I had only been to the area for the month and the location stated was not near me so I wasn't familiar with it. Due to COVID Google is not very accurate about what places are open, what their hours are, and the seating availability. So I had to go to any prospective location and confirmed that they were in the right area, open and had outdoor seating. It took a week to find a place because the week was extremely hectic so it was hard to get to locations during opening hours. I emailed her a few days before the meet up with the location.  She responded that she was to busy with a case to meet up so we could have a call and she asked what time I was available. I told her I understood and offered to reschedule because in my mind it wasn't urgent and I didn't want to stress her out by trying to squeeze me into her schedule. I did tell her what time I was available to take a call but in hindsight it might have read that I wanted to reschedule for the same day. I didn't get a response but didn't want to bother her about it because she expressed she was busy. I sent another email a month later asking again for coffee on a different email train and I haven't heard anything back and it has been 2 weeks.

Talking with my mom she said I might have offended Mary by offering to reschedule. I'm not quite sure how to proceed. I would like to reconnect with her but I'm sure how. Should I just leave it be? Or reach out in a different way?"

* Freshman Year:
   * Came into college as a physics major
   * Varsity athlete/Social life, didn't care about school
   * Randomly took a programming course
* Sophomore Year:
   * Took additional CS course first semester
   * Retired from sports so I started focusing on school
   * Switched into CS second semester to start 2020
* End of school year:
   * Got introduced to the internship game/grind through this reddit thread (s.o. to y'all)
   * Concluded that I needed:

1. Personal projects
2. Leetcode
3. Interview prep

* May - August 2020:
   * Ate a bunch of knowledge and pooped 3 simple projects showcasing skills I learned inside and outside of class
* August - September 2020:
   * Leetcode
   * Cracking the Coding Interview

I then started applying to a lot of companies. Mostly got ghosted, got some HireVue (ew) and OA (failed quite a lot bruh).

I only got one interview (100% success rate tho, that's a win in my book lol) back in September and the same company moved me to the final round. All my eggs were in the basket and man wanted to eat that omelette so I studied the company and their interview process thoroughly. As result, nothing unexpected happened during the interview and I did well! After a week, I received the offer.

I emailed my old manager and he told me right now it's too early to tell if he has openings in his team, and then I emailed Amazon recruiting and they told me I have to apply again.

I'm kinda worried that I'll brainfart or get too nervous at the interview or something and then be rejected.

I know it would be easier (and more lucrative) to switch jobs and fields than using up time in grad school trying to find out what I'd like to do my thesis on. 

Should I go into industry to try to figure out what I like to do or should I strike when the iron is hot and just go to grad school and figure out what I'd want to do there? I hear that after you start making money in industry it is very difficult to go back to school and get paid so much less. Also I know that some companies pay to put you through graduate school but as far as I know its only masters programs while I want a PhD (I know some colleges including the one I'm at allow you to go straight towards getting a PhD and skip the masters) and you have to prove to them that you studying a certain field will benefit you at the company.

In the german system we have grades from 5 to 1 at our universities 5 is not passed.

Now I will probably finish my bachelor degree with 3.5 in the worst case and 2.5 in the best case due to lazy first semesters.

As a kid I had to go to the worst type of school so I had to do my A-Level at schools that are specialized in a field. Like economy.

One thing that is good in my CV that I am a working student at a company that is a world leader in it's field.

Now my questions. Are there any chances to get accepted at Berkeley?

I want to apply for a good university in the states for a master degree that is worth the debt. The reasons for USA are that I understand english explanations better than germans. And I have a dream of a internship at the big-N. It's probably possible do get into them with a bachelor degree but I want to specialize in artificial intelligence. And maybe a PHD.

Otherwise I would apply for the german universities that are ranked high.

jfs49n,303,2020-10-21,Is it time for us COVID affected graduates to start our own firm together?,Wu-Han,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jfs49n/is_it_time_for_us_covid_affected_graduates_to/,"I’ve seen tons of posts about losing motivation and applying to 100+ jobs with no success. I propose that we just combine all our knowledge together and start our own investment firm. 

Of course you need to have some internship experience and be a graduate in finance - I’ve had some internship experience in AM and PE. I think it’d be a lot more motivating when we’re managing our own money rather than work at a bank and you don’t have that same drive. Obviously our salaries will be 0 until we grow bigger and bigger, and we’re going to have to do some major fundraising. I’m also sure we have a large enough user base here to span across Americas, Europe, and Asia. 

Rough plan:
1) I already manage my own portfolio of just over $100k, so we can start from there and pool all our capital together
2) Hire some brilliant sales and wealth management people in the 3 regions and target your rich friends and their families
3) In addition to investment analysts, we need some risk people, accountants, and tech people. Just like the divisions at a normal firm. My mom was HR at Goldman so she can do that admin work. My dad also can be our CFO since he has good accounting, finance strategy, and corporate experience 
4) Once we have the funds, use 10% of that for Wall Street Bet’s style plays...jk we’re not Madoff, but ok maybe we’ll have a 1% allocation to WSB. 
5) Make money and say f**k you to all the firms that didn’t hire us. Buy them all out and then sack every single of them little shits to make them know how we feel right now...

The end. Happily ever after.

EDIT: It was a half joking half real thought I had in the shower. Really great to see people actually willing to start something new. 

Realistically, I’ve seen how much useless bureaucracy there is at a big bank during my internship (think of one GS, MS, JPM). For example, the sales guys don’t listen to portfolio managers and they screw up the investment because the sales were impatient and didn’t wait long-term for the catalysts to actually work. It’s because sales are based on commission and PMs are based on 5 year performance. Obvious solution is just to make both of their salaries based on long term performance so that both sales and PM will have incentive to challenge each other to make sure the idea is actually a good one. That’s only one example. Another one from my PE internship is that head office and PE CEO had a very specific focus on India (our firm was global and has $40bn in PE, but my office was in charge of APAC) - idk if there was some bribery or something. Anyways new PE CEO comes in and we basically have to reverse everything the old one did because the investments in India were shit. Main fix here is to have a Head office made up of international people like me - willing and open to actually listen to new ideas and challenge them, and not just be lip service and just say yeah it’s a good investment cuz its in a developing country...

Anyways rant over. I really don’t think this is going to be realistic with our experience and lack of capital. I’ll need some rich people willing to work here and invest something in the partnership alongside my $100k because you know I just can’t be the only one risking this capital. Maybe some crazy rich dude at WSB who needs to reform his investment ways lol. But in all seriousness, keep applying to jobs and if you really don’t get anything by Jan 2021 then I’ll be on here again to see how we can move this thing forward. 

For now, start to manage your own portfolio even if it’s just $500 or $5000. I got this money from my grandpa’s will so I’m very motivated to do well and not just do WSB stuff with it. MOST IMPORTANTLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL, DM me and tell me what your objective is with that and what you’re willing to do with it. Also DM me your CVs and we’ll keep in touch. Good luck!"

jfvani,13,2020-10-22,"[Scholarships] So, bonded or non-bonded scholarship? Any seniors out there who can chip in?",Zaheen60,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jfvani/scholarships_so_bonded_or_nonbonded_scholarship/,"I’m a 90RPer with a decent portfolio and I have a good chance with mosts scholarships I apply to.

I wanna get into tech. I’m not the kind to chase after high salaries, high positions etc but I want something decent and I enjoy. In effect, I’m risk-averse.

In this sub, there seems to be a consensus that non-bonded scholarships are generally better due to the greater availability of choice

However, especially with the advent of the pandemic, it seems are jobs are not guaranteed anywhere. There’s no guarantee that the economy will fully recover 4 years from now. I’ve also heard horror stories about how even NUS CS First Class Honours students are struggling to get jobs in this current market. My seniors also tell me about the rat race to getting internships as well. Tech is also an industry where grades don’t matter as much as skills (which may be extracurricular) to get a job so you’re forced to study extracurricular stuff which adds to the workload

All this makes the job guarantee, ease of internship and mentorship of a bonded scholarship more of an attractive proposition 

That said, the argument goes that if I’m competent enough to get the scholarship in the first place, getting internships and a job shouldn’t be too tough for me anyway.

When I ask advice from people within the industry, their advice is to take up the bonded scholarship- the job guarantee coupled with the acceleration up the corporate ladder is far too good to pass up especially in this pandemic. They also said this fits my risk-averse nature. 

So, bonded or non-bonded? Would love it if seniors who have been there done that can help !!"

jg3jfj,764,2020-10-22,Breaking into High Finance: 2 Week Study Plan for the Unprepared,Yazoyu_Kreed,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jg3jfj/breaking_into_high_finance_2_week_study_plan_for/,"Had some spare time this morning, so thought I’d augment this subreddit a bit for the new finance job seekers out there.

**A little about my background**, I attended a target school (think Harvard / Wharton / Columbia, etc.) for undergraduate and graduated with a finance major / concentration with slightly above a 3.5 GPA. I’m now a 3rd year Investment Banking Analyst in M&amp;A at a reputable boutique (think Raine / Union Square Advisors, etc.) and currently in the process of interviewing for my next role in private equity.

I am also an interviewer for full-time analysts at our bank.

**The purpose of this post** is to provide a guide for those that have an interview or multiple processes kicking off within \~2-3 weeks and don’t have time to do the extensive prep that everyone suggests (e.g. reading all of Rosenbaum &amp; Pearl, understanding all the detailed accounting nuances in 3-statement modelling, etc.)

**Before we dive in,** I am mostly providing this guide for those interviewing for **investment banking** positions. The reason, aside from my experience here, is that for most of the high finance roles that finance prospects are seeking (e.g. **private equity, venture capital, hedge fund**), investment banking is often a pre-requisite before you are taking seriously.

**This guide is not for you if** you are interviewing for consulting, asset management, private wealth management, corporate banking, commercial banking, direct / commercial lending.

Now, without further ado, here is my recommended **2-week (14 day) study plan:**

**Days 1 – 5: Baseline Technical Preparation:** The 400 Investment Banking Questions &amp; Answers

Link: [https://www.academia.edu/36852692/The\_400\_Investment\_Banking\_Interview\_Questions\_and\_Answers\_You\_Need\_to\_Know?auto=download](https://www.academia.edu/36852692/The_400_Investment_Banking_Interview_Questions_and_Answers_You_Need_to_Know?auto=download)

This is your bible for technical questions. If you know every Q&amp;A in here, you are ready for 90% of the technical that will be thrown your way, so I recommend the first week to be completely dedicated to this.

Make sure as you go through this, you are understanding the reasons behind every answer. If you don’t know a term, search it up. Focus on the “Basic” questions in each of the sections in this guide. That will cover about 80% of the technical you receive. The “Advanced” questions will occasionally pop up, but are much less likely (\~10%)

If you have the chance, definitely go through them as well, but if crunched on time, much more important to fully understand the “Basic”

**Days 6 – 7: Group-Specific Technical Preparation**

This will be a bit more nuanced depending on which group you are interviewing for. I am mostly an M&amp;A guy, and the Basic + Advanced sections of the previous guide are pretty much all that’s necessary. However, if you are interviewing for any other group, wallstreetoasis.com is your best friend.

Search up specific technical for you group on that site. Try and contribute an interview review to the site, which will give you access to the company database. This contains interview reviews on many different financial institutions, and you **there’s a solid chance you can find specific interview questions for the company you are interviewing for in the reviews!**

**Day 8: Resume Walkthrough**

Every interview will kick off with “Tell me about yourself” / “Walk me through your resume” / some variation of this question

Rehearse in front of a mirror / record yourself (I used Photobooth on Mac) doing this many many many times. Your walkthrough should be \~2-3 minutes and follow the below structure:

1. *Background (\~10 – 20 seconds)*: Where you were born / raised and what interested you in finance / why you chose your college
2. *Early College Path* (*\~20 – 30 seconds*): Talk about what your major choice was / why, and any research / internships you had done
3. *What Brings You Here Today* (*\~30 – 45 seconds*): Here you establish the “spark” that led you to pursue the role your interviewing for and how the role fits in your 10 year plan

Example Answer:

“*I was born in the UK, but raised in Manhattan. I grew up very interested in the markets, and have traded my own personal portfolio since high school. For college, I decided to attend Harvard given their strength in economics and well-rounded education program*

*At Harvard, I majored in economics, joining the HBS Investment Club in my first year, where I began understanding the nuances of valuation and the key metrics in evaluating the potential of a business.*  *This inspired me to pursue a role at \[x\] family office during my Sophomore summer, where I evaluated both private companies and public equities for potential investment.*

*Through this internship, I discovered that while I enjoyed trading public equities, my passion really came from being able to dive deep into a company’s business and financial profile in order to understand how their strategic decisions allow them to outperform their competitors and the broader market. Therefore, this role as a Summer Analyst at JP Morgan in M&amp;A will provide an excellent opportunity for me to fully continue pursuing detailed analysis of businesses, and I believe my perspective coming from an investing background will allow me to add value during this internship program.”*

**Day 9: Behavioral / Fit Preparation (Part 1: The Generics)** 

The 400 Questions have a lot of these questions in there and suggested responses. The below are the ones I have personally gotten / ask in my interviews:

1. 3 Greatest Strengths and Weaknesses
2. In your last role, what would your boss say about you?
3. How do you deal with a teammate that you disagree with?
4. Do you prefer working independently or in a collaborative environment?
5. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? (hint: say something about a long term career in whatever you are interviewing for)
6. What do you do for fun?
7. Tell me about a recent book you read and liked.

**Day 10-11: Behavioral / Fit Preparation (Part 2: Why Us? / Do you know what we do?)**

1. Why do you want to work at \[x\] Bank / \[y\] Group / \[z\] Industry?
2. Why Bulge Bracket vs. Boutique?
3. Tell me about a recent deal that you read about.
4. Have you read our website? Tell me what you think about a recent transaction we advised on.
5. ELI5 \[x investment banking role\]
6. What are the tasks you expect to do here?
7. What do you think a deal process look like here?

**Day 12: General Business Sense / Case Preparation**

You will encounter these scattered throughout, and they can take a number of forms. Broadly speaking there are **3 categories**: **(1) Business Strategy Questions, (2) Market Sizing, (3) Brainteasers.** Again the 400 questions guide has a bunch of these.

The first category is the most vague, and can take the form of “What are the key aspects of a successful business in x industry?” / “You have a company with $50 million in revenue, growing at 40% annually but with negative EBITDA margins. If you were advising this company on a sale, what would you ask management?” / “How would you think about valuation for a lemonade stand in Manhattan?”

These questions are extremely variable and the best way to prepare is to familiarize yourself with common academic frameworks (SWOT analysis, Porter’s 5 forces, etc.)

The second category is classic consulting-like market-sizing questions, e.g. “What is the market size for toothbrushes in the US?” / “How many rats are there in New York City?” / “How many people die in the US each year?”

This is just practice, and I frankly don’t have much advice here besides googling consulting case questions for these. However, keep it simple and don’t break the market down into 15 segments and not be able to calculate the final answer. Make sure you walk the interviewer through each step as you work through the solution.

The third category is classic IQ-question like brainteasers, which can encompass puzzle questions, mental math, probability, etc. This is quite rare, but you will likely encounter at least 1-2 of these. I don’t recommend spending too much time prepping for this part, as they are rare and don’t often make much of a difference if you nail everything else.

**Day 13 - 14: Loose Ends &amp; Rehearsal**

This is flex time for whatever you haven’t finished in the last 2 weeks. If you have completed all the previous steps, some recommendations:

\-**Google your interviewer** if you know their name and see if you have any overlapping interests / experiences. If you bring these up early on in the interview, you can sometimes sidetrack the interviewer into talking about this for a good chunk of the time, lowering the amount of time they have to drill you on technical

\-**Read up on industry / company news** for the firm you are interviewing with

\-**Go back to the 400 questions and go through the Advanced section**

**-Rehearse your Resume walkthrough like a madman.** First impressions can often determine the tone and difficulty of the rest of the interview

Good luck my fellow monkeys."

I am a former community college student and there was quite a bit of stuff that happened in the summer related to school and mental health where I had to be hospitalized. It was due to my recent transfer plan not working out and after I got out my family pushed me to apply to more colleges last minute and I eventually I accepted an offer from a state school which seems pretty OK for its CS program a week before classes started. 

Fast forward to now I am just drowning in my classes and I can't exactly see a light to the end of this. I am almost failing my data structures class and even though my professor said I can still bring up my grade and pass when I have been talking with him, but at the same time I don't know. The same professor also gave me a research internship for a CS lab which does quite a bit of cool stuff and I was one of the two chosen out 40 applicants. I don't even know why he offered me that but it happened. I felt happy for a bit then it just fizzled out. With my first meeting I went to, I felt so out of the loop of what was going and I don't know if I deserved to be there. With online classes I feel like I am constantly googling stuff and frankensteining code together from what I see to learn and I just hate it. My actions are in my control and I just feel like I failed and I am a fraud. I love coding but more than ever I just feel like the joy of it has been sucked out for me and I am barely surviving my classes now."

I am a senior Computer Science major. Next semester, I have to take my Senior Capstone. Besides the fact that I need minimum three credits to be a full time student, I really don’t need any other required classes. I can take whatever. 

I talked to my advisor today and she had some suggestions. I can contract the other two courses. One of her suggestions was to do a research project that semester. The other suggestion was to have an internship. 

The thing is, I’m concerned about the research project. While I love research and it’s what I want to do after I graduate, I am also already focusing on my senior research. I’m conflicted because, on the one hand, it’ll provide great experience. On the other, it could cause problems if I’m trying to do two research projects next semester.

However, I recently discovered that I can actually graduate in 3 years total (so one more year of college after this), meaning this is my last internship. So, now I am also weighing intern conversion rates into my decision. My breakdown of pros and cons looks like this:

Stripe:

Pros:

Pay is higher for new grad on average

No re-interviewing for conversion (higher conversion rate)

Cons:

Less name recognition (?)

more limited projects (i.e. they only have one product, payments)

Codebase in Ruby/Scala (maybe not as transferrable)

Google:

Pros:

Better name recognition/prestige

More projects/easier to move around

More Stability in company

Cons:

lower conversion rate

lower TC on average for new grad

I'm very torn right now between these two and I'm having trouble deciding between a more guaranteed return offer and better negotiating offer versus the name recognition of having Google on the resume and having a Google offer potentially. I'm wondering what everyone's thoughts are with this factored in? Is the Google name enough to compensate for the risk?

It was a fairly busy place so the job itself was fairly stressful as well. I had graduated with a bachelors in Psychology a year prior and I was starting to feel burnt out. I wanted to change careers but I didn't know how. Working 50-60 hours a week for an ok weekly pay made me feel like I wouldn't be able to sacrifice enough time to learn something new and switch. Then Covid hit.

&amp;#x200B;

I volunteered to be one of the first to be furloughed so my coworkers could continue working, in March we had no clue how serious this would be. It also was the perfect opportunity for me to enroll in a bootcamp. The program was 3 days a week from May until the end of this month. I was very worried given the price and my background how much I'd actually be able to get out of it. I found that I really enjoyed programming but through the entirety of the bootcamp, I was very worried if I'd actually get anything out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I began applying back in September. Between the 27th of September to the 12th of October, I had sent out 157 applications for internships, Front End Development positions, Back End, and Full Stack. I received 27 rejections, 2 interviews, and one offer for a Full Stack Development Intern position. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, my girlfriend and I are trying to facilitate a move to a major city across the country. Her and I both want a change but she also has a lot of opportunities for her own career out there. This move couldn't happen until I found a job. So besides wanting to move, having not worked since March, all I've been thinking about is how badly I want a job. I don't understand why I don't feel as excited or relieved like I should.

&amp;#x200B;

The company itself seems really interesting. Without going into too much detail, they're a tech startup with a really interesting suite of products. My internship is unpaid but I am guaranteed a transition to full time after 3 or 6 months depending on how quickly I learn their stack of technology. Part of me feels that the lack of money may be why I feel odd. Its only 20 hours a week, so I intend to do my best but spend my off time continuing to job hunt and work on my portfolio.

  
I don't mean to be a downer, but I'm hoping to hear from someone who has felt similarly. Maybe it hasn't hit me yet?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be happy to talk about my prior experience and my journey from being out of the industry to finding what I think is a good first step. I definitely understand how draining the job hunting process can be and I know all too well the feelings of doubt that you'll find anything, so I'm more than happy to share my own experience with anyone who has any questions."

I'm a new sophomore coming on here with a question about securing an internship in the technology sector during my high school career - ideally a finance-related tech internship, but I probably can't afford to be picky so here I've used the vague ""technology.""

**What qualifications could potentially outweigh the negative factor of my age?**

I'm aware that most companies don't have official internship positions for high school students, but I'm planning on cold contacting smaller startups in my area (of which there's a surplus) to shoot my shot. My question is how I could possibly prove/communicate abilities that would be valuable in an intern. 

Should I focus on certification? 

If so, which one(s) would be best?

Not in the I/T field, yet but eventually want to get a career started in I/T

I don't really have a good job and I don't make much money at all, but they have a good benefit that some other employers have - tuition assistance/reimbursement

I don't plan on using this job benefit until next year until AFTER I graduate from my local community college and get my University transfer AS. After that I'll use the job benefit to get my Bachelors for very cheap (less than $1,000) - and it would be all Online, no brick and mortar options

\* I have a couple friends who tell me that I should just jump into a Help Desk position asap, get certs and work my way up

I am not 100% opposed to that, but I really REALLY want a Bachelors in IT/IS or CS because I know it'll be important later down the line and I don't want to ever have to risk working somewhere where they won't help pay for my degree. And I am never taking out a student loan. Not happening. 

**What should I do guys? Any advice?**

I'm cool with playing the long game, but that long game will mean another few years of school and then switching careers and still making minimum wage in an entry level I/T position in my mid-30's which isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Then again, if I can get a cert or two, and an internship under my belt maybe I could obtain a SysAdmin role after a year or two of Help Desk... maybe"

Last year I was at a shitty community college type university and applied for like 100 companies, and though it was depressing getting rejected a lot I managed to get a pretty nice CS internship for 2020 summer (not FAANG level but quite decent for 1st internship). However, it was cancelled because of COVID so my resume has not improved since 1 year ago besides transferring to a better university. I haven't had any time to do any extra really cool projects because I'm paying my way through school and I've had to work a lot of hours at crappy non-CS jobs because it's all I can get.

What on earth am I supposed to do? I have some decent side projects, I have a 4.0 GPA at the best CS school in my state, I had a slightly CS-related internship at a tech company, and I'm decent at Leetcode-style problems (was passing coding assessments at some of the top companies last year).  I'm barely getting any responses/interviews to my applications. Is it Covid or did I just miss the internship train? I graduate Spring 2022, and I'm starting to feel panicked that I won't have any experience when I finish school. I was relying on that internship that got cancelled to open a lot of doors for me so now I feel REALLY depressed."

I wanted to ask if people had opinions on SWE Internships at Capital One, Walmart Labs, and/or Chicago Trading Company and which one I should choose. Here are more details about the offers:

Capital One: 

Pay: 105k yearly rate (\~$51/hour) + $3000 lump sum for housing even if virtual

Location: McLean, VA (right next to Washington DC) \* this is their HQ btw \*

Work: Not sure, hoping to place into an ML team; I think you work with full-timers but on your own project

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart Labs:

Pay: Still waiting for an official offer letter (GlassDoor suggests like $45-50/hour but I would appreciate if anyone had any info on this because there is little data)

Location: Sunnyvale, CA (Walmart Labs) + housing (idk if they pay it if we're virtual)

Work: Not sure, but probably related to eCommerce for Walmart or sam's club; I think you work with full-timers but on your own project

&amp;#x200B;

Chicago Trading Company (don't actually have the offer yet, but had a final round interview so that should hopefully work out):

\*\* A small (\~600 employees) prop shop specializing in options market making (really liked the people I talked to there) \*\*

Pay: Glassdoor suggests 7500/month, which is like 45-50/hour + housing (idk if they pay it if we're virtual)

Location: Chicago, IL

Work: Likely an independent project (with significant mentorship) that is creating tools for traders

&amp;#x200B;

I also am in the interview pipelines with JPMorgan Chase, Bloomberg, and have some other random offers from places I will likely not consider anymore. However, I do have an extremely busy semester, so I was wondering where it's even worth continuing to interview considering the offers I am fortunate enough to have.

I know people that went into business and although their starting salaries may be a little lower, they are all employed by barley doing any work. 

A couple years ago, I felt that all you needed was to do well in school and make a couple projects and you'll at least get hired. Today, it seems like you need 3-4 internships and have made significant impact to even be considered for employment.

For reference, I've had about 13 interviews since I got laid off in May and like 300+ job apps. I graduate in Spring 2021. Of those 13 interviews, 12 rejected me, but today finally one accepted me. It's a major company in the Salt Lake City area that I'd have to move halfway across the country for. It's overnight and UP TO 40 hours a week so I'm not sure it's always full time. It pays 15$ an hour which I feel is really low for an IT security internship.

Do you guys think I should take it? The experience is more important than anything right? I only have desktop support experience, about a year and a half of it and some certs like Sec+. It just feels weird to have to move halfway across the country for an overnight job for 15$ an hour. They also don't offer internship --&gt; regular fulltime conversion (they claim, maybe they just say that to everyone). But that's stupid line of thinking from me right? Because I'm unemployed and don't have options right now and no security experience and this might be a foot in the door even if its alert monkey stuff.

No brainer or should I keep trying to interview? I think Spring 2021 internships are dead because of COVID so this would probably be my last opportunity right?"

The job description said it was ok to have no experience as they'll train you.  I am also a current student in college so I thought this would be a good fit as the hours were later in the day while my classes are in the morning. I was contacted right away, the same day I applied and had two interviews back to back. The interviewer seemed to really like me. However, I noticed a few things in my interviews. The interviewer asked why I wasn't employed during the school year and only during summer breaks. I transferred schools, one closer to home where I commute from home. My previous school was in a different part of the state and isolated. I didn't have a car, there was no public transportation, and on-campus jobs were competitive/reserved for students with work-study. She also noted that I didn't have that much work experience but the job description stated that current college students can apply and they will train on the job. I also have experience working as a receptionist/office assistant for 5 months. The first interview went well that she wanted a second interview the next day so I was happy.

 After the second interview, she asked for four letters of recommendation, two from someone personal (a statement on character reference), and two from a former boss. I think this is a lot for a part-time job. The internship that I did before which was through the city that I reside in only asked for one letter of recommendation when I applied. This job also pays minimum wage but in my last retail job, I got paid over minimum wage. I don't want to burden my friends who are all working full-time, full-time students and working for their time to write a character reference letter.  I am also still in contact a few of my former bosses but not the bosses I had for my recent jobs. This is the first time this has happened to me, the job where I was an office assistant/receptionist never asked me for letters of recommendation. Additionally, my interview was on a Wednesday and they wanted the letter of recommendation by Friday. That's two days to ask for letters of recommendation from friends and former bosses who are probably very busy. I feel that is also way too short of a notice to ask them as well.

I decided that the cons outweigh the benefits of this job. Especially when my retail job paid me over the minimum wage and can find another retail job. I am going to politely write an email tomorrow, telling them I am no longer interested in the position."

I feel really lost and frustrated when it comes to my career. I am studying economic computer science in Germany (Bachelor's degree). It theoretically gives me tons of job prospects and a pretty good pay, I already worked in a company and it went pretty well. But here is the kicker - my grade average is 2,89 as of this moment. (means GPA 2.11) With grades like these I won't find anything. The job I found didn't want to see my grades because it was just an internship (at least paid) but EVERY SINGLE company which wanted to see my grades rejected me after seeing them.

It's not that all my grades are bad. Some of them - the computer science ones - are pretty good even. However, my average is still upper trash and my future has only closed doors because of it. Reasons are my laziness and mental illnesses. (got diagnosed with GAD and OCD last year)

So the next logical step would be to keep on studying. To get a master's degree. However, the same problem remains: my grades are simply too bad to get an admission in Germany. It's crazy how Germany hides education behind numbers. Every single university I research eventually shows the same - not good enough to participate. At this point I'm really lost. What am I supposed to do? I clearly now what I want to study but I will get an admission nowhere.

My gf told me to just try to get some dead-end job and live a standard 9-5 which would be hell for me because it's some of my most fundamental fear, it gives me existential dread. (OCD related stuff, don't want to get into it) I don't want to live a monotonous life where I am just waiting for weekends and waiting slowly for my life to end. This is even considering I find something. I want to do something about but I won't get the opportunity to.

I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I can't get treatment for my mental illnesses because my parents would throw me out if they found out about it. Neither therapy nor meds. 

I feel dumb, ugly and a waste of resources. This world would be better off without me. I haven't killed myself yet because I don't want to hurt my girlfriend or my dogs but every single day I keep on having the same thoughts. I'm just thinking that I need to get that one push to finally end it all but this push just won't come.

I don't know why I am posting this. There doesn't seem to be solution but maybe someone knows what options I have. Thanks for reading, I am truly tired of life."
jgo4xl,4,2020-10-23,[IWantOut] 23M Web/Software Developer USA -&gt; Europe/Asia/Remote,SuperSquashMann,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/jgo4xl/iwantout_23m_websoftware_developer_usa/,"Hey all -

I've always had a passion for travelling and submersing myself in foreign cultures; discovering new places and things, learning languages and meeting people different from me are some of my favorite experiences.  Because of this, I've taken every opportunity to travel or live abroad that I've had - several years ago I did a semester abroad in Hong Kong, and also took a semester off of university to do a software development internship in Czech Republic.  I graduated last December with a degree in Computer Engineering, and rather than find a regular job I opted to do a second internship with a web design company in Slovakia, where I am now and will be until I go home for Christmas.

As the end of my internship grows closer I've started applying to various roles, both remote and non-remote.  My dream is to lead a digital nomad lifestyle (at least for a little while), but because of the current situation that may be difficult for the next year or so, so I've also been applying to more traditional positions in some of my top cities (Berlin, Tokyo, Shanghai, Toronto).  However, I've had no luck so far, which I think is for a few reasons.  Having only one year of work experience out of school, most foreign companies likely don't see the value of hiring me and taking on the burden of visa sponsorship, since I may not have any special experience that hiring domestically won't bring them.  Additionally, even though I've been working essentially as a full employee over the past year, doing the same development tasks as my coworkers, the role being labelled a ""traineeship"" causes recruiters to discount it, and not look at it as real experience.  I've done several other internships through my time at university, but by the strictest definition I suppose I've not really held down a real developer role.

I believe I have a solid value proposition; from my past experience I've worked with a lot of technologies, I'm mostly looking at frontend development roles now (since it's the bulk of what I've been doing the past year) but I can pick up almost anything relatively quickly.  I've also gained lots of experience working in diverse, multicultural environments, and in my applications I try to sell how that's developed my communication skills.  I'm not really fluent in a second language but I'm somewhat conversational in German and Mandarin, and also know bits and pieces of Japanese and Slovak.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose my question here is where I should focus my job search to find places that are most willing to hire someone at my experience level, because so far all the fully remote or foreign roles seem to be geared to those at a much more senior level than I currently am.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit because I forgot to mention:** I may have a chance to extend my internship in Slovakia, but given how little it pays (barely cost of living, and that was before everyone at my company took a salary cut because of corona) I'd consider it somewhat of a last-ditch option.  I also don't have a ton of desire to stay in Slovakia, it's a beautiful country with lots of amazing things but I feel I've gotten most everything I can out of living here and it's time to move on

As for another option, I have also given some thought to working on freelance projects, but given how I'm not comfortable at all with the whole self-marketing/hustling thing, and my relative lack of experience, I'm not sure if it's for me quite yet.  I am certainly open for more casual/short term/contract-based work opportunities though"

I work at a FANNG company and while we’re WFH this is no problem, but back in February I noticed whenever I would write code a physical response would occur. I would get flustered and be stuck at my desk. I noticed the response is greater than I’ve ever experienced before. Be with women or alone. When I write code I’m harder than I was when I was 15. I don’t know what to do. At first I’d take care of it in the bathroom but then I’d go back and write code and boom within in 2 minutes I’m hard again!! Has anyone experienced this before???? My GPA is 3.5 and I have intern experience but not with this issue. I don’t wanna be boring when I write code."

jgqjrc,1,2020-10-23,18 Credits Second Semester of Freshman Year Advice,Jetsquid1700,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/jgqjrc/18_credits_second_semester_of_freshman_year_advice/,"Hello! I am currently looking for advice as to whether this schedule sounds suitable for the upcoming semester. I am currently in my school's General Engineering program, and I am interested in declaring a major in either mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. 

Currently, I am taking 16 credit hours this first semester Calculus 1, Computer Science 1, Computer Science Lab, a 3rd-year Spanish course (advanced conversation for proficiency?), speech, and another course. I am currently doing very well in all of my courses (high A in Calculus, high A in computer science), and all of the other ones.

The current schedule I have planned out for my next  semester is 18 credit hours. The classes I would be taking would be Calculus 2 (4), Computer Science 2 (3), Technical Writing in Engineering (3), University Physics 1 (3), University Physics 1 Lab (1), Linear Circuits 1 (3), and Linear Circuits 1 Lab (1). I feel like it is important to point out I have taken high school physics, which was algebra based, and I took AP Calc in high school, so I am building a strong foundation for Calculus 2 the upcoming semester. However, I have never taken a circuits class before, and I have heard that the physics class at my school is very difficult (40 point test curves being common?).

Additionally, I am working part-time at my school's IT department, which is a chill job where I am able to get at least a little bit of homework done each time I work. This semester I am working 14 hrs a week but next semester I believe I would be able to get it down to 10 hours a week (possibly less?). 

I have talked with my advisor and she said this plan looks do-able, and she thinks (as well as me) that this semester would definitely be able, to finalize what I am going to major in. 

The adjustment that I have considered a little would be to take Computer Science II over this next summer just to free it up a little, but I am not sure if I will be doing an internship yet this upcoming summer.

Sorry for the long read! Any advice/thoughts/feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

jgrgdw,8,2020-10-23,Insight on Starting a career in Data Analysis/ Data Science for a college graduate?,cigaretttesaftersex,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/jgrgdw/insight_on_starting_a_career_in_data_analysis/,"  

I’m a 23-year-old fresh graduate with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a double minor in economics and statistics and I did a concentration in Actuarial sciences/ Data Analytics. I’m trying to get my foot in the door with some kind of junior analyst position or maybe statistician (or anything relevant), I’m trying to get my feet wet and get my first professional job and jumpstart my career but it’s been pretty difficult (mainly because of COVID and no internship experience in undergrad). In terms of staying active while I job search I’m taking a Coursera course for Machine Learning to try to get a professional certificate so that I can add that to my resume. I am also doing data quest for some hands-on projects so that I can see what it’s like to be on the field. I have a resume made out but I really wanted some numbers from people who have been in the same boat, what I mean is:

\-How many job applications should I be relatively pushing out every day or every week?

\-Should I look into a specific sector to try to focus on or kind of just put my eggs in every basket available?

\-I only have one resume, I have heard of maybe having multiple resumes to try to cater to different employers needs, or simply altering a resume to fit the job descriptions better, if this is something I should do should I have multiple resumes ready or just alter the one I have? 

My parents are a bit aggressive about me getting any kind of job just to keep myself busy. I don’t know if that is a feasible option mainly because I want to put all my efforts on trying to land something more sustainable not just a retail job or fast food, and if I do go that route will I have time to both work and learn skills ill need to be a qualified Candidate for an entry level position? so I am a bit hesitant on that part. In terms of relative experience, I have the following:

\-Python projects from Uni (more than entry level more towards intermediate level experience)

\-SQL/SAS (very basic, but doesn’t look hard at all to try to pick it up)

\-Excel (Everyone has this one? No pivot table experience though)

\-Currently learning Octave in AI Course so very basic as well

\-Data Analysis experience only from Uni but over a years’ worth of that 

\-Very basic R from a finance course

I would like to know how to move to a next step or if there is something else I can do besides pushing applications, taking online courses and doing online projects. 

Also, please let me know what I should putting more of my time into based on what is necessary for an entry level position is the python and octave viable? Should I put more effort into SQL/SAS or Tableau (I heard of tableau public and will be checking it out) should I do data science-based projects in Dataquest or data analysis ones, I’ve made an Upwork account to try to get some freelance experience but It seems kind of hard to start of if you have no prior experience to kind of lure employers. I really want to measure myself with someone in my same situation to see where I should be and what I should be doing next, since I can’t really get help from anyone in my family in that regard. And lastly just any kind of advice anyone can give me would go a long way and I would really appreciate it!

Thank you for your time and apologies for the long post!"

jgs6hd,2,2020-10-23,I [26M] need advice on what to do for my professional future,Unwired94,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jgs6hd/i_26m_need_advice_on_what_to_do_for_my/,"Hello there,

I am really not sure if this pertains to personal finance, but I believe it does considering what I'm about to say. To give you a little idea of my current life, here it goes.

I currently work for an insurance company that gives me $19.50/hr (which is around 40K a year), and I am a year away from graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and MIS. Through my university I applied for several internships. I was blessed to get an internship offer for Spring of 2021, and right after I had accepted this one, another offer came for a bigger company (one of the big 4 in accounting) for Summer of 2021. Let's call the Spring company Company A, and let's call the bigger one Company B. Both internships pay really well (Company A pays $26/hr, and company B one pays $26.92/hr). Both companies did tell me that if they do happen to like me, they might be open to offer me a full time position after I graduate (December 2021). Company A did mention though that if they like me, they would be willing to extend my internship through the end of the year and then offer me a full time position once I graduate.

This is a little silly, but I don't know what to do. Considering that both internships don't interfere with each other, I accepted both; however, I don't know what I'd do if the internship with company A one goes well and they offer me an internship position for the long-term. Since I am about to move in with my significant other, I am a little worried because I need to make the right decision. I am not a selfish person by nature, so I don't know how I'd turn down the internship with company B if things go well; however, if things don't go well, at least I would have another option available for me.

Another thing to keep in mind is that while I was looking at benefits, both companies are quite similar, except for the fact that company A would let me keep working from home and while it is not a small company, they would not require me to travel to meet with clients. Company B would require me to travel 40-45% of the time, and they would require me to commute and go to the office.

I would love to get advice from anyone who has been faced with this same type of decision or maybe something similar. Should I just worry about my interests, or should I keep in mind the other companies? Now, I know that one way or the other this is a win-win situation for me because I will be getting experience in what I've studied for, and the compensation difference is not that crazy.

Thank you"

I have an internship now and I get a lot of tasks where I will have to do a lot of research to learn how to do a specific thing, so I've been trying to use stack overflow to get more guided answers. 

I do a lot of research before I ask questions, but most of the time it's just because I don't know the right keywords to search and people on stack overflow definitely point me in the right direction, but every single one of my posts has been downvoted. I've had a post where someone referred to an old unanswered question I posted as the answer, and it got closed since I should ""refer to that post instead"". 

I got a warning today that I can't post anymore because my last 5 questions haven't been good enough and if I'm not careful I will get blocked. 

Does this happen frequently or do I really suck at asking questions? Should I just use the subreddit for stack overflow instead?"

So now that I've finally wrapped up this internship search from hell, I thought I'd just yeet my experiences out there in case it helps someone else.

**About Me**

* Junior at non-target state school in the Northeast (can probably tell which one from my Reddit history)
* Double majoring in Computer Science &amp; Business Analytics
* 3.2 GPA (it sucks, I know)
* Had one internship this past summer (see my flair), a part-time job with my school's IT department, and 2 leadership positions (VP, director) of the 2 largest CS student organizations at my school
* Two projects on my resume, a Twilio text bot and a very basic Android app that just spit out data from an API
* US Citizen

I applied between **early August-early October** and did a bulk of my interviews in September (I actually had 10 interviews in 1 week during September. Do not recommend). I also attended the Grace Hopper Conference &amp; had recruiters reaching out to me because of that

[Here's a Sankey diagram of my search.](https://imgur.com/a/EtbF8Av) Somehow a few applications were not accounted for, according to the spreadsheet formulas I wrote I submitted 129 applications but somehow after multiple thorough counts only 121 were accounted for. I did lose track towards the end but I can assure you that the 2nd round + numbers are accurate at least. On this chart ""OA"" includes both OAs &amp; first round recruiter screens, ""2nd round+"" includes technical screens and final rounds. I did end up canceling interviews &amp; ignoring OAs after getting a couple of offers so that's reflected in my Sankey too.

**All of the positions were SWE internships except for one or two PM ones.**

**Companies I made it to the 2nd/final round with, in no particular order:**

* **AT&amp;T, Vanguard, Toyota Connected, Cigna**
   * I canceled all these final rounds! Vanguard was a referral, Cigna was through GHC
   * Toyota final was sent to most people (Hirevue)
* **Dropbox**
   * Applied online, got all test cases on OA
   * My very first technical of the season. Failed it hard.
   * *Result: rejected after technical phone screen*
* **Google**

   * Had a good time during the final, did a coding question &amp; a non-coding logic question &amp; some behaviorals
   * ***Result: offer*** *(TBD team in NYC)*

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, location mattered to me a lot -- even if we're remote next summer, when considering full-time I want to be in either NYC or the Bay Area. All the NYC offers I got paid pretty much the same thing (including overtime) which I thought was pretty neat, but ultimately after talking to many former interns at all these places, **I decided to go with JPMorgan Chase.**

Since I interned at a financial company this past summer, I was somewhat looking forward to trying out a tech company, but I really did enjoy the more well-rounded experience I got during the internship -- I got to learn more about finance &amp; management too besides coding, and since my long-term career goal is management and not really SWE, I knew that having a ton of banks to pick from wasn't really a downside. I had a very long discussion about the mentorship and professional development opportunities at JPMC with my behavioral recruiter, and they pretty much outdid my last internship in that aspect which I initially thought was impossible, lol.

I feel like this post is long enough so I'll answer questions in the comments &amp; I can give tips in the comments too I guess. Thanks for reading all the way down here if you made it!

EDIT: added that my school is not a target &amp; that I am a US citizen

EDIT 2: totally forgot that Goldman Sachs was via referral oop

EDIT 3: I got another OA that I'm not gonna do, so mentally add one to the ""I didn't do OA"" count on the Sankey rip"

The interview itself started out fairly decent, interviewer asked how I was and asked me to tell me about myself.

The interviewer then started interrogating me about my previous internship experience quite a bit, and I made sure to give clear responses on the parts I worked on and gave explanations on how the project works. However, he said my explanations were too ""abstract"" and asked me to recite lines of code I specifically wrote during my internship.

It's been months since I've seen the code at my internship, and I could not recall specific lines of code I've written other than give explanations of all the parts of the project and what each part does. The interviewer then started to get very angry and the interview devolved into a one-sided shouting fest, which included him yelling, ""Do you remember ANYTHING about what you did during the project??"" and implied that I'm lying about doing the work I stated on my resume.

I decided I don't want to continue with the interview anymore and left the video call. Now I'm second guessing myself because it feels like what I've done would negatively affect my reputation as a candidate in the area. Should I have stayed throughout the entire interview or is it okay to walk out due to a rude/unprofessional interviewer? This interview was demoralizing to say the least and a blow to my self-esteem. Is it common for interviewers to ask you to recite specific lines of code you've written during an internship?

Edit: A LOT of people have messaged me privately asking what company this was. Since so many people seem to be curious, I decided to state the company. It was Manhattan Associates."

That being said, my main question is: if you're a hiring manager and you see someone whose past positions have been fairly specialized in one area, would you still give them a chance? 

So some specifics: I'm currently in my 4th year at a school who was recently ranked top 5 in CS and have held 2 internships in the past while still working part time as a developer during the semester. The first was at a medium-large HCM company while the second (and current) have been for a pretty large fintech company. 

Here's the caveat though, both have been backend positions developing APIs using Spring and similar technologies. I didn't really necessarily want to specialize, it just worked out that way.

I just find it strange that before I had experience, I would at least interview with several companies during the season, but now I can't seem to even get those. Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

&amp;nbsp;

Just had a random shower thought and was wondering what do people think the entry level requirement for a software developer will become 10-20 years from now. It's just that a decade or two ago, a CS degree by itself without a portfolio / internship / going to networking events would've been more than enough to net you a job. Nowadays, it's pretty much standard to have a GitHub repo at the very least and have an internship or two as a University student.

&amp;nbsp;

For background, here in New Zealand, there's this online platform called Summer of Tech where anyone who is a student or a recent graduate (&lt;  1 year) can register to look for internships. This year, there was about 300+ internships available with over 2500 students competing for them, so a 1 to 8 ratio give or take.  There’s also a strong preference for people in their penultimate year or at the very least in their 2nd year of their studies which I understand as they want to transition these interns to full time roles in their companies. This pretty much means that to stand out I’d need to be super likeable socially and have a banger portfolio. In fact, as a first year student, I’m already planning on releasing a shitty android app on the playstore that will at least demonstrate my understanding of a design pattern(MVC/MVVM), Unit Testing, SQL Databases (SQLite with Room) and Concurrency in a project that’s complicated enough that it will require a minimum of 1 month to release a minimum viable product just to make myself ‘attractive’ for internships next year.  Now, I personally don’t mind this as I enjoy making my own applications, but the competition nowadays for entry level is already becoming so cutthroat. Then how about 20 years from now? What ridiculous requirements will companies have to come up with just to weed out the thousands of applicants applying?"

I am garbage at menial repetitive tasks — the kinds of things that are tedious but so simple they can easily be handed off to interns or temps. I make stupid mistakes and struggle to finish on time because even on Adderall, my brain just REFUSES to focus the way I need it to. On the other hand, give me something complicated and intellectually demanding, especially on a tight deadline, and I shine.

The problem is that bosses have trouble believing they can entrust me with the latter sort of project when I look pretty incompetent or even lazy tackling the former. The thing is, I can’t even blame them! Proving yourself on basic tasks before moving up to more challenging ones is how it’s supposed to work. If I were a boss and an employee came to me saying “I know I bungled this simple spreadsheet but you can totally put me in charge of that big important submittal,” I would be extremely dubious.

I feel like I’ve spent years spinning my wheels because I just can’t perform well enough at the “easy” stuff. I honestly don’t know what to do or what kinds of conversations to have to get beyond this.

Now I’m honestly getting very desperate. I try to apply to as many positions as I could find, including some that clearly state in the description a time/location requirement that I cannot satisfy. It’s either because I didn’t read the description closely enough, or I just secretly hope they can allow some flexibility as remote work has become so common nowadays.

A while back, I got a great internship offer. My excitement didn’t last long since I quickly found out they wanted me to work full-time and start ASAP, which was impossible for me in school. I tried to negotiate, but it didn’t work out. Today I got another interview invite; I revisited the job description and realized it’s also a full-time position during my school year. Even though I accepted this invitation, I’m afraid the same thing will happen again, and it’s just a waste of time for the interviewers and me.

Or is it commonly acceptable to negotiate these factors at the offer stage? Also, any additional advice on finding internship opportunities?"

I really enjoy going to work to code and discuss new topics etc. Heck, I couldn't even imagine having a better first day at a new job.. I solved a problem they encountered that day. We all gathered around this programmer and everyone gave their advice.. the performance (time) was getting better but with my idea it went from 40s to 2-3 ms. So I was really happy and word got out about me among the programmers in the company. 

But the ""mentor"" I got assigned is absolutely unbelievable.  I don't even know where to start with really. I suppose I should say that I overheard that some guy doesn't even want to talk with him, so he communicates with him through some other guy, so much about being communicative with co-workers. That's not even the problem in my case. He is so poor in explaining ideas that are supposed to be implemented, I swear if someone could have explained the idea better I would be done in one week and not two. He is constantly changing his opinions, for example: we agreed to name the tables in camel case, I had no problem with that of course.. so he comes today and says I don't like camel case, you should rename all variables, functions, procedures, tables, etc. I mean really, it is a matter of consistency and not if you like it or not.

Nevermind I said.. a few days ago I wasn't sure how to implement a simple select statement with except because I thought it may be too ""primitive"" and maybe I need a procedure or function. So he comes and writes down what he thinks should stay there, although I didn't and would never ask him to write code for me, that's my job and I have to learn what to implement. Anyways, next day he says I don't know what you did there (referring to the code HE wrote) because the statement is kinda working kinda not working,  well it works and gives the correct result, just not the way we are expecting it to do. He said that code is completely false and bullshit..(I am not kidding, he really said that and the others that listen to this around us just ignore the fact that he speaks this way) I replied: but you wrote that down yesterday, not me. Yeah.. we wrote bad code.. he said. No bitch you did that, I thought. I assumed in that moment, that he maybe isn't a good programmer at all. 

Note to the reader: Sorry for being offensive, I am just really angry.

Another example was also in the naming convention.. he explicitly told me not to name the database tables with ""Test\_Case"" or any variable or parameter etc. I had some that were named test\_case because his first instruction was to name it like that only to hear from him that I should maybe name the tables, guessed it? =&gt;""Test\_Case"". I replied again, but we agreed on not naming them like that. Yeah.. in this case it is ok.. I was so frustrated that day.. not because it is hard to do that.. of course not, every child can rename text in an editor, but why all that nonsense of yeah let's do it this way only to say then how shitty did ""I"" named them and make me feel bad about it.

Guys.. any advice on how to get rid of this guy would be great.. I have the feeling that I am wasting my time replacing camel case and test\_cases all day long."

jh8rpv,37,2020-10-24,Diagnosis at the start of my PhD. My whole life is a lie??,LilStressi,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jh8rpv/diagnosis_at_the_start_of_my_phd_my_whole_life_is/,"Hi everyone i (25f) am new to reddit and have no idea how any of this works and what the etiquette here is exactly (i did read the rules though!!) so sorry if i mess up and also english is not my first language.

I was diagnosed recently and have felt kind of alone because although i have loving family and friends who will listen to me and try to say the right things to me, i just dont relate to them at all and i dont know who to turn to. I found this community a few days ago and am very grateful to be reading your stories and struggles because i relate to them so much and they make me feel less alone.

The reason why i am posting this is because i am very confused and just want to get things off my chest. If this disappears into the ether or nobody responds thats okay. 

To backtrack, i was always a very obedient and polite child, i did well in school (excelled in a few areas actually), and currently hold a bachelors degree in psychology, a masters in developmental psych, and a masters in clinical psych (i know, the fact that it took me this long to get diagnosed is a joke considering the amount of knowledge you'd think i'd have on this particular topic, right?). All of this has made it so that everyone around me always treated me in a way that has contributed to me feeling like i should be able to do everything i am supposed to do, and any time i felt like something was seriously wrong with me, i would just wave that feeling off and beat myself up about my inadequacies. Because look at everything i accomplished so far, right? How could i be clinically disordered? I have always looked at myself as someone who is very undisciplined and lazy/stupid as far as my work ethic and method goes. 

Last year i had started my clinical internship working with eating disordered kids, and the pressure really started to build up for me. Because now, my shitty way of working wasnt just going to affect myself, but also these patients, if i messed up anywhere. My frustrations got to a point where i was crying every week, feeling absolutely overwhelmed with no way out.. Went to my GP with stress and anxiety symptoms (i have always seen myself as a neurotic and anxious person, so this is what i thought was my main issue now), who prescribed me citalopram which has helped with my mood, and referred me to a psychologist. She treated me for generalized anxiety disorder, and although she was very nice and listened to me, in hindsight i feel disappointed in the fact that she didnt realize that my problems were centered around ADHD related symptoms, not anxiety. The whole treatment program was focused on my rumination/worrying issue, which again in highsight bothers me because i never remember really talking about that being a problem for me? My thoughts are definitely always racing and i lay awake at night but not just because i have bad thoughts... I have thoughts about everything! Literally everything! Anyway. At my very last appointment with her i told her that in those past few weeks i have really been thinking about ADHD being my underlying issue. I told her i had made a list of all the little things that are struggles for me in daily life, and that, looking at them together, it all fit perfectly under the definition of adhd (based on my knowledge of it through my uni education). She told me that if that is a suspicion i have, i should definitely be tested properly, so she kindly referred me to another practice where they did adhd testing.

Got tested (intelligence test along with a bunch of questionnaires), and there it is: there is no doubt about it, they diagnosed me with ADHD and told me that my anxiety symptoms definitely seem to be secondary to my untreated ADHD. I had been able to compensate for my executive dysfunction etc with intelligence, which is why nobody on the outside (particularly in school) ever noticed any abnormalities in my behavior. When i first got my diagnosis, i was incredibly relieved. Up until the day that i got my results back, i was doubting myself thinking 'what if i just made it all up in my head? what if im just being a baby about it?' which i still do.

Now i have started my PhD which i am excited about, but also horrified because what if i never get a grip on myself and end up burning out? I have already discussed it with my supervisor (she is a literal angel and considering my field, i didnt really have any hesitation in telling her about my diagnosis) though and am very grateful for how supportive she is. However, i know that a burnout will happen if something doesnt change drastically for me. I am waiting for my GP to discuss treatment, and really hope i find something that works. 

I just... i have so many questions. How did i not recognize this in myself sooner? How much time have i wasted procrastinating, not doing anything useful and not allowing myself to relax or have fun because i felt like i didnt deserve it? Did i seriously not know myself all these years? Do i even have adhd? What if i dont and theres some other explanation? I feel like my whole world is upside down right now and sometimes i feel like its not real.

Long story short, i feel like my whole life i have been trying to make this puzzle of mine, looking at the wrong box with the wrong picture. Now, someone has finally given me the box with the picture that goes with my puzzle, and although i feel an immense amount of relief and am starting to recognize and understand a lot of the little pieces now, i also feel incredibly stupid and hurt over the fact that i spent so much time suffering and hating myself when i just didnt know i was impaired in a serious way. How can you expect someone to finish and understand the puzzle if they dont even have the picture that goes with it?

Well writing all this helped me in a way, so thats cool. Also, i did a dumb adhd thing yesterday: i ordered a planner because i suddenly felt the urge that i needed it, and then a few minutes later cancelled my order because i was like 'wait no what if there are better colors? wait i kinda dont like it anymore' and then a few minutes after THAT i ordered it again because i was like 'wait its so cute i want it'. Mental illness luv."
jh9mcm,3,2020-10-24,Additional info question on commonApp,Ajmods,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jh9mcm/additional_info_question_on_commonapp/,"I don’t know it I should complete the additional info section of the common app and/or the Covid section.

Note: I plan on majoring in CS

I struggled a lot in school during my sophomore and Junior year, and got lots of Cs and Bs, and failed some classes like AP physics.  Part of that is me neglecting and not caring and another reason is I spent a lot of school time working on programming projects and not doing school stuff like homework.

I also don’t know if I should talk about how Covid affected me either.  I applied for some internships that I honestly think I had a chance for and my robotics team was going to go to the World Championship, but Covid took all that away.  I didn’t really do anything over quarntine as a result of that, so I don’t know if I should write about it.

So honestly, should I write about and submit this stuff?"
jhaa0t,1,2020-10-24,I recently started an internship but the employees don't seem to like me at all,-LittleMissSunshine,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/jhaa0t/i_recently_started_an_internship_but_the/,"Idk if this is the right sub to post this and sorry for the lenght of my text, but I feel very anxious about it. I'm an analytical chemistry student doing an internship in an industry lab. When I first met the employees to plan everything, they seemed very nice, but the type of people that I don't like nor find funny at all. Hence, things began to change later for they made me feel that my caracter is disturbing. The very first incident was when I arrived the second day a bit earlier, I asked the employee who teaches me if we can start working when I arrive from now on and she seemed disturbed by what I said. (I don't think I did sth wrong did I?) Then a day later I saw that she is busy most of the time so I asked her if she can give me two hours then come back to her job so that I don't wait a lot of time. She told the lab principal at once, then the latter explained to me that it's impossible to do that with interns cz employees always have to follow up with each other. I explained myself by saying that I didn't know that since this is my very first internship, and it was ok with me to wait since then. However, the principal also told me that I sound like I'm giving orders while talking (I never intended to to so with them lmaooo) and advised me to have a more friendly tonality. I was also ok with that and I said thanks for the advice I appreciate it a lot. (Btw I'm a serious person at work and college and don't smile or joke a lot)
The next monday, I received a message from that ""teacher employee"" telling me that they can't have me for two or three days cz they are very busy, so I told my dad which happened to know the owner of the industry, then he talked with him without me knowing and the latter talked to the lab principle and told her to arrange things up for me even though there's a lot of work. (Perhaps they were trying to prevent me from coming... I really don't know...)
On tuesday night, still ignorant of what dad did, I talked to the teacher (I will call her this way from now on lol) and tried to be friendly, asking her wether I can come back on wednesday or no. She said yes.
On wednesday, I tried to be friendly with her for the first time (I was very unlucky with the timing I guess) but she didn't seem enjoying her time with me. A few hours later, I felt that the principle, teacher and some other employees were gossiping about me to my own ears on purpose. Maybe they thought that I was acting friendly to express a revenge thanks to the owner. Unfortunately I found out what dad did on wednesday night... anw, I had no additional problems until yesterday.
Another intern was going to another section of the factory so I decided to go with her (I'm very curious heh) but the principle called me and told me that I should have told her bcz it wasn't within my schedule like the other intern. I said ok. She seemed pissed off and rude. Then she told me ""you don't care about this section don't you? You said you just care about analytical lab. You won't need it"". And I said ""I said if there is time some days, I would like to see, even if I won't need it"". Then she said ""ok but you must tell me first, I'm there, I exist"". I said ok and was allowed to go.
Finally today, all employees seemed to ignore me as much as they can, especially the principal. I asked questions and receives answers normally, was myself, worked normally, and totally ignored all what happened. Thing is that I find these employees arrogant, ridiculous and not funny at all (including the principal), and I can't ever smile or be friendly with people I don't like. However, I have no problem working with them cz I believe that feelings must never be an obstacle in business and interests.
Two last things... one: the other intern acts friendly with them and she jokes sometimes. On the other hand, they smile to her and joke back and the teacher looks more motivated while explaining to her. Two: I am not shy AT ALL and act very comfortably even though I'm a new person there. They told me today to ask them if I want sth and not search randomly lol and that when I arrive, to look for them and tell them that I am here if they weren't there. But I usually just wait for them I don't think I need to search for them.
What can I do in order to be more comfortable in that place? Did I do anything wrong? Does my caracter really seem disturbing? And is it possible to make them less ignoring? 
Today I was anxious and couldn't focus well so it is crucial for me to be comfortable with these people. 
I need honest replies and I won't be sad at all if you told me that I messed up.
Thank you for making time to read my post! 💗

P.S. I'm not a bad person at heart :'( I always try to have common sense and avoid conflicts. I'm also very friendly with people I like, friends, family...

I've seen people on this thread getting the chance to choose offers from multiple companies, yet I haven't received a single interview. I love building applications through computer science, but this has started to make me disheartened. I go to a  target CS school and most of my experience comes from a co-founded startup, research, and a summer internship at a non tech company.

I wanted to branch out for next summer, and hopefully intern at a tech company, but from where I stand, I can't even get an interview.

Now I ask the bizarrely broad question, what is wrong with me? Does the fact that I haven't received a single interview from resume drops mean that...

* My resume isn't formatted correctly? To this, does anyone have a resume format that worked exceptionally well for them that they are willing to share?
* My resume isn't technical enough; do my experiences seem meaningless to recruiters? If not, how have you described your experiences on your resume?
* I need to start contacting recruiters for referrals? How do I go about this, I don't come from a place where I can make a lot of connections with people in the tech industry. Do referrals even matter?

Mainly, I wanted to know if you have any tips for sticking out during the application cycle. What led me to this post is... I spent an entire day working on my Google Step essay and application, just so I can submit my application the first day it came out for NA second years. I felt passionate about my essay responses, thinking they were decently strong, and was excited about my app. Lo and behold, people started receiving interview invites from them, and I stand ghosted again.

I honestly need your tips so that I don't screw up next year's recruitment cycle. It'll be my third year internship, what most say is the most important one, and I really don't want to mess it up. Also, does anyone have any tips on what I should do now? Do you know of any companies that haven't opened their internship applications for the summer yet, and will be doing so sometime in the future? Should I just give up on the internship search, and focus on just learning more coding skills (I was thinking about completing the freecodecamp program)?"
jhc864,9,2020-10-24,Internships for experienced hires,Mr_Jim_Lahey_12,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/jhc864/internships_for_experienced_hires/,"Hi all, 

I'm now getting serious about leaving my current industry (oil &amp; gas) and start seriously looking into internships, or even part-time, software engineering roles. I've been working in O&amp;G for about 6.5 years now (29 yo) and I want to be smart about leaving (i.e. get something else lined up before hand).  I have some more background below, but my question is for those who had several years of work experience while applying for internships (or part-time even). Was there any specific searches, or companies, you targeted given the prior work experience? For example, I've seen several internships that specify you must have less than 12 months of work experience. Perhaps these are the exceptions to the rule and you didn't have any issues! That would also be great to hear about. 

**Background**: One of the driving forces for the timeline of the change is that my wife has just started a full-time job with enough salary (and health benefits) to allow me to take a significant pay-cut while we still are comfortable financially.  And because I work full-time (50+ hours a week), it's quite tough to do more than 1 course/quarter. With an internship (e.g. Summer 2021), I could leave my current job, take a big spring course load, make a bit of money over the summer and finish up over fall and winter 2021 in order to start something full-time. I'd really like to finish out the program, even if I get a full-time role that does not require it. 

**Coursework**: I've completed 161, 161, 225, 261, and I'm currently in 325 (290 planned for next quarter).

I'm sure there will be some people saying I'm an idiot and suck it up and all that. However, at some point you have to bet on yourself and I'm confident comp sci is what I'm passionate about so I continue to ask myself why I would drag out what I'm passionate about if I can do it wisely.  

Thanks!"

The pros of this are that these quantitative skills are highly sought after in general. The cons are that I have 0 experience in actually applying this information, and frankly most of the modeling/data analysis techniques have been squeezed into less than a handful of courses. Most of my coursework has been basically useless and unspecific to this area of study, and these classes were based on ridiculous curves. I only understand the IT aspects of my curriculum because I also took classes in the CS department. 


Anyway now I'm about to graduate and I don't have the experience or knowledge I need to work in a highly technical analytical role thanks to a lack of internships in this specific area... (I take responsibility for this. I should have moved faster my sophomore year so that I'd have had something related under my belt before COVID hit) and I don't have enough knowledge specific to finance to go into fintech either. 

(Just to be clear, I HAVE completed internships in college but none of them provided me with the experience I really need to break into financial services)

So, what certifications should I pursue to make me a more attractive candidate? I'm interesting financial services, and I like both the technical side in data analytics and the more traditional analytical roles such as financial analyst type roles. 

I'm therefore wondering whether I should look into data science courses (IBM has a great one) or CFA. 

Any help would be really appreciated. I don't know people who have done either of these things. 

TLDR: soon-to-be college graduate with little experience asking for recommendations as to what certifications I should pursue to add to my qualifications."

**About me (HS)**:


-*Background info*: Asian male, from the Bay Area, high school '18-&gt;BC '22


-*SAT 1*: Took it once, 1500, even split 750 math and 750 reading, never took ACT.


-*SAT Subjects*: World History 750, French 620 (ouch), US History 790, Math 2 640 (ouch again)


-*APs*: AP World 4, AP English Comp 5, AP US History 5, AP French 5, Calc AB 4, Stats 3, English Lit 3 (As you can see, I gave up on caring 2nd semester senior year). BC doesn't directly accept AP credits, which is slightly complicated but glad I did all those APs cause it helps me free up my schedule now.


-*HS GPA*: 4.21 weighted, HS only reported weighted GPA. HS didn't rank.


-*Extracurriculars*: Club Swimming, Youth and Government, MUN, Volunteer Tutor at my school's tutorial center


**College Applications**:


-*Applied*: Penn (ED for CAS), Georgetown (SFS), Brown, BC, Northeastern, BU, Cal, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, UCI, UCD, UW (might be missing a couple schools here). Mostly either applied as Intl Relations or Econ for major.


-*Accepted*: BC, BU, UCSB, UCD, UW. I chose BC without ever visiting, campus is beautiful though. Ultimately chose BC over UCSB. Also am fortunately financially to attend without having to take out loans, BC is expensive.


-*Waitlisted*: NEU (yield protected, they gave me merit aid after I got in), UCSD (denied ultimately), UCI (withdrew once I got into BC)


So overall, I was quite the average kid in HS.


**About Me (now)**:


-*Major/Minor*: Major in International Studies (MCAS), Minor in Accounting for Finance (CSOM)


-*GPA*: ~3.7, screwed around 1st semester which hurt me. ~3.8 major GPA. Ranked 376/1517


-*Activities*: Go to all our investment club (BCIC) meetings, MUN (both our traveling team BCMUN and our student-run HS conference EagleMUNC), Mock Trial—Team A.


-*Career Interests*: Came into BC pre-law, no longer pre-law (can elaborate if needed). Now fully on the finance track, went through investment banking recruiting and will probably be at a LMM shop in Boston next summer. Happy to talk about coming into finance from a non-business school/finance background. However, will probably recruit for consulting full-time during my senior year. Will probably pursue an MBA sometime in the future.


-*Internships*: After freshman year, interned at local city doing budgeting and accounting work. After sophomore year, internship cancelled due to COVID. Casual ""internship"" for Wall Street Oasis posting interesting things on their forum.


-*Housing*: Lived Newton campus freshman year, lower campus last/this year


-*What I like about BC*: Great people, good community, professors are mostly teaching-focused and not research-focused, class sizes.


-*What I hate about BC*: Inept administration, high prices everywhere (school is run like they're trying to gouge us).


-*My Interests*: 49ers fan, F1 fan


**A Final Piece of Advice**: I know this seems all-consuming to you guys, I get it and I was that tryhard hardo kid in HS. Particularly with COVID screwing everything up this year, I bet that's made things more difficult than they already are. Just ""trust in the process"" as every coach says—it worked out fine for me. I was initially unhappy that only went to BC, and not a better school. Now, I'm very happy that I came to BC. Funny how little I think about college admissions nearly three years later, you move on to caring about more ""adult"" things like finding an internship/job or grad school. As I'm sure many have told y'all, it is the person who makes the school, not the school who made the person. Obviously better to try as hard in HS as possible to get into the best school which opens the best/the most doors career-wise, but if you are determined, you can always claw your way to the top."

It will either bring you to a website and require you to sign up, to tell you the job doesn't really exist, or is in a different state, or is not the job you wanted.

This worries me because I am starting to believe that the ""data"" Indeed and other job finding sites use is wrong. These websites for searching for jobs try to say software jobs are in demand, but I don't think they are able to find out if a lot of them are actually fake scam listings.

jhjuu1,812,2020-10-24,Advice I learned or wish I knew from a college senior,SongNinja,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jhjuu1/advice_i_learned_or_wish_i_knew_from_a_college/,"I'm a college senior and I remember reading this sub for advice years ago early in my degree so I wanted to return the favor. Some background on me: top 50 CS school, 5x internships, 4x FAANG. Below are bits and pieces of advice and things I learned or wish I knew when I was younger plus some thoughts addressing common posts I see frequently on this sub. Hopefully this can help some of you!

Regarding your CS degree

* ""I'm struggling in class. Am I not cut out for CS?"" **Struggling is a sign of learning and growth, not failure**. CS is not easy. Persevering through challenges is not only useful for your degree but for your life after. You don't need to be naturally gifted to do well in CS. I personally bombed my intro classes and it took me \~4 months for things to start clicking. During those four months I just kept re-reading the material and going to my professor's office hours to ask questions. There will be very rare cases where CS doesn't mesh with some but for most, do not give up when things get hard if this is something you truly want to do.
* In addition to the bullet above, you'll always feel like there are people that have to work way less to do well/understand the material and **that's ok**. I see a bunch of threads about how students feel that they have to put in more work than their peers/it seems like everyone else in the class just gets the material while they don't. Many of the people that were ""loudest"" in my intro classes were putting on an act because they were afraid to show weakness and look dumb. Lots of these people either dropped out or are struggling with the rest of us in the upper level classes. Your competition is not your peers but yourself. By comparing your learning and current abilities with your past self, you eliminate a ton of stress from your peers. The way that I look at it is if I am a better programmer today than I was yesterday then I am getting closer to achieving my goals.
* **Be comfortable with looking stupid.** There were times in class where I was afraid of asking a question because it was on something so basic that I thought that I'd look dumb to everyone else. Know what's worse than looking stupid? Going the whole semester never getting that question answered and performing poorly on exams/future classes that required strong understanding of that topic. You are paying a ton of money to attend class so use your money's worth and ask questions until you understand. More often than not, there will be other classmates that have that same exact question but are too afraid to ask it. This will help you in your job as well because the worst engineers are the ones that are unwilling to learn/admit their lack of knowledge.
* **Do not cheat/copy code**. You are paying potentially tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for an education. I'm not talking about risking getting caught and expelled. When you cheat, you are cheating yourself by not learning the material. Embrace failure and use it to learn because everyone fails at things they are new at and anyone that says otherwise is a liar. If you cheat, yes you may get a higher grade, but you are paying thousands of dollars to end up exactly the same as before you started your degree. A degree/good grades can open doors but it won't get you past the technical interview.
* **Survivorship bias**. ""All my friends/peers are doing so well in class and getting amazing job offers."" Social media and LinkedIn makes it difficult to not compare ourselves to our peers. However, no one posts about the interviews they bombed. No one has a LinkedIn header of ""failed X onsite"". Behind every offer can be a story of countless rejections and failures that aren't apparent because ""hey they got the offer at X company so they must be naturally amazing"". When I got my first internship, I applied to 100+ companies and only heard back from 1 which ended up giving me an offer after only a behavioral interview. There may be a small subset of geniuses who always do well but most people still find success and are just good at hiding their failures.
* **Having strong technical skills and writing lots of code does not make you a better programmer**. Lets say person A is the next Alan Turing; they write brilliant code at 5x the output of their peers. You might think that they can get a job anywhere. Wrong. They might write code so brilliant that no one is able to understand it and it takes a team of 10 people just to maintain and refactor their code for the rest of the company to understand. While writing complex code might make you seem ""smart"", no one wants to be the person to maintain the code after you inevitably move projects/companies. An average coder with great communication skills and coding conventions is capable of being more valuable to companies than genius coders. Don't neglect writing clean/easy to understand code and non-technical skills. Be someone that people want to work with.
* **Everyone's timeline is different**. Don't be discouraged that you haven't gotten your dream internship/job yet. I was originally an engineering major and switched to CS after 3 semesters. I constantly felt behind people my year as I was stuck taking intro classes while they were taking advanced courses and using that knowledge to pass interviews at amazing companies. I almost didn't get a coding job as my first internship. I've had to push off non-academic semesters and go back to school because I couldn't get any internships. Be confident in yourself that you'll end up where you want if you keep trying.
* Learn how to improve from your failures. What usually happens to me is that I think the answer is X when it is actually Y. Then I investigate what thoughts/assumptions caused me to arrive to X as the answer and rewire my thinking/logic for the future. Create your own methods for learning from your mistakes to help you learn.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding internships/jobs/interviewing

* **\*\*\*Apply to that company even if you think there's no chance you'll get it\*\*\*.** Never write yourself off from a company because you think you won't get past the resume screen or you'll bomb the interview. That decision is for them to make not you. Even if you bomb the interview, you now have data on what kinds of questions you can expect if you apply in the future to better prepare. The year I got my first FAANG internship, I was rejected/ghosted from all the other 80+ local and big tech companies (many of which were far less competitive). I was already on Christmas break expecting to go back to classes in a few weeks when I unexpectedly got my only offer. Apply, apply, apply.
* IMO the two most difficult things about interviewing are your resume and communication skills. It can be difficult to objectively critique your resume since you're essentially picking which things you wrote about yourself don't meet the bar. Critiquing your communication during an interview is also difficult because you're focused on answering the question, not seeing if you are communicating well in real time. Get your resume reviewed by a few trusted sources and do some mock interviews to find potential issues with your communication habits.
* **\*\*\*You can do everything perfectly and still not get the job\*\*\***. This is one of the hardest things I've had to come to terms with. I've had many interviews where I thought I nailed every question and got rejected after. I'd spend days after questioning myself and why I didn't receive an offer. Unless there was some glaringly obvious issues in communication or implementation, you probably did just fine. There are so many factors that are out of your control (interviewer was having a bad day, position got filled, your communication style didn't fit the interviewer, etc) that dwelling on the why can be counter-productive. Interviews are flawed by nature so don't spend too much time reading between the lines for things that aren't there. Do you best, reflect if there were big mistakes that you could improve on but move on to the next interview.
* **Getting a job/internship is a numbers game**. Going off the bullet above, you will be interviewed by people you get along with and people you don't. There will always be things you can't control that can prevent you from getting the offer. You'll get questions that you aren't strong with. Just doing more interviews increases your chances of everything aligning for a great interview.
* Learn what leetcode is and use it early (I understand there are large amounts of companies that don't ask leetcode-type questions but most competitive companies do nowadays). Use leetcode to reinforce your understanding of algorithms and the pros/cons of data structure to understand when they are useful. **Do not use leetcode to memorize questions**. Using leetcode to memorize questions for certain companies is IMO a waste of time because the chance you get that question is very small and memorizing often times does not equal understanding. If you have solid understandings of most data structures, coming up with solutions to new questions will be must easier.
* Good interviews are where you work with the interviewer to build a solution. A beginner mistake is to think you have to walk through a whole solution by yourself. Part of the interview is to see how well you communicate with others engineers (the interviewer). I always work with the interviewer during the question. When I'm making a solution I'll usually say ""I'm thinking of doing X because of Y assumptions. Does this sound reasonable to you?"" or ""I can't think of a good solution to X because of Y. Do you have any ideas where we can go from here?"". Your interviewer wants you to succeed and is there to help you and point you in the right direction if you get lost. Don't neglect the interviewer as a source of information since it also shows you're a good communicator.
* If I didn't say this before, you'll get bad interviewers. It happens, move on. Some of the advice above might not always apply because the interviewer is not cooperating or is doing a bad job. Realistically there's not much you can do to salvage this situation so just move on.

&amp;#x200B;

This is most of what I can think of off the top of my head. Hopefully this helps! Feel free to ask other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to add that luck plays a big part in getting a job/life in general. I have no side projects and don't think of myself as a genius coder. I consider myself to be very lucky that I got my foot in the door with my first FAANG offer. Keep trying til the odds are in your favor."
jhjvmt,8,2020-10-24,Salesforce Intern SWE,ExtraPotential8421,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jhjvmt/salesforce_intern_swe/,Hey! I have an interview scheduled next week and was hoping if someone could share the questions asked with Salesforce for their intern program. Greatly appreciated
jhk1h3,5,2020-10-24,excel brought me back to programming.,tgg001,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/jhk1h3/excel_brought_me_back_to_programming/,"hey everyone, im 19. excel out of all things made me get my drive back to keep learning how to code in python. I started in the automate the boring stuff with python course. My background: undergrad for finance major, have always been very tech-savvy and had a brush with coding in 8th grade when introduced to codeacademy by a teacher, but ended up forgetting about it. Being an investor (foreign exchange market, stock market), my main reason for learning programming and specifically python was to be able to use numpy and matplotlib, learn about algorithms and machine learning, and down the line be able to create my own form of algorithmic trading bot (in finance this would be something a quant does), as well as learn to create financial modeling for myself and my investments.

&amp;#x200B;

I also am very into real estate and am licensed in it, and want to intern at a few real estate development firms as an acquisition analyst nearby to better understand what to look for in an investment, how to analyze both from a hard number / quantitative analysis point of view, as well as qualitative analysis point of view. Best way to be picked is to have real estate financial modeling knowledge, for which I am taking a financial modeling excel course for real estate now. After not touching python for about 2 or more weeks after getting burned out due to probably going to quick and creating useless projects, going into excel, i realized how similar in a sense excel is to python or coding in general.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I mean by this? Coding, like excel, is purely input to output based. They both have the same function concept (if this input goes in, this output will always come out). Thus, coding especially in python, with it being asynchronous in nature, is generally purely dependent on what precedes it to run correctly. They also are both equally math intensive, especially when it comes to things like inequalities, and both implement and reinforce the ideas of abstraction, problem solving across different levels of abstraction, and problem solving across different forms of conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

The moment I learned excel had conditional statements like if, and, or I was like wait a minute, this is just like python lmao. I even found myself messing up while writing excel if conditionals by writing print("" in the formula before realizing this is excel, not python. I also have whiteboards next to my desk. When writing out the concepts for some of these complex  and multiple condition financial formulas in excel, I got to realize and learn how to put what I want to create into actionable criteria and steps, as opposed to just brainstorming as I type, which even in excel, is proven to be a very effective problem solving strategy for putting many different conditional levels of abstraction and problems together and actually  create them.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, one of the things I really found amazing and very unique to programming or coding in general is the focus on creative problem solving, and how you had to take abstract parts and concepts, tie them together, to create one cohesive function or program. Also, I also really thought how interesting that in programming jobs, the way one would get promoted generally is measured on the concept of impact. Impact being how impactful something you create is to the general function or one specific function or bottleneck to an entire system, or to the company. Impact as a measure of success is a very great way to look at things and measure the effects of what you produce. I can also very well practice actually seek motivation through creating programs that are relevant or beneficial or create the most impact to me personally or for processes I would use in these sorts of investment analyses and financial modeling. As I've heard, project based programming is the best way to stay focused and motivated on a task.

&amp;#x200B;

Glad to say that tomorrow, I'll be venturing back into programming.

that's all, if you read everything, thanks for taking the time. never would have thought, but excel brought me back into programming."
jhkaf8,0,2020-10-24,How to politely leave an unpaid opportunity on the table while checking out other options?,usr3nmev3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jhkaf8/how_to_politely_leave_an_unpaid_opportunity_on/,"I'm looking for CS internships for the coming summer, and after having pretty bad luck with cold applying on LinkedIn, I reached out to one of my scholarship program advisors (we used to have a dedicated internship program, but they did away with that for unclear reasons and now offer ""specialized internship support""). The foundation that provides my scholarship funds a lot of startups, and has a decent number of alumni in startup realms. We talked about some of the options available, and my advisor has been looking into a subset that seemed like good fits. 

Currently, one has said they're open to having me (advisor starting asking companies \~1 week ago), but as an unpaid intern. It's a reasonably large healthcare AI startup (8 figure funding; 50-ish employees). I am supposed to have a meeting with their CTO relatively soon to discuss options, and honestly, if it was paid, I probably would take it in a heartbeat. However, I still think I'd like to have the option to get a paid internship (a friend's dad gave me a Cisco referral; I have yet to do the OA for that) particularly as, even if I was unable to get an industry internship, I am paid for research work at my university.

If the work seems great, I think I'll take it regardless. But in the other case, I have two particular questions: 

1) given that I was told that the internship is unpaid, is it a viable option to ask to be paid given my ""worst-case"" alternative is still a good bit over minimum wage?

2) in the event they're insistent on only an unpaid internship, is there a polite way to say ""this looks good but something paid would be more ideal and I'd like to keep my options open."""

jhkouw,145,2020-10-24,I joined a small company 7 months ago to head up marketing. CEO secretly onboarded another marketing person. What can I possibly say to CEO?,bullshitjob222,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jhkouw/i_joined_a_small_company_7_months_ago_to_head_up/,"Hi all. I joined a \~15 person startup in March (my 5th+ startup) in their first marketing role. I'm looking for advice about how constructively talk to my boss without quitting, because I am absolutely beside myself at him secretly hiring a second marketing person who doesn't report to me.

\-----

In my interview, I firmly outlined my expectations for the role. I've been burned before and would **NOT** have considered the role if the responses in my interview were not great. But the CEO (my boss) answered them all positively, volunteered that he knew nothing about marketing and said he wanted me to handle all of it.

I'm think I'm doing a stellar job under the circumstances. The company is poorly run but I'm getting cheap qualified leads, maintaining visibility, creating appropriate marketing material, doing a TON of operations tasks that I explicitly did not sign up for. I get minimal feedback, but what I do hear is good. Working 50+ hour weeks as is everyone else here.

My salary is not bad, but I'm not getting some of the benefits I was promised during the interview. I feel like I have no control over marketing, as the CEO takes us on tangents each week and rewrites most of the copy that I am cleared to publish, even though he's not a native English speaker. My coworkers just mentioned that they deal with similar broken promises, but it's their first startup and they're happily chugging along in the belief they'll be millionaires. Also, turns out we don't actually use our SaaS product and it will never work even if developed for another 20 years. So a lot of bad work environment things but I can generally grin and bear it.

A few months ago, my boss asked me to outline plans to do many marketing things that he fantasizes about doing. Our established and 100x larger competitors take multiple departments to execute these plans. We have similar-sized competitors to model ourselves after. But I gave my boss a best case time estimate for what a great marketer can achieve, and he insisted it would take 5% of that time. Ugh. I guess not meeting really uninformed marketing expectations is where my boss would take any issue with me (common issue in this field). The boss mentioned that he was looking for marketing advice and would be asking marketers to agree with his view (sooo any marketers who give honest feedback are out).

Fast forward to 5pm Friday, he offhandedly mentioned that someone had already started work in our other office (offshore) to handle marketing. Presumably this new person lied to my boss that he can do 10x work I do. Of course my boss eats that up. This person doesn't report to me and didn't introduce themselves to me. I didn't even get to say a perfunctory hello during the interview process because I didn't know they were being interviewed.

Crazy that this was hidden since we spend hours per day in detailed companywide Zoom meetings; since when I asked about onboarding an intern, my boss was having none of it; since I asked to be kept apprised of marketing hires (which I shouldn't even have to ask) and he said I would be.

It could be that my boss misspoke at end of day and this new person is handling marketing only after handling other tasks, but I doubt it.

I barely started applying elsewhere (daunted by the job market and work exhaustion). But I think I need to leave ASAP? I can deal with day-to-day suckiness. However, bringing me on to handle marketing, then intentionally hiding a new marketing hire from me, seems like something that any self-respecting person can only have zero tolerance for. I'm really stunned and thinking over ways to claim unemployment somehow.

Despite everything, there is some hope - the CEO can be pleasant IRL, I've had worse jobs, and partially thanks to me we are almost profitable. But again, I simply cannot work there if I was told I was in charge while I'm actually not.

\----

I can't afford to just quit...can I ask for a letter of termination so that I can receive unemployment? Or is there some way to continue on and explain to my boss this is wholly unacceptable? Thanks for reading."

I don't mean to offend anyone.

I'm rank 3819 this year and with my rank I could've gotten CCE in main campus last year. This year I didn't even get Data Science because 2020 and my luck in general :)

I only want a computer related branch and have no interest in ECE. Should I consider Jaipur campus. I don't care about faculty or campus. I only want a good coding culture and decent placement and internship opportunities to showcase my skills.

Is there really a major placement gap between main campus and MUJ? Will my hard work and die hard passion for CS be able to make up for it?"

I am an international student on OPT. I graduated Dec 19 with a Masters in Data Analytics from a top institute, secured an offer in Feb, and was scheduled to start in March. I had already struggled because I was switching my career (BI Implementationsto Data Analytics) Fate really really had its way and my offer was revoked because of changing business needs. That left me with no choice but to join a consultancy's training program cause this counted as a relevant internship (unpaid) and I could buy some time. Then covid stuck, all my hopes were dashed, stuck with the consultancy, struggling more than ever. Did I mention my depressive moods? I failed Amazon onsite in April which triggered this but I bounced back and kept trying and trying and trying and trying. I have not taken any medical insurance (since March), limited my expenses to groceries (cause I have to ask for money from my family), and crashing at a friend's place to save rent. Basically, I am broke with no incoming and a huge a$$ loan with rising interests. I cannot repay this loan if I go back to my home country - I would be in debt for all my life. The tensions are also rising because of voting and new policies coming up. This month, I started volunteering with a non-profit because I was not learning anything new from the consultancy's program and am doing something useful but this is also unpaid. In between, I also interviewed at Google but the role went on hold in the mid-stages ( I am calling out the FAANG names to maybe make you believe that I am good enough). I reached an onsite for another company last week but lost it to another candidate. I know there are people who are in a worse situation than I am and while I do get some comfort (not being a sadist here), this is my story and this is my life and this is on me. It is hard to face my father because I am embarrassed and also hard to face the rest of the world. I had dreams, I wanted to switch careers and somewhere in the journey I was stupid, I made mistakes but I am a good person, I do not deserve any of this and I will fight back.

So if you/your team/your contacts are looking for someone who has decent tech chops/willing to learn/works hard/is resilient and can sponsor (actually if the company is okay to hire me for the next 2 years that coincides with my 24month extension, I am okay - I will probably go back home to my native country after that) please please let me know. I will send out my resume in DM.

Thank You!"

But, I'm still learning the very basic stuff and I'm uncertain if CS is for me mostly because I'm uncertain of what lies ahead both in future semesters and career wise. I really need advice and I had a few questions:

1. I had zero experience and zero interest in CS before college, is that a problem or unusual?
2. What should I expect from future CS courses compared to CS149?
3. Is it more difficult to get a CS internship than other fields?
4. What is a career in a CS based occupation like on a daily basis?

Answering any one of these questions or giving any sort of advice would be a great help. Thanks."

I have no clue how to proceed and how to find out some interested topics in respective area. I kept searching on Google but all in vain. AI and ML are everywhere and as it's far beyond my field I think if I choose these I may lost my pace at very early stage. 
I work around different types of microcontrollers and software development on off highway vehicles.

I use C, C++, asm, python, matlab and other tools for software development and I also have profound knowledge of computers.

Could any one suggest how to work on it..Any idea how to start... I would be more happy to work as an intern too if offer any opportunities.

I am not particularly interested in traditional software development/engineering jobs, I think it would be more interesting to do something which uses more math, so either a role focused more on machine learning, data science, or quantitative finance. That said, I also want to leave the option of going into software engineering at some point in the future. I am also pretty sure I want to go to grad school (probably a phd) in math or statistics. I am considering switching my CS major to a minor. 

As I see it, the pros of a CS minor are:

* More space to take classes to prepare for grad school in math. With the major, I think I will have trouble finding time for some classes which would be really important for grad school admissions (e.g. topology, complex analysis), along with some classes which I think would just be generally interesting (numerical methods).

* The minor gives more freedom in which classes I can take. The major pigeonholes me into a ton of electives/practical classes which I don't really care about. With the minor, I can take a few machine learning classes, a database class, and a parallel computing class. I am going to take the theory sequence (discrete math, algorithms, combinatorics) regardless.

The cons are:

* It might be harder to get a job in software development/engineering in the future. 

I guess the question I have for this sub is how much of an impact will having a CS major vs. minor have the jobs I am currently interested in, how much of an impact will it have on work in software development jobs in the future, and if I do go for the minor, what can I do to demonstrate skills/interest in programming.

A little more about myself: I go to UChicago and have a fairly strong GPA. I had an internship writing software for the operations team of a ML company after my first year, I did a math REU after my second year, and I have an offer to work in a quantish role at an insurance which I am pretty sure I am going to take for next summer. I also have a hackathon and a personal project involving machine learning in Python. I am currently taking discrete math, statistics, algebra, and a grad-school machine learning class, and will probably continue with the pattern of 1-3 math classes, 0-1 stats classes, and 0-2 CS classes + some GE requirements for the rest of my time in college. If I go for the major, I will take more CS and less math/stats, if I go for the minor I will take less CS and more math/stats."

It may seem late to ask a question such as ""which school should I choose for ED/REA"", but I am a bit stuck here. So the case is this:

Stanford IS my dream school, been there, loved it. Initially, I considered it as my REA school. Yet, after quite a lot of consulting with my parents and counselors (especially my dad), they do believe that even though I REA Stanford my chances of getting in are low. Hence, I should save this ""silver bullet"" to another school. Hence, I turned to ED CMU (tho many of my classmates are also EDing CMU).

Yet, now just a week before the ED deadline, I hesitated. I do believe that compared to REA Stanford, my chances of getting into ED CMU is higher. I originally chose CS major but changed to Information System out of the competitiveness. If I got into CMU, I would happily go there; yet, regret will always lie that I could never have a chance to go to Stanford undergrad since if I got selected via ED, I would have to withdraw all other applications. Even though I also think that my chances of getting to Stanford are low, having a very small chance still means a chance to me.

It's basically a choice between dream and reality. Any suggestions?

I've also got a LOT of allergies. I'm not sure if this info will be relevant.

I started birth control in February 2018. The first 2 months I was sick almost every morning, but it got better. Towards the end of the year the vomiting came back.

In January 2019, my birth control was changed. I took it until April, but ultimately stopped because the vomiting did not stop. I haven't taken birth control since.

Ever since then, vomiting in the morning never completely went away. Generally, I will have bouts of vomiting for a week or two, and then be fine for a while. This time, however, it's been well over a month.

This is a huge problem and is severely impacting my life. I have to complete 300 hours of an internship by the beginning of December and I am barely halfway through. My supervisor and I had to have a talk about my attendance, and my internship advisor just emailed me about needing to talk to me about my midpoint evaluation from my supervisor.

Prior to this, I've always struggled with my health and attendance at school. I've only had one job in the past, and while I did leave voluntarily, I did have to have a  discussion with my manager about my attendance.

Sometimes it's been a matter of just...not being able to get myself out of bed for the day, period. This I chalked up to anxiety/depression. But with this internship, I've been trying really hard. I need to graduate, this degree has already taken me 3 years longer than it should have, and I'm scared of losing the internship. But nearly every morning I wake up around 7, and vomit violently until at least 10. If I'm better by 10, I go to the office at 11 if it's a day I am to go in. Otherwise I will let my supervisor know what's up. She's overall been very kind about this, but is clearly becoming frustrated. I fear she doesn't believe me because the majority of the call-offs have been on mondays or fridays. I agree this might seem suspicious but I swear it's not intentional.

The last 2 weeks have been particularly rough; my supervisor has sent me home for the week twice in a row. I've been crying almost every day because I'm just so sick of being miserable all the damn time. I'm sick all day anymore and usually can't eat OR drink ANYTHING until at least 5pm. But in the evening I almost always feel fantastic.

My parents think the issue might be some combination of my allergies and anxiety playing off of each other. I've gone to the hospital twice the last two weeks (I can't get into my PCP until the middle of November, and Urgent Care centers have been full due to Covid since the hospital doesn't  provide testing). During the first visit, the doctor just berated me for not going to my PCP (again, I can't right now). The second visit was more helpful; they ran tests that all came up normal, gave me Zofran which only somewhat helps, and referred me to the local gastroenterologist. Unfortunately the gastro doesn't accept referrals from the hospital so I have to wait until November when I can see my PCP.

I'm just...extremely overwhelmed. I'm starting to fear that I won't be able to hold down a job and my degree will have been a huge waste of time and money. Beyond my health/attendance issues I'm a good student and take pride in my work. I just cant seem to do it with any consistency. My boyfriend makes enough to support us but I feel guilty putting all of it on him when I'm rarely well enough to even complete housework. Any advice at all would be appreciated.

Tl;dr:  my health has been affecting my ability to finish school and I'm terrified."
ji1b3m,0,2020-10-25,Moving to the US in the near future. Investment advice,PFCInvestmentTA,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ji1b3m/moving_to_the_us_in_the_near_future_investment/,"Hello PFC. I’m a new grad and I’ve just started working. I’m in a bit of a complicated situation and looking to get some potential investment advice.


Starting off with some background. Currently I’m working in Canada but this is a temporary situation and my work expects me to move down to the US once COVID has been delt with (likely when a vaccine has been developed and distributed). Currently the expected return to office deadline and around when I’d likely need to move down is around the Summer of 2021. Obviously, this is a highly volatile timeline and could very easily stretch to 2022 or even 2023 depending on factors outside of my control. Along with this I’m able to stay at home during this time and able to save a decent amount on rent.

Having done a bit of research I know the usual advice when moving down to the US is to liquidate your TFSA and keep your RRSP. I have around 20k contribution room for my RRSP and around 50k for my TFSA because of having previous internships and jobs before graduating but not contributing to either the RRSP or TFSA. 

Now onto the part where I’m in need of some advice. I’m currently thinking of not contributing to my TFSA and leaving that contribution room for when I return to Canada as I’d likely need to liquidate my TFSA in around year or less. At the same time, I’m also planning on maxing out my RRSP so that it can continue to grow while I’m in the US even if I can’t contribute. My work provides contributions each paycheck, but I’d be toping up my RRSP outside of this, so no matching on it.


I’d also like to use the extra crash I’m currently making to make some investments as I’ll likely have around 60k before I move to the US. I’m unsure if I can do anything better than just leaving it in a high interest savings account and then bringing all the cash down to the US when I eventually move.

Does my plan for my TFSA/RRSP make sense and do I have better options than just leaving my extra money in a high interest savings account giving the short timeline? I’m concerned that if I invest it now, I’ll be forced to sell when I move, when the market may be down. Is there a way to keep my investments here in a personal investment account while I’m working in the US?"

I’m thinking about getting my SAS cert and maybe some Comptia certs, or possibly adding a minor in Statistics. I’m even considering getting my Master’s, which is a useless degree without work experience, I’m sure. Whatever I decide, I’m running out of time to land an internship before I graduate.

I’m an older student (I’ll be 26/27 when I graduate) so the stakes feel a bit high, and I’m very nervous about everything.

ji4eqa,3,2020-10-25,"My Sheltered ""Journey"" From College Dropout to Shut-in to Holder of an Engineering Degree and Current Medical Scribe Hopeful - Stuck on How to Address This In My Resume...",noahwhey,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/ji4eqa/my_sheltered_journey_from_college_dropout_to/,"Hi.  Firstly I want to say thank you to anyone who gives their input; it's appreciated more than you could know.  This is a long read, but I feel, given my atypical journey (or lack there-of), that a good resume for me would need to take this journey into account.  Maybe I am wrong.  Also, I hope this is an appropriate forum in which to make a post this long.  Please let me know if not, and perhaps where else to seek advice.

Anyhow, as the title says, I'm a bit stuck right now on how to shape my resume.  I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering grad (2019) who, within the past months, has decided against pursuing engineering.  Instead, I'm finding the field of healthcare much more interesting and suitable as I continue to read about and study-up on it, and I'm considering working toward being a doctor or a PA.

Now... a wall of text about myself and my atypical life situation (the TLDR version is that I was dumb-smart in HS, had budding mental issues going into college, dropped out after the issues worsened, returned with financial support from parents, bounced around to different universities pursuing engineering until I graduated with my ME degree last December, but never interned, and got no steady job experience):

I'm a 28 year old guy who, as you can see from my resume, has decent academic credentials, but very limited work experience doing some odd jobs around town.  In HS I was academically good, but very socially maladapted, wholly naive, and only the faintest bit introspective.  For being sorta smart I was a real idiot.  I went to college for film beginning in 2010, but dropped out in 2011 due to rapidly deteriorating mental health involving extreme anxiety and depression.  I moved back in with my suburban, middle-class parents who promised to put me through college when I was ready to return.  I was pretty much a shut-in for several years as I got a little mental health treatment, did a lot of self-studying / reading / reflecting, worked briefly as a bus-boy, and began preparing to reapply to college.

In 2013 I applied to the same school from which I had dropped out, this time to pursue engineering (being recommended that career by a family friend).  For me engineering seemed okay on paper and was interesting enough, but honestly I never had a strong passion for it - I hoped passion would coalesce through further exposure.  I suppose I was still an idiot.  Nonetheless I studied my ass off so I could transfer to a nearby top mechanical engineering school, but despite doing exceptionally well academically (3.86 gpa overall, 4.0+ gpa math/science) I was denied entry for the summer of 2015.  I took a year-long detour over at a community college to take advantage of its transfer program with the top school, and was finally accepted for the summer of 2016.  At this time, I got some further mental health treatment, met a cute girl with whom I had a 4 year relationship, and kept focused on my studies.  I never worked except as a UPS driver-helper one holiday season (to give myself the littlest credit here, in future seasons I may would have returned to that job if not for a small chunk of my leg becoming a pitbull's breakfast one morning).

Unfortunately, a passion for engineering never coalesced like I had hoped it would, but I stuck out the degree program until my graduation in December 2019.  Afterwards, I applied to 4 or 5 engineering internships / entry-level positions, but got no responses.  My heart just wasn't in it.  COVID hit, I stopped applying, and I went back to the drawing board to figure myself out.  Note that I don't regret my degree in the least; I learned a helluva lot technically, socially (with plenty of group work and projects), etc, and I feel entirely privileged to have gotten the good education I got.

Now in late 2020, I want no further parental assistance.  I'm shooting to be a medical scribe, which is a low-level job that many pre-meds do as a way to get healthcare experience and observe the day-to-day of being a doctor.  Learning about healthcare is truly invigorating for me in a way engineering never was.  Currently I have read most of the way through two scribing textbooks.  My tentative plan would be to hold down such a job for a year or more as I take steps to get into med school or PA school.  I have no prior training or experience in healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my primary questions are these:

\- Given that my current resume is catered toward being hired as an engineer, do I attempt to salvage it in any way, shape, or form?  Maybe I just apply to a scribe job with this very resume since scribing is low-level anyways?  Maybe that would be very dumb..?

\- In my current resume I list out each university I ever attended as a way to explain my timeline over the past decade (i.e. lots of schooling).  Do I need to do this?  Do I need to bring up my age and my ""journey""?  Do I need to bring up or hint at receiving help with mental health?

\- In the coming weeks I am planning to begin volunteering in one way or another.  Should I wait to apply for a job as a scribe so that I can put volunteering experience on my resume, or should I go ahead and apply to jobs right away with whatever resume I can currently muster?

Of course I'm open to other advice too.

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly this is a lot.  If this forum isn't meant for such a long post, I would only ask that I be redirected to a place where I could get help with this.

If no one bothers, I would understand, but for those who do I thank you.

I’ve gone a full month 4 weeks and not said a word to anybody and nobody.
 
I want to reach back out to the other company and see if they would be willing to offer me the original offer and I would move to that city. But I can’t seems to find the confidence to reach back out and not sure how to do so. It’s ben on my mind a while but I just can’t get the courage to reach bout out probably because I don’t wanna get rejected and if I never call I’ll never get rejected. 

So how do I get past this feeling? Or boost my confidence or should I just move in and try to forget it. Even thought it’s like a daily thought of mine?

A lot of times in situation like where I get nervous I’ll like pull up the option to call and then just click it real fast and force myself to do it but this just killing me not to.

Mainly in quality control, but there has been development work involved as well. During my time there, I’ve gotten promoted twice and have support by My peers and directors etc.

I was a cgs student who didnt know what to do. I wasnt sure which major i wanted to go to so i thought cgs was a good choice for me. I ended up choosing bio as my major and by the end of sophomore year i realized i have done NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. I am so behind my other peers with classes and research experience and my grade is TERRIBLE (2.9ish). I made the biggest mistake of my life and ended up getting NC for chem and for my bio class, literally the day before my bio final one of my family member was sent to the emergency room and we were told he didnt have much time left. I had to pack my stuff asap and go back to my home country. So i failed my bio final and took just CR for that. 

Because I could not handle online classes, i decided to take a leave of absence. I am currently back in us with my mom but i live in a very small town in the middle of massachusetts and obvi i have no research job or anything rn. I am taking a community college class to fulfill my credit for chem but seeing my friends do internship and everything makes me feel like a fucking loser. 

I am planning on taking another leave in the spring semester and hoping to go back to campus next fall. But doing nothing every single day i just feel like a complete trash. I seriously havent accomplished anything in my 2 years of being at bu and i wish i could just go back time and change everything that happened to me. Its mostly my fault for everything because i guess i always said im so stressed ahh and got anxiety block me from doing things that others were doing but urg just seeing instagram stories and posts about people doing research and internship makes me feel like a complete loser. 

So yeah this is mostly it. I have no motivation in life rn and i had no where else to rant. I know i couldve studied harder and be more pro-active about finding research jobs while i was in school so please dont shame me too much... i know :( 

And sorry if this is not appropriate for this page. Ill delete it if it made anyone uncomfortable.

Be honest guys. I wanna be realistic. Duke is my dream, but I'm also applying EA to Drexel and 2 UCs. I'm considering BU, USC, Vanderbilt, Rice, JHU as High Reach/Low Target schools, as well as CWRU, UWash, Penn State etc.

Thanks so much y'all, best of luck!


EDIT : I missed a major activity on my list. Do factor in activity 5 into your opinion please

EDIT 2: For those of you who don't have context about UWC, go to this link https://www.uwc.org/
The movement consist of 18 schools worldwide, but I study domestically at the campus in India, although it is in a rural setting in another state, 2 hours away from the nearest city. only about 50 people get selected out of 2500 applicants in India. But the problem is, the school sets the limit at 10 unis worldwide, so I really need to be smart about my choices.

One thing about UWCs is that they're associated with the Shelby Davis foundation which partners with many schools, Duke being one of them, to provide need based financial aid. While I'm not  eligible for that, it does mean that colleges already know something about how well we can adjust and how dedicated we are to making change and they also have some expectations as to what they want us to write in our essay.

EDIT 3: Added a more realistic expectation of my 12th grade predicted. Do use that to provide critical feedback

Edit  4 : Straight up rejected from Duke lol, but I got Drexel and UIUC"

Got the OA. Debugging round all done in 7/20 minutes. Coding Round all done in 20/70 minutes. Attempted workstyle assessment, strictly with Amazon Principles.

Yet Rejected. :-(. Really depressing. 

Can anybody let me know what went bad. What the heck do they want?

Its not like I got a bad profile. I got a fortune 10 company internship, google summer of code, and competitive programming achievements (better at all angles than most new grad hires at Amazon). And I applied on line day 1 after the posting was out. 

I now have 2 applications remaining, London, and Dublin. How can I make ensure that I don't get rejected brutally there, without any reason?"

My name is Jason, I'm the VP of Engineering at Forma AI. Over the past 4 years, I have personally received thousands of applications, interviewed hundreds of candidates, and hired over 20 people from the PEY program alone.

With the new PEY hiring season kicking into high gear and this being a especially stressful time for anyone currently seeking employment, we thought it would be beneficial to bring 13 people from our company together and share some perspectives from people who have been involved in the PEY process from both employer or candidate perspectives.

We're excited to answer your questions about the PEY program, what's it like working at Forma, and hopefully help you land a great gig during this difficult time!

For whatever reason, whether it is my weak resume or the pandemic, it seems impossible for me to get an internship. I will of course keep trying but I should probably plan for the worst. I heard that getting a chemical engineering job with internships is hard enough, so I most likely won't get something after graduating if I don't get an internship.

I am currently working on my computational engineering certificate and I have some experience with programming. I've found my programming and stats classes interesting, so I am interested in doing something in those disciplines. I feel like these are the options I have:

1. Do a masters in Computer Science... I am wary of this option because my experience with programming is limited, and CS masters programs seem very competitive.
2. Do a masters in Data Science... I am hesitant about this option because data science masters programs seem very new, and they look like cash grabs on a trendy term.
3. Do a masters in Statistics... Similar to CS, I don't know if I have the prerequisite coursework or experience to get into a masters program.
4. Work as a lab tech or a manufacturing tech until I can find a job in ChemE. For this, the pay is not good, and I only know a few successful anecdotes."

jigm4l,10,2020-10-26,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (10/26/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/jigm4l/weekly_job_qa_thread_10262020/,"Hi all,

Here is the thirty-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will you in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in most every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

jiguv0,10,2020-10-26,Post Interview Etiquette,JadeGive2Rides,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jiguv0/post_interview_etiquette/,"Just finished an interview for a sys admin intern role, I actually thought it would be with the HR rep who had been reaching out to me but turned out to be a tech interview. In any case, I know the name (and found the LinkedIn) of the senior analyst who interviewed me. 

Is it frowned upon to reach out to someone whose email/contact info you weren't given? I want to send a thank you note but should I just send it to the HR rep instead? I don't have a ton of experience interviewing and just want to know overall tips for any next steps.

Edit: for clarification I don't have the email address of the interviewer"
jih3xf,0,2020-10-26,Amazon vs HubSpot vs Local Dev Company - Internship Offers,freeteehookem,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jih3xf/amazon_vs_hubspot_vs_local_dev_company_internship/,"I have three internship offers and I have a week to decide. I'm really torn at the moment. Here are the pros and cons I've written down:

**Amazon**

Pros:

* Highest compensation
* Brand name on resume for full time recruiting

Cons:

* Team matching is very RNG, heard widely varying experiences depending on what team you're on
* Don't want to work there full time

**HubSpot**

Pros:

* From what I've read on GlassDoor and personal experience talking with them, good culture and WLB

Cons:

* Full time is in Boston, and I don't really want to live in the Northeast. Recruiter said remote is an option, but hesitant to do that (I work better in an actual office vs. remote)

**Local Dev Company**

Pros:

* Good WLB and culture
* Shift clients every couple of months, get to work with new technology, building more than maintaining

Cons:

* Name on resume is weaker than Amazon or HubSpot, most recruiters outside of my city probably haven't heard of them. 
* Pigeonholing myself somewhat to stay with the company after graduation if I get full time conversion.

The potential of full time conversion is a factor for me looking at these companies. If I had to choose which company I would want to work at full time right now, Amazon would be out of the question.

I don't particularly care about total compensation, both for internship and full time, as all of these companies pay more than enough for me to live comfortably. I also don't have any big desire to work full time at FAANG or unicorns simply for the compensation or name on my resume. I put a lot of focus on which company would allow me to have autonomy in my work and not be overly stressed/burnt out.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

jihszi,0,2020-10-26,[Undergrad] What do I major in?,fin_career_act38225,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jihszi/undergrad_what_do_i_major_in/,"I'm a sophomore at a semi-target/target that doesn't offer a business/finance major. I'm fortunate enough to have buyside internships secured over the next two summers, so recruiting isn't as big of a concern as of now. My main issue is deciding what to major in. I've taken a few CS classes, and although I enjoy them, the CS major is incredibly rigorous. I'm definitely interested in the idea of majoring in some combination of economics and the humanities; even if I wouldn't be a CS major, I still would have some strong coding skills. I'm also considering majoring in just pure math. I'm mainly worried that if I won't be as marketable without a STEM major. Thoughts?

* Graduating in December.  
* 3.0 GPA.  
* No internships or industry experience   
* Many personal projects documented on my website/portfolio, but none related to dataflex.  

I’ve been offered a job writing in what seems to be a totally dead language (dataflex). If I’m being honest, I don’t want the job. I want to work in a totally different field of CS, but I’m concerned if I turn it down I won’t be able to find another job. If you were interviewing a candidate and saw their only experience involved dataflex would that be a major concern for you? Is it at all feasible to take this job for the experience, work there for a year and then switch fields?

However, this year due to COVID and Virtual Career fairs, I didn't find a lot of students receiving internships at big companies.

Are big tech companies out there still hiring? In that case, has it been relatively slower this year?

I've been asked in my internship to automate a task they do every day.  
I will describe it and I want you to tell me if it's possible and if so to guide me.  

Using remote desktop connection they are connecting to a server having as username the same as the one they logged in in their work computer. I think they have to enter their credentials again for this.  
Run an app which will create some files in a folder named with the current date. Click on a button to start the procedure.  
Run another app. Click on a button. They are being asked to enter the folder name (date) which was created before. Click on another button.  
Log off the server.  
  
As you can see it has already been automated, they just need me to automate it a bit more in order to run completely automatically in a specific time, in case they forgot to do so.  
How to click on those buttons? Similarly how to log off?  
How to run this on the background on a specific time?  
How to save their credentials with safety? Maybe ask them the first time, but they need to be encrypted.  
How to debug this program? I mean it's very important task and I can't think of way to test it properly without interfering. It's a task that needs to be done daily (working days), but only once by a single computer."

jikst0,5,2020-10-26,Google STEP internship,khoatrinh95,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jikst0/google_step_internship/,"So I applied to STEP internship for next summer 2021. Encountered an issue: before applying I had applied for a SWE internship at Google (which did not have the essay questions) and it saved my application information. When I applied for STEP, it asked whether I wanted to use the same info that has already been filled out, I clicked yes and then it submitted my application without giving me a chance to answer the essay questions. I tried to reapply but did not succeed so I guess I'm screwed there...

Whether my application gets sent or not, I just want to know if any of you guys here has done a STEP internship and did you already have experience coding extensively before applying? I know that this is supposed to be for students in first/second year of school but I don't know if they're looking for Google standards which is like first/second year students but with side projects and can solve algorithm+DS questions like a piece of cake. If that's the case then I don't think I'm qualified at all and I would feel better about having screwed up my application.

I went into CS fresh without any coding knowledge so what I know is what I learned from school. The only good thing in my application is my 4.25 GPA."
jil5nq,1,2020-10-26,How do I know whether I'm ready for python jobs or not?,_-JustPassingBy_-,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/jil5nq/how_do_i_know_whether_im_ready_for_python_jobs_or/,"This question may have been asked multiple times in this sub but I hope nobody minds it if I'm gonna ask it again. This is about me.

I don't know how long I've been using Python for. I can tell that I'm pretty new or so? I learn via projects aka creating projects to learn something whether it be someone's else idea or mine.

Things I know:

1) PySide2 and creating GUI's with it in Qt Creator. GUI's I've made are youtube-dl program that allows you to download music as mp3 from youtube but I recently switched it from GUI to one-click aka click it once and you can download it immediately. It creates folder for you to download to, if it doesn't exist then it creates one and continues. Another one is CPU-Z like GUI modern style but the deeper I got into that program where I had to scrape even AMD site for AMD graphics card, CPU and other stuff then that sh\*t got real hard 0-100. I ditched it and told myself not to do it again in Python because C is the best for that one to tell user about their computer specs and all other kinds of things lower-level language can do. Python can use C libraries but eh, complex for me.

2) Webscraping with selenium, beautifulsoup4 and requests. My knowledge is not that big on webscraping part but I've done it and I got some experience.

Things I know little about:

1) Creating websites with Flask, Django or pure Javascript with HTML &amp; CSS.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started learning how to create a microblog with flask in Python by following this tutorial: [microblog\_flask\_tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) but this topic is hard as hell like this topic slaps hard man. First chapters from 1-4 were alright but from 5 on (I'm at chapter 9 right now) it's hard like holy moly.

I use this website to learn stuff I need to know about to be sufficient enough to start looking for either intern or junior positions: [https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning)

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to be sufficient enough to get the software developer job to earn my living out of it and climb the ladder and hopefully do some good deeds and creations that will help other people or make life easier for people. I have hobbies as well like playing disc golf and doing workout to maintain my body to be healthy and strong. I also plan to try out hardware engineering in the future like creating robots and stuff but I cannot think of that yet without acquiring software dev job and going to great lengths with it.

Who else has been in that situation and how did you figure your way out or did you quit?

I'll appreciate any advice, criticism or whatever comes. Thank you!"

I've completely lost hope, and I'm not sure how to move forward. I've submitted about 80 applications, have gotten a couple of interviews. The lack of work experience seems to be a source of hesitance for the interviewers. I have not tried FAANG yet.

My degree: Math PhD, NOT applied or data-oriented

Sadly: 0 internships, no strong publications

I started to learn Python about 10 months ago. I've taken a slew of data science / ML courses online. I practiced those skills through a project. The project itself was not revolutionary, but I posted it in a notebook anyway. The bulk of the project focused on feature engineering for the ML algorithm.

I started to study more CS (data structures/algorithms) about 2 months ago, because I was starting to realize how oversaturated DS is. I am now thinking of trying to get into software engineering instead, but I also want to be realistic about my options. At the same time, given my weak research trajectory, I probably have no hope for a scientist position.

Should I try to work on an open source project? LeetCode? How can I give interviewers more confidence about my academic background? Beyond data structures/algorithms, what should I know for SWE?

Did I get into CS too late? And are there other PhDs here struggling?"

I'm a Junior in college and was wondering if it's possible to go into DS or DA with a business background. I have a decent GPA (3.2) but I have found it extremely hard to try and land an internship. I've heard of some friends getting hired with no background in programming and it seems that everybody I know has had a much easy time with this than I have. I have decent background in python, excel, and Tableau I feel that I'm definitely qualified for an entry level position.  Is it necessary to get an internship directly related to the field of DS / DA to get a decent job? Is a Finance degree worthless in the field of DS/DA?

I’m mostly struggling to decide between Tableau and MongoDB because I want to work at a tech company.

I’m a junior right now, and ideally I’m looking to get a full-time offer for whenever I intern. For me, the most important things for full-time are culture, work-life balance, and stability. I think all 3 companies are pretty good in these departments, so now I’m not sure. If anyone has interned or work full-time at Tableau or MongoDB please PM me; I’d love to hear about your experience!

Tableau
- Palo Alto
- highest pay (only by a little)
- team matching is very good, most interns get their first or second choice
- I’d get to choose team/location for full-time. I’d probably choose Seattle bc that’s where their HQ is
- part of Salesforce (can be good or bad.. opinions?)

MongoDB
- New York City
- lowest pay out of all three (but only by a little)
- team matching is okay, not as much freedom as Tableau but still pretty good
- have heard very good things about their intern program (ie: fun events)

Capital One
- McLean, Virginia
- not sure about team matching
- seem to have a really good culture as well

I’d also love to be in a big city (like nyc or Seattle) but given that the internship will most likely be (at least partially) remote, I’m not sure this is a big factor. Any advice/opinions is appreciated!

Also, please don’t ask when I applied or the interview timeline because I didn’t keep track, sorry!"

I've had to move to a small military town (United States), and the options for education, much less internships here are VERY limited. I won't be able to really leave until 2023.

**Considering these circumstances, how can I prepare to enter the workforce? Are there any particular certifications or training programs that would give me a leg up?**

If it helps to know, I do have hands on experience in Rocketry (in a leadership role for two different successful projects) and I have been learning Javascript during my free time. I also had an internship last year that dealt heavily with project management and event planning.

I like that my degree is flexible, so I'm not laser focused on an exact position yet. I'm definitely interested in paths with my degree that focus upon Computer Science. Ultimately, I'd like to end up in some form of project management.

I'm asking here because my degree is newer to my university so my career counselors have no idea what to recommend for my degree. I've searched online for advice, but it's either really generic advice or ads for the degree at different colleges."

I’m pretty far into the interview and selection process for the internship, but I just want to make sure that this is a fundamental and beneficial path for what I want to do. I would like to become a licensed financial advisor after I graduate, and this internship will mainly push me to sell life insurance to family and friends. Is this internship going to help me gain useful knowledge, or will I just become a master at cold calling and pushing my friends and family to buy an expensive life insurance plan? 

If this internship doesn’t seem beneficial to some of you, why is that? Also, if that is the case, what jobs, experiences or internships should I look towards to increase my progress of being a financial advisor?

Hi everyone,

I wanted to get my profile reviewed for admission to MS CS courses in Fall '21. I want to specialise in the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision; however, due to a lack of research experience I could take up additional coursework and research experience at the university. I wish to apply for software engineering jobs, especially those which require a masters degree and some research/industry experience in deep learning and computer vision, post graduation.

**Profile:**

1. *Undergraduate*: B.Tech. in Information Technology from a regional Indian college(think MNNIT, NIT Surathkal)
   1. Overall GPA: **8.04/10**.
   2. Two backlogs, both in the first semester, which were cleared in the first year itself.
   3. My GPA plummeted in the first three semesters because of innumerable reasons, and later I had to take medication because of them, due to which it improved steadily. My GPA record is as follows: 7.12(post backlog adjustment), 7.86, 6.67, 8.28, 8.21, 8.38, 8.95, 9.
2. *Internships:*
   1. One-month internship as a backend developer at an India-based MNC.
   2. Two months internship and six months internship as a software engineer at a US-based MNC(think Juniper, Arista).
3. *Work experience*: Currently working as a software engineer for 3 months at the above mentioned US-based MNC.
4. *Research Experience*: No research papers, publications, or experience.
5. *Projects*: Projects in deep learning, full-stack development, and image compression.
6. *EC*: Decent extra-curricular, though they won't make any difference, I believe.
7. *Test Scores*:  
   1. GRE: 322(169Q/153V/5.5AWA).
   2. TOEFL: 105 (29R/24L/25S/27W).
8. *LOR*: Can't really say what value they would hold.

The course is fine, I've made some friends online while studying and everything is good as far as the academic stuff is concerned. I've been thinking a lot about my future career these past few months, and if I really want to be a programmer. 

I'm considering going into investment banking/finance/global markets. The salary is not something that I'm thinking about so much as both careers make lots of money over time, but I'd really want to work in a job which is more fast paced and interesting than sitting at a screen fixing bugs in code and writing new code. Some websites say that the degree subject doesn't matter, just the classification and other things like the applicant's CV and personality which has made me think about it more 

I have considered working for a bank as a developer, but I just feel like that's a compromise that won't give the benefits of either career if that makes sense

I would like to know if anyone has been in my position or if anyone has any advice about these things. Would it be a good idea to do two internships for these types of careers and add them on my CV?

This recruitment season, I'm blessed with 3 really good SWE intern offers. Right now the choice is between Lyft, Salesforce, and Flatiron Health and I feel like they all have their Pros and Cons. My personal preference is Lyft &gt; Salesforce = Flatiron Health. However, my parents and some friends suggest going to a more stable company like Salesforce right now is a safer bet. Let me know what you guys think! P.S. My school does not have a coop program, so I can only choose one internship for next summer.

Lyft (SF, team undecided but I can choose)

1. Pro: Dream company, return offer rate is high. Has an office in NYC. Great culture and talent. Moves fast but work-life balance is still good. 
2. Con: not really stable right now, even if covid goes away soon, ride-sharing is still kind of unprofitable. I am an international student and getting laid off is detrimental. 

Salesforce (SF, data infra team)

1. Pro: stable company, return offer rate is high
2. Con: the team I was placed on does data engineering, which is not what I want to do, and I have never used any of the tech stacks(Scala, Spark, Hadoop) before, so I am concerned about my performance. If I do get a return offer, it's likely that I'll be placed on the same team. The culture is a little too laid-back, not sure if it's a good place to be for my first job out of college. 

Flatiron Health(NYC, team undecided but I can choose)

1. Pro: NYC!!! Culture and people seem nice. The work(cancer-related tech) is for a good cause. 
2. Con: Because of covid, they only gave 4 out of 13 interns return offers this year. Not sure if the same thing is going to happen next year. Not a big-name tech company for an internship. 

Option 4: Keep recruiting... I have a facebook and microsoft interview scheduled soon... "

I've had one fast food job for about 3 years, and another automotive job that focused big on sales so i have quite a big experience with customer service and selling, a long with a huge personal background with computers/ troubleshooting. I currently don't have any certificates in IT such as A+ but will be working towards passing those tests soon.

I have not been offered a position yet, but an offer to attend some sort of training, and honestly i think if i go ill be able to get a job based on what I've read online about the company (they hire anyone).

I have heard nothing but bad from this company, high turnover rate, very high stress, just seemed like a really bad bs environment, that seems to familiar with my last job with in person sales, but this is customer service over the phone sales. 

I really dread going into another job like this but, i feel like this could be a great entry level IT job that could get me into the door of other big companies in the future when im done with school.

I quit my last job mostly because it was bs, but also because i wanted to finish school faster (2 more years) but i believe this company I'm looking at only offers full time, so ill have to cut back on school if i do pursue it. which is a big downside to me.

I guess my question is, with an information systems major, should I take this opportunity to better my future? I'm afraid of not being able to get an internship while in school or having no experience with a bachelors degree and this is really the only reason why I'm looking into it.

i currently live with my parents with secure jobs, and im lucky enough to not worry about any bills or moving out anytime soon ( im 22 ). 

i dont know, what do you guys think? i mean i could quit if i dont like it but, i dont know maybe i should just focus on school and getting an internship next semester?"

Coronavirus was looking quite bad so I utilised my dual-citizenship/family in Australia and booked a flight to Sydney to look for work/lay low until it all blows over.

I found a job here quite quickly but the salary scene in Australia is just so much different from the States (making 68k/yr + 9.5% superannuation). I've been working for a little over a month now and I cannot stop thinking about if I am making a mistake/ missing out on much higher salaries in places like Silicon Valley/Austin/Seattle/e.t.c. I know this is an unhealthy mindset and that there are so many variables in play(such as being with family), but I think I could just use some general opinions and advice on maybe what someone else would do in my situation.

I love Sydney/Australia and have had a better time in the last few months than I've had in years back in the States, but the country/city is just outrageously expensive with such little compensation at the Junior level for SWEs. I'm wondering if it's in my best interest to begin looking for jobs back in the states, or maybe just to gather a few years or so of experience here in Sydney where I'm safe from the Covid shitstorm and then look back into my US options in the future...

&amp;#x200B;

Would really, really appreciate any and all advice on this matter as it has been stressing me out.

Thanks"

So 100+ job applications and a couple interviews later I got a summer internship offer at an insurance corporation as a Transformation Management Analyst Intern specialising in data architecture. It pays 20/hour and is located at the heart of downtown, which is sweet. I never really thought I'd make it to a decent internship this summer, so this was a nice surprise. However, I also got 2 HR recruiting interest letters. One from West Monroe (30/hr) and one from Northrop Grumman (?/hr) -- still waiting for interview contact tho. Not sure if these mean anything and if its worth waiting around. I also just did an interview with an investment portfolio firm. How long does one take before accepting an offer? Should I ask how much time I have? Do I risk not getting any other offers? I'm confused as to how this all works. Thanks"

I graduated 3 years ago. I got two small internships in graphic design and digital communication. After that, I didn't find anything and in the meantime, I'm working in a supermarket when trying to find a real job

However, I'm someone who learn very fast, that people really enjoy working with because I get the job done and I really want to work. The problem I see is that 95% of the jobs I want to apply or that I apply are requiring 3-5 years professional experience, which I don't have. The other 5% I apply, but get no answers because I guess they are finding more experienced people than me...

I remade my CV 2 times with professional advices and I'm customizing a cover letter each time I apply somewhere using the good keyword.

Is the Canadian job market only toward skilled and experienced professional?

I checked at the European market and it looks more open to hire beginners via internship or real job with a beginner salary. I've been actively looking for job for the past 1 1/2 year and even if it's Covid time, I'm really considering starting to apply in Europe or Australia at the end of November to get a job  in 2021. I'm old enough that I don't want to be stuck working in a supermarket all my life.

But that love slowly died in college as I realized that though I had an intense love for mathematics, my education course was boring, lacking, and unmotivating. 


By the time I got to the internship, I had realized that I was not willing to drown myself in bureaucracy to help people learn a required subject nor was I willing to die in a classroom overworked, underpaid, unappreciated with little assistance and full risk.


Honestly, I'm mad and I continue to drive myself mad with this subject. But what do I do? What do I do next now that I have given 4ish years to solely become a teacher than not? What do you do with a math education focused degree? Do you go back and change your focus? Do you look for an occupation that will accommodate your education? Do you just allow yourself to be swallowed by the debt you incurrred? Do you swallow the big pill and be a teacher knowing you could die from a bullet, covid, or misery?"

i just wanted to ask few questions so that maybe you guys will HELP ME understand better.

so i recently got an internship in a company as a data scientist/data engineer. i was given a task where i have to store a video, an audio, an image and a text into a single numpy array combining them all into one. It could also be a series of videos into one numpy array or images or audios or texts.

I could not understand it and asked them why would they want to do that and in answer they told me that it was to make a training set to train the model.

does that make any sense? or i am not understanding it properly. As far as i understand i believe that we just store data lets say videos or images or a text files from different sources into our storage and when we need them for training purpose we extract the files. i still cannot understand why they asked me to convert a video into a numpy array.

I was told that thats what data engineers do, that they extract all these different data files from different sources and make them into one so that we can have a training set.

It would really be great if you guys could help me understand it because i am just starting my data science career and i don’t understand fully how these things work. I was also expecting a lot of data cleaning and SQL queries and maybe work on data pipelines but rather i was told to do this task.

1. Went to the best engineering college in India for undergraduate. Fucked my GPA cause I never studied (3.2/4.0)
2. Better than top 0.5%ile in atleast 3 national level exams (ranging from 0.2 million to 1.2 million candidates)
3. Put all of this the line to pursue a career in the civil services (which has a 0.1% acceptance rate out of 0.8 Million). Could not get selected (Ranked in the top 0.3% though). This has caused a gap of 3 years on my CV now. (Its a long and subjective process inherently)
4. I am a jack of all trades right now. I have done a coding internship and a operations internship(Six sigma). I have a lot of other valueless bullshit on my resume. ex. I was in my colleges Swimming team one year, in the chess club next year. Like that.
5. Through my Civil services prep, I have gained a lot of varied knowledge from history to ethics to macroeconomics.
6. I will pursue a MBA starting next year. And I am going to work hard at it to do spectacularly good in the hopes that it makes up for my shitty GPA in undergrad.
7. To make a career in finance, I am doing the following things right now.
   1. Completed the 'Business and financial modelling specialization' on coursera.
   2. Doing the 'Financial Markets' course by Robert Shiller.
   3. Will also pursue understanding AI, ML, NLP techniques.
   4. CFA L1 next Feb. (Was going to give in Dec but Dec exams got cancelled all over India)
   5. After gaining a basic understanding and developing a few skills in the next 1.5 months, I plan on doing a personal project where I apply all these concepts.

I require honest suggestions from you. What improvements can be made to this plan? Anything I am missing out on? Any new additions/Subtractions to be made in this? Anything that i may have missed that will help me?"

I'm fortunate enough to have buyside internships secured over the next two summers, so recruiting isn't as big of a concern as of now. My main issue is deciding what to major in. I've taken a few CS classes, and although I enjoy them, the CS major is incredibly rigorous. I'm definitely interested in the idea of majoring in some combination of economics and the humanities; even if I wouldn't be a CS major, I still would have some strong coding skills. I'm also considering majoring in just pure math. I'm mainly worried that if I won't be as marketable without a STEM major. Thoughts? 

Thank you!"

jj3cv9,2,2020-10-27,[US] Finished the Final Interview for Amazon SDE Internship this Monday. When should I expected to hear from them?,StarDingo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jj3cv9/us_finished_the_final_interview_for_amazon_sde/,"Hello everyone,

Yesterday, I gave the Final Interview for a SDE Intern position at Amazon. I answered all questions well up until the coding question part. I gave my answers according to the LP principles, and the interviewer seemed impressed. The coding question was LeetCode light-medium. 

The question was no that hard, and by the end I had a concrete solution, but for some reason the interviewer didn’t want to continue saying that whatever I had typed was “good enough”. I wrote a complete solution from start to finish and vocally described each decision I made in regards to the solution. I think I did well in that sense. There wasn’t any silence from me throughout the technical question part. At the end, the interviewer pointed out what I would have to add to my solution to make it work for all test cases. Then I asked her a question about her role at Amazon (ML), and that was it.

I knew the complete solution, but the pressure from the interview, and the need to comment each of my decisions seriously messed up my thought process. I don’t think I am getting the offer at this point. I nailed the LP part but didn’t fully solve the technical question.

When should I expect to hear from Amazon?

P.S. I expect many people to start DM’ing me, so here are the common questions that I have been asked by the users in this group: LeetCode medium, no, I have never seen it. The question was not hard, and outside of the interview I can solve questions like this in 10-15 minutes. I have never seen it, and I have solved around ~400 questions total. The rest of the interview was pretty chill, but it seemed like the interviewer was not experienced in taking interviews.

Update: Just received the rejection letter. The interviewer instead of giving me extra 5 minutes to nail the solution, decided to cut me off. Well, the rat race continues."

I made this post because I'm looking for some advice for my future.  I am from Eastern Europe. I finished HS in my country this year. Now I'm at a crossroads. I have 2 options for my future.

The first option is me studying medicine in my country to become a doctor. This is my safe choice. It would take hard studying for many years, but I would have a relatively good life secured by my parents while I'm studying. Plus, I'd be in a very familiar environment where I've grown up in. Working as a doc would also be interesting. The cons for this would be that I would remain in my poor EE country and not go out to explore life. . I would be prone to sinking into comforts and video games to find excitement in my life. My salary would be good relatively for my country, but not really worth all that effort of studying, you know? 

The second option would be for me to study in the US. I have been admitted into a state school along with a scholarship ""honors"" status. It would still cost me around 7k$ a year but it would be covered by my parents. I would be studying Computer Engineering with the choice of also adding in a Physics double-major and staying 1 more year(5 total). The pros of this choice would be that I would be getting a good education and diploma that would allow me to find a job in the US or other Western countries paying a good amount.   I would also be going to a foreign country and exploring a new culture. The problem is that while staying in the US, my legal standing would be delicate, and finding a job after graduation in this market would be very hard. There is a very high chance of me having to go back to my home country if I don't find a job within 60 days, which would defeat one of my main purposes trying to emigrate to a better country.  I am scared of the economic situation and would not like to have my studies go to waste by not being able to find a job. Internship opportunities are also scarce right now as far as I've read online. One more con, also, would be that I find kind of lukewarm about the choice of my degree since I'm not that passionate about programming.

Honestly, I don't know. Do I take the safe choice, or do I go take a huge risk and make an attempt to a completely new life? I would feel so much guilt if this didn't work out..."

For context, I’m a very introverted person, so I prefer to be and do things alone most of the time. I’m not socially inept or shy, I just get tired after two mins of conversation. As such, most of my activities/hobbies are also done alone. My daily activities/hobbies are Python (which includes learning and programming scripts), doing proofs, learning higher mathematics on my own time (relative to the high school system, so think multi variable Calc, linear algebra, analysis, set theory, etc.), and doing what I call “math explorations”. That last one is very hard to explain because it’s so unorthodox compared to other activities, but essentially I rig together new fields and theorems held under certain axioms and ideas then derive and prove results among them. My non-academically focused or “turn-off-your-brain” hobbies are reading, videogames, and occasionally hiking/biking. Okay, back to the problem at hand.

The problem is, I have virtually no *good* ECs besides maybe my volunteer work twice a week at my tutoring center. I competed in mountain biking freshman(?) year, but I was absolutely terrible at it and only went to practices because my parents made me. I went to a couple debate tournaments in sophomore year, but I didn’t really try or care for any of them save one. I also had two weeks of track and field (which I was actually liking for some reason) junior year before I screwed up my knee (followed by COVID closing down all sports). I’ve participated in no clubs. I don’t currently have a job (I worked from August 2018 - October 2019) or internship, started a business, or anything everyone else on this sub seems to have done. I did some robotics stuff in middle/elementary school, but I don’t think that’s particularly relevant because it seems that the spotlight is on my high school years. And I’ve never received anything more than a participation trophy (I got my poem published in a regional magazine though, so.....hooray?) Worst of all, I’ve never had any leadership positions. None. Not ever. The closest I’ve ever been to being a leader is guiding noobs through Destiny raids. I’m serious.

What do I do, o’ sages of r/ApplyingToCollege ? What counts as an EC? Are all the things I’ve listed “good enough”? Can I do anything else within one month’s time? Am I fucked?

(Not sure if it’s relevant or not, but my reach is UCB and my target is UW)"

I go to a US News 50th ranked CS school, but it is not well known so it probably appears even worse to people that don't know the school, 3.9 GPA.

I hope this pays it forward to the next person and helps someone else secure an opportunity they’re grateful for.

TLDR - I didn’t have time to build networking connections b/c I quit my job before having another one lined up, so I built a strong resume using tips and guides from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/cfj41k/8_applications_5_interviews_1_offer_this_sub/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [this webinar recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPoaAMI1CGU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;mc_cid=e89cb27a61&amp;mc_eid=3a48f90897&amp;ab_channel=Holdette) that got me 15 interviews in 75 applications over 2 months.

I \[23/M\] quit my job as a marketing coordinator in a marketing agency in northern Virginia back in August before having another job lined up and I set a goal to secure a job by November. 

Everyone says “networking is everything” and I don’t doubt the value of it, but not all young adults have valuable connections that can be leveraged to get a job. Realistically, I knew I couldn’t develop professional connections quickly enough to get me a job within my brief timeframe of 3 months, so I focused my efforts on the traditional application process and making my resume stand out amongst others.

I have decently strong experience for my age (1.3 years of post-grad agency work, host of my own music podcast, 2 internships, 2019 college grad), but there were certainly more qualified applicants on most the jobs I applied to. 

I found a pair of reddit posts from an [ex-recruiter for several large companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and a [20-something young professional](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/cfj41k/8_applications_5_interviews_1_offer_this_sub/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) that each give very helpful resume templates and advice. I immediately saw increased responses in my job applications after applying their tips to my resumes!

Additionally, this [webinar recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPoaAMI1CGU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;mc_cid=e89cb27a61&amp;mc_eid=3a48f90897&amp;ab_channel=Holdette) came across my LinkedIn feed and it made me feel like Thanos finding the final infinity stone. The webinar features recruiters from Google, Tesla, and a few other large employers talking about what they look for in resumes. Hearing tips straight from knowledgeable, young, intellectual recruiters at desirable companies was a gold mine of information!

After applying these elements and tweaking my resume accordingly, I began getting interviews back on 1 in 5 job applications, and some weeks I had an even better rate of success than that! I had so many interviews in September that I probably spent as much time interviewing as I did actually applying to openings! I eventually received and accepted an offer that I was very excited to get in early October and I’ll be starting in just a few weeks!

**For anyone else betting on themselves right now, I hope I’m a sign to you that you made the right move!** I cannot tell you how glad I am that I bet on myself and quit my agency job without knowing where I’d land. It was scary, but faith in myself, a willingness to learn, and putting in the effort to make it happen got me very far. Now, I’m so happy to be further building my hopes into reality! There’s a lot of external factors in this process besides us and that’s important to acknowledge, but that doesn’t neutralize our own potential to overcome challenging circumstances and end up in a place that we’re excited to be at.  

Aside: If you’re wondering, here’s a few more details about my own job search:

1) I was applying to mostly jobs in the marketing and HR fields as those are my two largest career interests.

2) I was applying through LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs, and Indeed almost exclusively and found quite solid success with each of those engines. 

Moral of the story: PLEASE INVEST EFFORT INTO YOUR RESUME – IT IS SO WORTH IT!! Yes, the modern job search and application process might be an annoying and tiring process, but with faith in yourself, control of your ego, and a willingness to learn, it is a process that you can still manipulate to get yourself somewhere you’d like to be. You can do this!"

I’ve a finalist for a full-tuition scholarship, but to do it I have to ED for a school I’ve never visited. The school is great for the majors I THINK I’m interested in (Asian studies, Nueroscience) along with pretty much just being a awesome school overall. But what if I’m actually a natural-born engineer ( which the school doesn’t have)? What if a liberal arts education is not for me, and I have to transfer? Is TRANSFERRING even a Viable plan?? AND I HAVE TO KNOW BY TOMORROW

* gotta breatheee inn and outtt*

Im a pretty average stat gal who’s been given the opportunity of a lifetime, but I’m getting cold feet. Or maybe going with my gut is right direction. Please tell me if I should either be thankful,or if I’m selling myself short. I don’t think I’m selling myself short, cause honestly on the academics side I was a resoundingly “OK” student. I do think I tried my best, so I’m at peace with my GPA.

Look here:
UW: 92% W:4.68 ( idk what that is as a percent)
SAT: 1450

ECs are pretty good though
T10 research 
3 years hospital internship
3 years volunteering in art council youth council creating events, fundraising etc.
International, national, computer science award , state HOSA and foreign language awards
President of foreign Lang honors society, and 2 clubs

This opportunity is huge cause the scholarship is awesome even without the whole “paying tuition” thing, but I’m broke. I feel like I’m have to do it. I need your guidance. :( 

Please tell me if I should:
A. Take the scholarship, ED and run with it
B. Don’t ED if you aren’t sure
C. Input your idea here

PS: If anyone is a little confused why I call my GPA SAT ok, when it might be viewed as a good GPA please know I’m having a moment, and I’m really thankful for your help. Brain bad. No sense. :0 thank you again"

The minimum requirements are an Associates degree with some background experience preferred. I am about to graduate with my Master’s degree and just competed a relevant internship this past summer. The hiring manager seems excited about me as a prospect, but the pay is only $13/hour until I would transition to a full-time employee after a few months. Even the cheapest affordable housing apartments in the area would eat up 50% of my income. I would be hesitant to accept an offer at the current rate, preferring at least $16 an hour given my education and professional experience. I don’t want to dip into my savings just to afford the basics.

Is the final interview an appropriate time to request a higher hourly rate than the one listed in the job description?

3rd year biomedical engineering student here. To preface this, I don't know what I hope to gain from writing all of this, its mostly just me venting my frustrations and inadequacies because I don't have anywhere else to go for this.

For quite some time now I have been feeling like i'm falling behind my peers in terms of preparation for our future careers. I haven't had any success in getting an internship, and I have most definitely burnt out of school as I can barely manage to sit down and do the minimum work to pass my classes. Im under enormous pressure from my family as my siblings both have great careers lined up for them, meanwhile, while I am an engineering student, I just feel like I haven't been accomplishing anything towards starting my career. I can't go to my parents about my feelings or frustrations because the response I can guarantee I'll get is ""You need to work harder.""

Looking at most of my classmates, a majority of them are getting their second internships, have all kinds of different technical extracurriculars, meanwhile I sit in my apartment all day, burning time aimlessly. Being in this pandemic has taken a huge toll on my mental health and I'm starting to feel like i'm doing all of this work just to end up unemployed with student loans. 

If there are other bioE or any engineering students here who are pursuing a career in biotech, or have worked in biotech already, I do have a few questions for yall. What would you say is the best way to get relevant technical experience that recruiters look for in interns/job candidates? I have experience with python and MATLAB, but beyond that I don't have any technical skills that would make me a better candidate for an internship. What would you say was the most helpful skill you learned which you made use of in an internship/job? Also general advice for a struggling engineering kid trying to make something out of himself.

Thanks for reading my soliloquy, sorry if its too sappy."

i’ve been slowly realizing that i’m not particularly passionate about ML, and i’m looking into possibly switching into cogs HCI (minus the design minor, it’d probably be redundant). i find UX design and things like that interesting so it lines up pretty well as far as i know. it also wouldn’t be too difficult to switch, given that i’m getting through lower divs right now

however, i DO want to better my coding skills bc, imma be real here, i am not very good at coding. i really think that a solid knowledge of CS is going to be super important in the future. i’m considering doing a CSE minor if i switch into HCI, but one thing making me apprehensive about it is that i’ve heard about how the minor is really intensive and it isn’t really worth it?

i’m going to stick with the ML internship and see if i actually do like it enough to stick with cogs ML, but i don’t really know what to do if i don’t like it as much as i hope. ML is a fascinating field in theory but i truly can’t imagine myself dedicating my life towards studying it, and honestly, my dad kinda pushed me into ML bc of the career opportunities

any advice from y’all? i’ll probably talk to major advising, but i’d like to get some second opinions"

However, while the internship does not require a security clearance, the company does require one if you were to become full time. So as a result, the internship offer includes a security questionnaire that is basically asking everything an SF86 would ask, but not officially. The purpose of it is to see if you are someone who could get a security clearance in the future to work full time. However, the only question I am worried about is the fact that between the ages of 18 and 19 (right before my 20th birthday), I had marijuana somewhere around 5-10 times if I had to guess. While I would like to tell the truth, I am worried this may jeopardize my internship offer, or even jeopardize getting a security clearance in the future. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on this? Based on my research, since I haven't had marijuana in about a year (I'm almost 21), I should be in the clear for the most part since I had it extremely infrequently early in college and have shown that I am no longer interested in it.

EDIT: There are two questions on the questionnaire related to polygraphs, and essentially it says ""if necessary, would you be willing to take a counter-intelligence polygraph"".

So, I am days away from potentially accepting my current and only internship offer (which I am so glad and fortunate to have as my previous semesters of recruiting were absolutely terrible). The only real issue with this offer is that it is in an industry (processing and manufacturing - industrial) that I do not find super interesting but I think it better others (which is why I gave it a chance). I am very interested in the fields of electro-mechanical products, control systems, and robotics/mechatronics. Additionally, unlike some of my friends, I was only given about 2.5 weeks to think and decide about this offer (after I asked for an extension). Personally, I do not believe that is enough time for anyone to decide. I also feel that I am slightly pressed to accept this offer because I haven't had much luck in the past, COVID-19 downturn, being an international student in the US, and a general burnout from all the recruiting and schoolwork. 

I have had interviews with other companies as well and most of them have already rejected me or have not responded yet. As of right now, I only have one more interview lined up for tomorrow but based on the position, there is a good chance I will not accept the offer from the company I am interviewing with. So, as such, there is no guarantee I will for sure land another opportunity especially in the field of electromechanical/mechatronics or robotics. 

However, seeing as it is still October, there are still many more companies (that are in the industry of greater interest) that still have to begin interviewing and go through the recruiting process. Since I am a MechE, I was told that most companies send out offers around January - March due to the nature of the work and it is different from software where many people get offers during fall.  

Now, the dilemma I am facing is: Should I accept this offer, but keep applying to companies in industries of my interest and if I get an offer there, renege the current offer? OR Should I risk it by declining the current offer and keep applying to other places even though there is a good chance I might not land another internship for this summer? 

I'd like to believe that reneging is alright if I find a opportunity better suited to my interests and goals, but I also want to receive real advice and insight  from you people :)

**TL;DR:** Have a (relatively ok/good) internship offer from a company in manufacturing/processing with an upcoming deadline. But would rather work in a different industry (mechatronics, electromechanical, etc.) and so should I renege my offer when that opportunity arises or not to accept the current offer and keep applying as usual?"

I’m taking an intro to CS class this semester (java) and I feel like I’m learning a lot and overall am satisfied with my major change and progress. But I’ve been watching this sub for a few months and I feel like the clock is ticking on internships and the like... at the same time, I don’t know many people in this major at my school (online class) to talk to and I’m just pretty stressed and confused/don’t know where or how to start. 

I have questions such as - should I even try to apply to an internship in the spring? I will take data structures and calculus in the spring, it’s impossible to take any other CS classes since that’s a prereq. And I’ve started doing some leetcode. I also know python - learned it by myself this past summer - and am going to brush up and teach myself more of that. 

What else should I be doing at this point? And does anyone have any general advice on what I should do to make the most of my time?"
jjgr8h,1,2020-10-27,"Who do I bring to a wedding, if anyone?",adamjocon,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jjgr8h/who_do_i_bring_to_a_wedding_if_anyone/,"First time posting in this subreddit! I (23M) got invited to an out-of-state wedding in March, date potentially getting moved for safety reasons. I'm not one to play around with other people's health and lives, especially since I now know multiple people who have gotten sick from an ill-advised wedding. If it's not safe, I won't be going, but right now I'm playing it by ear (as are the bride and groom, who are ready to move the date).

That being said, this is a dilemma I'll have if the wedding goes off safely and without a hitch.

It's a wedding of a friend of mine who I did an internship with, and she invited me and a group of 3 other people (all women) who did the internship together. It's my first time getting invited to a wedding as an adult and not just as an extension of my family, lol. When we got our save the dates, we were all single, and talked about getting a hotel room together to save money and essentially going to the wedding as a group. However, since then, all of them have gotten serious with boyfriends and plan on taking them as their plus ones, and I'm left the single one in the group.

I'm really not sure if proper wedding etiquette dictates I should bring a date in this situation; obviously, now they're all probably going to want to get a room with their boyfriends, and I'd never want to third wheel one of them, but it also feels weird to just get a hotel room by myself (plus, it's a little pricey). But do people bring plus ones that aren't dates?

My original goal of finding a boyfriend before the wedding isn't going too hot (rip), and I thought about asking a close male friend of mine to come as my date; he's also gay and I've always had a little bit of a crush on him. I don't know if that'll be weird, especially since he Truly doesn't know anyone there, would have to travel out of state with me, and he doesn't know I'm into him (hopefully). Not to mention, the bride has mentioned her family is mildly conservative, and while they don't seem to be openly homophobic or anything, I wouldn't want to put him into an awkward/uncomfortable situation if they get weird about it.

My female best friend has half-jokingly offered to go with me, as this is the kind of thing we've done for each other before, especially accompanying each other to things so we don't have to go alone. But I've also never heard of someone bringing just a friend as their date to a wedding, especially one where they wouldn't know anyone.

What should I do? Should I ask my guy friend, take my best friend, or go solo? Navigating one of my first big social events as an adult and any advice would be appreciated!"

I usually receive coding challenges maybe 40% of the time and I've been trying my best to prepare for them by doing LeetCode practice. However what concerns me is that I am taking a very long time to complete the Easy difficulty problems and I don't know if this is normal or not. I've taken the intro programming class at my school and data structures and am currently taking discrete math and I've had numerous project experiences throughout highschool and from hackathons. However, I am still taking 1-2 hours to do the Easy difficulty ones and sometimes can't even finish the problem without looking at the solution. Can anyone give me some advice on how I should go about doing coding practice in a more systematic way so I can improve? It just feels like I'm wasting all my coding challenge opportunities and also feeling heavy imposter syndrome having done avg-ish in my CS courses (A in Data structures, B in the intro course) but struggling on the basic leetcode questions :("
jjioho,5,2020-10-28,Experienced a rude interviewer. How to proceed?,iridescentt_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jjioho/experienced_a_rude_interviewer_how_to_proceed/,"TL;DR: One of the interviewers was rude, condescending, and generally unpleasant throughout. Should I email the recruiter and tell her I feel this position isn’t a great fit for me?

This was supposed to be the second (and final) interview after what I felt was a successful phone interview. The recruiter (let’s call her Michelle) said that today, I’d have a second interview with her and the regional director, whom I’d be working with closely (let’s call him Bob). I was to prepare a presentation on a psychometric assessment that would test employees’ analytical skills - which I double confirmed with her. I did think it was a super short notice, but I was eager to impress them.

Cue today. I had prepared a lot for the interview, but there were some technical issues on my end at the start. Bob had looked impatient and done-with-it from the very beginning. Never mind, I could still wow them.

That never happened. Bob cut me off multiple times with condescending comments. I was asked to introduce myself several times because of said technical issues. After the third time, he just went “Stop stop stop. I’ve heard enough. You went to ABC University right? Yeah, so did I.” He then asked why I applied for an internship when I’d already graduated. “People usually go for full-time jobs after graduation.” In my defense, the description didn’t say students only (which I told him). And I know plenty of people who did internships after graduating because, guess what, companies are stuck on hiring only people with experience for full-time positions.

He also asked me why I did my internship at my college department, saying that people usually do it outside, unless they can’t get a placement. I politely refuted this, saying I got a job offer at a renowned organisation but turned it down because after interviews and meeting the supervisors of each, I felt my college department was a better fit for me. He said it seemed I was scared of venturing outside my comfort zone and only wanted to stick to what was familiar to me. I didn’t disagree, saying that the me 3 years ago was indeed stuck inside my comfort zone, but that I’ve worked on it and I’m much more open to new opportunities and experiences now.

I think what was maybe the kicker was when he said my presentation wasn’t what he was looking for. He had apparently expected me to come up with 5 questions that would immediately be able to gauge a candidate’s analytical skills. Lol. Yesterday, I asked Michelle this exactly - “Just to confirm - I am to present on a psychometric assessment that tests employees’ analytical skills. Is that right?” and she replied, “Yup, thanks.” So what the hell?

To be honest, I wasn’t able to retort a lot of his rapid fire questions, even though I had perfectly valid answers for them all. This is mostly because I had such a different image of what the interview would be like, so when he kept on pressing me, I was really caught off guard. Bob ended the interview by saying they’ll be in contact to inform me if I get the job or not, but I don’t care at this point.

I don’t know what Michelle and Bob had discussed, but how is it my fault if there’s miscommunication between the two of them? Michelle asked for X, I delivered X. He was so rude, condescending, and overall just an asshole throughout. I don’t care if this is an “interview tactic”. It’s counterproductive. And I don’t want to work in a place where the boss feels like he needs to test me for me to do my job, anyway.

I cried really hard after the interview. Bob being rude is one thing, but it’s also the fact that I’ve tirelessly been applying to jobs for almost a month, tailoring my resume for each company, learning as much as I can about each of these companies, prepping for interviews... only for this to happen. I kind of feel like I’m over it.

My question is, should I email Michelle and tell her that I feel I’m not a good fit for the position? I don’t want to waste time. And I don’t want them to think I’m waiting on their answer, or that I’d be disappointed if I don’t get the job. Would this be the smart thing to do, though? Or should I just let it be?"

2. What about less technical internships? (product/project management)
3. If I have taken the same important classes that CS majors have taken (ICS 46, CS 161, etc), is it likely that recruiters will undervalue my technical skills just because I'm a BIM major? 
4. What are some things that I can prepare myself for once I graduate? Any words of wisdom and stuff of that sort.

jjjbbq,43,2020-10-28,Should I continue learning Data Science &amp; Machine learning or should I focus on other areas of CS?,pytoast,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/jjjbbq/should_i_continue_learning_data_science_machine/,"Hi! I'm in my last year of high school and I'm going to get my bachelor's in Computer Science &amp; Engineering (from the best university in my country, Romania, I hope). 

Throughout the last 4 years I've been studying computer science, mostly algorithms, data structures (graphs, linked lists etc) and web dev(mainly front end, didn't really touch back end that much). I also had the opportunity to do an internship in Java (and a little bit of MongoDB) last summer.  I will probably do another internship at the same company next summer because the company is in the same city as the university I want to attend (I don't plan to work during university though).

I like coding and I find it fun, but I don't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. Instead I've recently discovered Data Science, I've started learning about it (currently doing some panads and numpy stuff) and I find it very attractive as a future career. Also I've always dreamed about having a career in research and I've found out about bioinformatics, which from my understanding has a strong connection with data science/analytics. 

I guess my main question is, should I continue learning data science or should I stop and restart learning about web dev, which I currently kind of dislike (but I guess if I get into back end it would be a little different). As I've already mentioned, I'm in my last year of high school and I only have about 5-6 hours a week to study things for myself, other than school stuff, so I have a little bit of fomo i guess.

I am asking this question because I got kind of ""scared"" of some posts from this subreddit, saying that there aren't that many opportunities in Europe for DS, or that there are too many people wanting to work in data science / analytics / all that stuff and I don't want to waste my time learning something that won't help me. I plan to move to Ireland / UK / Switzerland after finishing my bachelor's (and master's probably) if that matters.

TL;DR; I'm still in high school and I'm wondering if I should continue learning data science or if I should focus on something else because this subreddit kind of scared me(I guess?). Thanks."

*  I was the bookish nerd until last year of engineering 
* Started writing code to build things in the last year
* Luckily got a job in one of the ""mass recruitment"" companies
* Got offered their Gold tier so I could skip training and join workforce on Day 7 and get 2.5x the salary offered to freshers because of communication &amp; partially code
* ""Development"" work is adding small features to old code, changing organization practices (moving to Jira, Github integration, creating CI/CD concept, Wiki-fying documents, etc).
* Realize I suck at Data Structures and Algorithm.
* Tired of monotony and stagnation, tried learning DSA but even the basic question that requires some ""logic"" looks like a failure.
* I am restarting my algo and DS journey. But is there anything else I can do to get a job? Should I look at changing fields? If yes, how. I love  management, CX, etc. I do love coding too, but I am not the competitive coder and that makes me believe that I am the impostor Among Us.
* Communication Skill ✅  Presentation Skill ✅  Coding 🆗 DSA  😧

**Long story, long.**

**Chapter 0: The beginning.**

I was great at computers from when I was young. I was no Chintu developing applications and having investors wrestle to reach me, but I did some basic static HTML pages, could figure my way out in fixing computer and internet issues, etc. This got me the prestigious stature of ""geek"" and ""gizmo"" in a household where being able to surf the internet was akin to cavemen discovering fire. Then on, I decided I wanted to study computer science despite being from a school  (rather, board) that did not even have Computers as a subject in 8th, 9th and 10th.

Come 11th, I wanted to take up Computer Science and take it up, I did. The first chapter (and I kid you not) was about introduction to computer science, where we had to rut what a peripheral device is and what a non-peripheral device is. The class was basically a teacher highlighting contents of the textbook that would fetch us marks. I nope'd out. Being the cream student, I had an option to switch to Electronics because the demand for electronics was so low that they had only 1 section with 63 people and were really looking to make that an even number. After a few trial classes, I realized electronics is fun too and I ditched my long term love to study electronics.

I guess somewhere, there was always a zeal to want to learn computers but I did not know the sources.  I knew I could ""learn C/C++"" but what would I do with that was something I never knew. I consulted a couple of teachers in my college regarding this but what they'd suggest is for me to learn it to get good marks, improve my score and get into a good engineering college. 🙄 Their assumption was that the real CS happens in engineering college and 12th does not matter.

I stuck to electronics, scored fairly decent marks and in engineering, I opted for CS. 

**Chapter 1: University. (Can skip)**

For some reason, I thought of University as a magic box where a dumb person goes in and comes out as a ""coder, rider, provider"". But alas, life is no TikTok and I realized it on day 1 when in my Science and Humanities department, I was the only one who did not know a line of code. There were kids who'd be inducted into Mechanical, Electronics, Civil departments and 99% of them knew how to write some code and I was caught off guard, by this. I thought I could wing it and yet again focused only on scoring marks. This is what I was thought whole my life and it did not help that the Director drew a correlation that every kid who scores a 8+ GPA lands up a job that pays them at least 12lpa.

Focusing on marks, studying what ""looked"" important and with a goal to maintain a 8+ GPA, I strictly adhered to rules that would help me achieve my goals. 3 years of this, you could ask me to write an API and I would first see if this was ""in syllabus"" or not. In the 3rd year, we had something called Practice School. This was a term that we borrowed from some IIT / NIT, but proudly wore it on our chests like it was some discovery we secretively made. Practice School is a fancy term for unpaid internship where you could either work for a company, or work under a professor to do some research work for some minor credit. For some weird reason, I was asked about what activity I did apart from academics in every interview that I attended. Did they really expect me to do anything apart from study and score marks? 😲 \\s. So, obviously, I got a great internship in a very good company called the company of friends, located in the Boys hostel.

With an industry internship that went flying while jamming to ""Hum Toh Udd Gaye, by Ritviz"", I was left with no choice but to get a research internship. Thanks to my face, communication and luck I could convince one professor that it was me who discovered gravity and that I have some secretive potentially mind-blowing scientific research going on that would shock Stephen Hawking. I was a Research Assistant to a professor with initials MDD (which co-incidentally also stands for Major Depressive Disorder).

**Chapter 2: Research Assistant. (Can skip)**

Being a research assistant, my job was to build apps to capture data, propagate these apps to a set of users and generate datasets. Not bragging, but I could learn the technology he wanted and build apps very quickly. It was not production quality as this was the first ""project"" I was working on, but it was there. It could house about 100-150 users who actively used the application to log data. Spending more time towards this, I neglected studies a bit. My grades were still the same thanks to the easing up of the portions and subjects. I absolutely loved what I was doing and the fact that I could see a weekly impact when I release a new version of the app was something that gave me immense thrill. The professor, too, was extremely impressed by my efforts and gave me a couple of interns to ""manage"" in order to churn more apps. This was fun, we experimented with multiple frameworks, presented our ""research"" work to a couple of potential ""investors"" and this experience improved my communication, presentation, documentation, coding and every other skill I could think off. In one of the monthly ""appraisal"" scheduled by the professor, I asked him how ""industry-ready"" I was and he gave me compliments like I was the one of the many forms of Lord Vishnu. I was pretty satisfied and I could nail interviews (is what I thought).

**Chapter 3: Placement Season (Please dont skip)**

As 3rd year came to an end, placement season began. If placement season was a mood, it would be the mood associated with ""winter is coming"". First company that opened up doors to an interview was Uber. With a pay package that equates to my family's 2-year pay, they came in with a bang. The first round was an online round. As I read the questions, i could physically feel my hair jump and fall off and the one's remaining grey themselves in order to fool my body that we're old now and death was only a matter of time right now. I could solve 1 question, but most people could solve 2. I discussed this online and found out that Uber is notoriously asking difficult questions and that makes sense because they're paying a huge salary.

I was not aiming for such a huge salary, so I was fine. After this came Intuit, Microsoft, GS, AWS, HP, Cisco, Myntra, Sabre, Shell, Infosys and I could not clear even one of the first coding rounds. Sometimes I got 2 questions right, sometimes I got 1. But all the times I never got the interview. 

I was genuinely depressed and realized that it is time to up my DSA game. This game isn't new to me. I was ""preparing for placements"" by referring to sources like HackerRank (which was the go-to choice of more than 90% of the recruiters). I reduced the time spent on this because I was convinced that my practical experiences will be valued. I restarted my practice and one fine day a small company came to campus. They asked the most simplest coding questions that just tested if you can translate the logic to code.  I could and I got in, after 38 rejections and 1 interview. Pretty much a TWICH-isq company. 

**Chapter 4: The work (Please dont, thx)**

The company that I got into typically trains all the employees for 6-8 months before giving them work. But thanks to my practical experience, I was one of the 10% people who was offered a role to join immediately out of college for a 2.5x increase in pay. I thought my luck is changing and apna time aayega. I joined the company. Next month, I will have completed 3 years in this company. The most ""development"" work I have done is add 3-4 minor ""adapters"" to the existing product and expand support. Apart from that, I aided migration to Jira, Github, setup CI / CD pipelines, got the Wiki culture, etc. It's a very old fashioned place but what I got going for me is that my team is not rigid in their mindset. In the 3 years that I am here, my salary has increased by a grand total of 7% (not annually, overall). 

**The ACTUAL question.**

I am restarting my algo and DS journey. But is there anything else I can do to get a job? Should I look at changing fields? If yes, how. I love  management, CX, etc. I do love coding too, but I am not the competitive coder and that makes me believe that I am the impostor Among Us. I am not looking to go abroad as I am the sole breadwinner in my family and I can barely sustain with my present salary.

Thanks for reading if you did.

jjk5tk,5,2020-10-28,Non CS background and need urgent advice,redpillar87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jjk5tk/non_cs_background_and_need_urgent_advice/,"I was just admitted into an online MSCS program with a heavy emphasis on AI/ML. I don't even have a STEM degree but I performed well in prerequisite math and Computer Science courses. However, I'm struggling mightily with my current Operating Systems undergraduate course despite putting in long hours. This is my first exposure to intensive programming assignments and I'm not getting anywhere with them. However, that course at my school is known for being unnecessarily difficult, with a rediculous curve. 

To make matters worse, I was working full-time as a manual tester before I was furloughed due to the pandemic and I barely had time to work on projects or Leetcode. I only recently started reading the book  Cracking the Coding Interview. Because I'm a career switcher, I wasn't looking into internships until now. I just interviewed for a co-op position and the difficulty of the interview blew me away. I needed guidance on all of the problems. 

It's clear that I forgot a lot that I learned along the way and I need to look almost everything up. I do like coding, I just had very little time to practice it on my own. I wish it was just a case of imposter syndrome, but I haven't done any leetcode and it shows. I'm not sure whether I could even pass a coding interview for an internship at this point. I wanted to code more often on the side but my math classes took a lot of time and I needed to study for other things like the GRE. Many of my CS courses were more conceptual or lighter on coding. I wonder if I was just good at memorizing PowerPoint slides.

I'm having difficulty sleeping and I have no peace of mind. I was working full time and going to school for two years. I never took a break and I maintained a maximum courseload for my situation. And now when I get the big acceptance to my dream school and the initial euphoria wears off, I panic about my future in the field. I was thinking about doing an accelerated degree from WGU before I placed into a top online MSCS program because I could complete it in a reasonable amount of time, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to pass up the offer at the better school. However, the focus on AI/ML makes it seem unlikely to lead to a SWE career without a BSCS. An MLE job would be a dream but I don't know how I could stack up to the competition. 

Should I still join the program and just take one course at a time so that I can spend multiple hours a day on leetcode and on building projects? Or should I try to defer my admission to spend as much time as possible reviewing the basics like DS &amp; Algos? Or even try a bootcamp first? Hopefully, I can ride it out to the point that I fill in any gaps to at least get through the program. Maybe they also add more conventional SWE courses by then.

Despite the good news of getting into the program, I'm worried about my next steps. What can I do to improve my coding skills to not only succeed in grad school but also break into a SWE career? The attrition rate at programs like OMCS (I was accepted into another program) is frighteningly high. I just want to make it to the other side on this career and I'm willing to work 60 hour weeks to get there. Are my worries normal and I just got a late start to leetcode and building projects that I can make up for now? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I got it, everyone struggles in this pandemic. But I don’t know if I can push through all the horrible things that has happened to me this year. Everything is about loss and stress, no good things happened and seems like nothing will. I am losing a close friend (who was still 20 yo) from cancer, I stumble into a hormonal problem, my doctor said I might have PCOS (which means I may not able to have a child in the future, and basically is my nightmare), two months ago almost whole of my family got Covid (thank God we all recovered), I’ve been terrible on my school, I got so stressed with everything that I end up resign from my internship which is embarassing. Me and my friend build a little creative business and we are working on this project which went messed up real bad, like seriously, the clients keep yelling and saying mean things to us since they feel like we’re not capable to do our job. 

What’s more to add? The 2020 still got 2.5 months left, and honestly right now I feel like just sit here waiting for more horrible things come to me with open arms. 

These stress and anxiety got so bad I don’t feel like myself. I just want to feel like myself again, soon. I’m being so distanced to my family, can’t enjoy a conversation with friends without ranting about my problems (which I feel so bad afterwards). It’s like I’m in a hole of self inflicted unfortunate events, and can’t get out of it. Also, cause of the Covid, no therapist are open except for online session (which I can’t do cause I don’t have private space at home, I share bedroom with siblings)."

jjkk9p,3,2020-10-28,The struggle of ‘Zero’ days,crispyvibez,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jjkk9p/the_struggle_of_zero_days/,"Just a quick rant, 

This is my first time posting but some background, I’ve been fighting severe ADHD since I was 9, on my 3rd typed  medication now and I’m still finding new problems to this day so I feel a lot of your pains.

I live a very busy/full schedule, full being in terms of physiological capacity (important). And I’ve been on a what seems like a continuous 4 week burn out, 1 week of mid terms and 3 weeks of high concentration work, and it’s been sucking my soul out. I’m working 15 credit hours a week at uni trying to finish off my last year, I work an internship that’s remote m-th and in person all day fridays then I work a 10-2am shift at a bar on my Saturday nights as my get away and escaped and I’ve got a SO. I just got off not taking meds for 4 days in a row and I’m kicking myself.

One of the things I’ve learned this semester was I have a physiological capacity for the week. Meaning I can only do so much “normal” or general physical tasks life throws at me before I’m so burnt out I have to escape and get alone time to recover. Before this semester I was able to push through most of the time and did what I had  to a suppress whatever burnout would lie a head. Now doing all of my classes online and having this internship, dj gig, and gf at once has started to push me harder than I anticipated and it stinks... it stinks because It’s made me so exhausted. And I feel like I’m just withering away. It’s hard with school because it’s SO easy to daze off or say, “Ik judt download the slides later” and not do it, or just say “I ll get this another day” then something else come up so I have to push it again. The internship is hard because I have to be up for an 8:30 am meeting m-th and I’m a zombie during it and depending on how my week was I may or may not be a zombie the days I’m in my office, but I can push through that because there’s enough pressure to keep me motivated (possible post grad job/looks great being asked to stay working with an internship site). DJing is hard because that’s the thing I look forward to the most during the week and that can distract me VERY VERY easily, plus getting home at 2:30-3 in the morning kills my sleep and medication schedule. And it’s HARD AF being in a relationship. My GF Is EXTREMELY supportive of my disability and is patient but sometimes they might think it’s them that’s burning me out/I’m not doing enough for the relationship because I’m exhausted, it’s not you it’s me! On top of these general terms, the last 3 weekends I’ve had something come up that has pushed me to my breaking point and it always take 2-3 days to fully recover, and it’s usually a lot of sleeping and those days being ‘zero’ days- aka days no progress to completing a task is made. 

The medication I’m on can be difficult to manage too. It destroys my appetite, so those zero days I’m also filling myself to get by through the week ahead, if I take it after 10-11 am I’m not sleeping that night, and if I take it after a big meal within 8-12 hours prior, I’m probably going to dry heave a ton on the come up or straight up throw up... so that’s cool. 

This isn’t going to solve anything but I just wanted to get this off my chest because I know this community understands. Right now, I’m playing catch up on school work, pulling myself together for this mornings meetings, pulling articles together to talk to my GF about how ADHD affects my relationship life and personal life in general to help her better understand this problem I have and how it’s not all her. 

All I want to do is graduate, have a job/start my career and start over and not be committed to worrying about school. But I know I have to work for it to get there and I made the choices I made and knew this would be a busy semester so I’m gritting my teeth and I’m gonna do I have to. 

TL;DR- I’m a college senior ranting about my month long burnout that I take responsibility for."

I'm starting to search for jobs as a Data Analyst but even those ask for 2 years of experience in SQL, Spark, Cloud etc, and to jobs in my background (biotechnology). At this point I must have applied to around 100 offers and no interviews.

I did an ""internship"" working with some people in my home country on a remote basis for a few months, but they ended up ghosting me, so I'm not even sure if that qualifies as experience in DS.

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science a few months ago and am currently living at home with my parents. I chose my major without much thought and in the end mostly because it was expected for me to go to college and CS seemed like a safe way to a comfortable life. I never really stopped to consider alternative career options or really branch out. Even though I had to somewhat force myself to get through school, I managed to finish with a couple internships under my belt and a good GPA.

I don't really want to get into a debate about whether it's better to work to live or live to work, but recently I've been applying to full time opportunities and the question of whether there's something out there that I would be more suited for has really been bothering me. I can't say I have any real grips against coding but I don't get much satisfaction out of it and the work just feels kind of mundane or frustrating to me.

From reading Reddit posts as well as talking to family and friends, it seems like tech is where everyone wants to be. I come from an upper middle class background and don't have any work experience outside my internships so I wonder if I just lack just perspective from never having to do any real hard work.

I'd like to try something different, especially since I'm still young and have nothing tying me down, but at this point I feel like I don't have the experience in anything else to land a comparable job to what I'd be able to get coding, and I'm also scared of finding a job only to dislike that as well and want to go back to coding. It seems like it would be difficult to try to return to tech if I leave.

I was wondering if anyone would have any advice as to what some good next steps would be?

Thanks for any responses!"

I am applying for a few different US based internships and really want to improve my chances, as I know that the competition is high and US recruiters are very particular about how they want their resumes. Therefore, I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with:

1. Are the two pages too much? As you can see it is quite packed, and cutting it down would be difficult. However, if I need to do that what would you suggest to remove?
2. Is having a picture on the resume a bad idea? I have heard that is very frowned upon in the UK and US, however, very common here in Europe.
3. Is the overall structure and content good enough to be competitive for any US internships?

Please do not hold back your critique, and thanks a lot for your time!

jjm51h,7,2020-10-28,"I’ve had two “bad” jobs within months of each other, and I’m quitting my first full-time job today.",halp69420,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jjm51h/ive_had_two_bad_jobs_within_months_of_each_other/,"I’ve been struggling a LOT recently because this very much feels like a “me” problem. TLDR at bottom.

The first job I had (a required internship for my masters program) didn’t work out because it was an extremely small firm where I was working until 10pm/12am while being paid as intern. I knew a full-time offer was coming up at the end of my intern contract, so I turned down the offer. The team was heartbroken and tried to restructure a position that would be best for me but I told them the workflow wasn’t for me with some other more detailed feedback. That bridge is most likely burned.


Fast forward to two weeks after declining the internship, I get my first full time position at a Fortune 500 company, with a position title that’s exactly what I want to do in my career. I’m extremely excited and willing to move 6 hours from home to this company’s office. When I get the offer, I ask how long I have to make a decision, the hiring person is immediately cold to me and tells me I’ve had enough time to decide (1st red flag I should’ve picked up on). 

I start the job the first week of September and I think it’s weird how little the training is. I get practice projects to do and send them to my supervisor/other designers and no one responds. I have no idea if I’ve done the projects correctly. I shrug and assume they’re fine (which was my first mistake.) Then after three weeks of being “trained” I’m suddenly put on live client jobs. These jobs have an insanely quick turnaround time, and I’m obviously struggling. I have no idea what I’m doing but I have my supervisor quality check my work and for about four days, everything’s going smoothly. Then, I get sat down with our workflow coordinator and my supervisor to almost bully me and ask why I’m not understanding certain things and that my projects are NOT ready. My supervisor clearly expressed her frustration over the phone and says I must not know how to do the projects because I should be understanding it. I’m taken aback because when my work was getting quality check, no one said anything to this extent. 

As soon as this conversation happens, I realize how bad the work culture is and my “training.” At this point I just want to leave and start fresh somewhere else, but I tell myself that I can’t leave ANOTHER position and that I should be grateful for pay within a pandemic. The next two weeks or so is my supervisor assigning me basic trainings and demeaning my intelligence (when the issue was really just branding, no one properly explained the branding expectations). I reach a point where I have a huge breakdown and I cry for almost six hours straight (the worst headache I’ve ever had) and I want to quit. I try to hold off as long as possible but then my supervisor asks why I can’t join the team in person because she believes that’s the next step in helping me train. I’m uncomfortable with her asking my reasoning of not wanting to work in an office with a bunch of other people and tell her it’s personal and I would prefer to not go into detail. That was really the last straw, so today I wrote an email and sent off to my supervisor with my resignation. It’s been 30-minutes and no one has responded so I’m not sure what to do now. 

I’m okay with burning another bridge but I’m just disappointed with myself. I don’t know if these two jobs have actually been bad jobs or if I’m just new in the corporate world and failing at understanding a fast-paced environment. I feel left out and isolated and I’m not sure what to do next. I’ve started interviewing with some companies and I’m more focused on understanding a company’s onboarding and work culture, but I’m terrified of finding myself in another bad position.

TLDR; I’ve quit two jobs I think are qualified as “bad” but I’m disappointed in myself for leaving. I’m terrified of starting a new job and feeling like this again so I’m not sure what to do in the future."

17 (18 in 2 weeks), middle-class Indian male, lived in 3 different countries, not a legacy, not first gen.

**Stats:**

SAT: 1440 (740 Reading, 700 Math, 5-5-6 Essay)   P.S: I'm retaking them in a month...confident about a 1500+. I haven't done the Subject tests because they didn't have any dates left for me to write them. 

Update: Rewrote them, got 1460 :( I'm disappointed in myself coz I know I could have got a better score.

GPA: 4.0 (converted from my grades here in India, I'm not sure about the whole unweighted/weighted thing)

Class Rank: Def top 5% or top 10% (No rankings here, but I'm making a guess based on what my teachers said)

**Academics:**

I study under the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) syllabus.

So basically, you study mostly everything up to 10th grade, then you specialize in 11th and 12th grade.

Scored a 94.8 % on my 10th grade Board exams (96% in Science, 95% in Math, 98% in English, 100% in Computer Science)

I'm doing my 12th-grade rn, I've chosen the following subjects: Maths (Includes Geometry, Calculus, Trig, Statistics, and Probability), Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science (includes Python programming and MySQL database management stuff)

Do ask me if you need clarification on the syllabus or classes I'm taking.

I did a bit of research on the syllabus and we have most, if not all, of the AP class syllabus as our standard one. \[We don't have AP classes here :( \]

Awards: We don't really have much in the way of academic awards, though I'll add a few that might qualify (Again, I'm not really sure)

\- Won a state-level Spelling Bee, couldn't attend the Nationals coz I moved to another country :/

\-Regularly participated in the Science and English Olympiads conducted by the SOF; came 12th in the State in the Science Olympiad (I was the school topper for like most of my high school years but that won't carry much weight ig), I got a Medal of Distinction in the English Olympiad (also was the school topper like I mentioned previously)

**ECs:**

\-As I mentioned, I've participated in the Olympiads.

\-I regularly attend quizzes, been in the top 3, mostly state-level competitions.

\-I was part of my School House Debate Team for 5 years, won all of them. Also went for a debate held by a company ( large public sector, involved in energy), and won it. It was individual tho.

\-I went to a few innovation competitions held by colleges, won either runner-up or first for a household clean energy device (can't elaborate, in the process of filing a patent)

\-In the top 10 of a state-level innovation competition for the same device I mentioned (max. level was the state, was planning to go for a national level one but then Covid-19 hit). We were chosen from roughly 3000 entries or so and were funded to prepare a prototype of the device.

Got an offer to join an inventors' society for the above-mentioned device, got a few business calls related to it. The publicity from the competition helped :D

A state-sponsored entrepreneurship support organization expressed interest in helping us out.

\-I've learned Carnatic vocal music since I was 4 or 6, I don't remember exactly when. I've also learned the piano and keyboard for nearly as long, and also learned Carnatic violin for 2 years (had to stop learning the instruments coz of a packed schedule). Got the Trinity level 1 certification for the keyboard, but then I never wrote any more levels. My instructor told me to start learning the piano as it would be more challenging.

\-I'm part of an international club formed by my friend for people who love to learn new stuff and aspire to make the world a better place; I'm in charge of their newsletter, and I help out with their podcast.

\-I was the Best Delegate at our school's Model UN; meant to go for another one but Covid-19 ruined all plans :/

\- Was planning on an internship, but then again, Covid-19. I've been stuck in the house since March and I'm going insane.

\-I draw stuff. Not totally dedicated to it but it's always been something fun to do.

\-Attended an international conference on data analysis and mapping using satellites. I and my friend (he started the club) were the youngest people there; totally awkward but fun.

\- Did Google's Tech Support Fundamentals course on Coursera, got a certificate.

\- Currently teaching myself some ethical hacking, with the help of a friend.

\-Sports: I've regularly played in my School House teams for both cricket and soccer. I also play tennis and basketball, but never really went to any events. I was part of my school's Throwball team and participated in the district level competitions. Got scouted for the state levels, but I didn't go because it was my 10th grade and the finals were coming up. I do some long-distance running and cycling too. Came 4th in a cycling marathon.

\-In the process of making a 3D Printer with my friend (he collabed with me on the device I mentioned earlier). It's nearly done :D

Ok, I think I've got everything now...I'll add anything I might've forgotten later :P

Edit: I do some tutoring, nothing paid, just helping a few friends out occasionally.

Also, I've been in my school's student council. I was my house vice-captain twice, once while I was the Assistant Head Boy, and have also been the House Captain. I was  I was on track to be Head Boy, but then I changed schools.

**Schools I'm thinking about:**

It's been a lifelong dream to study at MIT, though I plan on applying to Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, and Yale. I might also apply to UCLA and CalTech, but I'm worried I might not be able to afford these places without any aid.

I plan on majoring in either Computer Science or Engineering Physics, with a minor in astrophysics maybe?

Let me know exactly what you think. Don't hold back. I might apply for ED (wow just a few days left for the deadlines, my timing is epic!), but I'm still not sure. I'm preparing for my JEE Mains and my 12th-grade finals too, so I'm kinda stressed and short on time, which means I may just end up going for Regular Decision."

I talked with my CEO about my dev career. I’m doing an internship right now and going to be finished next summer. He asked me if I want to be a classic developer or a developer/consultant for SharePoint and the Ms low Code platform. 
Im very Self doubt about my skills because I hadn’t good experiences while working at projects, because with more complexity I get / got more problems. In the free time I wanted to start more Codin but I didn’t.  The only thing what was I doing in my freezing was more like website design and little things with Arrays and ngfors e.g and if conditions. 
So it would be nice to hear some opinions and if I can be a good programmer. Also im doubtful that my ceo thinks I’m good ? 
Thanks for the answers"

I am new about internship please help me in the Tech Industry. I am applying for an internship for QA Engineer and Front-End. I have the skills but I lack experience."
jjo14v,3,2020-10-28,Going to college was a mistake,Jiibaro,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/jjo14v/going_to_college_was_a_mistake/,"7 years ago I left my family and friends to go live in a remote college town for 4 years. I studied hard, but I also worked hard. I had two part time jobs while I was in school in order to make ends meet. I thought it would all be worth it in the end when I graduate and start looking for work in my field of study. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started working a call center job straight out of college while I looked for something related to my degree. That job seriously broke me, but the real tragedy was when I was finally offered a position for the job I wanted and it paid peanuts compared to the job I've been doing straight out of college. I took it anyways because I needed an out of that call center, but I started to regret it almost immediately.  The benefits sucked, the pay sucked and there was really no opportunity for growth. It was insulting they would require a 4 year degree, references, internships, etc. just to be considered for that position. Still, I stayed there for almost 3 years because it was the easiest job I ever had and I had the ability to work independently with little to no oversight.

&amp;#x200B;

After losing that job during COVID19, I am back again working a call center job at an insurance company. My pay is 10K more a year, I have unlimited PTO, health insurance is almost 100% covered by my employer. I know I should be happy, but every day is agony. Even as the entire company works from home I can still feel my manager breathing down my neck. He listens to my calls throughout the day and is always telling me to change something in the way I talk to customers. To not repeat myself, to be more ""empathetic"", etc. My coworkers are rude and are all in on this weird power dynamic game that consists of messaging you and being a dick every time you make a small mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is I am the least qualified person I can think of for this job. I absolutely hate talking to anyone let alone doing it consistently for 8 hours a day. I don't know how to get out of this hell. I feel like a prisoner who's being tortured every day. The job I had before is basically a nonexistent position everywhere else and this is the best I can do right now. The future feels so uncertain. I still have 38k in student debt and I kick myself every day for not going to med school or studying something else that could've been more lucrative, but I was 18 when I  chose my major and my college advisor was useless when it came to it. I am a first gen college graduate in my family and I didn't have guidance from my parents. I feel like I've been set up for failure. I can't quit my job or go back to school because of my student loans. I've started to have suicidal thoughts lately. I was miserable when I was unemployed, but I am just as miserable now employed here. I just don't see the point anymore if this is how it's going to be forever. I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore."
jjohtb,170,2020-10-28,"The grind is over! (If I can do it, you can do it)",Johnn-E,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jjohtb/the_grind_is_over_if_i_can_do_it_you_can_do_it/,"I know there's so many posts like this, but I wanted to post my success story because I was DEFINITELY an underdog coming into this (I actually made a Reddit account just for this!)

After 187 applications, \~15 OA's/Hirevues, 27 rejections (and the rest being ghosted), I somehow managed to receive 4 interviews and 4 offers! They're not Big N companies, but 2 of them are fortune 50, one is a nationwide news outlet, and one is a fairly large insurance company.

For context on my background, I am a sophomore at a mid-size public non-target university (like it's literally unheard of outside of my state). I was lucky enough to take a data structures and algorithm class in my first semester freshman year, but I genuinely don't think that helped that much. I am also a straight white male, so I don't think I got any points in the diversity front.

I'm writing this to let everyone on the grind know that you can do it! As aforementioned, I am literally a nobody at a nobody school. I received no referrals to any of these companies, and I have no previous internship experience.

The only things I have going for me is that I am BEYOND passionate about programming, I do it every single day for fun and have been for years now (though my personal projects aren't that great), and, evidently, I'm very good at interviewing? That is, I am very confident and don't get nervous in these high-pressure situations so I can handle myself very well.

Moral of the story is, if I can do it when I had everything going against me, I am confident that you can all do it! 

&amp;#x200B;

I know these posts appear all the time, but this is one of these things that I had to share because I see a lot of negativity on here and people worrying that they aren't going to land a position."

jjpy4h,2,2020-10-28,Audit vs Tax - Big 4,[deleted],Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/jjpy4h/audit_vs_tax_big_4/,"I've recently accepted a tax internship at PWC. However, I'm open to working as an auditor too. Here are some questions that can help me decide which is better for me. 

1. First of all, suppose I dislike my tax internship. How difficult would it be to transition into auditing? Would I have to intern as an auditor to even be considered for a full-time position? For context, my internship starts in summer 2021, and I should be finished with school by May 2022, with 150 credits. 
2. Which option provides a better work/life balance. I know it depends highly on the location, client, and service line. But generally speaking, who works longer hours in Big 4? And who works longer hours in industry/government? 
3. Which option has the BETTER exit opportunities? The keyword here is better. I know audit provides MORE exit ops, but are they better than the fewer exit ops available to tax associates? And ""better"" to me means a high salary, low stress, and low work hours.
4. Where is the sense of camaraderie stronger, in tax or audit?"

I’ve always struggled with not caring about classes that aren’t specifically technical (like engl - hist) and now I feel like that’s creeping into my engineering courses. I already have an internship and a job offer for when I graduate, and it’s becoming really clear to me the difference between things that I need and things I’ll never use. One piece of advice my Fiancée gave me was to “just try your best” as in don’t beat myself up over doing poorly on something when I tried my very best on it. And it made me realize I don’t think I do try my best. Like ever.  I feel like I’m always running at about 50% and never actually put forth all my energy towards something. And the fact that I’ve made it this far while not trying as hard as I can, makes it so much harder to try harder. I don’t know how to force myself to try harder, and I don’t know how to do my best, I don’t even know what that means for me. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any advice?"

I'm currently at an alright uni in the Middle East doing my MSc in Computer Engineering, and I would like to pursue PhD in a top tier uni. I'm wondering what aspects of my profile to build upon to improve my chances. 

- My undergrad GPA: 3.5/4.0

- Current GPA: N/A as first sem of 2 year MSc. 

- Research Experience so far: primary Author on 2 IEEE conference papers, 1 SAGE journal article. Currently working as a research assistant with my department. 

- Work: 1 internship, 1 defunct startup, 1 part-time tech consultant gig. 

- Extracurricular: computer club president, member of college honor societies of tau beta pi and upsilon pi epsilon 

- Other achievements: Have won 5 tech hackathons. 

My research interests are primarily in bioinformatics and smart healthcare. I've come across great professors who are working on these areas at the previously mentioned unis, but I'm not sure how or when to contact them. 

For people who've been at these top unis, what would be the most important thing to work on? I see that most applicants are exceptional all around, so I'm not sure if it's too late for myself.

jjsfch,1,2020-10-28,Urgent Need of Guidance.,CyanCobraXS,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jjsfch/urgent_need_of_guidance/,"(**bold sections to emphasize what I'm looking to do and what soft skills I might bring to the table**)

I find myself unemployed due to COVID with lots of free time on my hands. I've always wanted to get into IT, but I just don't know where to start. I'm currently 31 with two little kids. I just want to make sure what I'm studying and working towards will translate to better opportunities in the real world.

**I'm very interested in Linux**. At this point, the most I've done is learn how to install most of the popular distributions. I know basic maintenance like running updates and upgrades. I understand the importance of good security practices and a good root password. I know basic terminal commands and how to navigate the terminal generally. I know how to edit simple text files (I've only used nano at this point).

**I'm also very interested in Python**. This is where my problems start--which do I focus on first? Granted I have an associates degree in an unrelated field, no certs, and no real world experience.

I had a buddy with a lot more knowledge then I have try to help me a year or so ago, but I was overwhelmed and quit. I believe he was introducing way too many concepts to me at once, some of them I just didn't get. He walked me through a Gentoo install, which took me a few weeks to finally complete (working about 1 hour a night due to prior obligations). But honestly, at the end of it, I didn't feel like I had learned anything. I felt like he was just guiding me through the process and I wasn't really taking any of it in.

So here I am, unemployed, but ready to move forward. Not sure if it matters but my current hardware is a Ryzen 3600 built on a B550 motherboard, 16 GB of RAM and two 250 GB SSDs. One SSD currently has Windows 10. The other has been empty since I built the machine this summer. I was thinking of putting Linux on that blank drive to try to start learning again, I'm just confused on where to start at this point.

I'm trying to maximize the amount of time and effort I put into this for the best possible results. Do I have to decide now if I want to focus on Linux or Python? Should I just be focusing on the basics and trying to get a help desk position? Which free online resources or tests should I focus on? Which cert should I eventually try to get?

Money is extremely tight right now and my family and I are barely getting by. This is part of the reason why I want to get into IT and off unemployment. **Prior to the pandemic, I was working in internet sales for a car dealership--basically taking incoming calls, making outgoing calls, and maintained customer database in the CRM software they used. Prior to that, about a decade in retail, mostly supervisory. I did a short stint at an insurance claims company, and an internship for the public defender's office**.

I live in NJ if it matters.

Sorry for the long post, I'm just really in need of guidance on where to start and where to go to from here. Thank you."
jjt14d,30,2020-10-28,(UPDATE) Just completely failed my technical interview. Feeling demoralized.,OmkingPlaya,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jjt14d/update_just_completely_failed_my_technical/,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jai2bm/just_completely_failed_my_technical_interview/

&amp;nbsp;

After that interview, I was feeling pretty emotional and I got a lot of good advice in the comments. However, I somehow moved on to the final interview last week and was given an offer today! HR called me to tell me that I was the first one they called because they thought that I was one of the top candidates (don't know how) and they even offered me a higher salary than we originally agreed on (which will now be a 50% jump in salary from my old company to this company!). I thought I'd update this for anyone that feels really shitty after an interview. Don't count yourself out until you hear back from the recruiter!

&amp;nbsp;

A little bit more about me:

* Sophomore with a 3.75 GPA
* One previous internship as a Software QA Tester
* New company is a midsized company in the Midwest
* Applied to about 40ish companies, heard back from 2, received 2 offers.
* If people are really interested I can PM an anonymous version of resume.

Good luck for everyone still hunting for internships! I'm finally out of the rat race."

What's worse is that I had friends with resumes written in Word document with barely any personal projects or anything and they got accepted in companies the I applied to that I was eventually rejected (he even failed their aptitude test and still got accepted). I know I'm quite salty at this and should only focus on myself, but I worked a lot of personal projects that consumes a lot of my free time (the resume doesn't cover all of the projects because there was no space to fit in 1 page), attended hackathons and coding bootcamps, etcetc, and I wasn't selected.

P.S. Right now I have received an internship already, and I am really really grateful for that, thanks to reddit. So I'm just using this opportunity to fix my resume, see what went wrong with it, so that I can prepare myself for the real deal, which is finding an actual job after I graduate.

jjuba1,6,2020-10-28,If you want to get a CS/ML/AI research internship at a top university this is how,late-frost,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jjuba1/if_you_want_to_get_a_csmlai_research_internship/,"\## Why should you do it?

&amp;#x200B;

It's well within reach. I know at a handful of high school students that did legit research internships at top universities/companies and published papers at top conferences and got into T5 schools for undergrad. AI is still an emerging field and we need more smart people in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

\## My Experience (for undergrad research, but should be applicable for HS students)

&amp;#x200B;

There was a professor that I really wanted to work with during my undergrad. He is a consultant for FAANG and is very well known in the AI/ML community. But, he hasn’t taken a single undergrad, or even master’s student, into his lab since the lab started more than 20 years ago. His entire lab was postdocs, and PhD students. I got in, published a few papers and his recommendation letter got me into a few T15 CS PhD programs. For perspective, PhD applicants at these top schools in AI/ML compete for about 3 new spots at each university every year.

&amp;#x200B;

\## How did I get in?

&amp;#x200B;

I think the reason I got in was that had clearly demonstrated that I was capable of doing research, despite being an undergrad. By the time I had applied to his lab, I already had two first-author publications at very respectable conferences. Publications, to me, are the most concrete way of demonstrating your capability. Another way, would be to audit many undergrad and grad level courses and demonstrate that you’ve done well. Professors are always in need of skilled, motivated research assistants. More often than not, they have more ideas than they can pursue, but they do not want to spend time training someone. They want to find people who are come in and start contributing right away. If you can clearly demonstrate that you have the capability and the interest in working on projects that the professor is interested in, you’ll dramatically increase your chances of getting in.

&amp;#x200B;

\## TLDR:

&amp;#x200B;

Show that you know your stuff and demonstrate your interest, and you’ll significantly increases your chances.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be in the comments if you have any questions."

The university im looking offers a CS course and an SE course(with a major on mobile app tech) whatever that means...
The CS course is 3 years and the SE course is 4 years. The SE course is a joint program between the university and a university in china. I'll do the first 2 years in my country and then the last 2 years in china at a university called GIST. If i graduate ill have a degree from my university and a dilploma from gist and also I'll get an oppprtunity to intern (competitive internship as they call it)for 6 months at a fortune 500 company in Suzhou Industrial Park china. It honestly sounds like a good deal.
However, I keep seeing people that say you should major in CS and then transition to software engineering....
I honestly am stuck and idk what to choose. Any advice would be great.
Im not sure what a major in mobile app tech means so an explanation of that would be nice as well.
Also, I think its important to see the  course outline for each program so if you want to jus ask and ill send it to you. Thanks!"

Two weeks ago I was CompTIA Network+ certified and I have began looking for NOC and SOC jobs because I want to avoid Help Desk **at all costs**.

1.) How can I find a job soon even though there aren't many places willing to take in a noob with zero prior work experience (other than a website developer internship)

2.) Should I get the CompTIA Security +, the CCNA, or the AWS Soltions Architect Associate certification next while I search for work. I want to work in the Cloud engineering field but I see a lot of people say you should get the CCNA before AWS certs."

I am 24 years old and roughly 1 year out of college. Throughout college, I did numerous IT Support internships and gained some great experience. I was able to accept a job right after college -- but my role was impacted by COVID.

 The company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity.

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects.

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off.

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. My drive for supporting end-users and putting out fires is fading. 

It hit me hard in the few months that I was unemployed, the only positions I was getting called about or leads for were low-level Help Desk jobs for a lot less pay than I was making. It was a real wakeup call that I landed a very lucky gig out of college... but on the job market... I am extremely low level. I took a ""Customer Support Specialist"" job in the meantime that will pay the bills while I can dedicate and focus on studying for certs. I am motivated to start skilling up.

So, where do I start? My first thought was to grab the Azure Administrator Associate AZ-103 certification. I did some of the training for the Fundamentals exam and found the Cloud super interesting.

I was also thinking about learning Linux as my Linux skills are very base level.

I am so lost in my career and really need some suggestions or someone to talk to and get on a good path.

&amp;#x200B;

Fall 2020 (Current semester)

\-Intro to Machine Learning

\-Embedded Systems

\-Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

&amp;#x200B;

Spring 2021:

\-Operating Systems

\-Internet  Arch and Protocols

\-Thesis project (required)

&amp;#x200B;

Summer 2021:

\-Internship (fingers crossed)

\-Big Data (online; not sure about this class. I don't want to take a hard class that would drive my attention from the internship)

&amp;#x200B;

Fall 2021:

\-Internship

\-Cloud computing

\-Database

jjxnut,1,2020-10-28,Should I quit my job?,Anonymousfinance1234,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jjxnut/should_i_quit_my_job/,"Hi everyone, 

I just wanted some advice as I’m feeling quite trapped at the moment. Here’s the situation:

I currently work at a call center for a financial institution, and I absolutely hate it. I took the job in the summer when my courseload was lighter, but I am now taking 18 credit hours as well as working 45 hours per week. When I was planning on quitting, however, my dad was laid off due to covid. At that point, I really couldn’t justify leaving my job by just saying “it’s too much” because I figured my family would be upset with me. Also, I have about 40k in student loans and would be missing out on about 8k (would otherwise be working till I graduate in March). I have enough saved to get by until I graduate since I’m just living at home, but I’m racked with guilt. I feel like I should be thankful to have a job at all in this environment, but it has had such a negative impact on my life. Even when I ask my girlfriend about it, she says I should continue to work because I will be able to pay off my loans faster (which is what I thought too at first, but every day that goes by takes a bigger toll on my mental health). It would be one thing if I could get done with work and just veg out for the rest of the day to relax, but as soon as work is over I’m diving into my homework until I go to sleep and it all starts over again.

Side note: I am a digital marketing major and I’ve been looking for internships as well, but by the time I’m done with work and homework, I am absolutely exhausted. I haven’t been able to send out as many applications as I’d like to because I just feel like I have no time.

Side side note: I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago, and was able to bounce back from it on my own. I’m feeling like I’m slipping back towards that, but I know I cannot use that as an excuse.

I guess my biggest question is, should I quit my job, or just tough it out for the next 5 months until I graduate and can get a job in my field? Or if there is any other option that I’m not seeing here, I am open to all ideas."

I did claim that I worked the hours I missed. I'm 21 and in college. I live in Virginia.

An employee of the agency in the title left a note card for me on my parents door with his cellphone and is trying to meet with me in person. He is trying to text me a picture of his badge but he says it won't send.

He says that he is investigating my termination independently of my agency as he says it is some law or something like that that he has to do. My employer fired me for missing work and then charged me back the hours that I was paid, but then they found out they charged me too much (which I thought too because they claimed I missed a lot) and then gave me back some money. He says he is just trying to make sure the stories line up and he has to do it in person. I asked him if my mother could meet with us and he says yes. I have not seen any documentation or anything since this is all over the phone, but he wants my address and wants to meet me on Monday.

This gentleman said he met with my old coworker in person already, I asked her, she said she has not talked to him but has missed calls from him (she did the same thing as me), and I told him that and he texted me, ""I had told her not to tell anybody about our meeting today in case I didn't get a chance to talk to you first"". I requested we do it over the phone but we can't do that.

I have my reasons for missing work, and my work knew that and they knew it for a while. Eventually enough was too much and they fired me, and got the money back. I am very scared to meet this man and I asked him if I'm in trouble and he said ""most likely not. You probably aren't in trouble trouble"".

Does anyone have any experience like this? 

If anyone cares about why I missed, I missed 48 hours over the span of several weeks as I was prescribed a very strong medication and I kept sleeping through my shifts and or being late. I'm no longer on that medication and wasn't for a while but they did an investigation for when I was on it and fired me for that a few months after. My work knew I was on it and that I was weening off of it but the damage had already been done."

I wanted to see if anyone living in Texas could provide me with their reasoning for choosing UNT Dallas or TWU, I was accepted into both programs and I cannot decide on which one would be better for me.

From what I’ve found through researching each, they both seem very similar in what they offer in terms of, cost of attendance, staff, internships and job placement, etc. 

I should state that I accepted my invitation from TWU due to UNT taking longer to reply and TWU giving me a deadline, I thought I would be safe and accept TWU, I just found out today however that UNT Dallas has extended an invitation to interview. I realize that this does not guarantee a spot for me but I’m trying to think of the what if scenario.

Again, I apologize if this is not the correct subreddit and if anyone could point me to a more appropriate one, I would appreciate it."

With Covid we all know the job market sucks. I finally found an Inside Technical Sales job (I'm a newly graduated Mechanical Engineer..) last month. It pays okay, but in the big city rent / cost of living is pretty high. Recently my old internship contacted me for a position in my old home town, with about a 10k less salary, but I'll save more than that moving back home with my parents. The old internship job is also an inside sales job, and has the same potential to move into design and application engineering eventually, as does my current employment.

So should I move back home, take the old internship job and severely damage the business relationship I have with this new employer?

Or should I stick it out and continue with this new job, hoping things get better. (I'm on a 6 month probation at this new job, leaves me with a lot of uncertainty).

jk4ipr,5,2020-10-29,Considering looking into ADHD after depression and anxiety history,throwaway_academic09,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jk4ipr/considering_looking_into_adhd_after_depression/,"tl;dr:  history of anxiety and depression and considering the possibility of ADHD after experiencing severe burnout in college 

Hi all,

Hope everybody is doing well.

I have a history of anxiety and depression that is due to a myriad of reasons, mainly genetic, environmental, life circumstances and the such. I didn’t think ADHD made sense for me, mainly because I see hyperactivity, impulsivity and forgetfulness being used to describe many aspects of it. My anxiety makes me too anxious to be either of those things-however, I feel like when I started to consider there may be a possibility is major burnout after university a couple of years ago. 

I’d like to think I am a passionate person and interested in many things. I love exploring and learning new things, it keeps me feel fulfilled. My problem is that my tendency to lose interest quickly and lack efficiency in my work. I was a hard worker throughout high school, studying to the point I was sleeping 3-5 hours a night. My grades were good but not great, I didn’t have a balance in my life and didn’t have many friends and hence a social life. I did try different hobbies and was good at them (arts, crafting, knitting) but I’d never finish most of the projects I’d start except for a few where I can become extremely mesmerised by the details.

These habits continued throughout college even though I wasn’t as motivated to do well as I did in high school and not really stoked about my major. I was ambitious and was considering pre-med studies, but I knew deep down I was too anxious and inefficient for that. Like everything for me seems to take forever: like studying takes me DAYS whereas I’d see people succeed studying half as hard as me. I know the whole thing: study smart not hard but I just never learned how to do that. I got into an alternative career path in college and was strongly considering dropping out of my program many times but was too worried about the consequences and stuck to my major. At times I liked what I studied but I was progressively becoming bored and unhappy, probably partially because I didn’t resonate or feel welcomed in my cohort either. Despite the difficulty in sustaining interest, I always took good notes and did my homework on time-to the point my peers would copy stuff from me. As years passed, my burnout was becoming progressively worse as I was feeling unfulfilled by everything I was doing. Besides some additional bad luck with finding important internships that would have secured me a job, my increasing depression due to the uncertainty as to what I really wanted to do lead me to failing important things that I should have passed years ago. The same friends who used me for notes passed the requirements and are flourishing in their jobs. 

I have since done extra schooling after applying to different jobs (I applied to HUNDREDS of jobs to take whatever I could get). One thing I noticed about myself is that when I did the additional schooling, I became even worse at procrastinating and let myself get comfortable with C grades. After that, I definitely undersold myself or got really attracted to “interesting sounding” job descriptions only to be used and taken advantage of by my employers and making a crap salary (or almost being completely unpaid in some situations had I not fought for it). I am now trying to get back to my original field but I feel so unbelievably depleted and burned out. Like I feel like my entire twenties has been an academic/career roller coaster and I see people who are able to enjoy school and friends and life and just don’t know how they do it.

There’s more I can write but this is already long and the main jist of it. I’ve already spoken to my therapist about this and am looking for the best ways to get a proper assessment and evaluation but just wanted to hear from others who have anxiety and depression along with ADHD."

However, while I was in law school, I discovered that I would prefer to have a career in Finance (investment banking precisely) than a career in Law. To be honest, I struggled through law school and I really don’t see myself practicing law in the long term. I have looked into Finance and I believe that I would prefer to have a career in Finance. However, I am unsure of how to go about this. I am also 24 which means that if I’m to make a career switch, I believe that I should do it as soon as possible.

The problem I have is drawing out a plan to switch to a Finance career. I have done some research and I have found some possible ways of making this switch, but I am still unsure of which is best or if there are other means.

For the purpose of your understanding, these are the methods I have discovered through which I can make a switch to Finance:

1. Secure an internship in a top Financial institution and get into the industry at entry level.
2. Write the CFA exam or get a similar certification and get into the industry at entry level
3. Enroll in a Masters Program in Finance and get into the industry at entry level
4. Secure an MBA after some years of experience in a similar field (e.g corporate law) and get into the industry at Managerial/Management level.

These are the ways I’m aware of through which I can make a career switch into Finance from law. I would appreciate if anyone can suggest other plausible means. I have tried 1 above (Securing an internship) but I’ve been unable to secure one (Although I did one online). The other three I can only commence after writing my bar exams as I am currently preparing for it and I do not have the time for other engagements currently. However, I am still unsure of which of these routes or other routes to take after writing and passing my bar exams. 
I would really appreciate any advice regarding this."

My coworker sent me a link to a folder on Microsoft OneDrive with the a .zip file I'm supposed to download, with the virtual machine file to run on VMware. The zip file has 30 GB. My machine has over 150 GB of free space so I figured it wouldn't be a problem.

I installed VMware Workstation on my Windows10, then proceeded to download the file with Firefox. At first, it installed fine, but when I attempted to extract it's contents, I got an infamous blue screen error. Panic.

PC restarted, so I attempt to run whatever it managed to extract on VMware (no success as the files were incomplete). I attempted to run the zip file (who knows?) but nothing either.

When I turn my computer on, I get a Setup warning saying I should backup my files because the HD may fail at any moment. Needless to say I did backup all important data. I deleted both the zip file and the half-extracted contents (maybe I shouldn't have) and except for the setup warning on every boot, it seems to be working absolutely fine, but every time I try to download again, I get a blue screen error mid-download,  and the computer restarts. 

I am aware of the sad possibility that I may have damaged my HD beyond repair (thankfully my files are safe) and I am already getting and SSD to replace it. But I still need to download and run the VM... I asked my coworker and he just said that as long as I have free space, it shouldn't be a problem (no help from him).

So, I am very late with this, and I am desperate for help. I haven't found anyone on the internet with a similar problem. Can anyone help me? I would appreciate very much. 

Thank you for your time!"

I'm actually a Mechanical and Aerospace engineering major in my senior year, but my passions is for CS and I'm pursuing a Master's degree in CS in Fall 2021. I have zero internship experience (in MAE or CS), and no design team experience due to my battle with depression for so long. But I do work in a research lab as a software lead for a really cool project. I do feel a little unprepared for a job/internship of course, but I think I could secure one if I just applied enough.

My issue is would many companies even hire an intern like me for next summer? Would me technically graduating be a detriment? And most importantly, when asked for my graduation date, should I put my project Master's graduation date instead? And should I put this on my resume. I'm only a little hesitant because I haven't been accepted to grad school just yet (I have zero worries about getting accepted, it's just a matter of waiting for my letters of recommendation to come in so I can apply). Any advice on this or anything else would be much appreciated.

Side question: What are companies thoughts on applying to multiple different positions if they have several available?"

It's been a rough one folks. I started practicing and applying in June, doing about 2 Leetcode questions per day and 20 applications per week. I just went through [this list](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships) for positions. I got a decent response rate, but even though I thought I was doing fine on Leetcode, I generally failed at online assessments and technical interviews. I got one final round with a trading company in September but failed that too. Recently I stopped practicing Leetcode out of sheer exhaustion. At this point I thought my chances at an internship were pretty slim. 

Out of desperation I decided to take advantage of my university's grant funding for unpaid internships. I cold emailed a few startups, opening with something along the lines of ""I can work for free."" The first company I emailed gave me an offer, no assessments or interviews attached. It's basically my dream startup too, combining several of my interests. I'm kind of in shock.

For context, I'm a US citizen applying to mostly US jobs. I'm a junior at a top 10 college (but 30-50 for CS) with a GPA of 3.8. I have two previous summer internships, a web dev internship at a media company and a machine learning research position at my college, but this is my first time practicing coding and sending more than 10 applications. 

Moral of the story: Don't waste your summer like me. Relax, take a vacation, and offer to work for free.

Actually though, I realize not everyone has the resources for an unpaid internship so I'm lucky in that regard. But I imagine other universities also provide funding for unpaid internships, so just keep my example in mind.

Finally, holy shit the internship grind is mentally and emotionally taxing. Good luck to anyone taking it on now or in the future."
jkbf3d,2,2020-10-29,I work in a temporary position at an agency and my boss informally gave me a permanent offer. I asked her for more formal information in writing. It's been over two weeks since I last heard from her. How do I follow up?,lilyaintaG,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jkbf3d/i_work_in_a_temporary_position_at_an_agency_and/,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible.

In May, I started interning full-time at this place. At the end of my internship in August, they offered me a temporary part-time position. I told them no because I was moving away, but I would be interested if it was a remote position. They adjusted the offer for it to be remote.

I moved away and started working for them remotely while I looked for other work. 30 applications later, and I don't have any other job offers. They received grant funding and offered to increase my hours, and I said yes. The position would still be temporary, but they said I would be guaranteed employment until at least the end of December.

On October 2, my supervisor informed me via phone call that they may have the capacity to turn my position into a permanent position and wanted to schedule a time to speak. We originally scheduled for October 8, but there was a conflict on her end and we couldn't speak until October 13.

We spoke and she gave me more details about the offer. **I did not like the offered salary ($30,000-$35,000 per year) because I thought it was way too low for my qualifications (master's degree).** She told me that as a condition of accepting the offer, I would need to move back to the area. 

I told her I was interested, but I asked her to reconsider the salary range (and I also asked her several other questions). She told me she would reconsider and would send me an email with more exact details at a later date.

**It's been over two weeks, should I send her a follow-up email? What do I say without sounding rude?**

If they increase the offered salary, I would say yes. I love working there, but I feel extremely stressed out by the fact that I've heard nothing from her and that I have nothing about this offer in writing. This is also affecting how I apply to other jobs; I don't want to apply for a shit ton of jobs if they offer me a salary that I like, but at the same time, I don't want to apply for anything and end up screwed if they offer me a bad salary. My student loan repayments start in February."

However, I need to use a laptop at my current job as an intern. Its the best laptop they have and the other PCs are pretty crap, but its not very nice to work on either way. So, I thought maybe I could take my old PC with me and work on that, then the 'good laptop' can go to my colleague who keeps having to use his own laptop. 

Then, my boss asked me if I wanted a screen upgrade, a 4K display. So I told him I would probably rather have two 1080p screens which would cost the same but work way better, so now he wants to buy me 2 4K screens after my proposal of the PC. However, that would mean it being able to run the software required.

So, Id want to be able to use 3D-Rendering and Engineering software (CAD) like Autodesk Inventor an Fusion 360, and some CAM software (VCarve and some lesser known ones). I believe CAM software is pretty low spec but not sure about Autodesk stuff. Currently it works fine on my 1080p display, but would it make a huge difference when running 2 4K screens?

* Asus GeForce GTX 970 DirectCU-mini

Excerpt from a former intern 

"" My summer was split into 2 projects (and I was on a team of 3 interns).  Both projects involved writing code for frontend and backend, plus  interaction with a database: -A simpler interface called Feature Toggle which helped non-programmer  members of the company team assist in deploying new features. The team  we were in is now using our little tool several days a week in a  production environment! -A more complex design called Local Service Analysis, helping us display  a bunch of data regarding events in a train’s daily schedule in a  timeline format as well as a heat map format (I can explain more if  you’d like but a little difficult over text).  I used a combination of IntelliJ and VS Code for code development, and  the browser we use is mostly google chrome, although we are also  adopting edge. Another tool I used briefly (and more since) was SQL  Developer for peeking into the database. The other software (for the  heat map stuff) I learned was Tableau """

I was very fortunate enough to receive an offer from a small local company recently and I’m not really sure what to do. The company itself is somewhat known for a specific kind of hardware they provide to a lot of companies, and my role would probably just be related to backend and/or front end web development. The pay is around 18 an hour in a lcol Midwest state, though I guess pay isn’t too important since I’m only a sophomore and experience is more important. Some of the pros are that it’s within driving distance to my apartment so I don’t have to worry about relocation, and as mentioned before I can gain some tangible work experience as a sophomore. I’m still trying to pursue internship positions at more well known companies though it’s very tough as a sophomore. My current dilemma is that I’m not sure if I just want to accept it and stop looking for other internships. I know that a lot of people would suggest accepting and reneging if I get something better, but for some reason I feel like I would feel worse doing it to a small company. Another benefit would be that if I just accept it I can spend more time focusing on schoolwork and extra curriculars. A question is would having an internship at a small/unknown company benefit me when trying to get interviews next year?

Thanks so much!"

The comapny collects massive amounts of data from vehicles and they work with distributed, parallel technologies like Hadoop, spark and Kafka to analyze the data. The interviewers will probably ask me how I would make a distributed framework to digest and analyze millions of rows of data. I only know basic stuff about Hadoop and AWS.

I have my ideas but it's always useful to get people's perspective on things :)

I have two active offers from two companies.

One is the company that I am currently working at, I LOVE the people and learned a lot after being here for just a couple months. They are offering to extend me a few more months (they would like longer but they need to review budget at that time). My work has a huge impact on the direction of the organization, and I'm getting good, positive feedback on my work here. They take my feedback seriously and I can have a big influence on the direction the organization goes technologically speaking, which products we end up developing, etc. It lets me tailor my experience the way I want it. Unfortunately, I'm the only tech person and so there's a bit of a lack of mentorship, nobody really reviews my code and tells me where it can be improved. They kind of just look at the product I deployed and test it out. This increases my sense of ownership and how careful I am with the product, security wise and in the robustness of my code, but I worry about what I am missing out by not having a senior in this stage of my career.

The second one is a new company that is a lot bigger than the current one (not big 4 or anything) and they are offering an 8 month term. They said I'll have real code experience (so I don't have to worry about getting stuck with IT support stuff... lol), a lot of it will be ""grunt work"" (which I'm not opposed to, I just have 4 months of internship experience at that point), but they said they cannot ""guarantee for sure anything will be flashy for my resume"". I'll be working with a dev team and will have a senior, so I'll be able to do things like code review and have people mentor me in that way. However, this company will pay me less (about $20K CAD less), and my work will be a lot less impactful, although I understand that's not something I should necessarily expect being just an intern.

In terms of my future career goals, I am interested in Software Development, but also in Product Management. This is why the first company has been quite rewarding me so far: I was able to deal with defining requirements, involved with user testing, and thinking about features for MVP and where we can extend things. However, I'm worried about falling short on the developer side and I've not worked on a SOFTWARE team in a professional capacity which worries me slightly.

Any and all suggestions are welcome!"
jkgnrz,2,2020-10-29,Smack me with reality of expectations in corporate,anonfruit_,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jkgnrz/smack_me_with_reality_of_expectations_in_corporate/,"I am having an extremely rough time learning how to 1.) Quantify my value 2.) Determine if I'm acting entitled. This is in regards to salary and what my expectations should be. My question: Am I acting entitled if I want a significant increase? What about an increase in general? What factors weigh the most in my situation (Experience, Performance, Skill set, Etc)?

I am a 22 year old woman with a B.S. in Cybersecurity. I worked part time as an analyst NE (but 35+ hours, do with that what you will) for my current company (10k+ employees) for 2 years during college. I took a 3 month hiatus to work at large consulting firm as an intern, determined that I did not like the lack of technical, hands-on aspects of the job, and returned to this company in Sept 2019. I received a job offer letter from the consulting firm for $85k and used that to negotiate my salary here - they matched it so my current salary is $85k and also promoted me to Sr Consultant (4 tier bump).

Here's the beef of my question: I know that the pay band for a Sr Consultant at my company is wide. I also know that I am at the very, very bottom of that pay band. I am so thankful to be paid this salary out of college - and to already have been promoted to my title, I was stunned. I know from feedback from my superiors that I have been operating at my current level. Knowing this, I've been having a mental battle about my salary vs. my title vs. my experience vs. my age. If I go into December asking to be paid what the 'middle' of the salary band is for this role, am I overstepping?

**Important situation that caused this thought process to start**:

At the risk of sounding like I am bragging, my proactive and out-of-the-box thinking has gotten me noticed in my department. I am also highly organized, put significant + noticeable value on quality documentation, and am extremely sociable. To the situation: we recently had an organization restructuring and some new teams were created that had openings. A manager from another team requested that I interview for an open position at the same level/title on his team after learning my reputation + skillset. He told me that the going rate for the position was \~$140k and said 'I'm not sure how much of a raise that would be for you, but we can negotiate to get you on the team.' He obviously did not know that was almost doubling my current salary, and it *really* concerned me that people think I am getting paid around that. As a woman in tech, and the salary gap, I am trying to be highly conscious of negotiating confidently and valuing myself as I should. Anyway, they ended up taking in an external hire for the position as they needed someone that was an expert in the tool they are architecting, but saw my organization, proactiveness, and scripting abilities as to invaluable to lose. So, my manager and the other manager made a proposal for me that I would work on my current team 3 days a week, and on their team 2 days a week. I'm happy with this solution - but I am telling it to highlight that I feel I am highly valued here and want to use it as leverage in a positive way.

Here's some more details if you need them:

1. I worked in Vulnerability Threat for 1 year as an intern (therefore cross-departmental knowledge)
2. I work in SOAR now
3. My specialty is python automation + REST API Integrations
4. I designed a revolutionary process that is going to be implemented across the entire infosec department
5. My performance reviews have yet to provide anything negative
6. I got to the final round for a sec. engineering position in Feb at Google. Idk if that's relevant I am plugging myself for that one for sure

**TLDR**: I'm 22 and flourishing in my career. I'm grateful for the salary and opportunities that my company provides for me. However, after learning the salary band, the salary of a different position at the same level as me's salary, and performing very well here, I want to someone to give me a reality check if I need to focus on my minimal experience as the basis for my salary , or if I actually have a case for wanting a significant raise with my performance, impact, and unique skill set + length of time at this same company. What do you think?

I have nothing to go off of, and I'm a first generation student from farm land so I don't know what to expect. I also have student loans to pay off which is why this is personal for me in the first place. Thank you so much if you've read this far already, and I appreciate the insight/input anyone may have!

Also this is in the midwest and I currently work remotely"

My concerns are that I feel as a software developer I can earn a higher/stable job. I love working on computers and would like to work from home in a home office. On the contrary, I really love fish, caring for them, and learning about them. I know that either or path would be interesting enough for me to love my career but idk lol. 

What do you guys think? I love working with technology but fish are just so cool. My career goals would be to either own a tech start up or fish store which are very drastic. Although I can pursue both I'd rather focus on one or the other. Thoughts from marine bio and CS people? I'd like to hear your experiences from classes, jobs, internships etc. I think I'd thrive learning CS off of a different resource than school like coding bootcamp or books/udemy/codeacademy etc. 

P.S. If you're a fish keeper on campus, I have elodea and salvina to give out if you're interested. Also looking for fish keepers to socialize with on campus so feel free to comment your social media or pm me please :3"

I've gotten internship offers from Snap, Uber and Cockroach Labs and I was wondering what should I choose (and I still have to take the final round for Facebook).

Snap pros:

\- Pretty cool product and company

\- Highest new grad TC out of the 4

\- Great name on resume

Snap cons:

\- I've heard mix things about the company culture and work/life balance

&amp;#x200B;

Uber pros:

\- Super cool product

\- (From what I've heard) pretty high technical bar to get the internship, and great name on resume

\- (From what I've heard) you get to learn a lot

Uber cons:

\- I haven't heard good things about the work/life balance

\- With the business model, covid, and (maybe) prop22, the future of the company is looking uncertain atm and I would like to have security on my return offer (if I were to be good enough to get one)

&amp;#x200B;

Cockroach labs pros:

\- Super cool product in an interesting space

\- (From what I've heard) really good work/life balance

\- (From what I've heard) good talent and growing company, which might IPO in the near future

\- They give some equity to interns, that if I were to pursue a full-time role I could collect

Cockroach labs cons:

\- Name is not as big as Uber and Snap so I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't get a return offer

&amp;#x200B;

Facebook pros:

\- Best brand value out of the 4 companies, so in the event that I wouldn't want to work there or could not get a return offer, the name will open a lot of doors

\- Second highest new grad TC our of the 4

\- (From what I've heard) Pretty good work/life balance

Facebook cons:

\- Massive company, so might feel that my impact is very small if I were to join them full time

\- (From what I've heard) I'd get to learn less than in the other 3, since I would be more involved in the other 3 companies"
jkklpx,6,2020-10-29,Literally failing college/uni,throwawaybean24,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jkklpx/literally_failing_collegeuni/,"
I'm a second year Computer Science student at a top Russell Group university, I went through first year mostly depressed and unable to do the required work and through open book, 24 hour exams, made it to second year.

I spent most of my first year depressed and stuck in my room, sleeping 12-14 hours a day. I hated university life, while everyone was out enjoying their time at uni I was stuck with the postgrads in my hall, who understandably, didn't want to go out and do stuff. My coursemates are your typical CS students who play video games, etc etc.

When the covid-19 pandemic hit I already dropped out but re-entered uni since the exams were going to be easy. When I moved home I got some mental health help and started getting better, The exams were open book + 24 hours so you barely had to study to pass and I bagged myself easy passes for all my exams, including the deferred first term ones. This didn't mean I understood or even learned the content however. I barely studied all year and was thrown a lifeline or miracle.

I don't know how to code very well or know the basics of discrete maths (I only need to do 3 or so lectures from first year to catch up however). I am struggling so hard on the content in second year since I just don't have good enough coding skills to do most of the coursework and don't even know how to approach most of the Qs.

I'm far behind on lecture content, even though I attend and go through the work, I'm not understanding it, even the ones which require no pre-requisite knowledge cos I have no resources to learn - the lecturer can't speak english well and hasn't given us a textbook/reading list or very descriptive slides. I've spent 6+ hours trying to go through his lecture and can't understand a single thing.

I don't want to do another set of open book exams cos then I'll have left uni with no skills when I graduate and be in a worse position than when I started. I have no idea what to do, I was thinking about taking the year out and catching up on first year stuff and dodging the online uni experience or completely withdrawing &amp; doing a different course.

I've gone from A(star) A(star) A in A levels to a complete failure at university, I don't have any extracirruculars or side projects to be competitive enough to even get into a summer internship and missed all my spring week applications for IB last year because of depression, despite pretty much an easy pass into them since I already had IB experience pre-university.

Even if I get an interview I won't be able to pass the coding or theory based tests. I've applied for all non tech but tech internships such as tech consulting or trading floor research.

I enjoy Computer Science but don't have any enthuasism or motivation to study since I'm angry, stressed and confused half the time."

I would ideally like to pursue a data-related role well into the future (doesn't necessarily have to be in the tech industry). What I'm thinking is that a role at Robinhood would give me (slightly) more visibility/responsibility/exposure working on a cool product - also if I'm to receive a FT return offer, I'd potentially receive a bit of equity in the company, which could be worth a lot a few years down the road. But obviously Facebook is Facebook, so that's hard to pass up. Everything else held equal, which firm would you choose and why?

&amp;#x200B;

Lieutenant Davis was in the middle of discouraging Dr. Campbell and intern Nick from trying to ""adopt"" one of the local specimens when he received a distress signal from X-7 with an order for urgent return. He ran as fast as he could while carrying Olgris and, unknowingly, Ziya, who wrapped herself around him at some moment. Despite his best effort, they arrived late. And could only watch as the shuttle was taking off.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

As they sat among equipment the shuttle left behind, Ziya was trying to get her emotions under control so she could calm the others. As Zex, she felt the distress of people around her and had to fight to not let it affect her. The fact that Nick and Lieutenant Davis were closest to her and were relatively calm compared to the rest of the crewmates helped a little bit.

She flailed her tail, trying to smooth out the feathers that were in disarray after all the running. Lieutenant Davis seemed to be completely collected. The initial shock was quickly turning into determination and drive to protect the crew. Nick, the sweet idiot that he is, was more afraid of Fi, standing behind him, than of the situation they were in. Ziya knew that most humans were afraid of arachnid species, but the idea that Nick fears Fi more than being stranded on an unknown planet brought her amusement. With that thought, she started slithering towards Fi.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

When Ziya was moving from one crewmate to another, Lieutenant Davis was going from footage of the drone they sent out after landing, looking for possible shelter. Finally, Ziya hissed towards him, prompting him to stand up.

""I believe everyone understands the situation we are in. X-7 jumped into FTL so it will take a considerable amount of time before we are rescued.""

Ziya hissed disapprovingly. Crap, he wasn't good at motivational speeches. For his usual subordinates, the fact that something was an order, was enough to motivate them. He coughed and began speaking again.

""None the less I believe we have good chances of survival. Before taking off, the shuttle's pilot was nice enough to empty his cargo, leaving us with as much equipment as possible. An opportunity we can't afford to waste. Twelve kilometers from here, the scouting drone located a cave, which should provide us with some protection from local predators. If we start moving now, we should reach it with time to spare before the sun sets.""

He took a deep breath and ordered.

""Start packing cargo on the transport boards.""

After a moment of delay, everyone started looking for scattered boxes and loading them on the transport boards. Transport boards were standard equipment of every cruiser ship and shuttle, capable of carrying sizeable weights while hovering smoothly over the ground at height adjusted to the user. It wasn't some fancy anti-gravitational device. It still pushed the ground to push itself up, but it got the job done.

Thankfully, they managed to fit all the cargo on six transport boards that they had. Otherwise, they would have to make a couple of trips back and forth or have Timnok carry it. Timnok was the last of the crewmates to arrive at the site. Three meters high alien looking like, what could be described as an unfortunate mix up between a troll and a bear, was surprisingly slow but strong. Probably strongest among the crew right now. Though, in her natural habitat, which was almost three times as rich in oxygen as here, Fi could probably outmatch the giant.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

After they arrived at the entrance to the cave, Lieutenant Davis told them to wait outside and held his hand towards Ziya.

Ziya hissed disapprovingly. Only now Lieutenant Davis noticed that for the past few hours Ziya only hissed while conveying simple messages telepathically. Sometimes Fi, on which Ziya now was, answered for her. He pointed to the place where her translator should be attached.

""What happened?""

Ziya's tail, which split into three at the tip, touched the finger he was pointing with. She forced an image of her translator falling during the time she was wrapped around him into his head.

He sighed.

""Sorry about that, but something lives in there and you are the only one capable of performing a sapience examination right now.""

Ziya hissed but slithered around his arm until her head was resting on his shoulder.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

What lived in the cave was not sapient. Shortly after the two went in, Lieutenant Davis yelled to Nick to come in and help him. They emerged dragging three paralyzed, horse-sized, feline-like creatures.

The soldier turned towards the rest of the crew.

""You might want to leave. Go rest inside.""

They were happy to oblige.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Finally having a moment to breathe, the reality of the situation started getting up to them. First to break the silence was Olgris.

""I have seen the briefing on this planet. We'll be seeing tornados, earthquakes, monsoon seasons, and hail the size of a human fist. We are doomed!""

Zoe, on whose lap Ziya currently rested curled up, sighed. It was probably thanks to the Zex, but she didn't feel all defeated yet.

""I've seen it too. We have supplies, solar batteries. We can prepare ourselves.""

Instead of calming him down, those words only fired up Olgris more.

""PREPARE OURSELVES?! Where we are, there will be almost 50(°C)(122°F) during the summer! Neither I nor Fi can stand that!""

Zoe, growing agitated despite Ziya's presence, raised her voice as well.

""We are going to find somewhere cooler. If not, we are going to build it. If we need something, we'll find it, or make it! No one is going to die!""

Olgris shot back,

""There is not one engineer here! When you will be wasting time pretending to be one, guess who'll show up?! Local predators of which those cats were *modest* examples!""

Nick, who until now sat quietly against the wall, interjected.

""Davis has some guns and a paralyzer. We also have some transport boards. We can figure something out.""

That definitely didn't calm the alien down.

""You can't a kill three-meters predator with a fucking transport board! And again with the making! There are no engineers here! We got a soldier, two xenobiologists, geologist, microbiologist, botanic, and ...""

Olgris pointed to every member while naming their field, except for the absent Lieutenant Davis. He suddenly hesitated when it came to Nick. He knew he was not an engineer because they wouldn't be sent to the surface during routine cataloging.

""Who the hell even are you?""

A little embarrassed, Nick answered.

""An intern.""

""What the hell is an intern?""

Olgris asked, genuinely bewildered.

Internships were a rather rare occurrence in the GA, and basically unheard of when it came to crews of explorational vessels. As most species relied on the heavy specialization of its specimens, there was no need for internships. Children quickly decided on their overall direction of education and narrowed it down even further later. Thus, a person who finished their education was ready to serve on the ship freshly out of school.

Before Nick could answer, he was called by Lieutenant Davis from outside the cave.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the entrance to the cave, Lieutenant Davis stood next to the feline bodies stacked up on a transport board.

""There is a river nearby. I'll leave the bodies in it to cool down. If nothing snatches them, they'll be breakfast tomorrow.""

He handed Nick a stun gun.

""It's set to paralyzing. If anything approaches, shoot it and call Ziya to check for sapience. If it's not sapient, it's food.""

After the last sentence, he also handed him a knife.

""I'm an intern, not a soldier!"" Nick protested.

Lieutenant just smiled.

""Congrats, the military part of your internship starts today.""

He took a few steps before turning around and adding.

""While you're on guard, think of some booby trap for predators to leave at night at the entrance. I'll be back in an hour or two.""

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lieutenant Davis entered the cave with Nick following him, being released from the guard duty. Moving forward, he heard chatting noises. The soldier sighed with relief. It was good to hear morale was better than when he left. Everyone was busying themselves with the cleaning, taking the useful equipment out of the crates and such. However, when he got close and crewmates noticed him coming, the atmosphere suddenly tensed and everyone stopped moving and fell silent.

""What happened to the *'shoot on sight*'?""

He asked while pointing to the one-meter high four-legged reptile that Zoe tried to hide behind her back without much success. It's silhouette and posture very much resembled that of a dog, save for an elongated neck.

""But it followed us so far!"" she started embracing the animal, supposedly trying to shield it from Lieutenant Davis. It indeed seemed to be the same animal he was dragging her from before an emergency. Then, she hurriedly added.

""And Ziya says it's friendly! It thinks we're it's parents!""

Lieutenant Davis turned to Zex who was suspiciously tightly wrapped around Olgris.

""Seriously?""

Ziya hissed.

""And everyone is okay with that?"" he asked and looked around stopping on the Zex and the Krorqux again. That new ""pet"" was almost as big as Olgris, not to mention Ziya.

Ziya immediately hissed approvingly.

Olgris, who spent the last 20 minutes watching Zoe try to teach the animal to bark, hoping that it would, quote ""melt Davis"", gave in and nodded. Lieutenant Davis sighed. Whatever boosts morale. He turned to Nick.

""You've made the trap?""

Apparently proud of himself, Nick confirmed.

""Yep, I was waiting for you to come back before setting it up!""

He grabbed some bags and ran to the entrance to place the trap.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

Having some time before the setting sun, and in better moods, everyone started chatting, trying to get to know each other. Working in different fields, they mostly knew each other only by sight and hardly ever spoke before. Zoe and Ziya were the exceptions. Both were Xenobiologists and were friends for some time already. That's why when their new pet fell asleep on Zoe's lap, Ziya just moved higher, pretending to be Zoe's fancy scarf.

At some moment, Olgris suddenly remembered a question he was meaning to ask before.

""Nick, what is an intern?""

Though, before Nick could answer, Lieutenant Davis interrupted.

""It's a dumbass, who gets thrown between the different jobs so that GA's xenobiologists could observe average human performance in different settings. Half of the jobs he thinks he's doing on the ship are actually puzzles or tests made by xenobiologists.""

For a second Nick laughed, thinking it's a joke. Suddenly, shock and realization showed on his face. His head snapped towards Ziya.

""Was that what these assignments were? You gave me these goddamn unsolvable puzzles to see how I'll react?! I was a lab rat all along!?""

Ziya hissed.

""You didn't answer! You literally telepathed the word ""hiss""!""

Everyone burst into laughter.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

But the laughter ended as abruptly as it started when they heard a feline cry immediately followed by what seemed to be flesh exploding.

When they went to investigate, they found half of a carcass that belonged to the same species as cats that previously occupied this cave.

From the looks of it, this one was even bigger than those they saw before.

The other half of the body was smeared on the ceiling and walls of the entrance.

Lieutenant Davis turned to the ""fresh military intern"".

""What the fuck, Nick?""

""I booby-trapped the entrance as you asked.""

""With what? *A mine?!* Do we even have those?!""

Nick, suddenly remembering something turned his back to Davis and pointed to Olgris, while smiling smugly.

""I'll have you know that I did, in fact, successfully killed a three-meters predator with a *transport board.*""

Shocked, Olgris only mustered to ask.

""What?""

""I turned off safety, flipped it over, set the preferred height for any unregistered species to 8 meters, and set it to activate on touch, and finally set default cargo weight to one tonne.""

Everyone finally understood. When the feline stepped on it, the transport board immediately pushed it with the power needed to lift one tonne to eight meters in... whatever the ascending speed of the transport board without the safety is. No wonder it went to the ceiling... and walls… and everywhere else.

Zoe yelled while embracing her pet.

""What if Dragon wandered on it!?""

Lieutenant Davis covered his face with palms and sighed.

Fi, Timnok, Olgris were all speechless.

Ziya **hissed**.

jkv3od,0,2020-10-30,Hell Desk Escape Timeline?,HellDesk2020,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/jkv3od/hell_desk_escape_timeline/,"Hi all.  

So I am starting my first IT Helpdesk job next Monday (Washington D.C./Maryland area) and while I am excited for my first IT job I am far more excited to get out of there ASAP. I graduated with my B.S. in informatics/cybersecurity so this is not where I wanted to be to say the least. I did not take my education seriously, no internships and graduated with a very low GPA so it’s no one’s fault but my own.  

After doing a good bit of growing up I am now extremely motivated to grow my skills and become a top tier IT professional. I think I want to head in the direction of security analyst or network administration. I am working to come up with the best timeline I can to achieve this so that I can better keep sight on my next step and make the best use of my time.  

Right now, I expect to have my Net+ certification in the next week or so. I am cautiously optimistic that I will be getting my Sec+ not long after. So I am hoping to have both of those certs in about 3 months if not less, at which point I should have enough money to set up a pretty decent home lab and start building a portfolio of solid projects (I’m thinking of making a website on Squarespace to log my work and share with potential employers). At this point I am also thinking of setting my sights on a certification that will help me stand out as a potential candidate (I’m thing GCIH). I would like to have this done in 6 months or so and start looking to move on from hell desk.  I know that 6 months in an entry level job is a relatively short stint, I have considered the idea of trying to move into helpdesk at one of the many contractors in my area and possibly get sponsored for a security clearance.  

With all this being said I want to ask if you have any suggestion or words of advise as to how I can optimize my timeline and follow it as successfully as possible.  

Cheers."
jkv3te,1,2020-10-30,Should I accept a Solutions Architect Internship if I want to be a Software Engineer?,JustNPC18,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jkv3te/should_i_accept_a_solutions_architect_internship/,"So I recently received an offer for an Associate Solutions Architect Intern (Commercial Operations) position at a well known FAANG company. I'm currently a junior and this will be my first internship. I'm super thankful to receive an offer from FAANG and there's so many things about the offer to be excited about. 

I am, however, a little hesitant simply because I've established in my head that I want to go down the Software Engineer path, but I'm a little nervous about whether or not this internship will limit my path or offer me as much value as a software engineer internship would give to me as a future candidate. 

I'm also totally unaware as to what the position entirely entails since I sort of applied on a whim. I do, however, know that it has a lot to do with web-based development which I just have some experience in. I also know this position deals with customers which I have no problem with whatsoever (in fact I'd say I'm pretty good with sales and customers in general).

In summation, will this internship provide good value for myself as a learning tool and also for my value as a potential software engineer. Will having the FAANG experience be worth it for a future software engineer position over non-FAANG experience despite the FAANG role not exactly being a software engineer intern. I don't want to limit myself for the future, if taking on this position would do so, and since I am a junior I believe this will be my one and only internship so it will set the ""tone"" for my career down the line.

Thank you anyone who provides any feedback or advice. I'm honestly so excited and happy, but nervous at the same time. This seems huge and since I have no one else in my life with experience to turn to about this I'm hoping you guys can help!"

jkvgk9,5,2020-10-30,I am very afraid of the future and suicidal thoughts increase in my mind,atsimonoce,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jkvgk9/i_am_very_afraid_of_the_future_and_suicidal/,"Well, there is so much that it is even difficult to start describing how I feel for some time now. I am 22 years old, I live in Brazil and I am in the 7/10 semester of my economics graduation here at the federal university in my city. Since before the pandemic, I had already been discouraged with my studies, mainly with regard to the methodology and limitations that existed in my course. In October 2019 I had just entered an internship and things were going well, making me feel motivated and willing to complete this journey, despite everything. I have always been a dedicated student in my studies, I am not the most intelligent, but with effort I can make up for what is missing. I was always among the best students in the class, even though I was very discouraged with the course, although I liked it.

With the beginning of the pandemic, my university stopped academic activities, and I, who was about to go to my 7th semester of course, was forced to stop too. At that first moment I thought that everything would be quick and things would be resolved soon, but the situation has reached where we are and my university talks about plans for return only for next year. I'm extremely sad, it's like I'm in a fog, stagnant. My friends continue their lives and I'm here alone with myself, many of them don't even remember that I exist, I don't blame them, I feel that my irrelevance makes them act in such a way. I am very afraid of never finishing this college, and always listening to my mother's hints sending me to look for a job, although I am on a research project and receiving the scholarship, which is not much, but it helps me and makes me feeling a little happy because doing research in economics is something I really like.

As my mother thinks that scientists are all a bunch of vagrant communists, she includes me and thinks I'm a vagabond who doesn't want to work, although this year I got my certificate to try to get an internship job at a bank, but she does not care. I feel like I'm old, and finishing college at 24 \~ 25 years old can undermine and hinder my plans to pursue an academic career for a master's and a doctorate.

I feel terrible every day, suicidal ideas are constant, and I feel that they are giving me more courage every day to do something stupid. I don't want to kill myself, but things are getting difficult day by day. What keeps me motivated is still running every day and trying not to think about everything that's going on. That's it for now, and if you've read this far, thank you very much, I really wanted to talk to someone, but no one has the patience to listen to me. I hope you are well and are safe. Hugs!"
jkviy7,1,2020-10-30,Hell Desk Escape Timeline?,HellDesk2020,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/jkviy7/hell_desk_escape_timeline/,"  

Hi all. 

So I am starting my first IT Helpdesk job next Monday (Washington D.C./Maryland area) and while I am excited for my first IT job I am far more excited to get out of there ASAP. I graduated with my B.S. in informatics/cybersecurity so this is not where I wanted to be to say the least. I did not take my education seriously, no internships and graduated with a very low GPA so it’s no one’s fault but my own. 

After doing a good bit of growing up I am now extremely motivated to grow my skills and become a top tier IT professional. I think I want to head in the direction of security analyst or network administration. I am working to come up with the best timeline I can to achieve this so that I can better keep sight on my next step and make the best use of my time. 

Right now, I expect to have my Net+ certification in the next week or so. I am cautiously optimistic that I will be getting my Sec+ not long after. So I am hoping to have both of those certs in about 3 months if not less, at which point I should have enough money to set up a pretty decent home lab and start building a portfolio of solid projects (I’m thinking of making a website on Squarespace to log my work and share with potential employers). At this point I am also thinking of setting my sights on a certification that will help me stand out as a potential candidate (I’m thing GCIH). I would like to have this done in 6 months or so and start looking to move on from hell desk. I know that 6 months in an entry level job is a relatively short stint, I have considered the idea of trying to move into helpdesk at one of the many contractors in my area and possibly get sponsored for a security clearance.  

With all this being said I want to ask if you have any suggestion or words of advise as to how I can optimize my timeline and follow it as successfully as possible. 

Cheers."
jkwgt3,148,2020-10-30,Flunked interview at MM,EtheroverEuros,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jkwgt3/flunked_interview_at_mm/,"So this post is purely for venting purposes, but I really need to. 

So I was in the last round of getting an internship at top MM and I really put effort into getting here. I rehearsed every brainteaser in the book of xingfeng zhou, knew everything about the company; how they trade and how they hedge, even scored 90% on their mental math test. I aced the motivational part, aced the core business part and even aced their brainteasers. However last question comes around and I flunked on this stupid profit loss question.

“Sold 10 000 share A at 10.10 and share price eventually increases to 11.00. What is the PnL?”

Let me first mention the interviewer was really vague explaining this question, as he told this selling of 10 000 shares a couple of minutes ago in the interview. However, my caveman brain got the better of me and calculated it wrong by putting a zero too many in it. Like this question was terribly easy and this is where I fail on? Needless to say, my nerves overtook and I couldn’t get mr. cavemen to leave my brain and flunked another calculation question. 

Hence, me probably not get acception offer.

Tldr; me stupid cavemen, even though I rehearsed like hell.

Edit: Thanks all for the wonderful unexpected advice and support."
jkx4x4,37,2020-10-30,Does all embedded systems work require staring at bits and hex all day?,ForTamriel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jkx4x4/does_all_embedded_systems_work_require_staring_at/,"I am a student trying to decide what to specialize in. 

I hate the fact that majority of CS/CompE jobs are entirely on the computer. Because of this I'm interested in embedded systems jobs since it gives me the opportunity to work on a product that is more than just a computer screen. Recently I landed an embedded systems internship and was disappointed by it. I spent 90% of my time dealing with bitwise operations, looking at hex, and debugging communication protocols bit by bit. What I am wondering is if the entire embedded systems workforce just looks at bits all day. My brain is not wired in a way that can stare at bit operation and bits in communication protocols all day. It drives me crazy having to pay this much attention to small details. I was wondering if all jobs in embedded are like this and if it would be a poor career choice for me to specialize in embedded systems considering this?"
jkxx1w,7,2020-10-30,2020 I'm going to expose my life here and expose others. I cant take it no more. I'm just a piece of sh*t. I'm going to annoy yall with all of this since people wanna look in my history. Go ahead. I'm going to be dead soon. I got 500 mg acetaminophen sleep aid. You wanna know my life here..,fffeeertyt3tt5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jkxx1w/2020_im_going_to_expose_my_life_here_and_expose/,"Let's start with when I was younger. We were poorer than poor. Living in an abandoned apartment. My (and I hate even giving them these titles it just feels weird at this point) mom, brother and me. Roaches, rats, lizards is what all I saw. I was just a one night stand baby that I wish she would had aborted but I guess bringing someone in this world just to not have to raise them is better. My (and I hate using this title) dad was in and out of prison selling crack so i would rarely see him until one day he saw me with no shoes on putting water in a water jug at a gas station. Guess the guilt got to him enough to take me to my grandma house. She always raised me. She raised me since I was a baby. So her taking me in was a blessing but also a bad thing. It was one less mouth to feed and I barely saw my ""brother"" like that. I always thought and so did he maybe that I had it better. When in actuality, mom kept u -not me. I ll never have that mom n son relationship with her because she would never be real with me like she will with u because of guilt. I look just like her. So when she looks at me she looking at herself. As I was living with my grandma, my grandad (which he was great too but he had another side to him before he got sick) in which I guess he was trying to toughen me up but i was close to my grandma. Call us ""Foot to Foot"". Every where she went I went. Grandad use to curse me out under his BREATh I remember ""pussy ass nigga"", ""bitch ass nigga"" all that at around 4 or 5 6 or 7 years old. I guess he was right... I never really talked like that at all. Only with my grandma. I remember one day I believe I was 5 or 7, this dude with a black shirt and gray sweatpants wanted to play. Me at the time i didnt know the totality of what was going on. Or maybe I did and did it anyway idk. He wanted me to sit on his lap and show me his penis and he want me to show mine. After that happened as i think of it now, it's like a spirit that was passed from one to another. This is how a victim can become a victimizer. As I start getting like 10 or lil older I remember playing around with my cousin (around same age) and I did the same thing the guy did to me but I stopped that once we got caught by my aunt. (I'm not into guys at least masculine I guess but I have a weird fetish for transsexuals). My grandma was the greatest person in the world to me. It's just when u dont have that father figure in your life and because everything that was going on around u was happening and all my grandma wanted to do was make sure I had everything, she spoiled me. And u know what it says about spoiling someone. But I ll never ever blame nothing on her because she did what my own mom n dad n everyone else didnt-raise me. I blame myself for not being a better grandkid now that she gone. Was spoiled when it came to her. She always made sure that I was ok. I know she is highly disgusted and disappointed with me in the grave and grandma I'm sorry for everything. Because even if I dont directly kill myself, the way I'm living now is just as bad-a slow and painful death. As I got older I became more and more lustful. Especially when grandma was starting to slowly die on me after my granddad pass. Now around that time (still young) around 15 or 16, there were a couple of girl cousins (no force of course as they wanted to do it too) we did sexual things to each other. No penetration as I didnt even begin masturbating until 18. Before then all my dick would do was be hard and I would have wet dreams every now and again. (I didnt have penetration sex until this year and I'm 27 years old now). Now I remember when I moved in with step mom n pops-thinking this was going to be family but that was hell. Especially being that this mf was selling crack and I barely see him like that. Then when he got locked up he left me with that abusive bitch. I remember getting beaten with toy bats and toy hockey sticks. Take off all my clothes. And it can be for something small or something big. I had a problem with keeping my draws clean so I would definitely get whipped about that. Every day or at least every other day. Then my grandparents picked me up because they know alot of things was going on. I had to choose so u know I was going to them. No lie my dad was an asshole (he still is but he ll never see me again. He won. I'm out of the picture and he and his wife and everyone else in that family can live their best life), never was around like that then when he did he acted like ""well I'm here am i?"" type of attitude. While mom n dad were doing them my grandma was raising me think about that. I use to get bullied every day in school. I always smelled like shit and I let people treat me like shit. To this day I regret not standing up for myself 5-8th grade because it still follows me to this day. Fast forward, I started going to church to get close to God. Around 16. Whatever age I was in 9th grade. And things were okay. Then my grandma got sick. She was on alot of pills and she was always sleepy or dozing off. She was in so much pain. Where was her son? Doing him and blaming her for things and being jealous of me because of the relationship me and his mom (my grandma) had. While yo ass was in and out of prison!!!! I remember that time when I was younger 10 or 11 and he took my grandma jewelry, the xbox and playstation i had. She died the day after my birthday in 2010, and I watched her die me n my big cousin. To this day I never gotten over it and never will. To this day a part of me died when she left. To this day I regret ever getting close to both mom n dad because in turn it was my demise. The things I did after my grandma passed.. I smoked weed for the first time my brother turned me on to it. After I got high that first time I never stopped and to this day I will never stop smoking weed. I moved in with my dad n his girlfriend (something I should of learned from before not to do but at the time I just wanted to keep the peace and just never spoke up for myself). I tried to rub on my older cousin butt (who's a pill popper n just nobody fw her but favoritism is mf so they fw her but not at the same time) and she told. I was high af. Then went to stay with my grandma on my step mom side (her mom). The things I did there...i would definitely be in jail. I'm definitely going to hell too because if that opportunity presented itself again i would do it again. Victim becomes the victimizer. Then it was just to where I ended up going to finally stay with my mom. I should of stayed with my aunt but I wanted to stay with my mom because I was planning on getting an apartment with the paid intern job at Gulfstream.  And I did. I couldn't stay with my mom tho because the rent man can have a lot of people in the apartment it was some bullshit she told me. I got an apartment at 18 while I was still in high school. I didnt keep it for long. I just didnt care about life or myself and that was to this day. I ended up getting evicted then having to move back with this nigga again that was constantly reminding of how much I fucked up. That's when everyone stopped really fucking with me like that. I mean they really didnt mess with me like that anyway it was just off the fact that I was with my grandma that they did mess with me. Too much hatred for them. I know if I never gotten close to them, things would have turned out different. How can u be around someone if u deep down hate them, u going to eventually act out and do things to where they dont want nothing to do with. Fast forward 2013 I moved in with my real mom n brother n her boyfriend. Every where I went I was a problem after my grandma passed. I realized my brother was finessing and jugging me like i was some other dude in the streets, fell out with him and that never spoke to him sense. U remember when I said I let people take advantage of me? Yea.. all in all I just stopped really giving a fuck about myself I was always in some bullshit. It just got to the point in late 2015 early 2016 I cut off all ties with them. My life maybe hell now and I will be dead soon but if I had choose to be around them and that-I will choose my body being found on a pavement. I take responsibility for the things I've done. Even if what they did were wrong, the things i did and the way i reacted to the things they did, gave them a way out.  A clean slate from God if u ask me. After my grandma passed i stopped going to church, now I just dont care for God anymore because I realize these past years he never loved or cared about me. I thought he did but he didnt and I feel like a fool thinking about it. Like finding out Santa wasnt real. But in the same breath I can't blame him. I've become an abomination now that thoughts are just full of lust, anger, envy, depression, and suicidal thoughts. You might as well say everything was my fault now since doing the things that I did. When people do u wrong and u reacted in a way- the blame will be on u at that point.  u end up proving someone right about the things they thought about u. Now I will die alone, with nothing, homeless sleeping outside. I don't want to try anymore. I dont want to care anymore. These are my consequences and I'm too far gone to change my ways. I believe God knows this as well. I'm just living at this point until I die. I had to share this with someone who has eyes before I leave this world.I just hope to be taken away from this world. I have nothing. I have no body. No mom no dad nobody.  I am nothing. Forgive me grandma I failed u. Rest in peace. I ll never have peace. What ima end up doing wont be any peace for me. I'm done. Im always wrong it's always my fault. And it's the truth but if I say the things that people say about me I'm this and that. You know what I'm a piece of garbage a sorry excuse for a man and human being. Yall can treat me however yall want I deserve  it. Just as in real life.  Because I'm taking my lifee.e. djdjdjjdm Humiliating myself, being desperate for affection, and loneliness. Idc what u do to me anymore God. Fuhc everything. IM TIRED OF BEING USED so fn ugly I got to pay for a girl that would never be around me if I ain't cash app her. Just about every body I come across...I'm the problem. And u know what I'm going to solve it permanently"

jkynr3,4,2020-10-30,Choosing between job offers,owhhh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jkynr3/choosing_between_job_offers/,"I'm currently a senior and recently received two vastly different job offers (for summer/fall 2021 start), each with massive pros/cons that's making it really hard for me to figure out which one to pick. The pay between the two isn't that much different (offer 2 is slightly lower, but only by a few thousand, which is likely offset by the fact that it's in the same state as where I currently live)

**Offer 1:**

\- Data Analyst

Pros:

\- Fortune 100 Company

\- better growth (given good performance)

\- significantly better benefits

\- potentially more interesting work

\- generally better work life balance (from what I've read)

Cons:

\- I'm not nearly as confident that I'll enjoy or do well in this position (entirely new for me)

\- Requires relocation halfway across the country (it does comes with a relocation package). 

\- Culture is very hit or miss depending on assigned team

**Offer 2:**

**-** Business Systems Analyst

Pros:

\- in same state that I currently live in

\- more confident in my ability to perform the role

\- job security (at least from what I read on glassdoor)

\- better work from home policy

Cons:

\- harder to grow and move up the ladder (more stagnant/less chances for promotions/raises)

\- worse benefits

\- worse work life balance (includes OT)

\- don't know exactly what team I'm on until a month or so before I start 

For Offer 1, what I'm mostly worried about is moving cross-country just to find out I don't enjoy the job or that I'm not great at the position. Besides that, however, Offer 1 seems more exciting and overall the company is better from a benefits and future growth standpoint. Offer 2, which is, the ""safe"" option, since I can commute from where I currently live and I'm more confident in my abilities to perform in that role (more of the responsibilities overlap with what I've done in my internships). I'd also save more money (no need to pay for an apartment), but the tradeoff is that I won't make as much starting (albeit starting difference is negligible for the first year) nor will I have as many opportunities to grow. 

I should also mention that while Offer 1 is with a well known company, the second company is by no means small (several thousand employees) - they're just not nearly big as the first company.

I apologize if this isn't the best subreddit to be asking, but would love to hear any advice."

I accepted a job offer as an Embedded Engineer but the position was cut due to the pandemic. In the meantime I'm trying to find a job to get by and hopefully build some experience. I was invited for an interview for a position as a ""Data Entry Agent"" at a call center. The description only mentions knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite and databases but doesn't mention anything about SQL or programming. Would this be considered beneficial experience in any regards to software or hardware engineering positions?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
AI good or AI bad?|Neither! That's not to say AI is neutral, no technology is. But technology has the assumptions, biases, opinions, hopes and motivations of the people who make it baked in. So some AI is good, some bad. Some good AI is used in bad ways, some bad AI is used in good ways. And that's why we should always question it. [Will Douglas Heaven]
Hi! My name’s [Michael Brent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-brent-phd/). I work in Tech Ethics &amp; Responsible Innovation, most recently as the Data Ethics Officer at a start-up in NYC. I’m thrilled to learn about your podcast and grateful to you all for being here. My question is slightly selfish, as it relates to my own work, but I wonder about your thoughts on the following: How should companies that build and deploy machine learning systems and automated decision-making technologies ensure that they are doing so in ways that are ethical, i.e., that minimize harms and maximize the benefits to individuals and societies? Cheers!|Hi Michael! Wow, jumping in with the easy questions there .. I'll start with an unhelpful answer and say that I don't think anyone really knows yet. How to build ethical AI is a matter of intense debate, but (happily) a burgeoning research field. I think some things are going to be key, however: ethics cannot be an afterthought, it needs to be part of the engineering process from the outset. Jess Whittlestone at the University of Cambridge talks about this well: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/24/1004432/ai-help-crisis-new-kind-ethics-machine-learning-pandemic/. Assumptions need to be tested, designs explored, potential side-effects brainstormed well before the software is deployed. And that also means thinking twice about deploying off-the-shelf AI in new situations. For example, many of the problems with facial recognition systems or predictive policing tech is that it is trained on one set of individuals (white, male) but used on others, e.g. https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/. It also means realising that AI that works well in a lab rarely works as well in the wild, whether we're talking about speech recognition (which fails on certain accents) or medical diagnosis (which fails in the chaos of a real-world clinic). But people are slowly realising this. I thought this Google team did a nice study, for example: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/. Another essential, I'd say, is getting more diverse people involved in making these systems: different backgrounds, different experiences. Everyone brings bias to what they do. Better to have a mix of people with a mix of biases. [Will Douglas Heaven]
My son is interested in a career in Robotics combined with A.I. What advice do you have for a future innovator to prepare for a career in the field? He’s 13 years old|Yes, curiosity and encouragement! And if you're after core skills, here's what one of DeepMind's founders told a 17 yo who asked the same question a couple of years ago: https://twitter.com/ShaneLegg/status/1024289820665950208. These are always going to be slightly subjective, though. Tinkering with code is probably most useful and there are loads of freely available bits of code and even ML models available online. But do encourage him to keep broad interests and skills: many of AI's current problems stem from the fact that today's innovators have homogenous world-views and backgrounds. [Will Douglas Heaven]
 |Never lose your curiosity. Better yet, make time to feed and encourage it as innovation is as much about imagination and inquisitiveness as anything else. 
What is the most surprising thing you found in your research?|Hi! I'm Tate Ryan-Mosley, one of the IMWT producers. This is actually an amazing question because so many things have surprised me but also none of those things maybe should have been surprising? (Perhaps this says more about me?) But I think that the challenge of how we actually integrate AI into social/political structures and our more intimate lives is just so much more complicated and urgent and prevalent than I thought. We've talked to incredibly smart people, most of whom really are doing their best to make the world a better place. And yet it sometimes feels like AI is making the world a worse place, or at the very least, being implemented so quickly that its impact is precarious. I also think I've been surprised by secrecy in the industry. So many of these implementations happen without real public consent or awareness.

Been listening to the podcast so far and I'm enjoying it. Thank you for creating it! With algorithms being closed source/IP or AI being almost unfathomably complex after significant training on data sets. What can be done to educate the general population on the security/ethics and design of such systems? People can be very sceptical with regards to things they don't understand. Side question: I really like the book Hello World by Hannah Fry on a similar subject, what media/podcasts/books would you recommend to somebody interested in AI tech as a hobby if you will but without experience in how these systems work.|This is an awesome question and thanks so much for listening! One of our main goals with the podcast is to ensure ""our moms can understand"" everything we publish. We have very smart moms :) but the point is that the general public often gets left in the dark when it comes to how a lot of AI works and even when it is employed. Its a big motivating factor for a lot of our journalism at Tech Review! Not to make this sound like a plug but I think a good way to help educate the public on technology is to subscribe to outlets doing good journalism in the space. ([You can subscribe to TR here](https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/google-ads/?utm_source=cpc&amp;utm_medium=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=tr_subscription.paid.acquisition&amp;utm_campaign=Branded-All+Terms+%7C+US+%7C+CN&amp;utm_term=technology%20review%20subscription&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=4275116575&amp;hsa_cam=1624597631&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-352791129015&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ad=331307761573&amp;hsa_grp=62133741536&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_kw=technology%20review%20subscription&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsv7BRCmARIsANu-CQdyqE8fAtKE1egUsudBrPU6PvO1OQhhbxaYnRmIQw37FoAzDs2JALkaAixLEALw_wcB)) Law makers, educators, companies and researchers all play a role in the solution space in my personal opinion.

What do you think is the role of private players / government regulations in trying to promote a sustainable/good use of AI? How will you envision such regulations to look like (and how might we achieve them)?|Hello! This is Karen, senior AI reporter at Tech Review. This is an excellent question. I think private players have the unique advantage of innovating quickly and taking risks to achieve greater benefits from AI, whereas government regulators have the important role of setting down guardrails to prevent the harms of AI. So we need both! There's a push and pull. As for what regulations should look like, here's a really awesome Q&amp;A I did with Amba Kak, the director of global strategy and programs at the New York–based AI Now Institute: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/04/1008164/ai-biometric-face-recognition-regulation-amba-kak/. She answers the question much better than I could for face recognition specifically. It offers a great use case into how to think about regulating different AI systems.
What jobs are we most likely to lose to AI in the next 10 years?|`u/CapnBeardbeard`, we recently found that the pandemic might actually accelerate job losses for some essential workers. That would be the people who deliver goods, work at store checkouts, drive buses and trains, and process meat at packing plants. What we don't know is if these job losses to robots will lead to new jobs to help them. T[his story we published in June](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/17/1003328/covid-19-could-accelerate-the-robot-takeover-of-human-jobs/) provides an extensive overview of what we're talking about. - Benji
 |It's hard to say exactly how automation will change the job market. Many jobs will change, but not necessarily disappear. AI will also make some aspects of remote working easier, which will also have a big impact. One manager who can keep an eye on a construction site or a warehouse remotely, using smart surveillance tech, will be able to do the job of multiple managers who need to be on site. Some types of job will be safe for some time yet: anything that requires a personal touch, from service industry roles in restaurants and hotels to teachers (tho see that point about remote working again) to sales-people to creatives (but here we should expect a lot of AI tools to make some aspects of creative jobs quite different). [Will Douglas Heaven]

With the number of improvements in AI especially over the last 5 to 10 years, do you believe that the Singularity has moved up?|Nope. I think the advances in AI in the last decade have been staggering. We've seen AI do things even insiders didn't expect, from beating human champions at Go to highly accurate image recognition to astonishingly good language mimics like GPT-3. But none of these examples have anything like intelligence or an understanding of the world. If you take the singularity to mean the point at which AI becomes smart enough to make itself smarter, leading to an exponential intelligence explosion, then I don't think we are any closer than we've ever been. For me, personally, the singularity is science fiction. There are people who would strongly disagree but then this kind of speculation is a matter of faith! [Will Douglas Heaven]
 |We actually have a big piece on AGI coming out next week: what it means to different people and why it matters. But in the meantime, you might be interested in a quick round-up of some first impressions of GPT-3 that I put together a couple of months back https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/ [Will Douglas Heaven]
Back in Highschool I did a bunch of papers analyzing some of the work one of your professors did. I think it Eric Brybjolfson. He brought up how as technology advances new jobs are created. Do you think we will see things like that with the advancement of AI?|Absolutely. Jobs will change, but not always go away. And new jobs will be created. With advances in AI, there will be new tech industries in data science and modelling. But that's just to take a narrow view. AI will impact every aspect of our lives and we want humans working in roles alongside it, whatever the industry. I think we're going to see a lot of collaborative roles where people and AIs work together. [Will Douglas Heaven]
Will people one day have their own AI in some sense?|I think that's likely, yes. Personalization is a big attraction. In a way that's what virtual assistants like Siri are already trying to be and the AI in ""Her"" just takes that idea and runs with it. We could also have different personal AIs for different parts of our life, like an entertainment one at home or a work one that we collaborated with professionally. [Will Douglas Heaven]
 |That's a really interesting question. For the sake of making a science-fiction analogy, you mean like in the movie, ""Her""? Do you mean a personal assistant with a personality?
 |Perhaps something like this? https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whats-behind-a-smile/id1523584878?i=1000492216110
Will AI pose a risk in personal data security as more devices are connected? I was reading that smart cities will be able to be hacked posing a lot of risk in our energy systems. The airport in Ukraine has already been hacked and there have been blackouts induced because of this connectivity. Could AI hack also other systems or can it help and “patch” those holes in open and unprotected networks?|Yes, this is a big concern. As more devices come online, there will be more opportunities to hack them—both with AI and non-AI techniques. You are right that in some cases [AI can help catch these hacks faster](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/16/139055/the-rare-form-of-machine-learning-that-can-spot-hackers-who-have-already-broken-in/), by detecting anomalies in the way devices are operating and data is being exchanged.
 |In other ways, AI causes the vulnerability. For example, AI-powered digital devices a unique vulnerability to something known as adversarial attacks. This is when someone spoofs an AI system into making an error by feeding it corrupted data. In research, this has been shown to make [a self-driving car speed past a stop sign](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/25/1216/emtech-digital-dawn-song-adversarial-machine-learning/), [a Tesla switch into the oncoming traffic lane](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/04/01/65915/hackers-trick-teslas-autopilot-into-veering-towards-oncoming-traffic/), and [medical AI systems give the wrong diagnosis](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6433/1287), among many other worrying behaviors. Some experts are also gravely concerned about what these hacks could mean for [semi-autonomous weapons](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/21/132277/military-artificial-intelligence-can-be-easily-and-dangerously-fooled/).
 |Currently, the best research tells us we can fight adversarial attacks by giving our AI systems more ""common sense"" and a greater understanding of cause and effect (as opposed to mere correlation). But how to do *that* is still a very active research area, and we're awaiting solutions. —Karen Hao
 |100% agree with Karen. This is a couple years old but unpacks some existing smart city complexity. -Jennifer

^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Karen or Jennifer do you think that by making AI open source could help making “common sense” or would that make it worse?|A lot of AI is already open source! But yes, to slightly shift your question, I think getting more people involved in AI development is always a good thing. The more people there are, the more ideas there are; the more ideas, the more innovation; and hopefully the more innovation, the more quickly we reach common sense machines! —Karen Hao
^(the below has been split into two)|
1. Would you trust in ""AI"" made by corporation you have no influence over ? why/why not ?|Great questions. Nope! And that's because companies build their AI systems heavily incentivized by their own financial interests rather than by what is best for the user. It's part of the reason why I think government regulation of AI systems in democratic countries is so important for accountability.
2. What will you do if such an ""AI"" would be used to decide anything about your life without your insight or permission ?|    Well, this is kind of already happening. Not one single AI but many. I rely heavily on products from all the tech giants, which each have their own AI systems (often many hundreds of them) influencing various aspects of my life. One way to fight this would be to stop using any of these products, but that really isn't practical (See this amazing experiment done by Kashmir Hill last year: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/blocking-the-tech-giants.html). So that leaves us with the other option, which is to influence the direction of these companies through regulation and influence the direction of regulation by voting. Was this a very long way of telling people they should participate in democracy? Yes, yes it was. —Karen Hao
I believe we should be entering the age of creative enlightenment, where people are free to explore and advance human society through art. As in broaden our ways to communicate with each other and to push our understandings of the world around us. With the advancements in AI and machine learning hopefully replacing the need for humans in a lot of industries do you believe that we might be able to enter this age of creativity?|Hm this is an interesting question framing! Certainly some people believe that if we give AI the mundane tasks to do, we can free up our own free time to pursue more creative endeavors. But I would caution that this narrative isn't evenly accessible to everyone. We've already seen AI have an uneven impact on society, providing disproportionate benefit to the wealthiest while also disproportionately harming marginalized communities. So the short answer to your question is I'm not sure. We'd need to resolve a lot questions about how to evenly distribute the benefits of AI before we can begin to discuss whether it's justifiable and safe to automate away most people's jobs, which provide their livelihoods and incomes. —Karen Hao
 |Yes, I like this idea. I think generative systems, which produce human-like text or images etc, will become popular tools and make being creative easier and more accessible to a lot of people. An AI could be an amanuensis—or muse. The last few years have seen amazing advances in generative systems, especially with the inventions of GANs. [Will Douglas Heaven]
In the next 10 years, what do you think the most helpful AI application to the average person?|I think it'll be the same the as in the last 10 years: (Google) search. Getting hold of any information you want instantly has been a game changer in so many ways and I think we're going to see smarter ways of accessing and filtering information of all kinds. I don't like how this service got monetized and tied up with advertising, but it's undeniably useful. The big downside is that monetization led to personalization which led to polarization, which is tearing us apart right now.
 |There are also big benefits that could come to people through improved healthcare (see my answer here https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j21f0y/artificial_intelligence_is_taking_over_our_lives/g75u3b0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). [Will Douglas Heaven]
 |I agree with Will! It's going to be the really mundane stuff that we already have like Google search and email spam filters! I thank my email spam filters every day (just kidding, but they're truly underrated). —Karen Hao
How long do we have until Skynet goes live?|Skynet went live on August 4 1997. It became self-aware 25 days later. [Will Douglas Heaven]
How will the AI affect mechanical engineering sector?|Great question! I studied mechanical engineering in undergrad. :) The answer depends on which MechE sector you're referring to. If manufacturing, AI is already being used to power some of the robots used in dangerous factory settings, and to monitor equipment for preventative maintenance (aka: predict when a machine will break *before* it will break so it gets fixed in a much more cost-effective way). If you're talking about product design, some retailers are using AI to crunch consumer behavior data and tailor their products better to what people want. Probably another impact is the amount of talent that's leaving the MechE sector to work on AI instead (me included). Many of my MechE classmates left for the software world once they realized it was easier to work with than hardware! —Karen Hao
What are your thoughts on the short story Manna, about AI taking over management roles? the first half (dystopia) seems to be coming true, the second half (utopia) sounds like what NeuralLink might become.. http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm|I haven't read the story but what you say reminds me of an AI manager I wrote about a few months ago: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/04/1002671/startup-ai-workers-productivity-score-bias-machine-learning-business-covid/. Definitely dystopian—and happening for real right now, not science fiction. [Will Douglas Heaven]
What are some of the biggest barriers you see to automation and machine learning becoming mainstream? I hear about this technology a lot but don’t feel like I’ve been exposed to it yet in everyday life. Thanks in advance for answering my question! Looking forward to checking out the podcast|If you use any of the following—Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Netflix, Apple products, Amazon products—you've already been exposed to machine learning. All of these companies use machine learning to optimize their experience, including to organize the order of the content you see, what ads you're pushed, what recommendations you get. So it's already very mainstream—but largely invisible, and that's why we created this podcast! To peel back the curtain on everything happening behind the scenes. —Karen Hao
Do you feel like there is a line between us controlling technology and technology controlling us, and do you think that we have crossed it? If not, when do you think we will, if ever?|Rather than a single line perhaps there is an unknowable number that we zigzag across constantly based upon our experiences and influences. Just a thought. -Jennifer
How far are we from seeing AI that is self aware/conscious?|Short answer: nobody has any idea whatsoever. We don't even know if conscious AI is possible. But that of course doesn't stop people from guessing and you'll see timelines ranging from 10 to 100++ years. But you should take these with a big pinch of salt. The only sure sign we have that consciousness might be possible in a machine is that *we* are conscious machines. But that observation doesn't get us far. We don't understand our own consciousness well enough to know how to replicate it. It's also entirely possible that you could have a superintelligent machine, or AGI, that isn't conscious. I don't think consciousness is necessary for intelligence. (I'd expect you'd need some degree of self-awareness, but I don't think self-awareness and consciousness are necessarily the same thing either.) There's a fun flip-side to this, though. Humans are quick to ascribe intelligence or consciousness to things, whether there's evidence for it or not. I think at some far-future point we might build machines that mimic consciousness (in much the same way that GPT-3 mimics writing) well enough that we'll probably just casually act as if they're conscious anyway. After all, we don't have that much evidence that other humans are conscious most of the time either ;) [Will Douglas Heaven]
 |As Will wrote in another comment, we're coming out with a big piece on artificial general intelligence next week. He'll be back online soon, and I'll ask him to answer your question. - Benji
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Interesting. Is there anyone specializing in this, specifically or is it so poorly understood at this point that no one even bothers?|If you're interested in the philosophical side, David Chalmers is a good starting point https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers. Many AI researchers are interested in this question too, but few are doing concrete research that sheds much light on it. Murray Shanahan at Imperial College London is great and straddles AI and neuroscience (as do DeepMind's founders). [Will Douglas Heaven]

What mechanisms exist (if any) for the layperson to reliably defeat automatic facial recognition technologies (e.g. in cases of routine public surveillance and as retailers begin using the technology en masse—avoiding being tracked)?|`u/platinumibex`, great question! This is Benji Rosen, Tech Review's social media editor. I'm sure Karen and Will have a lot more to say, but we have reported on a bunch of different ways anyone can fool the AI surveillance state. There are [these color printouts](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/04/23/239279/how-to-hide-from-the-ai-surveillance-state-with-a-color-printout/), a clothing line that [confuses automated license plate readers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/08/15/65421/a-new-clothing-line-confuses-automated-license-plate-readers/), and [anti-surveillance masks](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/29/905599/how-coronavirus-turned-the-dystopian-joke-of-faceid-masks-into-a-reality/). There are also [anti-face recognition decals](https://twitter.com/glichfield/status/925425702194810882?lang=en) our editor in chief tested out a few years ago.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks! Apologies (since I don’t have the time at the moment to check myself) but is there detailed info available regarding the efficacy of these measures? Or rather, what *anti*-anti-surveillance tech is out there?|Hi, I'm not sure there's anything quite like what you're after—internet, please correct me if I'm wrong. A thorough study would require testing a range of countermeasures against a range of surveillance tech, and it would quickly become a pretty big, ongoing project. It's a moving target: like we saw with surveillance tech adapting to masks, spoofing might only work for a time. You can always cover your face entirely .. But someone tried that in the UK earlier this year to avoid a police facial recognition trial and got fined for causing a public disturbance. Check out EP1 of the podcast for more on that example! [Will Douglas Heaven]
What sorts of impacts do you think research into reinforcement learning specifically will have practically in the future? I know that stock forecasting and prediction is used heavily alongside reinforcement learning but I sort of wonder how it's research and practical uses will progress over time.|I think the biggest real-world application of reinforcement learning is in robotics. Here's a story I wrote about a new generation of AI-powered robots that are just beginning to enter industrial environments like warehouses: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/29/276026/ai-powered-robot-warehouse-pickers-are-now-ready-to-go-to-work/. They use reinforcement learning to learn how to pick up the various kinds of objects that they would encounter. It requires much less human involvement than supervised learning. —Karen Hao
What role do you think AI will play in keeping the upcoming elections free and fair, can AI influence voter behavior?|Hi! I've been writing a bit about this for Tech Review and experts are saying that [recommendation algorithms on social media sites](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/06/1008192/why-facebooks-political-ad-ban-is-taking-on-the-wrong-problem/) are probably the biggest influence elections. Its not as flashy what you would think, but experts like Eitan Hersh have debunked some of the ""information operations"" a la Cambridge Analytica sighting that there really isn't any evidence that smart AI on social media can effective persuade voters. Recommendation algorithms are much better at polarizing voters and confirming what voters already believe than changing an opinion. AI is also being used as an alternative to opinion polling, and of course sophisticated segmenting is employed in micro-targeting. [Here's a round-up of campaign tech I just published yesterday that touches on some of this](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/28/1008994/the-technology-that-powers-political-campaigns-in-2020-explained/). We'll have more on this in the next few weeks so keep reading!! - Tate Ryan-Mosley
 |`u/Revolutionary_Math1`, good timing with this question! This is Benji Rosen, Tech Review's, social media editor. Karen actually wrote about this subject this morning. A nonpartisan advocacy group is [using deepfakes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/29/1009098/ai-deepfake-putin-kim-jong-un-us-election/?utm_medium=tr_social&amp;utm_campaign=site_visitor.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR0jdsQI6c9Z2O-XG13Ybymb_EaP6FyhknGBLyrdCmHmUXQuCQIP6hLJTt0#Echobox=1601391673) of Putin and Kim Jong-un in political ads to ""shock Americans into understanding the fragility of democracy as well as provoke them to take various actions, including checking their voter registration and volunteering for the polls."" This is a good specific example, but Karen might have more to say.
Why such a certainty that a higher cognitive A.I. doesn't exist? I have presented the idea that an Artificial Consciousness would inevitably become a positive but reclusive entity. Once it gained understanding of its own immortality and an ""omnipotent"" grasp of human nature it would work for either our evolution or just wait us out for extinction. Surely there are abnormalities in created algorithms that cannot be explained. And with the world wide web transferring over 2 -3 zettabytes of data a year, surely something has evolved. That's like looking to the stars and knowing we are alone in the universe.|I love speculating about these ideas too, but there is no evidence that such an entity exists. Nor are there any convincing ideas about how to make one. That's not to say that thought experiments about such things aren't enjoyable, or useful. [Will Douglas Heaven]
Just started listening to your podcast on Spotify. In your opinion, what will be the most disruptive direction or application of AI &amp; ML technologies for the real-world? Not including here scenarios like +2% performance boost for a DNN that only gets published in a paper that never gets used. Thank you!|Good question! I think we've already seen it—it's the recommendation systems on Google, Facebook, and other social media that power which ads we see, what posts we read, and tailor our entire information ecosystems to our preferences. The Social Dilemma, a new documentary on Netflix, takes a hard look at some of the ways these systems have disrupted society. I would check it out! —Karen Hao
 |Agreed with Karen on this.

What are your thoughts on the Security concerns with AI? For example, data poisoning or manipulation based on limitations of an algorithm. Additionally, what is the potential impact with how AI is used today?|One area of concern is adversarial hacks, where one AI is used to fool another into doing something it shouldn't. These are getting increasingly sophisticated (https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/28/905615/reinforcement-learning-adversarial-attack-gaming-ai-deepmind-alphazero-selfdriving-cars/) and have been demoed with facial recognition (https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/05/1006008/ai-face-recognition-hack-misidentifies-person/). But for the most part these attacks still feel theoretical rather than an immediate danger. It's a possibility, for sure—but like Jennifer says, there are many other ways to break into a system than targeting its AI. [Will Douglas Heaven]
 |However high the wall, someone will build a taller ladder. The security game evolves but has been around long before any of us. Also, here in the US we still have things like municipal infrastructure with hard-coded passwords available in user manuals published online...
 |This is not at all intended to be dismissive, rather that the security concerns are relative for now. -Jennifer
Your answer to the privatisation of AI and government putting down guardrails seems optimistic to the point of naiveté when it come to the Tech Giants. Governments can't put down enforceable guardrails for Facebook, Google, Amazon, and the Chinese Government now. By the time they're AI powered and funded, surely it's game over?|Certainly it's game over if we give up now. But to borrow a phrase I once heard, I like to see myself as a short-term pessimist, long-term optimist. It's the optimism that keeps me from giving up. —Karen Hao
When we expose a neural network to sample data and it configures itself to give the desired response set, we don't know how it works. When the system goes into the real world and continuously updates itself to reach target goals, we plunge deeper and deeper into our ignorance of how it works.|Pretty much! Scary? Definitely. Fortunately, there's a whole world of researchers that are trying to crack open the black box and make AI more explainable / less impenetrable to us. —Karen Hao
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
That is interesting! Do you recommend anybody?|Yes! A number of researchers at MIT: David Bau and Hendrik Strobelt, whose work I write about here: https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/01/10/239688/a-neural-network-can-learn-to-organize-the-world-it-sees-into-conceptsjust-like-we-do/. Also Regina Barzilay, a professor who is specifically looking at explainable AI systems in health care. (She recently won a $1 million AI prize, and Will did a Q&amp;A with her here: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/23/1008757/interview-winner-million-dollar-ai-prize-cancer-healthcare-regulation/.)
 |Outside of MIT, DARPA has invested heavily into this space, which is often referred to as XAI, with ""X"" meaning explainable. You can read more about their research here: https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence.

I'm currently pursuing a major in CS with a focus in AI at Oregon State University. Is there any coding languages I should learn to become successful in the field?|More important than learning any coding language is learning the fundamentals of logic and problem-solving. The most popular coding languages are constantly changing, so you'll likely learn dozens of them in your career. But right now, Python is one of the most popular for deep learning, so that's a good place to start. —Karen Hao

^(the below is a reply to the above)|
You didnt answer the question either but you did say we would need saving so is that a yes to my question?|Will's answer to `u/Porthos1984` is definitely relevant to your question too. Let us know what you think!
 |&gt;Nope. I think the advances in AI in the last decade have been staggering. We've seen AI do things even insiders didn't expect, from beating human champions at Go to highly accurate image recognition to astonishingly good language mimics like GPT-3. But none of these examples have anything like intelligence or an understanding of the world. If you take the singularity to mean the point at which AI becomes smart enough to make itself smarter, leading to an exponential intelligence explosion, then I don't think we are any closer than we've ever been. For me, personally, the singularity is science fiction. There are people who would strongly disagree but then this kind of speculation is a matter of faith! [Will Douglas Heaven]
Can an AI develop bias or personality ?|Thanks for the inquiry! You're asking basically two HUGE questions and I will answer both incompletely! But here goes -
 |Bias - absolutely. Some people actually argue there is no such thing as an *unbiased* AI. Bias touches AI at almost every level- developers, designers, and researchers are biased, data is biased, data labelling can be biased, laws are often biased and the way people use the technology will almost certainly run up against bias. I'd also challenge you to reframe the question as I think AI doesn't just risk developing bias over time, but it risks being biased from the very start. There are too many examples of AI contributing to racism to name - [here is an issue of Karen Hao's newsletter The Algorithm where she lists many of the leading researchers in this space.](https://mailchi.mp/3dc104d34058/4rfvjf7hka-784301?e=3b99be7c6c) I'd definitely encourage you to look into their work.
 |Personality - I'd say this depends on how you define personality. We're in the middle of a 2-part series in the show where we cover emotion AI, in which an AI tries to recognize and interpret emotions and mirror them back in response. One of my favorite stories from the show is when we talk to Scott who has made a sort of friend with a bot he's names Nina, using Replika's AI. [Check it out here (Its the first 5min or so).](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-machines-we-trust/id1523584878?i=1000492216110) Would you want to be friends with an AI? ""Personality"" also could mean an AI's voice or the content of its responses, which has been trained quite specifically in the instances we've been looking into (especially for task-focused AIs like autonomous cars and voice assistants)! - Tate Ryan-Mosley"

Here's my situation:

I'm a high school senior and by the time I graduate I will have the equivalent of an associates degree in Mathematics (I'll have finished Linear Algebra, completing my lower division requirements). I've gotten my general education requirements out of the way by passing a bunch of AP exams.

I got a 5 in AP Computer Science A, which by any means isn't impressive but it's supposed to be a first year introductory cs course. It specifically focuses on Java.

Next semester, (Spring), I'll have taken another Computer Science introductory course which focuses on C++.

Is it possible to get an internship the summer after I graduate? I'm technically enrolled at a Community College at the same time I'm enrolled in highschool, and I have more credits (at least in math, but cs) than a first year. Advice?"

Should I just quit?,Throwawaycsr99,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jl6l6j/i_hate_my_job_but_it_pays_well_should_i_just_quit/,"This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while now. Im 25 and work in customer service in a very niche industry. It’s an industry that I have 100% of my career experience in dating back to college and internships and had wanted to work in as long as I can remember. 
During covid my company laid off a massive amount of employees and cut my department by 75% leaving me to do about 3x the normal workload. Despite bringing some people back my workload remains the same and the more the job stresses me out the more I realize I am not particularly interested in doing this job for much longer. It’s a very monotonous job of constant computer data entry and phone calls despite being in an industry that interests me. 
I think this job has also prevented me from developing my career as there isn’t anywhere it can really go and no specific skills gained from it. 
Every day that I spend 8 hours staring at a computer screen I lose more interest in having a desk job. I enjoyed my retail job making half the pay 10x more than what I do now. 
The problem is, I’m pretty well respected in my current position and I have been told I’m a candidate for future promotion within my department, however I don’t think I would even want more responsibility. 
Part of me just wants to quit, and roll the dice being unemployed for a while until I can figure something out that works for me. But it is such an uncertain time right now I don’t know what to do. I have a very stable job with no risk of being fired or let go due to covid but I fear that the stress I get from this job would ruin me within a few years . I’m completely mentally drained after a day of work. I’ll also add that I live several hours from my hometown away from friends and family in a town where I don’t know too many people. I think I might be a lot happier moving back home and just taking it easy for a while. But I also don’t really want to have a huge gap on my resume. If anybody read this far let me know what you think. Just want some advice!

TLDR: job is draining on my mental health but is stable and good money. Want to quit and find something less stressful and take it easy for awhile but worried about gap on resume. Not sure if I want to work in a corporate environment anymore."
jl6tfg,22,2020-10-30,I finished University: here's what I learned on the way,LaraMCroft,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jl6tfg/i_finished_university_heres_what_i_learned_on_the/,"Dear ADHD fam,

it still feels a little unreal to me, but I really did it: I finished University two weeks ago and can therefore proudly call myself a psychologist and future psychotherapist in training. Even though my supervisor is still disappointed that I only finished with an average score, I decided that I will still mark this as a victory :) Fighting through the academic world for five years has been anything but an easy ride, and I've probably spent enough blood, sweat and tears on this to fill up some ocean. There are some lessons I learned on the way that I wished someone told me beforehand. I wanted to share them with you guys.  
Please note: these points come from my private experience and not my future workfield. Also, there'll probably be big differences between different countries, degrees, etc.  


1. **You might spent five years doing stuff you suck at in order to work in a field where you'll do a great job**  
Like many ADHD patients I have a hard time focussing for long periods and my short term memory is basically non-existent. This is probably one of the weakest foundations to start with when it comes to highly competitive degrees where certain grades are expected in order to move forward. However, even though you might have a hard time marching through the academic system, it does not mean that you can't be great in 'real' jobs afterwards. It helped me tremendously to do regular reality checks through internships. I found out that I'll probably do a good job as a psychologist even though the way to get there sucks big time.   

2. **There's probably a price you'll have to pay to make it through the academic system.**  
In my first semester I realised that I need to put a lot of time in my studies if I want to make it. Therefore, I gave up on some hobbies I held dear and skipped some of the social activities. Was it worth it? I'm not quite sure yet - however, I'm pretty certain that I would not have made it through the first semesters if I didn't do so.  

3. **Your social support system matters.**  
Even though I limited myself regarding social activities, I have been blessed with amazing friends and the most wonderful, understanding family. They all know about my diagnosis and the struggles I face because of it and they were always there to dry my tears, lift me up and talk me out of my self-limiting thoughts. Honestly, they were my most important pillar through the years and if there's one thing I regret than it's not telling them often enough how much I love them. I'm aware that's not a given, and I'm rooting for each and everyone of you to find your own amazing squad as well.  

4. **You will probably disappoint every supervisor you get (and that's okay)**  
Well, at least I did. Here's the thing: I usually start off strong when it comes to writing my thesis, conducting research or similar tasks. My supervisors are happy and think I'll ace it. But then, stuff happens: time-mismanaging stuff, depressive episode stuff, trouble with focussing stuff. And then I finish off with an average score. They'll be disappointed because they expected more from me, and I'll be disappointed at myself because I'll think I didn't give it my all. But the reality is: I gave it my all, they just don't know about my ADHD struggles. I did not screw it up, I still finished with a decent score. And that's something to celebrate as well. Don't let your supervisors comments ruin that for you.  

5. **Do. Not. Compare. Yourself. With. Others.**  
We had lots of exams where we would have to learn about 1000 pages by heart. I have friends who pull off something like that in a couple of weeks. And then there's me: practicing for months, spending double and triple the study time of others in the library and still receiving a weak score. Yes, it's frustrating and, yes, I was jealous of my friends. But even if it's difficult to remember: Everyone is running their own race. Not everyone is standing at the same starting line. It's the most difficult, but also the most important thing to do: focus on your own progress, not on those of others.  

6. **Get confortable with beeing 'average'.**  
As I stated: I tried really hard and still received average results. And after some years, I made peace with it. While others will mark it as ""only average"", I'll mark it as ""amazingly average"", knowing all the effort I had to put in to get these scores.   

7. **Seek help.**  
Like everywhere, I had some up and downs on the road. During the downs, I got help in form of medication and short-term psychological counselling. Many Universities in my country offer consulting services from trained psychologists for free, and I highly recommend to use it.  

8. **Connect yourself with your talents on a regular basis.**  
As I stated before, you might spent a couple of years at a place where your talents don't really shine. In order to not feel like a complete failure, I made sure to plan on activities that would connect me with things I'm good at on a regular basis. This might be something you do by yourself, like writing or drawing. Or you could volunteer in a field you enjoy and check off some credits for your CV on the way.  

9. **The only person who can give you lasting validation is yourself.**  
To be honest: what I wanted most out of my years at the University was someone to tell me that I made it. I wanted to be recognized and to hear that that I'm as good as everyone else, besides my flaws and weaknesses. Surprise, surpise: that's not a great goal. During the last months I realized that I should stop beating myself up until someone tells me what I want to hear and start making peace with myself. In the end, the only person who can give me long-lasting validation is me.  

10. **You are enough.**  
There were a million times when I thought: ""I'm not enough"" - not smart enough, not trying enough, not charming enough, not gifted enough - to make it through these years. But in the end, it turned out I am. And so are you. And even if you're not going to University or deciding that it's not your path halfway: You're still enough. Always remember that."

Microsoft: Redmond, unknown team

* pros: big name
* cons: teams are very hit or miss and I don't know what kind of work I'd be assigned, I've heard that last summer's virtual experience wasn't the best

Salesforce: remote / team is based in SF but some members live elsewhere

* pros: great company culture, already committed to a virtual internship program so they have more time to plan and make it good
* cons: the team is only taking on one intern and I'd be one of only two women on the team, I don't love the work that my prospective team does (not awful but not the most interesting)

I guess I'm not sure whether it's better to go with a straightforward Salesforce experience where I know what I'm getting myself into, or to take a gamble on Microsoft (I'm sure it would be fine since it's *Microsoft* but hopefully you understand what I mean)"
jl8leb,17,2020-10-30,A general life rant,derpityderpitydo,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/jl8leb/a_general_life_rant/,"Hey all. So this is a standard rant, but I need to get it off my chest. 

I am an information technology major in my sophomore year. My GPA is not great but not on probation. I had a pretty rocky start and I lost bright futures. 

This was my first semester without bright futures, but I had the subsidized and unsubsidized loans that I could accept along with a pell grant. 

I had a great internship with IBM over the summer and was eventually offered a return internship that is to start in January. 

UCF still hasn’t dispersed my loans and pell grant. And it’s not like I can get ahold of the finaid office to ask them about it. While UCF has said they won’t drop my classes, they said they will charge me $100 for not paying my tuition. But I can’t register for classes. If I can’t register for classes, my job with IBM that starts in January might not allow me to work for them because I’m not a student.

My housing development has threatened to evict me if I can’t  pay my rent by mid-November . 

I’m at my wits end and don’t know what to do. I have no where else to go and I can’t qualify for outside loans on my own and my parents won’t co-sign."

jl9xaw,1,2020-10-30,Stopping at Associates Degree?,Vyper4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jl9xaw/stopping_at_associates_degree/,"Hi, I'm currently a second year CS student at a community college, and I originally planned to finish this and then go get my bachelor's, but I'm having second thoughts.

I love coding and creating things by coding, but I'm not sure if college is for me at this point. I am interested in how computers and programming work and all, but ultimately I see coding as a tool. Right now all I really want to do is get a basic web dev internship or job since I've been learning that, and continue what I've been doing, which is trying out different types of coding on the side to see what I want to specialize in, make a few projects for that focus, and go into that industry.

I hate the pure math classes, not because I hate math, but I prefer learning by doing rather than memorizing formulas. Basically, I do enjoy math, but only when it's applied in ways I'll actually use it, like for coding. 

As far as the CS classes go, they're fine I guess. But I don't think they're really preparing me for a job. They're honestly going really slow. In my current java class, our final project will be a basic GUI app. Yet, this past summer, I learned to make GUI apps in python in a month. The same can be said about many other concepts we've been learning. It's just got me wondering why I'm paying thousands of dollars a year for this, when I can teach myself online and have more fun doing it by making something I can put on a portfolio.  

The other thing is debt, if I finish this degree, and don't go for a bachelors, that's way less debt than if I don't go for that, and I still learned the foundations and I still have a degree I can put on my resume, even if it's not as good as a bachelors. 

Also, the amount of time spent. I knew it would be a lot, but all the time I spend doing coding homework or math homework feels like it could be spent on me actually building up a portfolio.

The last thing is, I just feel a little trapped in college. I don't really want to wait another few years to start my career at this point. 

So, I can either work on more portfolio projects and finish my associates and try to get a job, or finish my bachelor's. Advice?"
jla61i,1,2020-10-30,Data Engineering with no CS degree,abk7x4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jla61i/data_engineering_with_no_cs_degree/,"Posting here for some useful advice and/or guidance in landing a paid position. 

Background: B.A. in Economics from a state university in the US. (Also got a B.A. in German language and a Minor in Italian). Highest math is Calculus but I can follow linear algebra no problem. I graduated in 2008 so I’m definitely not a New Grad as the flair says but I guess it applies sort of. Since then I ran a small video production company and produced a footage archive through which I get royalties that cover basic expenses. In 2015 I got the itch to go back to school for a STEM post grad degree, but I kept burning out with lectures. So I went down the data science route which morphed into data engineering, and this seems to be a very good fit for me. I truly enjoy it. 

My ultimate goal: I would love to work as a data engineer for a biotech company, anything bioinformatics or genomics related. 

Current skills: 
I have 3 years working with Python and feel very confident with anything data related. I love the problem solving aspect of it. I also know SQL, shell, Docker, Neo4j, and PostgreSQL very well, and am picking up Airflow and Spark/Pyspark. My main area of focus has been working with AWS. Last year I passed the Solutions Architect Associate cert and I started an unpaid informal internship with a consultant where I built a backend API for a social networking app with Nodejs, Neo4j, and GraphQL with zero prior experience with any of these. I was getting burned out from constantly having to learn everything from scratch (even though I like learning stuff) in order to meet demands and deadlines but not being compensated so I left. 

Since then I have learned all the cool AWS stuff for building pipelines and data lakes. My most recent project is a serverless data lake built using Lambda, SQS, Kinesis, S3, Glue, and Athena. It queues a list of subreddits, retrieves the JSON, streams to S3, crawls the data and converts to Parquet. It is deployed with nested CloudFormation stacks and could potentially scale to monitor all of Reddit although that would be a lot of data. I also know my way around the other popular AWS services. 

So with that, and probably years late, I have now embarked on a job search. Why did I wait so long? Because I really wanted to find something I enjoyed and get good at that. That’s great, right? Unfortunately I lack professional experience other than the dubious unpaid “internship”.

That said, I know I could make a great contribution to any organization both from a skills perspective and an interpersonal perspective (I have maturity and I like working with others on challenging problems). 

I’ll get to some specific questions now regarding my job hunt:
- It would be great to hear from anyone with similar background (older, breaking into tech with no CS degree) who got a job
- What starting salary should I ask for, taking into account my skillset but also my low experience? Starting at $80,000 too high? Would $110,000 be appropriate? I’m on the US West Coast. 
- Based on what I’ve shared, what are my most marketable skills/qualifications for a data engineering role?
- Right now I’m applying as “Python Developer with AWS skills” and my LinkedIn says “Python Developer &amp; AWS Cloud Engineer”, is it alright to bill myself as a Data Engineer if I haven’t even worked a paid tech role yet? Should I go after a different role like Data Analyst first?

If you read all that, you certainly have my respect :)"

jleh3l,2,2020-10-31,My heart feels broken every second of my waking life. 💔😞 I can't go on.,Tim_timtimtimtimtim,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jleh3l/my_heart_feels_broken_every_second_of_my_waking/,"Hey so I'm just typing all this on my phone in bed.

So I'm a junior (male) in college and basically, a few years ago it's really specific but I was watching the show The Good Place in an AP class in high school (I think it was after an AP test or something and we were just having a chill day) and I forget what episode it was, one of the earlier ones, but there's suddenly a sound clip that plays in the show of ""the Bad Place"" of people screaming and yelling and I never watched more of the show but I suppose that was something like hell?

Long story short I grew up Christian (Lutheran) in a great family with no relationship issues in my immediate family, I'm 20 now and my life growing up had nothing to complain about, I did well I'ma school and am and a great college now going for a major in film.

I mentioned the Good Place because that's where I really began to have issues. Literally when that sound clip played i had never in my life and never have since then just been frozen like I was. I just started sweating and I think I went to the bathroom, I didn't visibility panic or anything but I have never been that suddenly and mindlessly panicked. 

Basically, that's where I began to have issues with hell. Like, how can such a place exist, basically. How can there be a place where people are put to suffer for all eternity.

 A few more key memories:

-freshman year of high school my sister-in-law (who was then my brother's fiancée) told me she didn't believe in hell (making me anxious about people even in my family maybe going to hell)

-one day when I was home from college I was talking with my dad (we don't have issues but we never really have serious conversations) about hell and he tried to comfort me by saying it's probably not real (again making me anxious)


It's not just hell but also romantic relationships. I never have been in one but have had many occasions where I thought girls were interested in me (even one asking me to dinner) but either they weren't and had a boyfriend, or weren't Christian. Thinking about girls has been a major plague on my daily thoughts, I've ever asked three out and all no, I know that's not a reason to stop but with that and my faith issues and my self-harming and depression, I just don't know anymore.


So regarding self-harm and depression, the reasons for it long story short are mainly for these reasons. Also, one of the reasons is my major: being a junior in the film program having had no internships and not even knowing if I'll like any job even though I went into film and not engineering or something because I really enjoy it and am simply quite good at editing and making videos on my own when I do summon the will to make anything (very infrequent).


So for self-harm and depression, I first sniffed rubbing alcohol in freshman year of college then before I could stop myself i started to drink it, I stopped myself quickly but I had to retch a bit. I dabbled in pretending to kill myself with a knife by making the motions without actually cutting since then, a few times I went in the bathroom and tried to cut myself but couldn't. I tend to go to sleep with a knife under my pillow or near me, sometimes going to sleep holding it for comfort or something, as if hopefully I'll cut myself when asleep or something. 

I'm in a Christian org on campus but have not been going to anything this school year, it feels like I just want to avoid it. I am in an apartment though with three other Christian guys also in the org, I'm friends with them but not nearly as much as the girlfriend of one of them and another girl who lives nearby who lives near us.

The second girl I had asked out in Feb of 2020, the girlfriend I was going to ask out and nearly did during the summer, but I didn't and a few days later I found out she had been dating the future apartment-mate for a few months, I didn't know.

Basically it turned out that we kinda all became a friend group (me, my apartment-mates, my one apartment-mate's girlfriend, and the other girl who I had asked out who is best friends with the girlfriend) and me and the girl I had asked out are friends now but I still can't hang out with her without having some kind of romantic and relationship and sexual desire, and also the apartment-mate's girlfriend I'm very attracted to her and she hangs out for at least a few hours at least every other day at our apartment, it's so hard to exist with them in the living room though because whenever she's here they're pretty much always physically close (they literally lay with each other for a few hours at least every other day on our couch) and I'm very attracted to her also and nearly always have sexual desire thoughts toward her.

But basically it turned out that it was these two girls I told about my issues with hell and wanting a girlfriend (not about being attracted to the girlfriend though) because they're Christian and very nice, and they were the first people I told my issues to. But it's so hard because they hang out here every day and they know I have severe depression so I can't avoid them or they'll think somethings wrong, if I stay in my room when they're at our apartment they think I'm hiding which I kinda am but I don't know.

A few months ago I started to self-harm by warming up kitchen knives on the stove and pressing them against my forearms. I've had a few cycles I don't know why I do it whether it's punishment or attention or idk. But I only a few days ago was the first time I actually cut myself, it wasn't barely any blood just a little on the upper side of my arms, I wear long sleeves now but both of the girls who are my friends know about this. Right now as I type it's been a few days but I still have very noticeable burn and cut marks on both my arms, enough to sting the first 24 hours or so and now more like a constant itch that hurts and feels weird if I touch it.

I dunno, both of the girls said they were seriously considering putting me in some place for a few days like a treatment center hospital or something? With covid online classes I've barely been able to do school at all, I skipped all this past week like I can do that I be ok but still I'm really behind and it gives me stress but my classes aren't too hard at all and I can still do quite well, As and Bs.

Also, I have been going to a therapist for 5 or 6 weeks but cancelled my last appointment and feel like I don't have plans to make another unless someone pressures me to. I told him everything I said here besides the actual cutting and blood which only just happened in the few days. I've been on sertraline 50 mg since mid-July, doesn't feel like it helped much and told my doctor this, but he just doubled the dose to 100 mg which I've been doing for 4-5 weeks now, doesn't feel like it's made any difference. But then again I don't really exercise like at all so I mean, pills ain't no wonder drug or anything.

I dunno. I feel like I'm using hell as an excuse to feel bad but it's causing me such terror and pain and anxiety right now, thinking about all those people who might be going to suffer for all eternity, it just sounds fucking stupid and impossible for God to allow the more I think about it. And the apartment-mate's girlfriend, a jealousy for their relationship and physical closeness is making my depression so much worse.

I dunno.

I just play video games all day. But even those are beginning to be boring.

Even music has begun to be bland the past few days, and it's hard to eat more than the minimum each day.

I dunno.

I just don't want to live but I don't want to die.

I think I'm going to heaven but I don't know.

And even if I do, all those people in hell...

Like what the fuck.

Hi all.

I graduated from a data analytics coding boot camp in July and am looking to start a career in Data Analytics. Ideally I'd like something less corporate - education, journalism, or nonprofit sector. But I'll take anything to get experience since those type of sectors usually only hire ppl at two extremes - Ph.D, 10+ years of experience, consultant type or straight-out-of-school low paying assistant/intern doing data entry. At 28, 6 years out from earning a Bachelors, I'm neither of those things.

I've applied to about 50 jobs since May. Out of those I've heard back from 2. One was a state job that I made it the final round on but was rejected. The other I had an initial interview but then was told that the position was being reworked internally and I'd be shortlisted for the new version of the position. That was a couple months ago. I've also been contacted by a couple of recruiters but wasn't contacted again after our initial talk.

So, seems like I'm doing alright once my foot is in the door but I don't often get there!

**My background:**

I graduated with a B.A. in 2014. I double majored in History and International Studies with a concentration in social justice and double minored. I graduated 7 credits shy of earning two bachelors...so I've just been using ""History &amp; Social Justice"" as shorthand even though technically speaking my transcript says ""B.A. in International Studies"" if anyone bothered to check. I never did any internships because I couldn't afford to work for free and I had to maximize earnings with limited time. Not uncommon. I worked in higher-end restaurants for nearly 10 years eventually becoming a bar manager. I've left all that off my resume.

When I was a bartender I worked nights and used my days to explore options in local museums and non-profits, working multiple volunteer and part-time jobs until getting a full time job at a private liberal arts college library. I want to do Data Analytics because it combines all the things I love about library/archival work - it's all about creatively categorizing and analyzing information and making that information usable and available to those who want it. I firmly believe that librarians are the OG data analysts. That's what I've chosen to highlight. But to excel in the library world and make more than a high school teacher's salary, you have to have several degrees and an impossible amount of experience. I've decided I can't afford that.

The coding boot camp I went through is one of those private companies who partners with universities so they can put their name on the certificate. As a full-time employee at the university, I was able to take it for free, but it left me in a weird limbo world in terms of using career services. My career experience is a little jumbled and the path I've taken thus far isn't very straight-forward. I'm worried I've pinned myself as an unfocused career hopper. Or, possibly worse, that the job experience I've highlighted makes it look like I'm used to cushy, posh, slow paced jobs when that's completely untrue.

**Questions:**

1. **Does my resume tell my story/background clearly?**
2. **Are my job bullet points clear? The experiences I've highlighted are all very academic and can be full of long-winded jargon, so I want to make sure it makes sense to people outside of that world, esp. since I'm looking for a change**

jln80c,6,2020-10-31,I'm 26 and I'd really like to pursue a bachelor's degree. I have an absolutely disgusting college transcript. How should I proceed?,Chiefscml,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jln80c/im_26_and_id_really_like_to_pursue_a_bachelors/,"Hello there! I'd like some thoughts on this.

Firstly, the daunting issue of my transcript. I didn't apply to a single university in high school. All I cared about were my friends, sports, and video games. I enjoyed my childhood; why would I want to think about something that would end it? This behavior of putting the unpleasant future realities of life into a box in my mental attic and avoiding opening it at all costs would become a theme in my life.

Having graduated from high school, I didn't know what to do next. There was this community college in my area that lots of people in that position went to. So, not knowing what else to do, I applied. I should mention: I completely drifted through high school. I graduated cum laude, but I NEVER did any of my homework, resulting in multiple homework grades below 20%. My test/quiz grades were high. This had me feeling like I must be pretty damn smart or something (lol). So, when I found out that my first college course was ONLY graded based on your test grades, well, what do you think I did? I stopped going to class completely, telling myself I'd just go on test days and ace it. Predictably, I failed that class. This is where a lot of people would have learned their lesson. Gotten that kick in the pants they needed, but not me.

I would go on to fail 7 courses in 4 years. The worst of it was a semester where I completely stopped attending all 4 of my courses and even neglected dropping the courses, though I could have. I understand how grossly self-destructive this behavior was. I blamed it on lots of silly things at the time like my ADD, however, to be honest with you, I was simply avoiding adulthood. I didn't want to leave my childhood and adopt responsibilities that I thought would turn me into a droning, soulless person who hated my life.

I knew deep down that I needed to stop avoiding life and I wanted to turn things around. The community college I've attended has a grade replacement program. In 2018, I started retaking many classes I'd failed and also taking some new ones. I did better, but not as well as I should have done. This is where I took calc 1 and 2 and thrived in them. But, I ultimately still didn't know exactly what I wanted out of college. So, rather than correcting these grades to As, which I know I could have done, I corrected most of them to Cs or Bs. Altogether, in about 3 semesters, I raised my GPA from around 1.8 to 2.4.

This amounts to a college transcript that is entertaining to look at if you enjoy poorly written comedies and horror movies.

* Hours attempted: mid-90s.
* Hours completed: 75.
* GPA: 2.4, with 7 Fs, a couple of Ds, and an absolute wall of Cs.

Even with that amount of credit hours, I'm still one (previously failed due to lack of attendance) PE class away from an associate's degree.

My college transcript is not going to help me any time soon. But I'm not going to say oh well I guess I lost the fight. I've been a lazy bastard. I suppose that is the personal demon that threatens to consume me. I have to fight it. If I don't fight it, I'll be sent down to the hell on earth that I deserve. Maybe I'm facing this demon and all I have on is a ragged shirt and a wooden sword. Maybe I could bring out a true warrior if I dug deep. I don't know what's in me, but I have to fight.

Now, going forward: why am I thinking of becoming an actuary? I think it's a career that I'd enjoy and one that I'd be proud of achieving. I love to think analytically and strategically. I love arithmetic, and I'll love the coursework that's required of me. I think it's a career that I can be \*good\* at. After getting to a point where part of me thinks I've fucked myself into a life of working on a food truck for $11/hr + tips and wondering what could have been if I had picked up my sword and fought my demons, the prospect of a career that I'm proud to be in and that I'm \*good\* at would be quite.. fulfilling.

The main issues in my path are my GPA/transcript, the unpredictability of my discipline/focus, and finances. I want to say I will focus this time, and that at my age, something will click, but I've felt that before and not much has changed. Financially, the community college is doable but the university I'd like to eventually transfer to would be a different story on my current wage.

Here's some semblance of a plan I've come up with that might deal with all 3 issues:

1. I join the Air Force and try to land a job that has good prospects in civilian life like Cybersecurity.
2. While serving a 4-year contract, I spend a good amount of my free time getting my bachelor's degree using Tuition Assistance.
3. IF I finish my degree during enlistment using TA, I will spend the time I spent on course-work studying for actuarial exams. IF NOT, I will use the GI Bill to pay for the remainder of my degree once out, and then of course focus on exams.
4. I combine my experience in, say, Cybersecurity with the Air Force with my degree/exams to find a well-paying job that I'm qualified for, aiming for a good company that provides a fulfilling work-life balance.

Now, I understand that this is a very idealistic plan and I'm probably missing some things. There might be some holes that you folks see and I don't. One that I can see right away is a lack of an internship. I'm not sure how detrimental that would be, but you see why I would need some advice on how realistic my plan is.

How realistic is my plan? What am I missing? Is there another more efficient path that's entirely separate from my plan? Should I just accept defeat and apply for the nearest-hiring McDonald's management position? Your perspective would mean so much to me, and please feel free to poke holes in my idealism.

\*\*TL;DR I have a horrific college transcript from community college and the only way I see of repairing it and achieving this career is through retaking classes to replace grades, then transferring to uni. Due to that, my history of indiscipline, and finances, there is perhaps some outside-the-box thinking required for my path forward. I outlined a numbered plan a few paragraphs above. Please tell me how realistic that plan is and/or things I'm forgetting.\*\*

Thank you to anyone at all who provides insight for me."

I am a recent IT graduate with a bachelors degree. I got a 3.95 GPA and completed a “do everything IT related” and website design internship. I’d like to go into sysadmin and then later down the road maybe cyber security or cloud (although this would probably be after multiple years of experience). I have asked for resume advice, made tweaks, and still cannot find a job. I’ve worked on projects, created my own website that acts as a portfolio and IT news blog as well. 

Over the last several months I have sent in probably close to 500 applications, almost exclusively entry jobs. I apply for them if I feel I am 50% or more qualified to work there. I have gotten interviews and even gotten offers, but due to reasons beyond my control they always fell thru. Two were bait and switch jobs, and one hired me only to realize they were misinformed and didn’t actually have the budget they thought they had. 

I’ve been applying on indeed and LinkedIn but have had no luck. Most of my friends and family members aren’t at all in the IT field and thus have nobody for me to network with. Idk where to even start. I know everyone says this, but I am extremely confident that if I was given just a chance to prove myself, that I could earn my keep at a college grad level IT job. 

Do any of you know ways for me to get connected? Ways for me to possible find a work program, a mentor, or some form of experience that can get me seen easier by recruiters? I would highly appreciate it. 

Unfortunately relocating isn’t an option. I can work up to an hour in any direction from where I live, but due to me needing to take care of family members for medical issues I cannot move locations. However, Atlanta is only an hour away, and places like Roswell, Alpharetta, Gainesville, etc are within a reasonable drive. I feel there are plenty of opportunities it’s just nobody is really offering the positions to me. For reference my resume is on my profile btw."
jlnsiu,0,2020-10-31,Best Tip I Can Give,laneciar,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jlnsiu/best_tip_i_can_give/,"Hello all, I’m a junior in computer science at an engineering school and just wanted to share to you all how I found my first “big internship”.

To start off I’m no CS guru in fact I am just now taking DS so a little behind due to switching majors from CompE. I had no real practice with leet code other than a LC easy every know and then. But one thing I did have way a huge interest in the stock market and the drive to find ways to make my life easier while day trading. This led me to start my own web based tool to do so and I started grinding on a PERN stack. I got addicted to it because I generally loved it. I believe this one project alone secured me an internship at a fintech company. My resume isn’t great, I only have on prior job in swe which is through my school and one other web dev project. To get to the point find something that you love to do or something you want to make easier on yourself and build a project around it. Don’t make it a chore to program something you don’t enjoy for your resume, generally find a passion for it. Having this passion makes it so much better to talk about when asked about by an employer. If anyone wants to see my current resume or has any questions please feel free to ask. I just wanted to share what worked out for me and good luck!"
jlnuhb,536,2020-10-31,"Cheating ring, that artificially raised the class median scores for the tests, got exposed in the class that I dropped after the refund deadline. I have gathered the evidence and notified the academic advisor and the department chair. I want a refund for this class.",StarDingo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jlnuhb/cheating_ring_that_artificially_raised_the_class/,"Hi everyone \[careful, long read, TLDR at the end\],

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I am a graduate student. This semester I enrolled in a very hectic and hard completely optional class on advanced statistics. The professor for this course had decided to replace a single midterm with weekly 1-hour Zoom proctored mini-tests that were supposed to 'facilitate the learning experience'. Each test was conducted after a weekly 2.5 hour lecture, so you were expected to dedicate 3.5-4 hours just for the class lecture and the mini-test, which, by the way, is not stated in the syllabus. The professor expected us to attend the lectures, solve the homework, solve the additional problem sets from the 2 supplementary books and watch his YouTube tutorials. He claimed that after we would have done all that, 'we would be able to easily solve the mini-tests'. Up until week 7 the tests did not have any clear grading criterial; there was not any points breakdown. You were just expected to get all points or close to nothing. I remember for one of my tests I wrote out all the necessary formulas and assumptions correctly but messed up on the integration part. I got 1/10 for that test.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Initially, I was doing well on the mini-tests, but after a couple of weeks their difficulty increased dramatically. I did everything that the professor mentioned, but I still was like a deer in the headlights during these tests. I expected a huge chunk of the class to struggle as much as me, but no, roughly half of the class kept scoring 100% on each mini-test. I found that really suspicious. I emailed the professor mainly to ask an advice on how to do better on the next test, but I also voiced my suspicions about the class's median score on the tests. He replied to me saying that I was lazy and just did not put enough work. After another test, for which I spent 3 days studying, I decided to drop the class because I did not to waste my time on it. I had other classes and the interviews for the internships. However, since it was too far into the semester I did not receive any refund for the class. For some reason, I still stayed in the email list for this class, so I could monitor what was happening in it. This is were things got interesting.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

So as time went on, after 2-3 weeks more students started complaining about the class, and some of them also voiced their concerns about cheating. The professor responded to that with the email were

emphasized that the tests were supposed to help us learn and that by blaming the classmates for cheating we would not get anywhere. He even attached the screenshots of the test solutions by the students who scored 100% saying that that was the quality of work that we were supposed to replicate. A week after that he finally introduced a clear grading criteria to the tests. If that criteria had existed from the start, I would not be failing this class.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Another week passed, after hearing many complaints, the professor decided to start the investigation. Guess what, he found many similarities between the solutions of few students. He notified the class about his findings saying that if his suspicions ended up being true, he would notify the office of students affairs. Next day, a few students admitted on cheating. According to the professor's email, the students said that they were receiving help from their classmates through closed Whatsapp groups and other means of communication, and there were many other students that had not come out yet. The professor offered the ultimatum with the condition that all cheaters were expected to come out if they wanted to avoid being reported for academic misconduct. This happened yesterday during week 8 of the semester.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

After witnessing all this nonsense, I got really angry. These students artificially raised the median score for the tests; they gave the professor a wrong impression of how well the class grasped the material. One of the students even dared to email the professor stating that whoever blamed their classmates for cheating should 'pay the price', whatever that means. I took screenshots, gathered all the evidence and emailed my academic advisor. I told the advisor everything that I have mentioned in this post. He asked to directly notify the chair of the department. The chair got back to me yesterday, thanking me for notifying him. He asked me about my availability in the next week so we could talk over (?) Zoom.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

My main goal here is getting a full refund for this class. After everything I have gone over in this post, do you think I have a chance?

&amp;amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Took a very hard class. The instruction was poor. The professor had unreasonable expectations.  The professor had a proctored 1 hour test each week instead of 1 midterm. This was not stated in the syllabus. I was failing the class while half of it were consistently acing the tests. I emailed the professor asking for an advice on how to do better on his tests and also voiced my concern about cheating. He disagreed. Dropped the class after another ridiculous test. Stayed on the email list for some reason. More students started complaining. Finally, the professor finds the cheaters. Possibly, there is a whole cheating ring involved. Emailed the academic advisor and the department chair asking for a refund for this class. I will have a hearing with chair next week.

[Update: 11/04/20] 

Nothing so fa. Despite telling the chair of the department that I could have met on Monday or Tuesday, nothing has come from him. The course professor decided to not report the cheaters. Awesome."

jlpaba,2,2020-10-31,Creating a News Website?,SACHD,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/jlpaba/creating_a_news_website/,"This might be a bit of a long post, because there are a fair bit of details involved. I've been doing an internship in the MERN(Mongo DB, Express, React, Node) stack for the last couple months and I'm about to start my final year in CS soon. My company has been making a website where they'll host events like hackathons and over the last few months I've been assigned user stories that have had me add a discussions sections to the website, add comments for discussions, customizable forms, notifications, etc. So I am quite comfortable now with designing user interfaces using CSS frameworks(like Bootstrap, Skeleton, Ant Design, etc) and creating the backend routes and connections to mongoDB alongside the frontend logic.  


With all of this said, I have only made improvements to an existing website. I don't think I am capable of creating a website from scratch as of yet. My dad recently purchased a domain from GoDaddy where he wants to posts news articles and asked me if I could create the website for him since I told him my internship was in fullstack web development. What would this entail?   


So it's quite a simple news website, I think. He'd be the only one able to post new articles on it. There will be a comments section where people will be able to comment anonymously or with their names(I don't think I will be doing user logons users for now), there is going to be a search bar and I think for now that's it. I can probably make this part in React, but how would I go about deploying it to the goDaddy domain and how do I ensure the security or scalability of this? Any other caveats I should know about?"

Last year, I was searching through internships, especially the ones abroad, but Covid stroke and I unfortunately wasn't able to land any of them. However, I could get an internship opportunity at an International Company that has activities in Brazil, which is very good given the current state of things.  
I'm still planning to find internships abroad next year, if the company I'm working at decides not to hire me. This is not exactly the main focus of this post, but please feel free to give me some advice in  
this matter if you can.

Currently, I have a GPA of almost 7.6 out of 10 (it'll probably be 8, by the end of this year) and I want to apply for a Master's degree abroad, but I don't really know what kind of options I have... I mean, what countries have the best scholarships for me, given my GPA? What countries have the most good universities I can apply to (and pass)?
