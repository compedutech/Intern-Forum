4vkajj,2,2016-07-31,Any advice for second degree students?,indigoprince,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vkajj/any_advice_for_second_degree_students/,"My first degree was in English and I actually never had that many issues with finding work and I have an okay job. However, my interest in compsci came to me by accident when I took some electives my final semester in college. After careful consideration, I decided that the second degree is going to be the route I take. It will take 5 semesters and that's a good amount of time out of the full-time work force, but I figure that allows me to have two summer internships (which apparently pay more hourly than my current position lol).  
  
I hope to find a career that can utilize my passion and talent in the humanities and my ambition in programming (working on the talent...all I have is the drive to learn all I can, but I'm still new to STEM). Any advice would be helpful, whether you were a second degree candidate or not.  
  
I keep asking myself ""what the hell am I thinking?"" but I guess I'm crazy. My biggest worry is that I'll almost be 30 when I graduate again. But whatever.  
  
To add to this, I'll be paying for this degree on my own this time and have budgeted my savings so that I don't have much debt when I graduate (I'm lucky that my alma mater, UMass Amherst, has a decent compsci program). So I'm very invested in this and have a lot to lose, which I think is also going to push me to success."

I've been interning with a small (but international) healthcare software/hardware development company and I've heard that they may be interested in hiring me after completing my internship. I've also heard I should have some choice which career path I would like to take. It seems I may be presented with essentially three options: Application Design, Project Management, or Coding.


My current thought process is somewhat along these lines:

It seems there are a lot of project managers currently in IT that have pretty weak insights into both coding and technologies. To me it looks like there is a large number of people that land in project management because they are not particularly capable or interested in coding or the development side. I generally enjoy coding, but I think making decisions/interacting with stakeholders on IT projects would be something I would be very good at. I don't think it would be particularly wise for me to go directly into project management until I have some time (2-5 years) focused on development/coding though. I also don't think I would be very interested in just coding for the next 25 years and would like to be able to transition to a more influential/decision making position than a software developer.

I wanted to reach out to this great subreddit for any input/advice on the following: 

* What are the Pros / Cons you have found of each of these career paths? (Application Design, Coding, Project Management)

* What career path would be most likely to be the most lucrative after 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? A short term goal (under 5 years) of mine is to generate/invest a decent amount of income.

Any input/information is appreciated!"

I have redisgned it and stuff but the one issue I am having is making a decision on where to host this new website as the current contract expires and my boss does not want to go back (FirstComm). I made a web application using PHP that interacts with our MS SQL server that works well on my test environment using IIS7 and port forwarding to have customers track their orders. I also made a working version in a  CentOS virtual machine on my laptop. The reason I made both is because I was originally told we had windows web hosting, but we do not. I was also not told we would not renew the current web hosting service when I made the CentOS version. 

I see GoDaddy has windows hosting with MS SQL support, but I have heard bad things about it. I also have considered a Digital Ocean VPS running CentOS. Has anyone else used either or have suggestions on what to use? I'm fine with using either Windows or Linux hosting, shared or a VPS, I just want to use what's best and also not incredibly expensive."

So to go straight to the point. I'm 23 years old and I'm a recent graduate. I obtained my Bachelors degree in Finance and Accounting. I have 1.3 years experience as a Marketing intern in a retail company, 6 months as an Account manager in a financial services company and 1.6 years as a Business Planning Analyst in a pharmaceutical company. All these positions were internships but I worked about 200+ hours a month. 
Now that I'm finished with Uni my employer says he cant give me full time normal employment despite promising me the position for 6 months. I received the news 2 weeks ago and i'm fed up with the overall situation in my country and I would like to work abroad. 
I'm fluent in Croatian, English and German.
Currently I'm just searching career sections on big bank companies web sites. 

- My question would be do you think that the above mentioned abilities are enough for an entry level job at an investment bank? 
- How much do I need to have saved up to go abroad and have enough to survive until the first paycheck?
- Do you have any suggestions on where I should look for new opportunities?

I would like to start working as soon as possible but since I just recently found out that I cant work here for too long there are now that many positions available where I can start working this year.

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you!

I used to have a really really passionate view of politics, and dreamed of being a senator and such, and I've always loved public speaking and debate so much. Won several state and notional tournaments in highschool, I teach highschool debate teams and judge tournaments in my spare time, have done so since I graduated highschool, and continued on to get a degree in Economics.

Ended up becoming a master's degree 4 years later after graduating highschool, and then I did the first weird turn and elisted in the Navy OCS (Officer school) and served for 5 years. I'm now out of the military and going to navy-afforded law school and going to practice at an internship with the JAG program before entering the private sector.

Kinda complicated but that's where I'm at, almost finished with my law degree and considering a career in law. I have a big sum of cash saved up from service and working in college/graduate school, so I'm financially set for a long time with free schooling. 


My (read: fantasy) plan right now, is to practice law maybe for a decade or two, save up a big sum of cash, probably get married somewhere in that timespan, and live pretty economically for awhile. 

Then in my mid 40's or so, get my teaching certificate and whatever training is required if time allows, and slowly transition over to being a highschool teacher.

It's kind of late to enter the game, but I have such an itch to teach that style of classroom, to be opening minds to new schools of thought at that pivotal turning point in becoming adults, maybe move back to my hometown and teach at my old highschool to be nostalgic if it came to being that mobile in that period of life. 

Then spend my ""retirement"" from then on as a teacher or potential higher up for the next few decades until actual retirement.


Is that feasible? Or am I just throwing away a future career as an attourney and being far more wealthy in the end?

Thanks for the help, it's a weird concept to grapple in my mind that I want to do this, so I appreciate any words of advice or experience you can give me."

I have only taken 1 java programming course and concurrently with this internship. I learned most of what I do at my job on my own. The job was mostly IT at first but I demonstrated that I could program so my duties have changed.

I have created a lot of java programs with gui's for users to do things like searching for information or running reports with our data in jde using sql injects. The tables I draw information from will often have hundreds of thousands to millions of entries and the querys can be quite complex, taking from many tables all with various relationships. Then I parse through the data and display it based on the needs of my employers. I have also created and managed my own databases in sql server. These are the main things I do but along with that I have created various tools like massive list compare, writing to excel/access from java, java robots, etc. and general IT work.

I feel like I have come so far but I don't know how I compare to others at my level. I'm the only person in my department that knows how to program, so I never had a mentor. I really like this job but it's somewhat isolating to have no one understand what I'm working on. They just tell me we need x,y,z and then I figure it out on my own.

Now the school year is about to start and I am wondering if I should try and find a different internship that has more in house resources for me. Also if I do look for another internship I want to know what my skill level is. 

Thanks for reading.

4vnzfb,4,2016-08-01,"Stuck in QA manual tester role for 2 years, what are my options?",stuckinQA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vnzfb/stuck_in_qa_manual_tester_role_for_2_years_what/,"Hi cscareerquestions,

TL;DR: Been working as a QA Manual Tester for almost 2 years. Want to find a development job, but may be have to relocate in 1 year. Should I still search for a job that I may have to eventually quit to relocate with my girlfriend? Also how do I make myself more hire-able. I have no development work experience, no internships, and a very minor side-project.

I graduated from college on May 2014 with a degree in Computer Science and landed my first job at a consulting company in the Bay Area on Nov 2014 with the position title Software Engineer Associate. However, the first project I was assigned to was a QA manual tester role. I was a little disappointed but the company did inform me that not all projects would involve development and since most projects last 3-4 months I thought I would just suck it up, complete this project and then hopefully my next one will be development. 

To my dismay I found out that this project would last 1 year, but decided that I could still suck it up and stick with the project for a year. However after a year, the project got extended for another 2 years and there's no end in sight.

I spoke to my supervisor about changing projects but he stated that this project is already understaffed and he really needed me on it. So it looks like I'll have to find another job if I ever want to work as a developer.

And this is where I kinda messed up. Instead of searching for another job right away. I kinda just gave up and continued working there for another 7 months and it just hit me that I really need to get out of here.

To make things even more complicated, my girlfriend is applying to Med school and I will be moving with her to where ever she ends up going. So that gives me about a year left in the Bay Area before having to relocate.

So my question is, should I even bother trying to find a new job right now with only 1 year left in the Bay Area? Or should I just be practicing coding and algorithms and working on side projects until I relocate?

Also, how would I make myself more hire-able? I am now 2 years out of college with no professional development experience and I didn't have any internships while in college. I have been trying to brush up on algorithms and coding problems and the only side project I've worked on recently was a small game made in Unity. Would attending a boot camp purely for the connections and networking possibilities be a good idea?

Sorry for the wall of text and thanks for any advice or suggestions!

4vpaxb,261,2016-08-01,How TF2 helped me achieve my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley (xpost /r/tf2),LoopsCode,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vpaxb/how_tf2_helped_me_achieve_my_dream_of_getting_a/,"This is a story on how TF2 got me a job in Silicon Valley, the place of my dreams to begin my career as a fresh new computer engineering grad. If you are struggling to find a job right now, perhaps this may be a little bit of motivation that you could find a good company fit, well, really anywhere. Let me know your thoughts. If you're still looking for a job after graduation - keep fighting. Here's my story. 

_________

This story started two years ago, when I was invited to sub as a Soldier in a UGC Silver Highlander team from a friend, his name Borat, I met in TF2Center. We played a few games while we chatted in Mumble, and in the first few games, we clicked pretty well. A few days later, this friend asked if I was interested in joining their team full-time as their main soldier for the upcoming season. I first hesitated, but eventually agreed because I thought the dudes were all very swell. 

Fast forward a few months, we were deep into the weekly games. Our team didn't have the best DM, or the best players, or even the best strats, but gosh darn, we had team work and good vibes. The group of guys were just great people that encouraged each other when things went south, and in general, made the sometimes-toxic UGC environment tolerable, and even fun!

Speaking of toxicity, this is how the story *really* started. 

As you all know, some teams would bring in unregistered ringers (often times higher skill divisions than what the current team is), imposters with the same name and display picture (played by a higher level player), or sometimes, the team leader just doesn't know it's against the rules. Prior to a match, there isn't much time to actually check one-by-one whether the player on the team is really who they say they are, or whether they're in the official roster. My team leader, let's call him Messiah, knew that I was a software developer. He is also one. He expressed to me his frustration, and it clicked to me that maybe I should try to take a stab at solving this problem.

A few weeks later, the UGC Roster Verification tool (now offline) was born. Initially, only the players in the team used it. After awhile, I started sharing it on /r/tf2, /r/truetf2, the UGC forums, TF2Center forums, and more, and it kinda blew up. I recall over 1000 unique players used it, and for a kid like me, that was pretty insane. Hearing people's thoughts on the tool prompted me to learn to gather user feedback, test for bugs, and ultimately implement new features to it. This was a great feeling, and it really trained me to become a better software and product developer.

Fast forward a few more months, the team sort of disbanded because we all had real life responsibilities to attend to (although no worries, we all shoot the shit on our Slack channel on a daily basis). I was talking to Messiah how I was graduating soon in June 2016, and whether he has any tips for me for job search.

Little did I know, Messiah, who I absolutely admire because he is *also* the main dev of a Steam based website, works in a company in Silicon Valley. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Recall, I've known him for around a year and a half by now, and this is the first time I knew about this. He keeps it very low key, a hint to his character. He asked me if I was interested in his company, which is conveniently located in the center of Silicon Valley. 

Am I interested? *Am I??* My life long dream has been to work in Silicon Valley. I think interested was an understatement. I was more like - ***fuck yes I am***! 

I honestly tried to apply for internships in this area all five years of my college career, with no luck each time. Being able to begin my career in the Valley would actually fulfill a long-time dream of mine.

Messiah put in a good word for me to the CEO of the company knowing what I did with the UGC Roster Verifier tool (and our fun technical discussions on coding and tech in Slack/Mumble), and I scheduled my first call with them. 

One call led to another technical call. Then a third culture call. Then finally, I was invited to their office in the Valley for a full day of on-site interviews. I flew over from the East coast; everything was paid for. Was I nervous? Goddamn I was. At this point, I was rejected by a few companies already, and morale was at a new low. 

I arrived at their office a few weeks later in beautiful California. I went through the rounds of interviews starting at 9 AM. After the seven and a half hours of interviews, of testing me everything from algorithms, data structures, building simple apps, asking me questions about design/UX/UI, career motivations, culture fit questions, and more, it was over. I was emotionally/physically/mentally exhausted, but I felt good. I even got to meet Messiah in person for the first time in two years, and he gave me a TF2 shirt. Even after meeting him in person, I still can't put a face to his voice from Mumble. It's just too unreal.

After I flew home, I went through one more phone technical interview with them, just to get more data. Considering they are a data analytics company, that made a lot of sense. 

So after around 11+ combined hours of interviews, one day, my now-boss called me to extend me an offer. It was my first offer, from a company of my dreams, and after all those rejections! I don't think happiness described it. After literally nine months of rejections after rejections, of reviewing those excruciating data structures and algorithms questions (which takes time away from me from developing great applications), of waking up knowing I *still* don't have a job while friends around me were getting offers - it was finally over. It actually took me three days to fully process the mental load that it's over. 

I achieved my dream, but I didn't do it alone. Playing TF2 actually helped me achieve my dream. Thank you Messiah, Borat, and the rest of the team for being such good people. I honestly can say I couldn't have done it without them! 

____________

So this is my story of how TF2 helped me achieved my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley. 

The lesson I learned is - just be a good person. Be a good person even under the veil of anonymity. You don't know when it will bite you in the butt, or when it will literally help you achieve your dreams. Just do it!

4vqoz1,1,2016-08-02,The transfer dilemma,scurtis28,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4vqoz1/the_transfer_dilemma/,"I am a rising sophomore at a top 50, non target school in the South (NC/VA area, don't think Wake or W&amp;L, I'd consider those semi's) double majoring in Econ and Finance. I currently live around 30 minutes outside of NYC, and I am fortunate enough to have a pretty large network of people around the IB/PE/HF spaces. My school currently has a very young alumni base, with about 15-20 alums in the banking space (mostly BB's or MM's, think CS, BAML, WF, Cantor, HSBC), and maybe 30-35 total alums in areas across those 3 industries I've listed above. I've already been reaching out to plenty for the last several months during my freshman year, and now's about the time I'm going to try and follow up on a few. There isn't a whole lot of structured OCR, but I know that CS and WF come, and there are a couple alums also at BAML. I am super involved in the student run investment fund, to which I'm a sector head (as a freshman). My real knock comes from my freshman year GPA, though. I lost my grandfather about a week before finals during my freshman fall semester, and pretty much tanked. I finished with a 3.0 GPA at the end of freshman year, despite having done well in high school (3.7/3.8). With all this in mind, I did manage to land a IB SA position at a boutique investment bank in my town this summer through a close family friend, which is a fantastic resume booster and looks great to future recruiters, yet my dilemma still remains.

My dilemma is this: I have very deep connections at an Ivy league school (multiple legacy, uncle on the admissions board). I never considered this school during my high school application process because I had yet to learn about banking entirely, thus having no real grasp on the competitive nature of it w/ OCR and the difficulty coming from a ""non target."" Also, this Ivy was ~$20k more per year than my current school which DID factor into my decision making (I'm paying a portion of my own tuition). Keep in mind, while my school is not completely in the dark, it isn't like the semi-targets that you'd think of in the south (like Wake or W&amp;L where several students make it across the BB's).

For me, however, my situation is a little more unique, in that I'd be able to pull up my grades from a 3.0 cumulative to a 3.3, and a major GPA of a 3.6 by the end of the fall semester (aren't liberal arts schools beautiful?!?). I've yet to even delve into my double major classes in Econ and Finance, so this upcoming fall could be a great opportunity for my GPA. This is a fairly realistic goal for me by the end of the upcoming semester, especially because I've yet to fully get into classes surrounding my major until this next fall. Ideally, by the end of sophomore year, I could have a 3.5 cumulative and a 3.7 major GPA heading into SA recruiting in the fall of my junior year at said non-target, which is miles better than where I stand now. My issue really comes in lots of different parts, though. I would much rather stay at my current school because of my close friends, girlfriend, and I just enjoy it more. I really don't like the idea of restarting socially (even though I'd be getting a clean slate academically). I also really love my girlfriend (had to throw this cliche stuff on here, it's Reddit). I know these reasons will really throw my credibility as a wannabe investment banker out the window, just hear me out. I like my current school, and don't want to transfer unless I really do have to. While I'm not an 100% shoe-in at said target Ivy league, I think I have a very solid chance with my high school test scores and involvement on my current campus with the added connections and legacies, being that I'll also be able to raise my GPA before having to apply in February of next year.

So, the age old question is: do I make the transfer to for my junior and senior years? I actually ask this question amongst people in the industry I've spoken to, and have gotten mixed reviews. Some say that it's too late, I won't have any credibility given that I'll jump into recruiting without any real academic performance at said target, there is far more competition alongside your classmates, or that my transfer shows disloyalty and does not guarantee me a job necessarily (which is more than true). That being said, some people also recommend it given that the OCR is a massive advantage and that I'll have more leeway in terms of grades (I won't need a 3.7 or 3.8 from said non-target, a 3.5 will do just fine from the target). Those people suggest I transfer ASAP (do junior and senior years at Ivy). Some people have even suggested I work for a break into IB or ER from my current non target, then pursue an MBA at the Ivy league target school and then work towards my goals from there, or even try for an MSF right out of school. Another super interesting (and my favorite) scenario would be to do 3 years at my current non-target, raise my GPA to a 3.7 or so, go through IB SA recruiting and have my plan B (if all else fails) to transfer to the Ivy, delay my graduation (which could be easy if credits don't transfer fully) and then repeat my junior year at the Ivy and potentially go through the recruiting process once again w/ all the added benefits of OCR and extensive network. This one seems nice but is a bit complicated, not too sure how realistic it is but I'd honestly prefer this situation if transferring seemed like the right path to choose.

I'm pretty certain on either breaking into IB or ER, as my long term goals are at an HF (should've put this earlier). I'm curious as to whether my aspirations to make it to HF affect my transfer dilemma as well, being that some I hear still consider school pedigree when going through their recruitment process (this is, in hedge funds). I'd obviously love to pursue something like the MS Equity Research Sophomore Associate internship next summer as a great way to either follow that path down ER or perhaps leverage that into a IB SA position (I do not care about the size of the bank at all, I have no preference between BB/MM/EB).

I'm incredibly torn and stressed about this decision, especially because it is becoming quite late. I have a terrific internship currently, but my grades were pretty lackluster in my freshman year which makes the uphill battle coming from my current non-target even steeper. I have been networking like crazy in any way, shape, or form, and followed all the guides from this site which has been a very useful tool over the last few months.

Also, I know some people are going to be INCREDIBLY skeptical of my ability to transfer into the school I'm talking about. If you are THAT skeptical and choose to focus on that detail, then just pretend I'm hypothetically a ""shoe-in"" and treat the situation as if I'd get in 100% no doubt.

ANY insight would be incredibly helpful, and sorry for the length it's just a rather long and weird story. Thanks to anyone w/ any advice!"

So, I'm applying to UTD this fall and am almost surely going to UTD unless I miraculously get into Rice and get offered full tuition (which will *not* happen haha, I don't have a perfect score on my ACT, but I know I exceed UTD's assured admission criteria as listed on their website). Here's what I'm concerned about:

I want to be a data scientist. I've shadowed a data scientist who works for a US fortune 50 company, I've had some exposure to database stuff, SQL, DBMSes like Postgres, I know R at a decent level, I'm learning Python, I already have taken some stats courses (I have the basic credits for stats at UTD knocked out already because I took a dual credit stats course with UT Austin last year), I've explored development and testing with an internship in the same company that data scientist guy worked for this summer, and I still like data science. 
However, I want to get a useful internship just about every summer during college, and I want to know if internship/full time job recruiters would laugh at me after an interview (edit: or an equivalent, or simply dismiss me because I have the wrong/too weak of a degree) if I get/pursue a CE degree. I still want to be able to apply for internships with companies like Intel or TI on the hardware side, and I could start off there instead of in software development since I hear the hardware field typically doesn't start layoffs until their employees turn 40. I've still had a passion for hardware for quite a while though, I researched a particular type of electronics component in the summer at UTD 2 years ago (won't say which for anonymity purposes), regularly make contraptions with my Arduinos, mess with my Raspberry Pi, etc, as well as design improved instruments for my school's lab instruments that have low resolutions.

**tl;dr:** I'm pretty sure I want to be a data scientist and I don't need to do any more exploring. 
Question: Could I still get software development internships while pursuing a CE degree, or would I have practically no chance? I also hear the CE degree practically eliminates the possibility of a social life because it is so demanding (is that true?). Should I bother getting the BS in math with a focus on stats in combination with the CS or CE, or should I just get good GRE scores and get a company with a tuition reimbursement program to pay for an MS in data science at SMU or something?


Computer science options
- CS degree (BS)
- CS degree (MS), will need to spend more money though so not preferable (but may be viable)
- Double degree: CS (BS) with specialization in data science, get company I eventually work for to pay for MS in statistics (data science focus) via tuition reimbursement program
- Double degree: CS (BS) with specialization in data science and Mathematics degree (BS) with specialization in statistics, get company I eventually work for to pay for MS in statistics via tuition reimbursement program
- Double major: same as directly above except not double degree

Computer engineering options: 
- Essentially the same stuff as above but replace CS with CE"

4vqr3c,12,2016-08-02,My small state school has almost no research going on. I feel like letting go of my grad school dreams.,_Converge_,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4vqr3c/my_small_state_school_has_almost_no_research/,"I go to a relatively weak state school known for liberal arts and partying. I could have taken an extra year at community college and gotten into much better schools, but after a brutal break up and rough home life I just wanted to get away from my past life and focus on school.

But now at this school I cant find any professors performing research for my department (computer engineering) and there are only a dozen computer engineering students at the school total. 

I talked to the head of my department, and asked him what I should do and he responded ""I dunno. You're kind of on your own there.""

So I'm not really sure what to do. Should I try to talk to professors in other departments to see if they have research going on? How can I land any research internships elsewhere? I dont know where to look. 

And I dont know why anyone would take me for a research internship over other students from better schools.

This is the struggle with going to a weak school. I see the students from Stanford and MIT and UCLA getting amazing, meaningful, highly publicized research and internship experience while I'm sitting here at an unknown school in the middle of nowhere with the head of my department with no knowledge of research going on on campus basically waving me off. 

I cant help but feel that the path is already set for me to never get into a top grad school. All I can brag about is a 3.6 gpa, while my competition is getting internships at NASA, SpaceX, Google, and getting experience under their professors who are top researchers in their fields. I look like absolute shit in comparison.

Anyways, what should I do here? Talk to CS or EE professors? My school's resources for finding research are lacking. 

Also does anyone have any success stories of getting into good grad schools from smaller schools? Because from the stats I've seen its unrealistic for me to try to get accepted to top grad schools if I'm not from a great undergrad school."

I'm an UK CS student, with a years worth of software engineering experience under my belt, plus a couple of months on a systems/sales engineering internship at Cisco.

I am, by most regards, an introvert. I quite like being by myself, and find extended periods of active socialisation in large groups quite exhausting. But at the same time, I like people, I never want to live by myself because I think it'd just be duller than having others around. I applied for this Cisco internship partly because sitting and coding all day with the occasional VoIP meeting at my software internship could get more than tedious. I've often considered a sort of ""technical non-technical"" role, where I'm using my technical knowhow and abilities, but in a non pure engineering context.

Would I regret taking a grad offer at Cisco if I was offered it? Cisco's CSAP program seems to have an excellent reputation, but I'm not even sure what other roles are open a few years down the line."

I graduate with my degree in CS in 3 semesters. I like that my job is mentally stimulating. I like my team. I would also consider myself a decent programmer and often help my classmates. So why am I contemplating a career change?

On my spare time I volunteer at the animal shelter, go to adoption events, etc. Also, I have an interest in science, but I am going to take more science courses next semester to test my interest or dedication to science. Do you see where this is going? I have been obsessing over being a veterinarian. No I don't fantasize about being a doctor or anything. I am in it for the animals, giving back and a physical job. A lot of veterinarians have told me that loving animals is not a good reason, an ignorant response and that the classes are hard and vet school is hard. I find science courses easy compared to my computer science courses and I use to be a tutor in math and programming. I also have a 3.9 GPA. I am not by any means bragging, but it can get annoying to always hear people say how hard it is all the time. And sometimes i wonder if every STEM major thinks their major is the hardest. Anyways, as a volunteer i don't like driving long distances, picking up poop, staying late, etc. but i do it for the animals. I know a love for animals isn't enough, but i think when there's something you care deeply about behind what you are doing makes a big difference.

I've read that veterinarians are not in demand, plus I would have to take an additional 4 years of school granted i get in. I would also get a starting salary of about 50k probably. As a developer who would graduate next year, I would make a whole lot more with no more school. But i can't seem to move past being a veterinarian. It would be a physical, mentally stimulating job, that would allow me to give back and learn about and work with animals and their owners.

I've decided i want to find a position as a veterinary assistant or technician to make a better decision. That would mean leaving my nice paying, competitive co-op. Should i leave my co-op to see if this is for me? Am i being crazy? The obsession has really died down and I am at a more rational state, but it just wont pass. Advice and experiences greatly appreciated

I have a question that keeps bugging me.
I need to select and purchase a Micro Controller, specifically one that comes on a developement board similar to the an arduino or beaglebone is, so I dont have to waste time with the circuitry.
The thing that confuses me is that a lot of the MCUs coke with no more than 1MB of flash memory.
So I'm assuming that
1) somehow that's enough memory for most embedded applications
or
2) I'll most likely have to expand the system with an external flash memory or ROM

Can anyone shed some light on this matter?"

It helps to let it out, and there's no one to really talk to about it, so...


            
I had a mental breakdown last spring. I've had a lot of ""episodes"" in my university experience, but this one took the cake. I overwhelmed myself, and I overwhelmed the people around me. I overwhelmed the person I was seeing at the time, and he distanced himself away from me. This made me more neurotic and as a result, in hindsight, I ended up getting worse and staying worse for a longer period time than usual.

I have depression episodes. I have anxiety. It runs in the family. It's bad. I need help, but I don't get help due to the dream career position I want. Maybe I could reconsider this career, but for now...


            
This summer, I left the country for an internship. Two hours before my flight, I got kicked out of my living arrangements for next year. It was a very shady ordeal - instead of being honest and transparent, my roommate stated that they were not going to get the house back and we should all look for different arrangements.

Finding a new last minute place while working full time in a country with limited internet access was difficult. 

Coming back to the states, I have no friends left on any level. Just trying to talk to my roommate about the security deposit and my items, has been beyond frustrating. It's like he doesn't even care. We were good friends and respected each other and now he treats me like I'm trash. It feels shady, creepy. Uncomfortable.

             
I have this huge pit in my chest where I feel like everything is going wrong. Add on to this, two deaths in the family, parent losing their job. My job is under new awful management - and I tried to escape, and didn't get a position I interviewed well for - I feel like I'm trapped into this job.

I feel sick to my stomach. I feel anxious. I feel like I have no place here, that I'm starting all over again, but this time, with enemies. I've lost my friends - how is that even possible.

I need to work on myself. I need to better myself. Take care of myself. Stay away from alcohol. Do my best. 

             


But how can I do that....it feels like I'm drowning when I don't have a support system to push me through my failures and celebrate my successes. It's made things so much more difficult, more lonely. Everything hurts and pains. I know I'm just at a rough time in life right now. But I feel I need something to push me. 

How do I move forward when I feel like I'm drowning in these problems? Doing the internship in another country was great to escape these issues and focus on improving myself and having a good time. But now I'm back in reality.

4vslb5,492,2016-08-02,WI-FI Electricity,tehpruno,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4vslb5/wifi_electricity/,"Hey. It's my 1st post, ever. And i'm sorry (for humanity) to say that it's actually a true story...

This happenned during an intership i had to do for my studies.

I was working in a tech support company.

Basically, all i had to do was to go where my boss told to me go and fix what had to be fixed. 

I was working in pair with my brother who also is a technician in this company (that's actually how i found the internship).

Here's what happenned :
#me = me
#lebro = my brother
#stupid= the woman i had to deal with

Our boss told us that a company bought some new computers without asking our company, and made a call saying the new computers weren't working.

Our coworkers, after a little remote troubleshooting really thought that the said computers were, indeed, broken in some way since they weren't showing on the showing on the network (no IP delivered from the DHCP) and the woman who called said that they were **PLUGGED** (keep this in mind, it's important). 
Also remember that the computers WERE NOT laptops.

So they sent us to go check what's happening.

We arrive at the company's office at around 10 am, asking to talk to woman who made the call or whoever could explain to us what happenned.
Of course, we were told that this woman was never there before 10:30 am and nobody else touched the new computers. (she was the ""IT referent"" in this company, basically, she was the one with whom my company would talk for any IT related topic).

Well, whatever, we waited 30 mins.

AND FINALLY, THE WOMAN ARRIVES !

&gt;**ME**: Hello, we are from [ITcompany's name]. We're here to see what's going on with the new computers you said you had troubles with.

&gt;**STUPID**: Oh yes, please come with me.

We follow her and she shows us the computers, which she f*cking put back in their package because they were ""broken"".

My brother and I take them, go into an empty room and start unpacking them and plug them in. Everything works fine.
My brother goes to talk to the woman.

&gt;**LEBRO**: So we've checked the computers, everything's working fine, could you please tell me exactly what you've done ? Maybe we can recreate the issue and know what happenned.

&gt;**STUPID**: I've unpacked them and **PUT THEM ON** (it's important too) the desks they're supposed to be.

&gt;**LEBRO**: Okey, Are you sure you've plugged them right, the desks you're talking about are all ready to have a computer ? (new desks, new rooms, maybe the electricity could have a problem that's why he asked)

&gt;**STUPID** : What do you mean ? We're in 2015, aren't these things supposed to work without wires ? Like my computer ? (she had a **laptop**)

&gt;**ME** : (holding myself together so i don't let even a little smile out) Hum, ma'am, these aren't laptops, they're desktop computers, they need electricity to work. That's why there are wires in the packages.

&gt;**STUPID** : I'm not that stupid (hum...) ! I know what i'm doing, i'm telling you that everything works via WI-FI nowadays !

&gt;**LEBRO** (staying surprisingly calm) : Okey then, come with me.

My brother starts to unplug one of the computer (which was shut down) and tries to power it on. Obviously, it doesn't work.

&gt;**LEBRO** : See ? It doesn't work without the wires.

&gt;**STUPID** : Then why is computer working without being plugged all the time ?

&gt;**ME**: It's a laptop, it has a battery which is reloaded every time it's on your docking station. 

We later found out that she never moved the laptop off the docking station, and since she didn't know what that was, neither saw any cables coming out from it (the desk had a hole under the docking station where the wires were going through), and had a wireless mouse+keyboard, she really thought that everything was working via WI-FI.

YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ELECTRICITY VIA WI-FI

(for those who don't know what a docking station is, it's a device in which you plug your laptop, it can add some USB ports, a video adapter (VGA, HDMI, w/e...) and other stuff)

He said it would be about two weeks for him to find out. Now I talked to Derek prior to this summer about a position at the school as a web developer (front end, cold fusion related). The position at John's company is an intern position using Django (which i love), and the position that Derek was going to help me with is a student developer position at my school. School starts in about 2-3 weeks, my internship ends in 1 week. Will my asking of Derek about the position (he said to talk to him towards the end of the summer) harm my chances of getting a job at John's company? They're close friends. I think I have a higher chance getting a job with Derek's because it's a student developer and I know the manager, he was my professor last year. But the job at John's company is the one I really want. What should I do?

tl;dr Will asking my friend about a job harm my chances of getting a job at the company he works at with my friend who'd be my manager?

After searching around a bit it seems like BIS is more a business/ theory degree rather than technical which puts me in a funny position. Throughout my degree I have done SQL, SAP and Visual Basic classes but never anything about networking/ actually installing servers etc which is what I am more interested in.

We have around a 10 terabyte server running on 10 gigabit Ethernet that connects to all of our work machines.  This is very important because about half of the people working in our office are dedicated to video production.  They make info-graphics, advertisements, and tutorial videos on how to use our software.  Most everyone in the office is using OSX, and our server is currently working great, but for some reason is having compatitbility issues with the newer versions of OSX and we are never able to stay up-to-date.  On top of that, we no longer have anyone who can maintain the server, and my company is looking to replace it.  The only problem is that we are a small company, and when we called in a professional (who'm we trust) he quoted us around 10 grand just to get a new server.  

I know it is in a RAID set up, but I'm not sure which kind.  I also know that we have crazy amounts of 4k footage that is stored only on that server, without any external backups.  All of my co-workers do not have room on their hard drives to work on the files locally, so they need a server that is fast enough they can edit large 4k video files in real time, with no latency.   It is important that the server has some form of redundancy or backup in case one drive fails, or a power outage, as I have seen the power completely go out for the entire building at least twice in the past three months. 

Obviously, I don't know much about servers or their maintenance, but I would love to hear some expert advice on this.  What options do we have?  I would not mind building one myself if there was a decent tutorial online.  Alternatively, my company might prefer buying a pre-built one that is easy to install, so long as we know that we can service it ourselves. 

Thanks for the help!"

Wasnt sure if I was serious about being a programmer. Didnt like my life, and got all depressed, and blah blah blah. Anyway I transferred out to another still pretty good state school but more diverse and liberal artsy. I finished my CS degree but thought I might just do programming on the side until I figure something else out. But now I'm actually serious about programming :P

The point is, if I include the awesome engineering school on my resume, it raises questions. To me anyway, I feel like employers are gonna think I couldnt handle the high work load because i transferred out. It's embarrassing.

It also looks weird to have 3 schools listed.

I originally had all 3 schools and landed a good job out of college as an android programmer but after 1 year, my company is laying off everyone in my building. Time for a second job.

I want to just put the school i graduated from and leave it at that. Is this okay?"

And (like magic) it turns on, boots into windows, and lets me log in with no problem, I turn it back off, and on, multiple times. It always works without a hitch, fans start up no excess noise, no nothing. So just to be sure I installed speccy on the PC and checked rail voltages, almost perfect, 5.05V on the 5V Rail was the one that was most off. So I turn it off, shut the side, take it back to $nurse plug everything back in where it was....and it doesn't start....

So without even thinking about it, I switched the power cord from one outlet on the surge protector, to another. And it worked, like magic

So I come back up to $boss and tell her

&gt;$me: Worked without a hitch, but we should probably get the surge protector replaced, because the outlet you were using went out, the rest are fine though
&gt;$boss: Really? I spent 30 minutes trying to get that thing working!
&gt;$me: Yup, remember to try a different outlet next time
&gt;$boss: *headdesk*

So I've been coming here for awhile for advice on some anxieties I feel as I get ready to start my career (recent grad).

I've expressed doubts about my ability, which people tell me is probably Imposter Syndrome. I've expressed my worries that I'm not gonna last at my first job, which most people say ""well all you can do is try your best, the rest is out of your control"" which I agree with.

But then other times I come here and read threads where seniors express how much they hate working with juniors, how if you're not a great programmer with huge projects, internships etc., you will not get a good job and won't do well at your job, even if you do.

I realize this is a large sub with lots of different opinions but it's hard to reconcile a lot of what I read. I really am worried about what to expect at my first job. It sounds like I might be hired this week, but I'm really apprehensive about starting because a lot of what I read makes me feel like I'm not prepared at all. I never had significant personal projects, I never did an internship (I worked for two years basically as a helpdesk guy during school). I hope I'm not walking into a minefield at my first gig...

I guess I'm just hoping to find that there are people like me in this field who are NOT superstars and probably never will be, who just want to make a living (not make six figures) at this, not make it their life."

I was in the middle of finishing my master's thesis, so I told them I wasn't really in a state of mind to think about joining their company.

I reached out to them after my defense and they are now offering me an ""internship"" with the possibility of full time employment.

I was going to counter that I am not interested in an internship (I have 6 years work experience in the field before I did my MS) and that they should just hire me. My thinking is that since CO is an at-will employment state, they can fire me at any point anyway if I'm not a good fit. But before I do that, I want to know if being an intern gives them flexibility that they would lose if they hired me as an employee (part time or full time).

The ""internship"" wouldn't be unpaid, although they have been vague with compensation.

Thanks so much for your time!"

I definitely want (and need) the experience that a job can give me. But I always see and read about people making more than a fair amount of money with skills that we learn in this program out on their own, working on startups, and building their own solutions. To these people, software development is like money for nothing. It's an alluring prospect. Does anybody here want to try that route? Success is certainly not guaranteed, but It sounds like a lot more fun than maintaining a corporate website, right? (Not that I would complain! If you're a corporation, please pay me to maintain your website I beg you)"

However, do you think it would be better to spend my time on 2-3 projects or just completely understanding the Cracking The Coding Interview material. With my time constraints now, I'd prefer to focus on just one. 

Side note: I have no previous internship/relevant work experience on my resume and this upcoming summer will be my last chance to get an internship because I graduate next Fall 2017. But it feels like I would need those projects on my resume to even land me an interview but then I never spent the time studying the interview material. So I feel like I'm in a predicament. Would be interested in hearing everyones thoughts. Thanks."
4vtzsy,1,2016-08-02,Should I quit my internship?,tankinturtle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4vtzsy/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"I'm an IT Intern for a local school district. I'm currently a senior in college, majoring in Information Technology with a career goal in network administration or something of the like in a medium sized business or school. 

A year ago I got an internship with a local school district. At first, it was to help with a summer project (which consisted of me putting laptop charger cords together, labeling laptops and laptop carts, and writing down serial numbers). They decided to keep me indefinitely and here I am today.

During the year, i work about 8-10 hours a week with college and 1 other job (basically geek squad for my college's on-campus students). My normal work day consists of sitting in a small office waiting for teachers to request help with their laptops/technology. I love helping people in terms of IT, its a part of the job that I enjoy, but I 'm never able to help with any serious issues. Most of the time, I'm fixing very simple hardware/Windows issues that I've fixed a million times over, and its the kind of stuff the other IT employees can fix in 5 minutes, if they had the time. I feel like my impact in my workspace is minimal and is a waste of time for me. 

This summer, the school's principals have decided that we're trashing hundreds of heavy, old computer/technology equipment, and I'm being put in charge of taking inventory of ALL of it. Its a mindnumbingly boring and frustrating process (I get to enjoy literally wading through piles and piles of irrevelant and outdated technology crap) and write down serial numbers. Just so that their inventory list is ""100%"" accurate. The buildings are poorly cooled so I'm also having to constantly run in and out of the building to keep myself from having a heat stroke. Every time I finish inventory and it seems like I can finally relax and do something other than inventory, they assign me with more inventory work. I understand that they're trying to find things for me to do around here, but I absolutely HATE doing this stuff. 

This summer work has made me think about quitting. I'm rather fed up of being basically our department's personal janitor. The main reason I've kept this internship so long is that they pay somewhat decent for a college student job and they have the possibility of hiring me full time when I graduate this year. 

I'm not really sure what to do. My biggest worry is that I lose out on a chance to have a job right out of college and that I have trouble finding a better internship after leaving this one. What should I do?"

&amp;nbsp;

*Five years later*

&amp;nbsp;

*“No matter what, you cannot deviate from this course of action.”*

&amp;nbsp;

Alice smoothed her dress greys, hair tightly coiled at the nape of her neck. A nostalgic wave of déjà vu hit her. There were no gleaming medals or rank this time, not even an insignia marking her a member of the U.S.S.F. but the familiar cut to the uniform and the tight pull of the her bun brought a flood of memories.

&amp;nbsp;

It was hard to believe she was back here, standing among dozens of others from nations all over the world. Convincing the U.S.S.F. that The Other Alice was real hadn’t taken as long as she would have thought, but they’d been thorough in their investigation.

&amp;nbsp;

It helped that The Other Alice had the time device, even if the power cell was burned out. It was a single use device that had taken Wonderland’s top scientists decades to make. During her deployment on Wonderland, Future Alice told her, Kat had briefed the U.S.S.F. on the technological advances their scientists were working on.

&amp;nbsp;

At the time, it’d appeared as though Wonderland was eager to share knowledge and trade in research and development of new technologies. Alice knew now that it’d all been a diversion, a smoke screen to cover the White Queen’s true intentions.

&amp;nbsp;

Those first reports were only a year off now.

&amp;nbsp;

“Standing before me are some of the brightest minds our world has to offer,” Commander Falstead said from the raised platform. “I personally consider it a great privilege to be here among you all. We’re on the edge of the greatest breakthrough since the invention of the hyperdrive nearly thirty years ago. Dr. Nagasaki and his team were interns on that project and I’m grateful to have their assistance and that of Japan’s Astrophysics Research and Development Department. I look around at the different countries represented here and I can’t help but feel a sense of pride. There aren’t words enough to thank you for what you’ve done, for what you *continue* to do. So I’ll just get off the stage and let you all get some grub.”

&amp;nbsp;

The room erupted in polite laughter as the Commander stepped down from the platform. The crowd broke and began mingling around tables laden with food and sparkling cider.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice watched the tide of people ebb and flow, catching tidbits of conversation. She felt removed from the proceedings, a silent sentinel with devastating knowledge. 

&amp;nbsp;

A tap on her shoulder made her spin. A young tech from the Medical team cleared her throat and begged Alice’s pardon but *the other one* needed to speak with her.

&amp;nbsp;

Without another glance at the glad-handing and triumphant jubilation of those behind her, she made her way to the medical wing. The lights in that part of the base were bright, flooding the corners with sterile white illumination. Despite the chill in the air the deeper she went, Alice found the absence of shadow comforting.

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of a long hallway she stopped, just before a door without a window. The outside label simply read ‘Quarantine’. An armed guard sat in a plastic chair just to the left of the doorway. He stood quickly to attention, familiar enough with Alice to stand aside without question. There were precious few who had permission to enter that room.

&amp;nbsp;

Commander Falstead had agreed with both Alice’s that the less who saw there were two of them, the less interaction she had with others in the U.S.S.F., the better their chances were. The White Queen couldn’t “listen” in on singular moments. It wasn’t like picking up a phone and dialing someone. She could only see in broad strokes. Endgame plans.

&amp;nbsp;

So the fewer who came in contact with the seemingly impossible anomaly of two Alice’s existing in the same timeline, the better.

&amp;nbsp;

Not to mention…

&amp;nbsp;

Alice entered the room, her heart quickening in her chest to a thud in contrast to the steady rhythmic beeping of the life support machines. Even for all the times she’d seen herself in that hospital bed it threw her. It was her and it wasn’t. They’d broken in their timelines, owned different memories, but the soul of herself still resided in that body, still as it lay now.

&amp;nbsp;

…future Alice was dying.

&amp;nbsp;

Radiation poisoning. The few doctors who'd been allowed to work on Ali had theories on how she'd been exposed to such a fatal dose but no answers because of the rate in which she was dying. Ali had been tight lipped on what tortures she'd endured on Wonderland and eventually they stopped asking, working only to make her comfortable in her final moments.

&amp;nbsp;

Willing her heart to slow, Alice reached into her pocket and pulled out a new red gem, twirling it between her fingers. A sister gem gleamed on Future Alice’s white scrubs. For a moment Alice watched the rise and fall of the other’s chest, knowing soon, it would cease all motion. The gems allowed them to communicate despite the fact her future self had slipped into a coma some months ago.

&amp;nbsp;

It’d come as quite the surprise, learning the device could be used in such a way. Already the technology was being outfitted for hospitals around the world, breaking ground in the treatment of coma patients.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice pinned the gem into her lapel and reached out with her mind.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Ali.&gt;&gt; They’d agreed on the nickname to make conversing easier. Alice felt like she had a twin sister which made it all the worse, watching her fade away. They’d grown close in the last several years, each of them healing the remote and terrible pain that had taken up residence in both of them. Understanding each other in ways beyond empathy.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Alice.&gt;&gt; The voice was weak, struggling for volume.

&amp;nbsp;

A lump formed in Alice’s chest. Too soon. It would happen too soon. &lt;&lt;They said you wanted to talk to me.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;She will be watching you.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Alice knew this and wondered why Ali had taken what was left of her limited strength to say as much. She clasped a frail hand into her own wrinkled one. What a pair they were, growing old while the world grew new around them. New technology, new exploration, new hopes and dreams. 

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Are you resolute? You must be one with your destiny.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I am resolute, Ali. I will not be swayed from my course.&gt;&gt; The truth of it filled her with courage, chasing away any doubts. There was nothing left in her but commitment. 

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I will likely be gone before they finish the shield. Promise me. Not later than the date I told you. You must return to Wonderland that day, whatever may come, you *must*.&gt;&gt; Ali couldn't squeeze her hand but Alice felt the intensity of her emotion through the connection.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I'm not sure I'll convince them to let me go alone.&gt;&gt; Alice had been gnawing over that tiny detail in their plan. At the time they'd begun planning it'd seemed to distant she'd been able to tell herself, “when we get to that bridge.” Now the bridge was here and she wasn't sure she could convince who needed convincing.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I couldn't risk you using it before you were supposed to, even to save Kat.&gt;&gt; Ali's voice grew weaker in her mind.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Ali? What do you mean?&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;The night I came I hide a portal device in your house. Behind the nightstand. Pull away the false panel and you'll find it. Do not use it before that date.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Alice promised she'd retrieve it. Before severing the connection she sensed a hesitation, as though there was more Ali wanted to say. 

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I have one more story to tell you. If everything goes according to my plan it won't come to pass. But it did, for me, and I need to tell it. The story of how Kat died.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Alice listened to the recount, tears welling in her eyes at Kat's sacrifice. At the sacrifice of everyone aboard The Looking Glass. They'd never know how their lives had paid the toll for Earth's salvation.  The remorse was heavy in Ali's tone, so familiar as to be her own. She'd hopefully never have to live with similar memories.

&amp;nbsp;

When she'd finished her tale, Ali paused before adding, &lt;&lt;I'm sorry.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

It wasn't till Alice severed the connection and exited the room that she realized Ali had called it *her* plan.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

*Five Years Later*

&amp;nbsp;

The night before the test, Alice dreamed of Weiss. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the years she'd had Ali as a companion the nightmares had receded into the background – never truly gone but diminished in force. Her death had brought them back full force. 

&amp;nbsp;

Always a hand reaching for her. Always the darkness pressing in on her. Always and forever he was out of her grasp.

&amp;nbsp;

*Hold on.* 

&amp;nbsp;

“Alice...” a whisper in the dark, just at her ear.

&amp;nbsp;

Then a voice cut through the black, a silvery thread of sound that filled Alice with hope instead of dread. Ali's voice.

&amp;nbsp;

“Stay the course, Alice. It will call for sacrifice but the price of failure is all of humanity.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice woke, the words “I am resolute,” still on her tongue.

&amp;nbsp;

She dressed that morning in solemn silence. Today was the day. No matter what happened, today was the day she would return to Wonderland. Alice stood staring into the face over the sink. It was her, it was Ali, it was determined. She picked up the old cracked earring, pinning it just beneath the lapel of the dress greys.

&amp;nbsp;

The other half of their plan was also coming to fruition today. It would be the first test of a worldwide shielding system. For the last seven and a half years brilliant men and women had worked tirelessly to make Ali's idea possible. Inspired by the technology Wonderland used to cloak itself from detection, the system would use a series of specially power plants to generate a force field. Linking to its sister stations around the world, the plants would protect against attacks from space by enclosing the entire planet in the field.

&amp;nbsp;

Ali hadn't been lying either. Even with ten years to prepare they were cutting it close. Already the White Queen's vessels grew close. They'd be upon Earth in a few days. Everything hinged on the success of todays.

&amp;nbsp;

The weight of the portal device pressed against her thigh, down in a second pocket she'd sewn into her suit. She'd nearly laughed at the symmetry of the act. Almost fifteen years ago she'd made a similar pocket for holding the blade she'd used to take the Red Queen's head.

&amp;nbsp;

The atmosphere at the U.S.S.F. headquarters was one of tension and apprehension. Every single person understand the gravity of the situation. If this failed, they were doomed.

&amp;nbsp;

People hurried around her towards their designated stations and check points, each carrying a chart, talking on a phone or whispering with a colleague. A junior intern from the Commander Administrative Office approached her, dipping her head but refraining from any form of salute.

&amp;nbsp;

“Commander Falstead asked to see you before they begin the test.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice followed behind the neatly dressed woman, the sound of her low heel slip-ons squeaking on the newly polished marble. The administrative offices where just off the north side of the plant. From a large window in the second floor they could see out over the generator and teams of scientists checking off the last markers of their pretest diagnostics.

&amp;nbsp;

“Alice, please, come in,” Commander Falstead greeted her, waving at her to join him. He dismissed two stern looking soldiers who passed Alice without so much as a glance. The Commander folded closed the file they'd been looking at and slipped it under a stack to the right of his desk.

&amp;nbsp;

From a second stack he pulled a small sealed envelope. Across the tip was a single word in familiar handwriting – 'Alice'.

&amp;nbsp;

“Before your future self passed away she asked that I hold onto this and give it to you on the day of the test. She said not to read it until you 'returned'. She wouldn't explain further but said you'd know what she meant.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice took the letter, tracing a finger over the black lettering. “Thank you, Commander.”

&amp;nbsp;

They sat for a moment in perfect silence, the sounds of a hurried world outside their bubble of awareness. Then he leaned onto his elbows. “Alice, between you and me...”

&amp;nbsp;

She looked up to a soft, understanding expression in place of his usual good humored but firm countenance. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Had it been someone I cared for, I'd have done the same.”

&amp;nbsp;

He didn't say more, just gave her a nod motioned for the person waiting at the door to enter. Alice dipped her head and removed herself.

&amp;nbsp;

Stuffing the letter into the same inner pocket where the portal device rested Alice took her position with the observing teams on the lower level. An hour to go and she'd be back in Wonderland.

&amp;nbsp;

“Commencing countdown,” a voice said over the loud speaker. Bodies stilled, eyes turned towards the observation windows around the center of the plant. Unessential personal had been cleared from the facility, leaving only the base crew who'd run the generators during the onslaught and a couple ranking members of the U.S.S.F.

&amp;nbsp;

A whining, whirling noise filled the air, pressing against Alice's ear drums uncomfortably. The technicians all wore headsets so she plugged her own as the announcer counted down to one. Before they reached their mark noise was cut in half by the shrill sound of an alarm. All through the halls red light began to flash.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice looked around, watching lab technicians running towards consoles and others still racing towards the observation windows. They relayed information back to the technicians who frantically pressed buttons and spun dials.

&amp;nbsp;

The moment they knew, Alice could see it on their faces. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Abort!” The Lead Technician screamed, sending a flurry of underlings out from his side to do his bidding. The whine grew quieter till silence, deafening and whole, filled the facility.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice felt her shoulders drop. The test had failed. Running a hand along her slacks she felt the portal device, waiting just beneath the fabric.

&amp;nbsp;

*No matter what, you must go to Wonderland.*

&amp;nbsp;

It was almost time.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice started for one of the cleared administrative offices, seeking privacy for this last act. Behind her the alarm renewed its vigorous wail. 

&amp;nbsp;

Over the intercom a mechanical voice said, “Warning: Containment breach. Warning: Containment breach.”

&amp;nbsp;

Pandemonium erupted. White coats dashed in a dance of chaos, running for exits. Someone bumped into her, hitting her shoulder hard enough to knock her back a step. Down the hallway Alice spotted Commander Falstead calmly directing people out of the facility. He spied her watching him and gave a final order before coming to stand beside her.

&amp;nbsp;

There was shock everywhere, write on people’s faces, laced through their words, but the Commander’s face was surprisingly devoid of the emotion. Instead he was composed, a look of resignation hardening his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

He said nothing, didn’t demand she evacuate or run, simply looked at her. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nearly time. Minutes now.

&amp;nbsp;

Commander Falstead gave a simple nod and rushed to follow the others out of the facility, leaving Alice alone in the hallway.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice pulled the portal device from her inner pocket, counting down the minutes with her wrist watch. As the final minute approached an explosion rocked the building. In the center, the generator exploded, shattering all the observation windows and knocking Alice off her feet. She felt her skull crack on the floor, blood running hot underneath her cheek.

&amp;nbsp;

Thirty Seconds.

&amp;nbsp;

It took everything within her not to activate the device sooner than the agreed upon time. Then a voice over the intercom said, “Warning: Radiation Levels Rising. Warning: Radiation Levels Rising.”

&amp;nbsp;

The building had been designed to prevent the expansion of radiation in the event of a breach but everyone still stuck inside before the lockdown would be cooked from the inside out. Meaning…her.

&amp;nbsp;

Ten seconds.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice groaned, pressing a hand to her scalp. The wound felt shallow but there was no way to tell how bad it was without medical attention. There was no time. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Warning: Radiation Levels Fatal.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice thought of Ali, realization dawning on her. *This.* This was how she’d died the first time. 

&amp;nbsp;

“No matter what happens, you must return to Wonderland.”

&amp;nbsp;

She’d known the test would fail. For a moment Alice was frozen in place by the flood of questions running through her head. Why? Why? Why? It was so tempting to drop the portal device and give up. Just close her eyes and go to sleep. One final trip into the dark.

&amp;nbsp;

Then, Ali’s voice drifted to her. Whether by way of memory or the hazy delusion from her head injury, Alice couldn’t tell. “It will call for sacrifice but the price of failure is all of humanity.”

&amp;nbsp;

Raising herself onto her elbow she gripped the portal device. “I am resolute.” Then she met her fate.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

The darkness pulled at her, tugging like an expectant child in need. *Follow me*, it beckoned.

&amp;nbsp;

But something else pulled on her too. Awareness yanked her up into a blinding white light. It took a moment for her eyes to adjust and when they did she was staring into the face of the Red Queen.

&amp;nbsp;

No. 

&amp;nbsp;

There were similarities but the shape of her lips was different, the color of her eyes a shade darker. 

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hello, Alice.” 

&amp;nbsp;

The guards threw her into a cell alongside Kat and the crew of The Looking Glass. Radovich and Yu pulled her towards a corner, propping her up. Pain was already beginning to ripple through her. Sores were not long off. Already the skin felt tender, ready to split. Nausea clenched her stomach, threatening to expel everything till she was hollow.

&amp;nbsp;

“Alice!” Kat rushed to her side, gripping her shoulders painfully. When Alice winced her friend apologized and loosened her grip. “How are you here? Did the U.S.S.F. send you? Are they sending reinforcements? The White Queen sent ships to Earth. We couldn’t warn you.”

&amp;nbsp;

The words came rushing out of Kat, her voice washing over Alice with familiarity and warmth. A sense of relief made Alice sag against the wall. There was still life in everyone’s eyes, though they were ragged and worse for the wear. Whatever torture they’d endured the first time around hadn’t happened yet. She’d arrived earlier than the previous Alice.

&amp;nbsp;

And alone.

&amp;nbsp;

“No reinforcements. Just…me.” Her hand brushed against her slacks, reminding her of the hidden inner pocket. The guards had taken the portal device from her, ripping it from her hands with terrible ferocity. Red welts were beginning to bloom where their nails had cut into her.

&amp;nbsp;

But, they hadn’t taken the letter.

&amp;nbsp;

Delicately she reached into the pocket and pulled out the crumpled envelope. All eyes watched her as she unsealed it and read the contents. When she finished she folded it back up and held it in a shaking hand. 

&amp;nbsp;

“What’s it say?” Kat asked.

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s for the White Queen.” Everything except the last line. That had been for her.

&amp;nbsp;

*I’m sorry, Alice.*

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Two days or maybe a million years later – everything ran together – the White Queen had Alice brought to her private command room. Screens dotted the far walls, coms filling the room with unfamiliar voices rattling off checks. The Queen sat alone in a narrow chair before all the screens and digital readings. She spun to face Alice where the guards dropped her on the floor.

&amp;nbsp;

Sores oozed pus, staining the pristine floor. The pain rolled her stomach over but she held back the bile. There was nothing to throw up anyways. She hadn’t eaten in over a day. 

&amp;nbsp;

“I wanted you to be here, to witness the retribution I will rain down on your pitiful planet. You, most of all, need to see what happens when you take from us. Even if it is the last thing you will ever see.” The White Queen’s voice was filled with righteous indignation but her face remained rigid, stoic as stone.

&amp;nbsp;

“While I would have liked to have time in which to exact the punishment you so deserve, I can promise you these final moments will send you brokenhearted into the void. I’ll learn to be satisfied with that.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice watched the Queen through hazy eyes. Everything was clouded by pain and misery. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Hold on.*

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen turned back to the consoles, leaning over to speak into one of the coms. Alice was amazed they’d reach as far as Earth. That was amazing technology indeed.

&amp;nbsp;

“Commence attack.” 

&amp;nbsp;

A screen fed back telemetry of the vessels approaching Earth’s atmosphere. Two thousand in total. Distantly, Alice mused over how the Queen received up to date information. How powerful was her deep space radar? Mysteries for another time, another *someone*.

&amp;nbsp;

“Command, we read no vessels in orbit.”

&amp;nbsp;

This made the White Queen pull up straight. Her hand hovered over the transmit button. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Leader One, I’m getting a strange reading from the surface. Power fluxuations.”

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen pressed the button. “Their shield technology failed. Likely residual radiation.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Engaging-“

&amp;nbsp;

The com went to static and a single blinking light on the radar dropped off on the next pass.

&amp;nbsp;

“Command, they’re firing on us! Where are their ships?”

&amp;nbsp;

Another blimp dropped, then another and another till more than thirty were gone. The White Queen called out commands, yelling into the transmitter.

&amp;nbsp;

“The shots are coming from the surface!” Someone shouted.

&amp;nbsp;

“They’re cutting through our numbers. We’ve lost Leader One and Twelve. Three and Four are crippled. Command! What do we do?”

&amp;nbsp;

A hundred, two hundred, three…blimps on the radar fell like flies.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice watched in silent fascination, recalling that first conversation with Ali. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”The magician’s oldest trick, misdirection.”*

&amp;nbsp;

The shield technology had been a diversion. Never intended to actually work because Ali had already known it wouldn’t. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”That’s her Achilles’ Heel. She only sees plans made with conviction.”* But she hadn’t seen the ground to space weaponry, which had surely been built with conviction because that hadn’t been what Ali meant. She’d omitted a word from that sentence. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”She’s watching you.”* 

&amp;nbsp;

It suddenly clicked into place. Alice felt something bubble up inside of her.

&amp;nbsp;

In less than twenty minutes the radar revealed nothing remained of the White Queen’s armada. Silence fell on the room. Alice broke it by reaching into her pocket for the letter, not sure she could hold back what rose up within her.

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen turned to see her hold the letter up. Cautiously she plucked it from between her peeling fingers. “What’s this?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Everything you need to know.” A bubble of bile rose but behind it was a throaty laugh.

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen read the letter, hands trembling. When she finished she crumpled it into a ball and tossed it to the ground.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice laughed. She laughed till her sides ached and her chest burned for air. She laughed as the White Queen stared at her in horror. She laughed when that horror turned to fury.

&amp;nbsp;

""You laugh?"" The Queen’s voice was shrill.

&amp;nbsp;

""Pawn takes the Queen,"" Alice said, when the laughter had died in her enough to allow speech. The euphoria took the edge off the worst of her pain.

&amp;nbsp;

""She did this knowing full well that she, *you*, would still die?"" The White Queen seemed genuinely confused.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice understood what her future self had placed all her faith in - The White Queen's inability to understand the concept of *sacrifice*. Ali had counted on the Queen’s need for revenge.

&amp;nbsp;

""Yes. It was the only play she had. I think a part of me has always know I'd die here."" Pain seized her, making it hard to concentrate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before the rolling wave of darkness could wash over fully, dragging her down into blissful nothingness, Alice beckoned the Queen closer.

&amp;nbsp;

Apprehension marred the porcelain features of the beautiful, terrifying woman. She leaned in just enough to hear the last words Alice had the strength to say.

&amp;nbsp;

""The destruction of your fleet was only the beginning, White Queen. They’ll be coming.""

&amp;nbsp;

Alice laughed at the look of fear that finally broke the mask of the White Queen. The sounds of her own mirth followed her down, down, down into the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;

I got an internship at a small game place and did their vfx work in unity for them and I've been thinking of getting more into that. I was recently laid off since the company folded and have been looking into going back to school.

I was thinking of getting another AA in programming, but it appears you can't get another AA once you've gotten one from a school. I could get an AS in game programming, but I was kind of hoping to just get one in straight up programming.

I can't get a bachelors in programming since I don't think I have really anything of note to get accepted in a good undergrad. So...I'm not quite sure what to do.

As for major goal: I just want to be employed to be honest. I dreamed, I tried, I failed. Now I just want to be employed and programming, from the bit I've done is kind of fun and if I could do it for games, especially with VFX, it could be the best thing ever.

So, any advice?

**Work Experience**

* Internet Page - Director of a publishing website in Spanish and Portuguese delivering over 60 million page views per month (up from 6,000 views per month total when I started), as well as reaching 20 million people a week on Facebook. Job duties include all aspects of running a major publishing page, with strategic decision making for development (front and back end), content (text and video), advertising, and social media being primary day to day responsibilities. To put it simply, aside from actually writing the code and stories, I do everything else for the website. I manage about 25 employees total in LATAM (primarily Brazil and Argentina, where I travel to frequently).

* Soccer Marketing - Worked with family in creating marketing decks for sponsors wishing to be part of a major soccer event. Within that, I additionally utilized the overlap in audiences for the event and website to develop interesting projects that can create recorded actions online for sponsors - something traditional billboard advertising has difficulty in generating. I can expand on other actions I have done here if necessary.

* Farm - Assisted in the planning and realization of a family farm. This included deciding on animals to raise, how to sell goods, the type of goods to produce aside from beef/poultry/pork, services we could offer outside of purely raising animals (hunts, etc), and other facets of running a farm (primarily financial-related).

* General Store - Needing an outlet for the farm's produce, we rented out an abandoned storefront in a local town. This allowed the farm some leeway in the form of vertical integration and developed a sales channel for our goods. Currently working on increasing average customer spending and generating greater margins as well as increasing sales in non-perishable and compact goods. This and the farm together are generating over 500k/year

* PWM Firm - Summer Analyst for PWM Firm, received training on investment philosophy as well as tailored investment portfolios.


**Extra-Curricular**

* Compete in Powerlifting (Next competition in November, current maxes of 455/345/545 on S/B/DL)

* Racing (Attending Bondurant after R1 applications go through)

* Scuba Diving

* Free Diving/Spear Fishing

* Target Shooting

* Sports (Football/Volleyball/Basketball)


**University - Top 20 School**

* BS in International Economics

* Recipient of competitive Honors Certificate (competing with Master's and MBA students)

* 2011 Sports League Honor Roll Certificate

* Member of University Football Team (D1)

* Winner of weight class in Regional Powerlifting Meet (2010)

* Co-Captain of Club Volleyball Team

* Member of Collegiate Investors Club


**High School - (Irrelevant for the application, but some info may be pertinent to an essay I write)**

* Intern at Goldman Sachs at 17

* Captain of Basketball and Volleyball Teams

* Treasurer and VP of National Honor Society


**Race/Nationality** - White/USA - Dual Citizen, however, with a non-Brexit EU Nation


**Stats**

* GMAT - Only took BASELINE prep test, this was without study, so I have room to improve. 710, 45Q, 41V, 8IR. Goal is 750+ by September 15th.

* Undergrad GPA - 3.2  (mediocre, I'm being fair here, and I identify this as the weakest part of my application. The average econ degree during my time was a 2.9-3.0 due to the curve only allowing 10-15% of students per class to receive A's, but that is irrelevant. My GPA is the main reason why my current goal for the GMAT is a 750 or higher)


**Goal of MBA**

* Network, Learn, Absorb - I really want to go to the West Coast as a goal for my MBA as working with Technology in any facet has been my calling. I've taken basic HTML/CSS and Comp Sci classes (the latter from EdX), and even since my time working at Goldman as a high schooler I was in the Technology department. Ideally I'd like to sell the website I run and get into technology consulting, because I worked a few times with people who were absolute geniuses and had amazing products but were myopic in how they approached bringing it to market and its true functionality. Also working with people smarter than me is always inspirational. Sounds silly but it gets me working.

* Target Schools - H/S, Sloan, Haas, Tuck, in that order.

Thoughts? I posted this before but only got 1 true review. My main MBA Goal needs to really be refined, working on that :)"

I'm 28 and have MSC in Computing. Wanted to study Business &amp; Software engineering but there was no college in the country which offered that mix, so there was Computing instead. 

Worked as a software engineer during university and afterwards worked a dream job in web development working remotely and digital nomading. 

Now got a bit bored from working individually and want to become a part of a team. I LIKE these activities: analysing, learning, creating products, optimizing, drawing, meeting people. I DON'T LIKE seating all day staring at the screen, coding and not communicating with people.


**PROBLEMS:**

1) In the country where I am resident there are no jobs in the fields I am interested in and everything besides working remotely for foreign companies is paid shitty, so I would have to move to somewhere in Western Europe.

2) Don't have some amazing skills in other fields besides web development, but have basic skills in marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurship which I got from starting my own startup and side-projects. 

3) Don't want to start from ""beginning"", taking on boring and low paid internship roles etc. after being highly paid and treated as a senior in web development.


**GOAL:**

I would like to retain the lifestyle of working REMOTELY from anywhere is possible. But my main goal would be to move away from programming to a role like: business development, product management or UX design, even if it means having to stay ON-SITE.

So I am trying to choose a viable career that would suit me the best and which would have an easy way to switch so that I could already use my existing skills."

Ha. 

Since then, I've changed my strategy to:

* not expecting any real job opportunities until I finish my MA and just kind of scraping by until then.
* locating and securing at least one or two internships between now and the time I graduate with my MA.

But I also want to take any opportunity I can to ""round out"" my experience in the meantime, which thus far only includes:

* Becoming a CASA advocate on a volunteer basis. I don't intend to work directly with kids as a career, but this is still at least peripherally related.

I'm open to volunteer opportunity ideas and whatever else you guys can think of. I don't expect people to go hunting for openings for me, obviously. I just feel like I'm not looking at a wide-enough picture of what could be relevant/helpful experience.

 I'm currently located north of Seattle for a year, then I'll be in San Diego for a year and a half, then Pennsylvania for two - in case the suggestions are location-specific.

I'm a chemE major going into my junior year. I've made the decision to switch to compE after taking off a year to work at various companies. I really enjoy the work I've been doing (software and embedded software) and would love to do it as a career. I've used C, C++, and JavaScript extensively.


Because I'm switching in, only 58 of my credits count from my first 2 years (I had already taken a few intro programming courses). I already have all the calculus, physics, chemistry and all my genEds done as well. I need 70 more credits to graduate. 


I'm an out-of-state student at a state school, but I'm very fortunate to have a full academic scholarship, so it doesn't cost me anything. My scholarship will only cover the next 4 semesters, though. Because of this, I'm hoping to finish my degree in 4 more semesters. The cost of each additional semester would be about ~20k which is money I really don't have (parents have very little money and a ton of debt, so I don't even know if I could get enough loans). 


To do it in 4 semesters, I will be doing about 17-18 credits per semester. These will be basically all engineering, CS, and math courses. Do you think this is doable? Here is my 4 semester plan:


Semester 1: 

 * Circuits I (includes lab)
 * Digital logic circuits
 * Discrete Math
 * OOP in C++
 * Statistics


Total: 18 hours


Semester 2:

 * Circuits II (includes lab)
 * Digital Logic Lab
 * Computer Organization
 * Algorithms
 * Software Engineering w/ C++
 * Linear Algebra


Total: 19 hours


Semester 3:

 * Intro to Electronics
 * Signals and Systems
 * Compilers
 * Embedded Systems
 * Elective
 * Elective



Total: 18 hours


Semester 4:

 * Capstone Project
 * Operating Systems
 * Computer Architecture
 * Elective
 * Elective


Total: 15 hours


The electives at my school range from very easy to moderately hard. 


What do you guys think? Is this doable? Any advice? As a reference, I had a 4.0 in Chemical Engineering and I usually took 17-19 hours per semester, although usually 1-2 of the classes were genEds. I don't have any real work commitments or research work and I have a return internship offer for next summer that I'll probably take, so I don't have to worry about any of that. 


Thanks for your help guys. My current plan is to try it this semester and see how I feel by the drop date (~6 weeks in)



Sorry for the long post. Thanks a ton if you bothered to read it all! 


TL;DR: ChemE to CompE switch. Junior Year. 4 Semesters of scholarship left. Need to take 18 hours/semester. Doable?"
4vwgs4,10,2016-08-02,Happy but no direction,LegendaryLlamaLord,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/4vwgs4/happy_but_no_direction/,"So for the longest time I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to be, but got into my first year of college and decided I didn't want to do that anymore. I ended up switching to engineering and have been doing incredibly well and have a fairly prestigious internship this summer. 

My problem is when I try to envision where I will be in 5 years, I have no idea. 

I like the type of work my major will set me up to do, but I don't really see myself doing it long term. I can do it well and would be proud of my work, but I don't have any passion for it. 

And this lack of enthusiasm for my work has made me put tons of energy into my social life, which sounds amazing, but sometimes I just feel so tired. It's almost like my life is spinning so rapidly that I'm forgetting who I used to be. I always had an inner drive pushing me to work toward the future, but now I'm almost starting to feel like a hedonist and am afraid of where this could take me. 

How do you find direction, or motivation, when you have no idea where you should go? How do you reign in your life so you don't accidentally throw out everything you've worked so hard for?

Day 1  
Brian was still out sick. I called and he said he’s fine, he just came down with the flu. When I mentioned my vague concerns about contamination from the zooplankton he laughed me off. Todd and I are fine.

Heather and her team sent a short email with footage attached. They took more samples and are keeping them in water. They’re wrapping up and heading back with Jake and will personally bring the samples back to keep as many of the zooplankton alive as possible. 

The DNA samples Todd ran have come back a jumbled mess. He muttered about contamination and rerunning them. I poached one of the printouts from him, and got a look at the results. It was quite the mess of bits and pieces, but I recognized a couple family names as partial matches, things like 2%, or 4%, nothing major. *Perixplexis, Smacigastes, Vibrio*. Yeah, there was definitely contamination here, although from where I didn’t know. 

I left him to fuss over the petri dishes and watched the new footage. It seemed pretty similar to the test footage at first glance. Meters upon meters of darkness once Jake leaves the photic zone, and then nothing but the tiny flashes of bioluminescent fish and plankton. I checked the timestamp, and I was almost halfway through at this point with no sightings of identifiable life. When we hit the 5000m mark a shelf jutted up. Notes indicated that Heather’s team had spotted to explore a small ledge before continuing downwards. It was here that I spotted what I thought was the first sign of life. The ROV’s lights had caught something large. I rolled forwards in the computer chair and kept the video playing. A massive shape came into view of the camera, and I squinted at it. It couldn’t be a rock formation, it was too fleshy. 

The head came into view, and then the sharp teeth, and a plethora of white, puckered scars that bit into the taut skin. It was a sperm whale. For a split second my mind raced. Had we captured footage of one hunting a giant squid? That would be the kind of breakthrough we needed. And then just as suddenly, I froze. Jake’s angle had shifted, and one the baseball-sized eyes loomed into view. It was unmoving, eerily still in the way it had rolled back into the whale’s head. It was only then that I noticed the lifeless gape of its mouth, and raw scrapes where the rocky bottom had torn away at the whale’s underbelly. I was unnerved to say the least, but I cut the video and added it to the identified animals folder. Whales don’t make it 4000 meters down untouched. They bloat and decompose, oftentimes popping spectacularly and showing feasting seabirds with entrails and loose, rotting skin. The whale corpse just felt profoundly wrong. The rest of the video is almost worse. 

The farther down we descend, the smaller the dead become. Anglerfish became tripod fish which became every type of eel imaginable, conger eels twisted and contorted upon themselves, snipe eels half buried under the marine snow. Not a single one of them showing any signs of decomposition. I dutifully categorized each one, and then watched as the ROV returned to the pallid sperm whale.  Its mouth hangs slightly open and a small, white crab stumbles out, its walk almost drunken. It falls from the gaping mouth, and when it lands on the muck it doesn’t move. After a minute a large eel descends upon it, and then darts away with the pale creature in its mouth. At this point I decide I’ve had enough for the day, and shut off the video. 
  
---
  

Day 2  
I came in find to find Gabi had sent an email instructing us to attempt to culture the zooplankton. We were capable of reproducing the pressure at which animals are exposed to at the bottom of the ocean. Todd set it to 5000m, roughly the depth at which the sample was taken, I whipped up seawater mixture and we added about ten of the copepods from where we’d been keeping them. At this point, we still had no idea what we eat. Phytoplankton, the usual food of phytoplankton, are off the table because at 5000m there’s not the tiniest trickle of sunlight. Phytoplankton are primary producers, and as such, require sunlight. After a few minutes of spitballing we decided to go with fish food intended for fry, and a dead goldfish in both tanks, even though we didn’t expect the non-pressurized plankton to last much longer. Not exactly scientific, but we didn’t have a lot to go on here.   
  
---
  
Day 3  
Brian is still out. I called again, but he didn’t respond. Todd sent him a text, and said he’ll drop by tomorrow if he doesn’t respond, but that he’s probably just sleeping. I went to Gabi’s office so that we could tell her about the DNA, and the footage, but the door was locked. I can see her in there, though, in front of her computer. She’s probably typing up a report, and didn’t want to be bothered, so I left. Todd kept getting the same results with the DNA, so he sent a sample off to a friend who works at a large university. I told Todd about the undecomposed animals. He shivered, and asked to watch the video himself. When it was over, he was speechless. He couldn’t think of anything like it, and didn’t know what would cause it. I couldn’t help but think of our samples back in the lab. 

We checked on the zooplankton. The pressurized tank was cloudy, and Todd swears. He disengaged the mechanism, and we leaned in to see the almost clear bodies of our organism floating on the surface. Our unintentional control group was fine. We thought we had lost them as well, but when Todd knocked on the tank they burst up in a swarm from the fish. There are no visible signs of damage to the body of the fish, and the fry flakes remain uneaten. As the plankton are transparent, it’s clear that they have eaten something, although what it is we don’t know. We’ve begun to call them *Ostiosecara* for now. Todd joked that Gabi will probably want to name the species. I smacked him. In all reality, naming rights belong to Heather, or at least Brian, if he would ever show up for work.  
  
---
  

Day 4

Todd’s going over to check on Brian when work gets out. I started writing this up on my lunch break, and I’m just now getting around to finishing it. I was a little worried about getting caught, but Gabi hadn’t been down here in two days, so she probably had better stuff to do than snoop around my laptop. 

We still didn’t know why the *Ostiosecara* don’t survive when we recreate deep ocean pressures. Todd’s theory is that they’re originally a shallow water species, and their eggs were somehow trapped in sediment. I knew they were examples of *Anostraca* cysts lasting for years, but what Todd was implying simply could not be possible. There’s no way a species could either survive long enough to become trapped in sediment and reach the bottom, or fall that far without being eaten.

It became clear they’re eating the goldfish, but it still shows no sign of decomposition.
Our little plankton still gave me the creeps, although I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why. As suggested in the comments earlier, it was so small that even if it were carnivorous and despite its aggressive activity, there’s no way it would be a threat to humans, or even larger animals. Even bearing the similarity of its mouthparts to *Isistius*, such a bite would be no more than a nuisance. The ecological ramifications of its release into waters would be disturbing to say the least, but it is not in itself dangerous. In fact, to my knowledge the only danger zooplankton pose is as their role in carrying disease. 

That was when it hit me. Disease vectors. They had a similar method of feeding to the cookie cutter shark, and carried what can only be a dangerous bacterium that benefited from their parasitic lifestyle. They bite a host, and expose their prey to the bacterium, a bacterium so vicious that it outcompetes all others. The undecomposed corpses began to make sense in that moment, even though I didn’t want them to. I looked up to call Todd over, and saw Gabi’s door swing open. Two men in suits were escorting her out. I thought she might have been working with them, that this might have been her doing, but when she looked back at me, looked at the samples of *Ostiosecara*, I knew she wasn’t. There was nothing in her eyes but fear.
  
Working silently next to Todd, we threw all of our samples into the pressurized tank. Heather would be arriving with more, but at this point, it was all we could do. I told him about my theory as we worked, wearing lab coats, goggles, and elbow length gloves. He nodded as I talked, and when I finished, the first word out of his mouth was “Brian.”
When we showed up at his apartment the door was unlocked. I want to tell you that the smell of death hung heavy over us. I want to say that his body was pale and bloated, lose with the arrival and departure of rigor mortis. It would be a lie. Brian sat in his computer chair facing away from the door, and Todd stepped inside, a relieved grin spreading his face, and slapped him on the shoulder. “What’s up, Brian? How come you haven’t been returning-”

His expression collapsed into one of horror as the body sagged forward. I knew by the way he had flinched that Brian was cold. That he had been dead for at least a day. 
We stood out in the hallway and called the police. We couldn't bear to be inside. Seeing him like this was somehow worse, taunting in its unnaturality.   
  
---
  
I was let go from my internship early with a promise of a stellar recommendation, and the unsaid threat beneath it that my career depended on my sealed lips. Todd transferred to a nearby university with a hefty severance package. We never got those DNA results.

4vwr03,1,2016-08-03,I think my friend is the reason I am scared to learn new things...,MuggedMelon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vwr03/i_think_my_friend_is_the_reason_i_am_scared_to/,"I'm just a high school student, and it is my dream to be a software developer someday. Last summer, my best friend got an internship at a new start-up and has really changed. He has started to become arrogant, somehow figuring out a way to often assert the fact that he 'is better than me', regardless of context and it has driven me to the point where I am genuinely scared to ask him questions when I am trying to learn new things in computers, as he just seems to get irritated and says that I need 'to learn something without him'. In the event that I do or find something that I find cool to do with computers and programming, he seems to refuse to share my enthusiasm and blatently replies with 'I really don't care'. This is contrary to what I say to him, regardless of whether or not whatever he is showing me is boring. I am always willing to share a friends enthusiasm regardless of what it is; as long as it makes them happy. Furthermore, he does not seem to understand that fact that I suffer from some learning disabilities, and I honestly try my hardest to learn, but it is difficult due to the aforementioned.

How do I assert this?

tl;dr:
best friend is becoming an asshole, constantly mocking me for what i am trying to learn - send help"

I am in a sort of junior/senior year at a decent state university. I am majoring in Mathematics with a CS emphasis. I should have all of my CS minor requirements met by the end of the semester along with an extra CS class of Object Oriented Program and Design. I am also doing free code camp in my spare time but am not very far in to it. 

My big concern is not only feeling like I am nowhere near qualified enough to do anything, and seem to forget most of how I have done every project I have done, but my GPA is pretty bad. It is a 2.8, which to be fair is a transfer GPA, as in only my upper level courses are on it, and I am a math major so a 3.0 is pretty good, but I don't think companies look at that. 

I am not really concerned with where I work, or even getting great money, I just want to get a job. I am 37 and not getting any younger. I would like to be able to pay off school and afford a car or something haha. Aside from what I am doing how can I get myself in the market? What are good places to look for internships? Basically what it boils down to is I am terrified that I am going to end up with 50k in debt and no job despite having a decent degree because I have no practical real world coding skills. "

I am currently working at a Big Four company in LA as a Security Consultant. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major.
This school itself as a CIS degree has a great reputation in Cyber Security and a lot of grads become very marketable after graduating through internships, CCDC, and clubs.

I am happy about what I did so far in my career, as I know that Cyber Security isn't an easy field to break into, and I managed to get in without going through the years of being at a help desk or technician.

So at this point, I'm wondering how I can advance my career and (not to sound greedy or cocky) maximize the money I can earn. I am making a decent living as a single male, but where do I go from here? Should I work on getting my Masters in CIS so that more opportunities open up, or get my CISSP?

Any knowledge would be very helpful :). Thank you!"

So, I graduated from a rather narrow field (nuclear), good uni, good GPA, took internships, summer schools. Now it's several months already when I keep having interviews and... always they say ""we like you very much, but we just found a guy who has a little bit more of relevant experience, sorry"".  
 - Can't find a PhD, because PhDs are given to people whom universities are already acquainted with, being sure of their performance, and my alma mater doesn't hire ( due to beaurocracy).  
 - Can't find a matching job, becasue the industry is kind of stuck, nothing is happening and people with ~5 years experience receive entry level jobs.  
 - Can't find a job in defense, becasue my country doesn't have military nuclear tech, and I can't obtain serurity clearance for any other state.  
 - Can't find a job in other industry, becasue while I do have transferable skills, they prefere people with the background.  
 - Can't find a job below my education, becasue if someone is to hire a nuclear engineer to check if a fuse panel is well connected, they better take a younger guy, who doesn't ask too much.  

What the hell can I do?  
Thank you for reaching this far."

Before I begin, I just want to say that it's both relieving and disappointing that so many Asians have experienced the same degree of what I've long denied was abuse, narcissism, and distrust from our parents (in my case, my mother, specifically). I suppose my upbringing, being raised by a single/divorcee mom from ages 9-18, allowed me to get away with some things, but this was cancelled out a bit by my mom's desire to prove to my father that she could raise me fine without him. (Also, I apologize for the  length of this post, as this is my first post ever on reddit and I've been known to ramble!)

I don't know if I'm really *looking* for advice, as I've recently started seeing a therapist and that's been a huge help, but I'd definitely appreciate and wouldn't shy away from any input or support, as I might have to take a leap of faith soon, depending on how my situation pans out. I'm also pretty open in revealing my past, so feel free to ask away. (Oh, and if you happen to be in a similar situation and just need support, just know I'm also open to contact, even if someone just wants to vent.) Onto the situation at hand...

In a lot of ways, before the most recent argument I had with my mother, I actually thought our relationship was getting better -- after beginning therapy, though, I began feeling that maybe a lot of my acceptance of her so-called ""advice"" (read: control) over the past 5 years or so had more to do with my fear of losing her. The recent incident that happened that pushed me to seek professional help was an argument with my mother regarding employment and internships that occurred the week of my 34th birthday. 

I'm a graduate student in IT security and have several friends who either are at management level or at least work in the same industry. My mother has one close friend who works in IT as a manager. Basically, the argument occurred because she felt that I should look for entry level employment (I'm about halfway through my program with about a year left). Since my undergraduate degree was in Accounting, having no prior work experience, I explained to her that the advice given to me from my friends who worked in the industry was to look for an internship over employment because putting my education on my resume as ""skills"" at this point in my program, if chosen for *any* job, would likely be for a company that simply needs IT personnel to handle menial tasks and would likely have little to nothing to do with what I was studying. She countered, stating that her friend, the IT manager, mentioned to her that I could start looking for work (for which I didn't say out loud, but I call bs, as this was the same person who told me **in person** that I maybe should take some undergraduate courses to strengthen areas where I felt I was lacking). I provided an alternative of seeking an IT help desk position at my grad school, since at least I felt I might be able to network a bit more, which she half-ass accepted, but then continued to state that her friend's advice should be a part of my job pursuit. I decided to stand my ground and I explained to her that I always felt undermined by her because even when I was provided what I felt was more credible advice -- both in relevance *and* quantity -- she still felt the need to assert that her friend's advice should hold equally or more weight than advice from my own friends. When I expressed that I felt she had consistently downplayed the relevance of my friends, even as adults, she countered again saying that she ""never said anything bad"" about them and ""always said your friend Tom (my closest friend who works as a IT security manager) was a good friend."" When I told her that believing those things about Tom yet not allowing me to take his advice over her friends actually *was* downplaying the relevance his advice, we began the cyclical argument that we've had multiple times over the years about her not trusting my judgement. Ultimately, recognizing the pattern, I decided to leave her place, assuming it'd blow over, especially given my birthday was coming up soon. Well, it didn't. She called me the Monday following my birthday weekend, after I had performed on the same lineup with one of my greatest idols (I've been a DJ for over 16 years, another thing I've had to defend against her), and immediately told me I need to start looking for that job. We basically repeated the same argument from the week before, but this time ending with me being so upset that I couldn't do anything but hang up on her before I lost it.

Instead of the incident driving me to apply for work at grad school and prepare my resume for internships sooner, it completely demotivated me. And I think this time I really finally had it because I even felt the need to quit smoking weed for the time being to assure myself that I had my head straight and I wasn't just making a bigger deal out of this than it was because I smoke daily. I assumed, like the last really bad argument we had, that she'd at least reach out, even if she couldn't apologize, but she didn't contact me until today (nearly 3 weeks later) and that even occurred with some conniving attempt to trick me with a text message only saying ""check your email"" when she never sent one. I didn't reply, as my therapist even said outright that I shouldn't have contact with my mother *at all* yet, but it's not surprising that a few hours later she texted ""call mom tomorrow."" I probably won't reach out, but unfortunately, like many I've noticed in this subreddit, I'm financially supported by my parents, as well.

Since my mom claims her and my stepdad want to support my education (really, I'm sure it's his money more than hers, considering she took early retirement in her 40's and is in her early 60's now), I have a feeling any suggestion I make for her to leave me be and continue that support is farfetched unless my stepdad decides to go around her (unlikely, as he's been fairly standoffish when it comes to what he considers ""mother-son"" issues). The fucked up part is that quitting my day job was their stipulation for supporting me through grad school (convinced that I'd need more time to ""focus"" since I was willing to take a double courseload). So, while my therapist recommends no contact, I have tuition and bills to pay, since I live alone in the condo my mother and I previously resided in together, prior to her marriage to my stepdad. I'm assuming my mom will call tomorrow, so I suppose all I can do (save for any better advice anyone might be able to give me) is make her realize how depressed I've been. She knows I've been previously diagnosed with depression, so I would hope and assume that the situation might make her step back a bit. 

My silver lining for a long time was my mom meeting my stepdad. He cares a lot for her and is well-off and maybe until a few years ago would try to talk my mom down a lot when we got into arguments. He has been alone much of his life, since his parents passed when he was young and they were dirt poor, but I respect him a lot because he fended for himself and moved to the US for college -- I feel this really influenced the outcome of my extremely successful stepbrother and stepsister (like Fortune 500 c-suite successful, who are about 10 or so years older than me), as I'm sure his parenting style was a bit more adapted to Western life. However, since he's hit his 70's, he's becoming frustrated with his own forgetfulness (another thing that irritates my mom) and often stays out of anything he considers a ""mother-son"" matter. I love the guy, but I feel helpless for him and how he has to deal with my mom, as well. 

I don't know if I love my mother the same way she loves me or if she'll ever make me feel like she does, but I will always love her and I don't believe she's always been a horrible parent. However, it seems clear now, looking back, that many of the times she decided to be more lenient on me are instead being used by her now as support for how good of a parent she was or, at least, how hard she tried to be a ""good parent."" I'm not interested in looking to the past for anything other than for greater understand of who I am now, so I really am hoping something breaks, even if it means I might have to survive on my own for a bit. I'm fearful of the possibility I may have to, but I think it's very telling that I'm at a turning point because I'm currently in a situation where I don't feel I stand to lose much except maybe some material possessions by doing so."

I'm 28 and have MSC in Computing. Wanted to study Business &amp; Software engineering but there was no college in the country which offered that mix, so there was Computing instead. 

Worked as a software engineer during university and afterwards worked a dream job in web development working remotely and digital nomading. 

Now got a bit bored from working individually and want to become a part of a team. I LIKE these activities: analysing, learning, creating products, optimizing, drawing, meeting people. I DON'T LIKE seating all day staring at the screen, coding and not communicating with people.


**PROBLEMS:**

1) In the country where I am resident there are no jobs in the fields I am interested in and everything besides working remotely for foreign companies is paid shitty, so I would have to move to somewhere in Western Europe.

2) Don't have some amazing skills in other fields besides web development, but have basic skills in marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurship which I got from starting my own startup and side-projects. 

3) Don't want to start from ""beginning"", taking on boring and low paid internship roles etc. after being highly paid and treated as a senior in web development.


**GOAL:**

I would like to retain the lifestyle of working REMOTELY from anywhere is possible. But my main goal would be to move away from programming to a role like: business development, product management or UX design, even if it means having to stay ON-SITE.

So I am trying to choose a viable career that would suit me the best and which would have an easy way to switch so that I could already use my existing skills."

I apply anyway but it really just has me wondering whether there's a larger demand for experienced devs (even with just 1-3 years) vs the amount of new/entry devs available with more than likely 0 years of experience minus a possible internship. A search for entry level jobs usually yields a much smaller pool of listings which echos the whole ""nobody wants juniors/entry devs"" mentality that I see a lot of people on here say companies have. Overall I guess my question is is the terminology changing a bit or was I just off with my mindset that junior and entry were at times interchangeable? Are you entry with 0 years and junior with 1-3 years ?"

I'm working on creating a part list for a cluster node.  I would like to build 3 or them, for the cheapest price possible per node.  each should use an ssd for boot, and I will add a raid card in eventually to drop a couple 2tb hgst ebay drives into each node for storage.   I need only pcie slots on the mobo, no pci.  I need at least one x16 size pcie slot.   2 x16 slots and an x1 slot would be the best, for a raid card, a gpu via riser in the x1 slot or a dual port nic, and possibly an infiniband card inn the last slot.     AMD is preferred, do to price, lower wattage is also preferred since they will be on a lot.

I'm is the US, so ordering parts is not an issue, and I am not against using used parts from reliable sellers.    The case is also not an issue; there's a bargain store near me that sells returned and open box cases for cheap and I plan on finding them there.

The purpose of the nodes is to play around with some clustering technologies to learn, since I'm starting to consider the idea of getting my masters to focus on distributed systems, I'm also trying to get more exposure to a pseudo HPC environment since I will be applying for an internship at my college's HPC cluster later this year; I'm currently a CS undergrad.   I'm also not against using older server hardware if it lowers the price.  

I'm looking more for the cheapest cost per node for the most power per node, without worrying too much about the power of any individual node, since they will always be being used in a cluster.

I've built other PCs in the past and messed around with server hardware, so this isn't my first time building, so I'm shooting more for lower cost than I am for ease of build or simpleness."

International student here at the UW (go huskies). Majoring in EE and this upcoming year I will be doing my (apparently) last year, so I will be taking thethe embedded systems class.

I keep hearing people say (or I read it) that ""if you do embedded systems, you will for sure get a job"". However I see my classmates in embedded systems NOT get internships in the summer, or I see others getting a job as a software engineer after they read ""cracking the coding interview"", that is, they end up doing what someone with a CS degree did, not too related to embedded.

I see most of CS majors getting jobs or internships, but I can't say the same about my EE embedded classmates.

My question/post may be vague, as I am wondering various things. How true is it that it is very easy to get a job in EMBEDDED? (assuming I am able to graduate this upcoming year)

Also, the UW EE program is supposed to be prestigious, but I personally think it is not that great. There is only one class in embedded called ""intro to embedded systems"" EE 474, and then there is the ""senior capstone"" class in embedded EE 475. I feel like there should be more classes for something you want to specialize in??

Here is the website of that EE 474 class, could you guys take a quick look at the labs and just let me know if you guys feel the labs are very well preparing me to get a job?

Do you have any general advice so that I can get a job after I graduate? My situation is somehow pressing, if I don't get a sponsorship from a company after I graduate, that means I will have to leave the country and go back home, which ideally, I wouldn't want to.

any advice/thought is welcome"

This post is going to be a bit long, but any help at all would be very much appreciated!

I'm absolutely stuck with picking a college major. I think too many subjects seem interesting and I just can't make up my mind and settle on something. Every time I try and craft an academic plan for me (which usually consists of double or triple majors and minors), I end up going over the unit limit and then realizing that having such a heavy course load would probably make me unhappy, damage my GPA, and take away my free time (which would harm my chance of doing clubs and internships as well). I don't even like school very much. I was always the kind of student who would watch the clock to see when I could leave class, and I really don't like the emphasis on test taking in college (though I do really appreciate how the structure of a class forces you to learn things). A lot of what I know now is stuff I learned outside of school on my own time (example: I like medicine, so I know a bunch of random medical facts and things about diseases). During my first year in college, I feel like I signed up for a lot of classes that sounded really cool and interesting *on paper*, but turned out to be somewhere between 'meh' and unpleasant when it actually came down to attending lectures, taking quizzes, studying for exams, etc. 

I was wondering if anyone here could point me towards some possible majors or careers. I'm open to graduate school, but I would prefer to major in something that can be lucrative at the bachelors level, if I decide that four years of college is too much. 

The things that I'm most interested in and/or already have some exposure to are: 

- Writing (best subject in school) 
- Psychology (especially in regards to emotions, interpersonal relationships, and mental health issues) 
- Persuasive writing, arguing, and making a case for things 
- Medicine (not hard science like chemistry and physics, but pathology, symptomatology, the study of autoimmune diseases, nutrition, environmental impacts on the human body, hormones, etc.) 
- Planning and organizing projects (I really like thinking about the ""big picture"") 
- Collecting human data (did a project in school that had to do with collecting surveys, visualizing the data, and then making assumptions about that data and it was pretty fun)
- Analyzing individuals, situations, and population trends (so sociology I guess) 
- Finding out why things are the way they currently are
- Thinking about the future  

Things that I'm still fairly interested in or find interesting in theory but don't have much experience with are: 

- History 
- Issues of sustainability 
- Budgeting 
- Marketing 
- Politics 
- Video game design (my favorite aspects are the storytelling and the world building aspect - the architecture, landscape, scenery, mood, style, etc. - but I don't have any hands on experience with this so I can't say for sure whether I'd actually like making games or if I just like playing them) 

I feel like I have too many interests and I feel tempted to somehow squeeze them all into a set of majors/minors (because if a skill-set or knowledge about a certain subject can't somehow be shown on a piece of paper, it doesn't ""count"" and will never seriously be considered as anything other than a very limited side-interest). It's gotten to the point where I hate looking at the list of majors my school offers, because too many of them look interesting and I feel discouraged just thinking about picking one and then missing out on the others. I think I'd be most happy just taking a bunch of random classes, but I know that a major like this doesn't exist (and even if it did, it would probably be very unemployable). This isn't even mentioning the fact that being a more humanities-based person, I'm obviously very anxious about the job climate for humanities majors, and therefore feel the need to major in (or just pick up skills outside of school) that tip towards STEM and would help me with finding a well paying job. I've really been spooked by this whole mantra that unless you major in computer science or engineering, you're going to have to fight and scratch and claw for a decent job, and even then it probably won't be in something directly related to your major. 

I'm sorry if my post was super broad. Just wondering if anyone has anything to throw out. Any help would be so amazing. When I think about future careers, I tend to focus less on the career itself and more on ""what kinds of skills/intellectual muscles do I want to utilize on a daily basis?"" I thought I'd just get a broad education that mixes interest with employability, and then cast my net out and see if anyone would hire me, regardless of what the position ends up being. 

Degrees that I've looked at are: STS (science and technology studies), professional writing, managerial economics, economics, sociology, psychology, cognitive science, sustainable agriculture, and design. "

***Now for my Prefrences***

Originally I had thought that I wanted to attend a mid-size school, but after looking at some LAC in my area (Willamette, Linfield, Pacific, and reed) and doing some research I think I would be happiest at a LAC. I love that I would have the opportunity to get to know my professors really well. I think it would be nice to have a close relationship with the faculty and be able to approach them for research opportunities. I am a little hesitant about how small some of them may be. As a student at a high school of around 2100 students, some schools that are &gt;1,500 I am worried about how small the campus may feel. Can anyone give insight in that?

I am interested in going to a college with a strong campus feel. I want to know I am in a campus, and not just a place that just feels like it is a part of the city (If you know Portland OR I despise the look of Portland State for this reason). I am fine with being in a city as long as there is a distinct campus feel. Having said that, I feel cautious about being someplace far from a city. Having lived 30 minutes from Portland I love having that easy access without being in the heart of it all, so that seems ideal for me. Being far from a city isn't a complete deal-breaker for me if there is still plenty going on around the campus and nearby town.

I also want to avoid any type of commuter vibe a college may have. Right now I think I want to stay on campus throughout all of my undergrad. This ties back into my desire for a strong campus feel. I am a liberal person, but not insanely liberal. A college does not have to liberal as long as it is not conservative, so middle ground places are just fine and I think I would be fine in a more left wing school as well. I am not that artsy but I do not mind artsy people.

I have never partied, drank, or tried drugs. So I don't want to be at a campus where a lot of leisure time relies on such activities. But I do think I want to try it in college so I do want it to exist on campus, just not be insanely prevalent.

I want to be either a psychology major or a Neuroscience major who is on a pre-med track. I know not every college has a neuroscience major and I think I would be perfectly content and happy with a psych major but I do view having a neuroscience major as a plus. Also, I have been studying Japanese for 5 years and I would like to continue that as well. But I do understand that Japanese programs are not nearly as common on the east coast so this is definitely not a deal breaker. I do want to study abroad sometime, preferably in Japan.

Because I want to go to pre-med, research and volunteer opportunities are a must. For this reason, I was originally looking into larger universities. But into my research with LAC it seems as if the approachability of professors for research opportunities and LOR make for a good environment for a pre-med

I come from a very poor background. My family has consistently been below the poverty line. I was even homeless for a period of my freshman year of high school. I don't want to go to an overly preppy-snooty college that has a really strong upper-class presence. I am afraid that my inability to pay for activities, concerts, events and just eating out may ostracize me. Similarly, I would like to have a lot of opportunities to have fun on campus without being a burden on my thin wallet.

Financial aid is an absolute must. I have $0 saved for college. My EFC is 0 so any school that meets full need I can attend. Schools that give really nice Merit Aid I can attend. I think my father will be denied Parent-Plus and I doubt I would be able to co-sign anything with him because of his bad credit. So I can take out $9,500 a year max if the school is not full need. I can do $1,500-$4,000 a year in work study and $4,000 a year in the summer before college if that is a requirement. When I run the Net price calculator for most top LAC it is affordable.

I really want to go out of state. I like Portland, but it is already my city, I want to experience someone else's city/town/state. I have been looking really closely at California. I am very interested in the Claremont colleges like Pomona, Claremont McKenna and Pitzer for reaches. I also think a school like Occidental may be a good match school. I am by no means tied down to California though. I really love what I have heard and researched about schools like Bowdoin, Amherst or Carleton, but I am afraid those schools are too much of a reach.

If you could help me pick schools that you think would be a good fit that would be amazing, Thank you!

Holly Crap this got long, my apologies."

This past year as a Junior, I must have sent out almost 70/80+ applications and I only had two companies contact me about a possible interview. I had my resume looked over several times and personalize my cover letters. I leave out my GPA as well. 

I saw a post on this sub about ""how attractive"" cs 225 is to employers, yet despite having take that class a long time ago, in addition to a whole range of more advanced classes, I seem to have a ~2/80 -&gt; 2.5% chance of a given company ever contacting me after applying.

Background: I wanted to pursue a PhD in chemical engineering during college. During my last summer in college, I found a startup in the industry and worked as an intern until I graduated. After graduation, I was offered full-time employment, and over the past year, I've seen the company become increasingly prominent in the industry. Although the company is in the same field, I am not doing work I intended to do. In other words, I am doing more client-facing work than research. All in all, the job has been great.

During my upcoming annual review, I will be offered a raise/bonus and be given a chance to tell my CEO what role I want to be in. However, I am planning to leave for school to pursue my PhD and would start next fall (2017). (I am still in the admissions process). Should I tell my CEO? I know that it's in a year and that my plans may not work out, so I should keep it on the down low for now. However, the job has been very good to me. The work, although not exactly what I dreamed of doing, has been rewarding as it was related to my passion. Also, the people have been amazing to me. As a recent graduate, everyone has given me guidance and has been flexible with me. 

Other than the fact that the people have been great, I may have to go to interviews in the coming weeks. In that case, I will have to come clean and tell them my plans. (Don't know how that'll turn out as well). If I don't reveal my plans now, it may come off as shady. So, should I tell or not? 

I feel like I should tell them because of my positive experience and that I will have to tell soon anyways if I am granted interviews. However, I may be naive here. I also need to consider the fact that if I don't get interviews and gain admittance, it's pointless anyways.

On another note, any tips for my annual review?

Thanks!"

I graduate with my degree in CS in 3 semesters. I like that my job is mentally stimulating. I like my team. I would also consider myself a decent programmer and often help my classmates. So why am I contemplating a career change?

On my spare time I volunteer at the animal shelter, go to adoption events, etc. Also, I have a slight interest in science, but I am going to take more science courses next semester to test my interest or dedication to science. Do you see where this is going? I have been obsessing over being a veterinarian. No I don't fantasize about being a doctor or anything. I am in it for the animals, giving back and a physical job. A lot of veterinarians have told me that loving animals is not a good reason, an ignorant response and that the classes are hard and vet school is hard. I find science courses easy compared to my computer science courses and I use to be a tutor in math and programming. I also have a 3.9 GPA. I am not by any means bragging, but it can get annoying to always hear people say how hard it is all the time. And sometimes i wonder if every STEM major thinks their major is the hardest. Anyways, as a volunteer i don't like driving long distances, picking up poop, staying late, etc. but i like to do it for the animals. I know a love for animals isn't enough, but i think when there's something you care deeply about behind what you are doing makes a big difference.

I've read that veterinarians are not in demand, plus I would have to take an additional 4 years of school granted i get in. I would also get a starting salary of about 50k probably. As a developer who would graduate next year, I would make more with no more school. But i can't seem to move past being a veterinarian. It would be a physical, mentally stimulating job, that would allow me to give back and learn about and work with animals and their owners.

I've decided i want to find a position as a veterinary assistant or technician to make a better decision. That would mean leaving my nice paying, competitive co-op. Should i leave my co-op to see if this is for me? Am i being crazy? The obsession has really died down and I am at a more rational state, but it just wont pass.

The other part is that I need help. Today was a low, low day. I included some questions at the end but would appreciate additional advice, encouragement. Sorry for all the text. This is the first time I've talked about this.

BACKGROUND (relevant details but you can probably skip this)
K-5th: I was homeschooled until middle school. Not sure if this contributed. But I was never in traditional settings where someone would notice symptoms. Homework took forever and I couldn't keep still in chairs, lines, etc. I was a high achiever and loved math. Excelled in academic competitions with other students, homeschooled and traditional.

Middle school: I went to a private Christian school. Homework started taking noticeably longer. Our academic standard was much higher than the public standards. I excelled in math, was highly competitive, etc. I was a very stressed out kid though. I was a perfectionist and would cry when I got stuck on a test. Homework definitely took me longer than the other kids. I thought I was working harder for better grades. I didn't start most projects until the deadline. I struggled to fit in. But I graduated top of my class and very involved in extracurriculars. I've since read about girls tending to overachieve in response to ADHD. This is a time when I also started seeing a therapist for anxiety, mostly over obsessive irrational fears. I was dealing with migraines and insomnia too.

I applied to get into a highly competitive college prep HS. I was told I was wait listed. I found out later that I had been accepted and offered a scholarship. My parents thought it best to let the opportunity pass as they had been worried about some of the bullying I endured at the private school due to racial and socioeconomic differences.

High-school: I started at a public high school. I had too much anxiety to go school by the second week. I could hardly complete weeks of school. Days were interrupted with panic attacks and hours spent in the nurse's office begging my mom to pick me up. About a month in and faced with the option of dropping out as a freshman, my mom took my to a psychiatrist. I later found out that I was diagnosed with agoraphobia, general anxiety, and depression. With meds, I started school again. They wanted me to start math where kids my age were: Algebra. I stopped caring about my homework because I knew it all, and nearly failed the course. But I managed a B by the end of the year. I took one AP English class and pushed as far as I was allowed with Math and science and really excelled in my math classes. I still worked twice as hard as my peers for what felt like the same grades. Didn't join honor society as I thought I wasn't good enough, but I left high school with a 3.8. 


COLLEGE PT 1
I went to an engineering school with nearly full scholarships. It was becoming harder to keep up with my peers and I was extraordinarily ashamed of my skill level and how hard I had to work, but I made honor roll. The second semester, I was raped by an upper classman in my dept. I had already taken on too much that semester (thanks compulsive overcompensation) and everything started to fall apart. I failed and dropped some courses classes and lost my scholarships.

I took a math and humanities class in my home town to try to get my scholarships back and aced both of them. (My scholarship appeal was denied because the admin didn't believe I had been raped since I just went to the nurse and didn't file a police report). Then my grandmother and a close friend killed themselves.

I believed hard work and persistence were all I needed. When I started taking classes at my school again, I couldn't do simple things anymore. I enjoyed math my entire life but I couldn't study and couldn't bring myself to do the work. I picked up a job in IT, but my class attendance dropped. I would spend hours staring at a screen, too anxious to attempt my homework. I would stay up late, convincing myself I was getting work done and then end up combatting the anxiety by indulging in my distractions. In retrospect, I was dealing with some PTSD symptoms as well as a lot of denial. After two more years, on and off academic probation, I left.

Then there was getting diagnosed. I had no concrete plan aside from fixing myself. I took on three jobs and found a therapist. I suggested that ADHD might be a culprit. I was open to meds but mostly wanted solutions I could put into practice. Because I was not diagnosed as a child and did well in grade school, she refused to believe it. I hadn't failed enough for her to think it was more than anxiety. My theory was that I had used anxiety as a way to manage it as the ADHD symptoms worsened with anxiety treatments. Hers was that I was trying to score ""meth"" (her words). She forwarded me to an in house psychiatrist who put me on a trial of wellbutrin. It worked briefly, but the next appointment I could get with her was six months out. The therapist continued to disregard my symptoms and emphasized how serious an ADHD diagnosis was but would tossed around suggestions that I was bipolar or borderline (no other mental health professional has ever suggested these to me before or since (She also suggested I just try to being friendly on the bus after being constantly harassed and nearly attacked (I don't see her anymore)))


COLLEGE PT 2
I enrolled in business at a nearby university and looked into getting diagnosed there. It was $300 for an evaluation. I kicked ass anyways and because I was bored or a masochist, went back to STEM full time while working 30 hours/week. Things got harder again. I dropped a class, worked less, got accommodations for test anxiety, kept a good GPA, and had a great internship the following summer. The internship served as a confidence builder and a nice break from school.

This last year I was constantly readjusting my schedule and dropped some classes. After a lot of searching, I found a psychiatrist and was prescribed a series of trial drugs. I can't explain how validating it was to have someone believe me. The trial runs and the end of a two and a half year relationship made for a rocky semester, but I made it out with a good GPA and got another offer to continue my internship. 


SUMMER 2016
In order to progress any further in my track, I opted to take a math class at a college close to my internship. I got permission and was told I could make up hours if needed. I had housing plans lined up since last year. A month before my internship, they fell through. I found a listing and was given a date to move in, after my start date. I'm fortunate enough to have family I could stay with and commute. Then they kept pushing back the move in date, sometimes at the last minute. I was couch surfing and camping and essentially living out of my car for the first month. I started school and was surprised to find that there was an online component. Someone broke my laptop last semester and my spare was on it's last leg. Some nights the homework didn't get in because I was sleeping in my car (something I should have explained to the professor but I still see it as an excuse). My plan B housing fell through entirely. Housing was picked clean and I couldn't afford any of the options. I moved back in with family and took on a daily two hour commute. Which is a huge amount of time to lose with a full time job and a summer class. The internet was unreliable but it was better than nothing.

The busy work on the online portion bored me and frustrated me. If a problem took me an hour to do and I got it wrong, I'd have to do it all over again. My sleep suffered. My school performance was on and off. I failed two of the tests and aced the middle one. I limited my homework time at work to lunch breaks, but it weighed on me and my job performance suffered. I submitted most of my homework late and left the final certain I failed. But I got a B! 

But then there's my internship. Now that class is over, I focus better. But I hardly accomplished anything because I was so afraid to ask questions. A stupid question is better than spending two days doing something stupid, but it's something I struggled with immensely. The project leader seems frustrated with me and won't look me in the eye anymore. I requested a different project initially as I was given the option as the one I ended up being put on was uninteresting and unrelated to my area of interest. It happens. Life's not fair. Usually our end dates are flexible but I pushed to stay an extra week to get more done and was told that they couldn't afford to keep me. Compared to the other interns, no one seems invested in my project or my progress. This could very well be because I didn't ask enough questions.


MY ANGST
Bottom line, my self esteem is wrecked most of the time. My highs make me forget how bad I feel running on no sleep and entrenched in anxiety over the fear of failing a class. As someone who was in an abusive relationship, sometimes school feels like a similar cycle.. After five years, I feel like it's too late to give up. But I'm tired of this. I feel like a fraud and a failure. I'm so bitter at my lost scholarships. I'm frustrated that no one helped me for so long. I'm tired of this pattern of crash and burn and rebirth. I'm jealous of my peers who thought I was overreacting when I mentioned I had nowhere to live. I'm so angry at my situation but I feel like I'm not taking personal responsibility for it. I should be taking better care of myself but I don't know where to let up. My closest friend is my coworker because work and class and homework is all I have time for. I want to cry and I want someone to tell me it will be okay and I can get through it. This is all I've wanted. Walking away the first time was devastating and I don't know if I can do it again. I'd like to think I could get a masters and/or make it in the professional world, but I've become so unsteady since college.

This semester, I will have to take out private and unsubsidized loans. I'm terrified I won't graduate and won't pay it off but I feel like I'm burning out and killing myself by working and taking 18 credit hours. My mom wants me to quit. I can't imagine what I would do after this. I have no money saved up anymore. But I also have a tendency to grind my heels in and I don't know when to quit.


MY QUESTIONS 
Is it worth it to take out the loans? 
Is it worth it to keep heading down this path? What should I change if I do? 
How do I get over that fear of asking questions?
How do I stop feeling devastated over every grade? 
How do I seperate my self esteem from all this? 
If I have to let go of this dream, what's next?
Has anyone experienced a worsening of symptoms after trauma?
I've been told ""fake it til you become it"" so many times. But what if that doesn't apply to me?
How do I juggle more than one thing at a time? (I keep planners obsessively but can't follow through)
Is it possible I'm just plain dumb?
Should I tell my current mentor the real reasons why I'm struggling?

I know it's pretty early to be talking about next summer, but I figure he earlier I start looking the less opportunities I will miss. 

In your experience, what should I be looking for in a CS internship? What types of benefits or pay, or jobs, etc. 

What types of companies should I be looking into? Would it make a huge difference to try to get into a larger more well known company rather than a smaller one that isn't known? I live in Utah, and I know there is a pretty big tech area growing in Utah valley. Would it make much of a difference to try to stay in Utah or go somewhere else?

Also, where should I be looking? Are there any good websites I should be utilizing, or any other methods you have found useful?

Now to the way over my head part... There are other interns here who are working on extremely awesome projects. Stuff that I wouldn't dream of being able to do.. At least at this time of my life. These guys know so much. Today only I heard them talk about how they are incorporating Unix, SQL, PHP, Java, Python, Apex, Apache Tomcat in their different projects.

How do I become like them? I felt so discouraged! All I know is Java (which I haven't used in about a month), data structures (a bit rusty on some of them), and minimal SQL. 

I'm 20 years old. One of these interns is in high-school and his project is awesome. The other 2 are doing their masters and their project is awesome x10.

I really enjoy programming, and I definitely enjoy learning new things. On top of that I pick things up relatively quickly. 

My problem starts with the fact that I don't have much project experience besides the assignments I received from my classes (mostly due to time constraints). My current portfolio is made up of console applications (C++, C#, Java), some simple games made with Unity3D (C#) and a few personal projects that I started and never finished (for learning purposes). My Database integration experience is lacking, and I'm not entirely sure where to start on that front. 

I live with my parents, and they've pretty much financed my entire college career, so luckily I don't have much school debt. Ive been working part time construction for about four years to help pay for school as well as to have some pocket money. I was offered to work construction full time while I search for programming work, which is what I'm doing now.

I have had two internships while in school, one of which is completely unrelated to anything comp sci. The other was at a startup advertising agency as a web developer intern. I really enjoyed the environment, but one of the biggest problems was that I had no oversight and they gave me nothing to do. Literally nothing. What made it worse was that I basically knew nothing about web dev going in. The person that gave me the opportunity said that the company usually hires their interns (sales and marketing) after graduation, but that they've never had a web developer intern before. I assumed this meant I'd basically be trained for a position. I stayed there for around 10 months expecting some form of training or some kind of project. I got to know some of my co-workers pretty well and they kept hinting at a position (no fault on them that I didn't receive an offer, though. They were just being optimistic.) In hindsight, I should have left when I first realized there wasn't going to be much for me to do. I ended up teaching myself some web fundamentals (JavaScript, html, CSS, Bootstrap, wordpress, etc) and playing around with NodeJS and some JavaScript frameworks. No actual projects came of these things but I ended up teaching myself a good amount while I was there. There wasn't any structure to what I was learning, and I definitely didnt learn enough. Asking for things to do yielded no results as well (before anyone asks), as they would just say ""just learn as much as you can."" If I had the opportunity to go back, I would just look for something else. 

Although my resume/portfolio wouldn't technically be lacking, I don't feel prepared enough to call myself a software engineer. I don't know if I'm just being too critical, but I don't think I know enough to have someone pay me for this type of work. If someone can nudge me in the right direction, help improve my development confidence, or just explain to my what I should be doing to improve my knowledge, I would greatly appreciate it. 

In case anyone asks, I haven't applied to anything yet. I know some of you might suggest that I put myself out there anyway, but I wanted to have something substantial to show before I throw myself into the wild, or at least ask some experts what they think of my current situation.

Thanks for reading!

I am also currently studying for my CompTIA A+ certification, then I plan to get the rest of the trio afterwards. I'm not sure where I plan to go afterwards, but I am open to suggestions from more experienced people. I am very interested in networking and sysadmin type roles. Thanks!"

GPA obviously matters big time for grad school, further schooling, etc. Likewise, it matters for industry jobs as well, but up to a certain point. 

So, I'm wondering if there exists a sort of GPA threshold after which your GPA doesn't *really* matter. Example: After, say, a 3.5 or 3.7 (or whatever), if you don't get a job, it wasn't because of your GPA. Of course, a 4.0 is ""better"" than a 3.8, but is there a point after which it comes down **solely** **to** **your** **experience**? 

A couple of notes: I'm talking about internships and entry level jobs after graduation. ALSO, I'm thinking specifically of business-related jobs, but other industries and sectors are fine as well. 

And please, I'd appreciate if CS students could avoid coming in and talking about how they got jobs with 1.8's. Thank you  :)

During summer, I work as a part-time L3 Sysadmin/Intern at a medium sized ISP company. I basically get assigned tasks or tickets to do that currently nobody has time for. 

It was a quieter day than usual and nobody at L3 had any tickets or assignments for me, so they sent me to L2 to see if they need any help. On the way to L2, I noticed that the L1 interns were doing something with full boxes of Portugal routers that the company bought for extremely cheap. I overheard one of them complaining that they can't get the thing working, so I decided to take a little peek at what they were doing, seeing as I had nothing to do anyway. After asking them what they were supposed to do, they told me that they are supposed to flash new english firmware and upload new configs to them, but they couldn't get past the login screen for a hour now. I took over one of the work laptops and saw a Mikrotik's RouterOS web login. It wasn't accepting the default username and password, so I opened Winbox and tried to connect to the router via a MAC address, thinking that the web interface might be just buggy. While looking at the MAC address, I realized that they're the cheap portugal routers the company bought. 

Then it hit me like a brick.

I immediately checked if the laptop is not connected to the company wifi, and of course, it was. The interns were trying to log into the company's wifi router. 
But wait, there's more!
After disconnecting from the wifi, I was getting no connection to the router. I checked the router if everything is plugged in correctly, and of course, they managed to plug in the patch cable to the WAN slot instead of the 4 LANs, while also forgetting to flip the switch to turn on the router. After waiting for a few minutes, I was still getting no connection. Turns out that they took a patch cable from the recycling bin that was on the ground instead of grabbing one that worked from the plastic boxes on top of the cupboards. After showing them how to flash the routers properly and how to upload the configs, I went to the L1 supervisor that told them what happened. They laughed and since I had nothing to do, I got assigned to watch over the inters so that they don't blow up anything for the rest of the day. 

At the end of the day, we ended up with a full box of reflashed and properly configured routers and around 30 routers that refused to flash (they hard-rebooted when uploading new firmware through either TFTP or web interface) that ended up in a box for RMA.

I interviewed with an investment firm a couple months back and made it to the final round of interviews. Unfortunately, they could only hire 1/5 individuals and I didn't get the position. This was the second time I applied to the company. First time I didn't make it past the screening interview. Messed up. Second time, made it to the final round.

I talked to one of the interviewers at the company and he informed me that everyone at the company loved me. My energy, enthusiasm, perceived dedication and work ethic. He said I had a good resume and cover letter and not to get down on myself. I lost out to someone with 3+ years of experience.

I've kept in contact with him over the last couple of months. Exchanged an email here and there just expressing what I'm doing to better myself, and how much I still think I'd be a great fit for the firm.

My question: can I outright ask him what he thinks I should do to give myself a better shot in the future if they have an opening? I know that staying in contact with him shows some drive and just outright determination that a lot of other candidates might not have shown. I'm hoping this can hep make up for my lack of work experience in the industry. I know it's best to be pro-active and figure it out on my own but I'm at my wits end.

I've tried applying for unpaid internships as well but there aren't a ton of them out there in the field and if you are out of province it's really hard to get them.

Can I ask this question or is it inappropriate?

Edit: He told me to stay in tough after the rejection and he said he would be happy to help out by giving me advice or anything. If I sent him a well crafted email asking this question, would that be inappropriate? At this point, I have nothing to lose but I don't want to come across as a pest or someone who doesn't know when to get the hint. "

I was downvoted/laughed out of r/LSD trying to warn others but I am also a frequenter of this subreddit so I think it may gain more traction here. I don’t know how to make sense of any of this. I’m going to try and do my best. 


I just moved to Washington DC earlier this summer for a pretty cushy paid internship with a NGO and I had been really looking forward to it. I manage the social media accounts and that’s about it. It’s actually kind of hard to believe I get paid for this. 


Anyway, I consider myself to be a psychonaut. For those who don’t know what that means, it’s someone who explores their mind and the world around them in altered states of consciousness. I am particularly fond of LSD. Because I moved to a new area, I was on the prowl for a new hookup. I hadn’t really reached out to anyone at work for obvious reasons, and I was having a tough time making friends. I went for a drink after work one evening to a bar on M Street. I sat down at the bar a seat away from this couple who were in their mid 20s. Handsome. Dressed a little more bohemian than the typical DC resident. Being that I was alone, I was eavesdropping on their conversation. Much to my surprise, they were talking about LSD. Speaking of micrograms and a step-uncle who synthesized it himself. I decided that this would be my best chance of scoring so I slid over to the closest barstool and they both stopped talking and looked at me.


“Hey guys, I know eavesdropping is rude but it sounded to me like y’all were talking about acid.”


The boyfriend eyed me suspiciously as one might expect


“Um… yea maybe.”


“Well… I uh know that you don’t know me, but I just moved here and I have been searching all over with no luck. I don’t know what your situation is but I would be super appreciative if I could buy some from you.”


He said nothing. His girlfriend was grabbing his arm. I could feel the awkward tension between us, fervently bouncing in the space between our barstools.  


With a nervous chuckle I said “Look, I know this is weird. I should’ve probably started by introducing myself. I’m u/ThankYouDude. I’ve just really been looking for a hookup and I’m pretty desperate at this point.”


“Well, nice to meet you u/ThankYouDude. I’m River and this is Sunshine.”


Although my face didn’t change, on the inside I rolled my eyes. You can never buy LSD from a normal fucking person, can you? 


Well nice to meet y’all. So whatta ya say? I’ve got $40 on me. Do you have any?”


“Yea man I can do 4 for $40.”


A wave of relief washed over me. Finally. 


“They’re gel tabs so they’re pretty strong.”


“That’s fine by me. How do you wanna do this?”


River motioned to the bathroom over his shoulder “In there.”


I followed him there and we exchanged goods and walked out. Quick and easy. I said thank you and tipped the bartender and I left. As I walked down the street I did a little two step dance and smiled. That was much easier than I thought it would be. I got back to my apartment and I was eager to try it. I had never done gel tabs before. As I walked up the stairs of my complex I took them out of my pocket and unfolded the tin foil. They were very small translucent grey tabs, and they had sparking silver flecks in them. Interesting. This looked like some high grade shit. I arrived at my place and quickly entered and sat on my couch in the living room. 


I should preface this by saying that I have tripped at least 20+ times so I was very comfortable with taking two of the gel tabs. I dropped them underneath my tongue, started a timer on my phone, and got up to go put a record on. I chose my new Tame Impala vinyl and then plopped down on the couch again. A few minutes went by. Then a few more. Then the record scratched as it reached the end of side A. I stood up to go flip it and I instantly felt light as a cloud. 


“Strange” I muttered to myself as I checked the timer on my phone. Only 12 minutes had passed and the onset of the drug had already begun. 


I flipped the record and turned to go sit down again. I froze. My couch. It... it wasn’t my couch. I mean yes it was my couch but I seemed to be experiencing some kind of IKEA dysphoria. I looked around the room and the feeling began to intensify. It felt like a slow methodical wave was making its way around the room, making everything I owned unfamiliar and strange.


“This is some crazy shit.” I thought to myself and sat on the couch once again. I looked up and… my TV. It was different. Not like the other things. It had physically changed. It appeared to be about 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide. If you’re thinking about a door, you’re spot on. It looked like a goddamn door. This is when things started getting really weird. I had never felt this way. I was beginning to think something was wrong. I went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. I looked in the mirror. I was wearing a fucking spacesuit. I looked down and it was just my slacks and a button down and loosened tie. Back to the mirror, a fucking spacesuit. Swear to God. This is when the visuals began kicking in.


 I went out on my deck to smoke a cig and relax so I could take control of this trip. I lit one and took a nice long drag and exhaled. I brought it up to my lips to take another puff, and it was done. It was smoked right down to the butt. 


What in the fuck… I couldn’t believe my eyes. I dropped the butt and grabbed for my phone in my pocket. I checked the timer. 45 Minutes. I was stunned. I had just gone to the bathroom and then out for a cigarette. How could I have possibly been 45 minutes into this already? I felt like I was starting to lose my grip on reality. I moved my hand to find my pocket to put my phone back but there was no pocket. I looked down and saw white. I was in a white jumpsuit. A fucking spacesuit. 


“This is not happening…” I muttered under my breath. I opened the door and went back inside. I immediately felt a pull to my new door sized television. I stood in front of it and I swear I could feel myself quite literally being pulled into it. What happened next abandons all logic and reason. I was sucked into my TV before I even knew I was in it. There was no up down right or left. I was practically blinded by neon geometric patterns and nondescript shapes. Imagine that scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yea. That trippy. My vision started to fade and then I must have passed out, although I don’t remember it. 


I woke up on my couch. I was naked. My phone sat unlocked on the coffee table in front of me. I sat up, and realized I was very sober. My timer read 50 minutes. My mouth hung open. How was any of this possible? It was the strangest thing that had ever happened to me. Then I tried to stand up. I was stuck to the floor. I looked at my feet and screamed. I had no feet. My ankles stopped at the stained wood. I started to cry. I don’t know what this was but it was not acid. I heard footsteps in my room and the hair stood up on the back of my neck. Out walked a black guy in full surgeon’s scrubs. He kind of looked like Gus from Breaking Bad. 


“H-hey man what the fuck is going on here. Who the fuck are you and why are you in my apartment”


He said nothing. He pulled out a syringe with a needle about as long as a middle finger and started drawing liquid from a bottle. I will never forget it. The liquid was viscous and black. It was sloshing around violently. He sat right next to me and pulled out an alcohol swab. He wiped a spot on my arm and then tucked it in his pocket. 


I was on the verge of tears again. “Please tell me what the fuck is going on. Please…”


He grabbed my arm and my lizard brain took over. I started flailing wildly. Then I felt a shock spread through me and I couldn’t move my arms. I looked down… and my hands… my fucking hands. “Oh Jesus Fucking Christ.” My hands were apart of the couch now. I couldn’t get away. He stuck the needle deep in my arm and I started to scream. I could hear a high pitched scream matching mine. I looked down. It was the black shit in the syringe. It was like it was mimicking me. He started pushing it into my body and it was cold. Freezing cold. I couldn’t do anything but sob. He pulled the needle out and that’s when I blacked out again.


 I woke up on my couch with my clothes on from the previous night. The sun was shining through my window. Everything was normal again. I just sat there and took deep breaths. Everything that happened had seemed so nightmarish and disturbing that I figured I just took the tabs and fell asleep somehow and had an acid-fueled nightmare. Then I looked at my arm there was a shiny silver Band-Aid where he had stuck the needle. My heart dropped into my stomach. I pulled the Band-Aid off and there was a small hole in my arm. I ran my fingers over it and the skin was stiff, as if there was a small ball just underneath the surface. I squeezed it. Black goo oozed out. I couldn’t control myself and I vomited all over the couch and the floor. I flushed the two leftover tabs. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any friends. I can’t tell my parents about this. They will think I’ve lost it. So I’m telling Reddit. I’m warning Reddit. Please for the love of God, don’t take the gel tabs with silver flecks floating in it. Don’t eat the alien acid.

My issue is, I can't figure out how to create said lists where, if you accidentally choose a second answer, or the wrong second answer, it's possible to erase that second answer. Right now when I select a second (or third, or fourth, etc.) answer, I'm not able to delete it to go back to just having the single answer.  

So...

if the drop-down list options are ""a, b, c, and d,"" and I first choose ""a,"" I currently have it set up so that I can then click back on the list, and choose another option so that I now have ""a, b"" in the cell (or a, d or a, c, etc). I can't delete ""b"" then, though, so I'm stuck with ""a, b"" in that cell. 

If I'm going to sell this to my coworkers as something they can use as a data tracking tool, it's got to be very user-friendly. Is there any way to get this to happen in a way that wouldn't require multiple steps and would just be as simple as deleting that second answer?

4w8jtq,3,2016-08-04,Getting a job is like winning the high jump,Prime_1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4w8jtq/getting_a_job_is_like_winning_the_high_jump/,"Lately there have been several threads asking questions or complaining about interviews, and with the Olympics starting maybe now is a good time to bring up this analogy.  Personally I think it is useful to try and get a sense of how the interview process works and why you see certain things happen.

In many ways interviewing is like entering a high jump competition.  Like the real sport the bar moves based on what the competitors are able to do.  However unlike the sport applicants never really know at what level that bar currently is at, and it can in fact move both up and down before the final job offer is made.  

The bar is first placed at some level determined by the company (the job requirements).  These requirements may or may not make sense for the job, but that doesn't really matter so much as it is only the starting position.  If all the applicants fall below the bar it will be lowered to a new level (always possible that a company will not lower it and will instead cancel the search, but that is rare so lets ignore that case for now).  If some applicants are above the bar it will be raised to that new level. 

The first key point is that when applying for a job you are ultimately compared against your competitors, not against the initial position of the bar.  This is why new hires can potentially get a junior job asking for 3 years experience, and also why someone with 5 years experience might get turned down for a job also asking for 3 years.  The second point is that there is no point getting bent out of shape if the requirements don't seem to make sense (e.g. 10+ years using Swift) because in the end you will be compared to other people who also don't have that, so it doesn't really affect much.

Next, just like the sport those who fall below the current level of the bar do not advance (i.e. don't get called for an interview) and those who are above get an invite.  One could argue that with resume parsing software doing keyword searches candidates that could potentially set the bar really high might get filtured prematurely.  While this is indeed true I would counter that by saying if you are just blindly submitting your resume that way then you aren't setting the bar very high at this stage.  There is a reason that people say networking and internships are important, and this is one reason why.  Those who can get around filters and get their resume into the hands of the right people are setting the bar higher.

In any event, once applicants begin to be interviewed the bar moves to a new level based on their performances. ""Performance"" here means what abilities and assets they can *show*, not just what they actually have.  Like a real high jumper it isn't how high they have jumped in the past, it is how high you show you can jump at that moment that matters.  As time goes on each applicant is compared to the performances of the other competitors who have set the bar at a given level.  If they exceed the bar it moves up to a new height, and if they are unable to reach the current level of the bar they are eliminated.

Obviously the bar continues to move (or not) as each applicant is interviewed.  Because of this it is possible to do well in an interview and even raise the bar to a new level, but still miss out on the job if someone else comes in and raises the bar even higher.  So simply giving correct answers is not enough.  You have to do better overall than all the other competitors so they can't get over the bar.  You can also see that someone can get a job offer even if they didn't interview particularly well as long as they set the bar the highest.

Like the real high jump all you can do is train as best you can so that you can perform well in the competition.  So when you read on this sub that a CS degree, internships, good resume, personality, and experience are important you can view it as what can you do to raise the bar so others can't exceed it.  You try and add all these things to give you the best chance of winning.  Some people will get jobs without a degree and others have trouble even with one.  In the end it comes down to who else is competing for that specific job at that specific time, and what the final level of the bar is, not what it was at the beginning.

Unfortunately you will likely never know at what level the bar is really at.  This can lead to a lot of frustration because you might think you did well throughout the process but still didn't get the job.  But in the end just understand that the bar ended up being higher that you were able to meet this time.  If you are consistently failing at some stage then that is an indication that you don't have something you need to push the bar where it needs to be.

On the bright side it can mean you did very well and set the bar high, so don't jump to the conclusion that you are terrible just because you didn't happen to get the job.  Another positive thing to remember is that every competition is very different, with different competitors who will set the bar at different levels.  This means that just because you didn't exceed the top level in the past does not mean you won't in the future.

Anyway, I hope that made sense.  Based on your own experiences do you think the above analogy is a good one?  "

However, I still feel like I'm missing a lot of the more complex, real world concepts that are taught in a CS curriculum.

My older sister is 28. She is all I have. We live in South India.

Our parents died when I was 9 in a car crash. My sister was 20 at the time. She fought very hard to retain the family assets (some relatives tried to cheat us off some stuff) and she was already doing an articleship (internship in a Charted Accountancy course) and we were, fortunately, financially well off. Then came the hard part of raising me. I was quite horrible to her, not understanding how much she sacrificed to raise me. When I was 14, I ran away from home once because I failed Hindi in a class test. Sis searched for me everywhere, found me and then a heated discussion happened where I said some mean things to her. (I really was a stupid fool back then).

But as time passed, I understood how much she has done for me and loves me. I know this sounds bad, but she is more like a mom than a sister. And I really will give up anything for my sister.

Everything was going great, and then this guy comes out of nowhere. He is a good guy, good job etc, and he begins calling my sister a lot. It didn't bother me much because I never thought they would get together, my sister never had the time or interest for a boyfriend, her life had always been around me. This went around for almost a year and a half.

I wrote my CPT exam a couple of months back (step one to becoming an accountant) and after that is when  my sister told me that they were in an official relationship. I was so shocked that I couldn't say anything. But I later said I am happy for them etc.

I'm happy that my sister is happy, but I can't help feel jealous? Angry? I don't know. I don't want him to take my sister away from me. I have met the guy and he is a nice person, even drove me to classes a bunch of times when my sister wasn't available. He sometimes watches football with me and we like debating and stuff. Overall, he is a good guy. I guess what I am trying to say is that I do not have a problem with their relationship per se, but I have a fear of it's impact on my relationship with my sister.

Yesterday night he asked me how I would feel if he married my sister and if he could bring up the topic of marriage in a couple of months.

Honestly, it made me sick to my stomach and I made the retarded move of asking him where would I go, then. He kinda laughed (not a humiliating way) and told me that ofcourse I would live with them till I am older.

Okay that's one problem solved, but what about later? Will my sister grow apart from me? What happens when the kids come?

I do not want my sister to miss out on life because of me, I am going to tell him to go ahead and ask her to marry him, but I really need to tell her that I am afraid, but how do I do this without making her feel guilty or something?

(Also is this normal?)

More info:
Apart from this, I do have a lot of friends, I'm very close to a few, and they all have told me that they got my back no matter what happens. I know that, but I can't live without my sister and nothing can replace that relationship. I do not have a girlfriend, I've never thought about it and have no interest.

TL;DR Orphaned kids, my sister raised me, was practically my mom, now a (great) guy wants to marry her. I know she is happy but im scared if I will lose her.

Tried posting to relationships, but idk why it wouldnt go."

I have a high 2:1 in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from a university just inside the top 50 in the UK. I've had no internships and the only work experience I've acquired was from volunteering with charities a few years ago. 

In the past few months I've been drawn towards pursuing a computer science-related career path and I've done a bunch of reading on the topic. The consensus seems to be that having a non-CS related degree isn't an impediment to working outside of the larger tech companies, as long as you have the technical know-how and experience (contributions to open source projects, your own side projects, etc.). So I'm currently enrolled in the CS50x Harvard course offered on edx as an entry point into all of this, and I'm looking at developing my skills on the side in whatever way I can.

What I'm wondering is whether I should continue on this path of working as an autodidact and hoping I can land a decent job at the end of it, or whether enrolling on an MSc conversion course would be valuable in addition to the informal learning?

Things like the [high unemployment rate among CS grads](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/16/computer-science-graduates-unemployment-bme) makes me hesitant to pursue an MSc, plus there's the opportunity cost of not earning a salary from a full-time job (and Lord knows that that opportunity cost is already incredibly high). But I've also read that it can be helpful to have some accreditation.

I've tried to mask a lot of the existential crisis that's currently going on, but it's really affecting me so, even if there isn't any career advice, even a message of support would be lovely. I'm honestly scared for the future.

Anyway, thanks"

Currently, I'm a junior in college going for a CS degree. I took all of 2015 off to do some internships, and came back to school January of this year. Around August of last year, when I was in the middle of a 6 month internship, I got hired for a web development job at a small web solutions company to start in December. My boss offered me a signing bonus to start while I was completing my 6-month internship, but I declined. Ever since December, I have been working part-time while I'm in school, and full-time when I'm not at this small company. Last spring break, I had the opportunity to visit one of the top employers in my area for a day. I originally wasn't going to apply until next year (when I would be graduating), but then I decided if I wanted to better my chances of getting hired there full-time out of college, I should participate in their co-op program, so I applied for a co-op earlier this summer. I went through their interview process and got/accepted an offer. I have several months until I actually start.

Now, since my current boss was willing to have me work part-time remotely while working full-time at another place, I wanted to ask if they would be willing to do that while I'm doing this co-op. I have co-workers who telecommute 100% of the time, and I can work from home whenever I want to. To be honest, there's no real reason for me to even come into the office.

So, I would just like some advice on how to approach my boss on this issue. I would like to do it ASAP to be fair to my current company and give them ample time to find a replacement if they don't agree to this.

Thanks in advance for your help."

I'm interning for a start up right now (have about  two weeks left) and I'm having some questions about the work load they have for the interns. 

Since starting a few months ago,  I have designed the entire site architecture (a first for me) and created all of the company databases.  Another intern has handled ALL of the front end (we do work well together to make sure our front and back ends mesh) I've also moved everything to AWS because our previous host kept having issues.  

Now,  they want a proprietary algorithm that will allow them to search and match profiles, which will essentially be the lifeblood of the site.  Is this normal?  I've had a previous internship that kept me busy with scripts to help efficiency (AWS lambdas, etc) but that all seemed straightforward, this new one seems like exploitation a bit. I don't mind doing work,  but something about this feels odd. Is it just me?

I suppose it is still too early to really have my mind settled on the exact kind of work I want to do going forward but I know that I want to be on the cutting edge. I don't want to be some code monkey working on *gasp* payment solutions... Currently my bent is toward Machine Learning (because it alligns with my mission of making computers do cool things) and so far my exploration of the subject (I'm taking Andrew Ng's course on Coursera) has stimulated my interest even further. 

Still, regardless of the field I end up in, I want to go places. I want to make interesting things. I'll read of some of the ai projects companies like MS and Google are pursuing and I think... ""I want that"".

***Where am I***

As mentioned, I'm a ""rising sophmore"" (kinda). I've only been programming for a year (I began around july 2015) but I've only seriously pursued programming and CS in general since the beginning of this calendar year (which is when I actually made the jump from Econ to Comp Sci). 

Since making the jump though I've been keen to supplement class learning with my own stuff. I've been hammering away at a networked Black Jack game, progressing (slowly) through K+R C and have recently started to do that there machine learning course.

As for my school (if it's relevent), It's a fairly reputable school in Canada, Queen's to be exact, but it's known more for its other programmes with Computing being a sort of a black sheep. I don't know how much this will hurt me once I graduate and I worry because I have friends in the programme who seemed to be rather good and they struggled to find jobs this year.

...

So where does this leave us?

I suppose I want general advice but I also have a couple of questions if people are willing to give answers:

1) Would most companies look at a second year Comp-Sci student for a summer internship? (I only really have one summer because I'm doing the whole programme in about three years (counting this past school year)
a) If so, what can I do to maximise my chances of landing this type of internship?

2) Will it be more beneficial for me to contribute in smaller ways to established open source projects, or is it best if I continue mostly doing what I have been which is overseeing my own projects throughout the development cycle. 
a) Obviously, both is good but time is limited so if I had to pick one which should it be?

3) How can one get to know their profs better. Heck, even if it does nothing for me in a career sense, some of them seem cool people who do cool things... but I'm a bit awkward? Is there anything one can do except going to their office hours ALL THE TIME?

4) More generally, what should I be doing to ensure that I have every chance to meet my lofty ambitions... I'm not looking for some magic pill, some cheat code that gets one in the door at Microsoft. No, I know that the majority of it is working HARD in ones classes and then supplementing that with work on side projects and other sorts of learning. Still, it seems like it is best to work in an intelligent manner toward my goals and I think where I may need help is not in the actual work but more how to communicate my skill to those around me.

Thanks, and DFTBA."

So I currently am employed part-time with the networking/tech support department at the university I attend; if I were to work for them full time next summer, could that be something I put on my resume in place of an internship? The work is probably pretty similar in terms of it's hands-on experience, as I would be working on our summer projects such as changing access points in buildings, servicing our servers, etc. and it would just be a lot easier to work there than it would be to find an internship. In case anyone is curious, my hometown area where I stay for the summer is Minneapolis, Minnesota. Thank you for your responses!"

The money is better than I was expecting for my area and experience (none). The only thing is that the job is a few hours away from where I (my parents) live and in an area I've never really been before. 

So I don't know if it's just the reality of the task in front of me now (moving, buying a car, etc) or what, but since getting off the phone I have this...depressed feeling?  Maybe it's just coming off the adrenaline high? Or maybe it's the thought that, if they are paying me this much starting off, what exactly are they expecting? 

I can't help but feel like they must think I'm really good or something, but I'm not. At all. And that's not *just* imposter syndrome - I've never built any personal projects or had any internships. My grades were good but I often felt like my professors ""let me through"" some tougher classes, like algorithms.

Bah, anyways, enough whining. I guess I was just wondering if it is normal to not be jumping for joy after receiving an offer? I would expect to be happy, but instead I'm sitting here wallowing in self-doubt and feeling kinda sick. Everyone I know is offering congrats and I feel like a moron for not feeling as great as they all do."

What I want to do before applying to jobs is to do several projects in the same stack so I gain depth of knowledge in at least one area. For any major project I would need front- and back-end technologies so, what I'm looking for is suggestions on full web stacks that are popular and have a lot of entry level positions. 

I've looked at MEAN (and used it and liked it) but, most of those seem to want extra experience (I could be wrong about that). I've also looked at RoR but I'm not sure if is a great choice given the growth of single page applications (I know this isn't an entire stack). "

**General Comments and Questions:**

1) I've tried to show that while I don't have any traditional ""hooks"", my passion lies in computer science and tech, as well as bringing that knowledge to others through teaching, workshops, etc., and that's really what I'm trying to highlight to admissions.

2) I dropped Varsity Fencing after freshman year to focus on other interests in CS/tech as well as Boy Scouts. Is it still worth including in my application? If so, where/how can I explain that I had valid reasons for dropping it?

3) How much is the 730 on SAT Critical Reading really going to hurt me?

4) Any other tips?"

It was not that easy. I ended up spending more money that I thougth in the beginning, so in the end I was not only far from everyone I love and learning that would be way harder than I thought as also I couldn't put my PC together and distract myself gaming, or have some multiplayer with friends, these were dark days.

It took time, weeks looing at the boxes with my parts and unable to use it, after I started working and my paycheck arrived I could finally be back. I still miss everyone but having my PC back made me feel a lot better.

Oh of course, pictures, [the build in all it's glory again](http://imgur.com/a/84yHa), the gamepad I originally bought for some android gaming (n64/DS/SNES emulating) until I could get the parts (yeah, they only had that one, I hope it doesn't break without any reason, RT already have an annoying noise).

At least I upgraded the power supply, originally it was a CX430.

Now next month I get the headset/headphone, since the one I had [broke in the most wtf way possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4rwbw6/first_a_dead_row_in_a_keyboard_then_an_annoying/), any sugestions about that? are all headsets really terrible? I know, getting headphone + mic would be better, but it doesn't sound that simple and unexpensive

I learned a few things:

&gt;Consider getting an notebook when travelling

&gt;Bring way more money than you think it will be necessary when travelling

I'm a 21 year old 3rd year college student about to be a senior who should probably a sophomore/fresh 3rd year in regards to how far I am in my course curriculum, which is biochemistry. My parents pay for my school, my housing, food, everything. I don't have a job right now because my dad wants me to focus on school , and then eventually have me go to pharmacy school. Sounds good right? Parents paying for my whole school? A lot of students would love that. But the thing is, I have a strained relationship with my dad to say the least.
My father is a good guy. He’s worked hard for this life in his own small business and he's got a wife, and 2 kids, me and my older sister, who's actually starting pharmacy school at a good program. But in highschool, I wasn't a straight A student. I was just an A/B student. I got into a decent university that's actually one of the cheapest schools for a good education in the state. The thing is, my dad is a good guy, but he's quite rude and mean in some ways. Like he was always on my sister's back while she was a senior in highschool. She was pretty unhappy in that time because of the pressure of getting into the school he wanted her to get into.

Back to me though, in my first 2 years of college, I struggled with calculus classes, and ended retaking one of them. As I continued on with my college career, I ended up getting C's or B's in my chemistry courses and haven't done any internships or research (which is seriously recommended in the biochemistry study, almost a necessity to go to grad school or getting a job) since my dad wanted me to focus exclusively on school and not be concerned with money or anything else. However I'm not happy with my grades and neither is he. We've had bad fights/arguments over the past few years, and it's come to a point where I'm tired of it. I never want to call him because I know I'll have to tell him that I'm failing him and wasting his money because I'm not doing as well as I want in school. A lot of people will say, ""study/work harder for it if you really want it"", and you guys are right. But I’m constantly stressing about how I’m behind in my courses/ how my dad is going to react/ I’m wasting money / what will my peers and professors and family think of me? It’s gotten to the point where I’m uncertain of my path and I’m just afraid to go on further, waste more money and time because of my low performance in school.
I have to retake O-chem again because I want to increase my grade for that class, which means more money down the drain. I told my dad this and he obviously didn’t react to well to it. We had the big fight, I told him that I wasn’t sure about pharmacy school, yeah it’s good money but I’m already not doing that well in undergrad so how is pharmacy school going to be any better. My dad’s a reasonable guy, but he wasn’t having any of it. He actually told me drop out of my current school and go to city college/ community college to retake some classes and get my GPA up. Turns out that you can’t do that with my university, you just have to retake classes at that university. So I end up going to a summer class where again I’m not doing the best in.

I just had a talk with my dad today, and I told him I want to stop school for a bit. I don’t even know what I should do anymore school/career wise, but the stress of my dad reminding me that he’s paying for my school, not being sure if I’m going to do well in my field or even graduate, and struggling in my studies in general is really getting to me. I’m not giving up, I’m trying to study, I go to class, meet with my professor and classmates about homework/lab questions, but anytime I talk to my dad I get extremely down on myself and have a hard time studying with that on my mind. I just feel so directionless and lost.

I’m thinking about going financially independent from my parents. Yeah a lot of you will say that it’s a bad idea/ can’t get financial aid under age of 24/ no job/ haven’t completed school. But this has been going on for over 3 years. I’ve reasoned with my dad and we just don’t see eye to eye. We’ve talked multiple times, and he just says I don’t listen to him, if I listened to him, everything would be better. Well I want this to be the last time I don’t listen to him. I don’t want to have to listen him anymore and disappoint him even more, or waste more money from him. I feel like I owe my father a debt that I can never repay, which is probably what I should feel like to my university to be frank. I feel like a lot of people will say, “communicate with your parents” or “your sister made to pharmacy school, you can too” or “suck it up, that’s life”. I’ve tried. I’m sorry to my parents and to all the people that I know, but I’m mentally too stressed out to continue on like this. 

Now I have to get back to studying to finish my class, and then start looking for a job/ plan out my future. Any advice/input would be much appreciated. 

Sorry for the wall of text.

4wdptj,5,2016-08-05,How to begin my career after a year long depression,johnsmith181,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4wdptj/how_to_begin_my_career_after_a_year_long/,"For backstory, I graduated university July 2015 with First Class Honours in Computer Science. I was really good at software development and had my eyes ultimately set on a software developer job come graduation.

Unfortunately I do not have internship experience, which makes my situation even worse because I have zero industry experience. 

Fortunately I do have good grades and several personal and group projects, including an extensive software system (comprising three major software components: a web app, mobile app, and server app) which actually garnered significant attention from industry representatives during a demonstration fair.

Ever since graduation I fell into what my psychiatrist calls a ""major depressive episode"" which left me at the lowest point of my life. It has continued for an entire year now. At this point, I am extremely fearful that my aspired career will never come to fruition due to my circumstances. It's been difficult because I have not been up to doing the work I used to enjoy, it used to be my hobby, but it gave me some of the best joy when I was 'normal' and I want that back. I hope to begin to rekindle that.

I understand that at the very least I must begin to build a *recent* portfolio of projects. Also, I have Cracking the Coding Interview to help with interview preparation.

So what do you think would be the best way for someone in my position to begin to prepare and pursue a career in software development?"
4weqah,2745,2016-08-06,TIFU by pulling the covers off my wife,wolfbayte,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4weqah/tifu_by_pulling_the_covers_off_my_wife/,"It was January 2008. I remember like it was yesterday. And before you get too excited, this is not a sexy post. It's also rather long, so If you don't want to read the entire story, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

We had a big day of football ahead of us, because all our rowdy friends were coming over.  A bunch of us from work had been hosting round robins throughout the season. Now it was our turn: the NFC and AFC Playoffs.  Playoffs? Are you kidding me? Don't talk about playoffs! Playoffs? I just hope we can win a game.

Because of the big games, we had to prepare a feast of feasts.  Because the next day was MLK day, we could stay up later than usual. We didn't just plan on watching football; we were going to turn that mother out.

We did not want to get up Sunday morning.  But we had to. I remained in bed looking at my wife waiting for her to get up first. She stared back waiting for me to get up first. I saw through the window that my neighbor was removing a tree. He had purchased an RV on Saturday and needed to remove a fruit tree to use the RV parking. With all the commotion, I knew it was time to get up, but we didn't want to leave the warmth of the down comforter to face and clean the frigid abode beyond the wall.  The only way to get either of us to budge was if the comforter budgedfirst.  I pulled a little off her, she turned to me.  I pulled a little more and she gave me the stink eye. I pulled the rest and let it slide off the bed onto the floor.  ""Fine,"" she said, as she reluctantly reached for her slippers.

We cooked, cleaned, and put beer on ice, then got ourselves showered and put on our game faces.  The games, food, and beer were a hit and the couchgate spilled over into the hot tub.  I didn't mind, because many of her friends were hot.

All good things, they say, come to an end, and so did the party. We were ready for bed.  The down comforter was still on the floor. So the wife grabbed a corner and pulled it up onto the bed. Once the blanket was all on the bed, she noticed a used dryer sheet stuck to it with a leaf on it. We may not make the bed in the morning, but we sure in Hell don't sleep with trash on it.

Wife pulled the leaf off the dryer sheet and immediately felt a sharp stinging sensation. She flung the leaf away, towards my side of the bed mind you, as she screamed. I rushed in and saw her panicking, jumping around, looking around, and waiving her hand. She tried to explain what happened and I figured she picked up a sticker from a sticker bush or something. I told her to get a bag of ice for her owie and I'd look for the sticker so I didn't step on it.

I walked around and didn't see anything. I leaned down and stuck my head under my bed found myself staring directly into the eye of my own mortality just inches from my nose. I froze but didn't take my eyes off it. I wasn't going to be up all night trying to hunt down should I escape. ""Get the vacuum!"" I yelled. ""What is it?"" she asked. ""Just get the vacuum."" ""What is it?"" ""Vacuum please!"" ""What is it?"" ""Please, get the vacuum and I'll show you?"" ""Oh my god, what is it?"" ""Fuck, get the fucking vacuum now?""  She runs out and drags out the vacuum from the nearby coat closet. ""Plug it in!"" She plugs it in. I'm still staring at the nightmare fuel as she hands me the nozzle. I nod, and she turns it on. I suck it up. ""Got it, turn it off!""  She's white with fear, writhing in pain, and holding ice on her right thumb. ""It's getting numb,"" she warned. ""Your finger?"" She grimaces, ""No my whole hand."" ""Shit!"" ""What is it?,"" she asked again? ""Get the tweezers and I'll show you."" I also have one of those little plastic bug carriers we have for the kids.  I opened the vacuum canister and she stepped back in fear. I grabbed the culprit with the tweezers and dropped it in the carrier.   I snapped the lid shut and fired up the laptop. ""A scorpion?"" she asked. ""Yes.""  A scorpion.

It was an inch-long bark scorpion. She called her friend, whose husband was a bug guy. He said their venom is not harmful to healthy adults.  The internet said otherwise. Also, they hide by folding themselves to look like leaves.  Also, my wife is night blind and needs glasses.  By now her arm was numb up to her elbow. The ice wasn't slowing the toxins. The blood vessels in the thumb carried the toxin up her arm. She was in shock, she was hyperventilating, and she thought she was going to die. She didn't believe me she would be fine. There was no choice. I had to take her to the ER. I brought our new friend along just in case.

I was shocked at the short wait at the hospital. The doctor said that the toxin in her wasn't life threatening, but he would give her some steroids for the pain and swelling. By now it was halfway towards her shoulder.  The doctor left the room to get something.

He returned with an entourage of doctors, nurses, interns, and I think the janitor, to look at the scorpion. ""Is that a prescription pad in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?"" Nope, it was a black light. He closed the door, turned off the light and shined the purple light on my wife's would-be assassin. It glowed green like that Wacky Wallwaker I got in my Lucky Charms two decades earlier. The doctor was as giddy as a kid in a pet shop. ""I'd heard of this, but never seen one in person,"" he snickered.  I hadn't realized he'd been waiting his whole life for my wife to get stung by a scorpion so her husband could bring it in for him to see it.  Glad I could help him cross that one off his bucket list.

After show and tell was over, we left the hospital, filled the Rx, and went home. And no the scorpion didn't go home with us. Instead, I let him go on the hospital sidewalk where he was poisoned by his enemies.  Wife went right to bed and I explained to the kids what happened. Fuckers laughed, but kids will be kids, I guess.

She spent the next day in bed as I vacuumed the entire house and called a bug guy. Bug guy came and checked around the house and yard. He told me I didn't have a scorpion problem, because I had no bugs for the scorpions to eat.  It was just a fluke. I had him spray the house anyway and put granules in the back yard to repel ants and scorpions. He suggested the scorpion came from the neighbor's yard when its home was literally uprooted. I guess one man's RV is another man's ER visit.

Wife missed a week of work. Each day her numbness subsided a little bit.  Whole thing, with lost wages, ER ,Rx, and Bug guy cost me over a grand.  All because I pulled the blanket off of her and onto the floor that morning.

We never leave the blanket on the floor anymore. To this day she is deathly afraid of dryer sheets, which makes for some interesting pranks if I'm ready to sleep on the couch. 

TL;DL Pulled the blanket off my wife and onto the floor to get my wife out of bed one morning. A scorpion crawled on it, stung my wife that night, and she missed a week of work with a numb arm.

The title pretty much sums up my concerns. Some info about me:
  
* I finished my BA in Math/CS and Economics in January
  
* Graduated from a state school that has a reputation for the performing/fine arts and small CS/Econ departments (I didn't know what I wanted going into college :/ )
  
* 3.0 GPA: I wasn't the best student, but I was asked to be a teacher's assistant for a few semesters in CS1 and a lower level Econ course
* I have good recommendations from professors, my thesis advisor, and my previous employer
  
* No internship
  
* I was fortunate to find part time work during school, which enabled me to graduate without debt and have some money saved. This may have hurt more than helped though because it's allowed me to live semi-stagnantly with my parents
  
* In the past couple months I've found ambition and applied to a few dozen of help-desk/desktop support positions in the NYC Metropolitan area. After some bumps in the road, I interviewed well for a few of them
  
  
I didn't expect to get a job instantly after actually beginning my search, but its been a couple months and I thought I'd have one by now. I think I need to reevaluate a few things. In the process of writing and thinking more about this, I may have discovered the answers to my original questions (mainly the first one), but I would greatly appreciate the community's input.
  
  
First, I've been applying almost exclusively to help-desk/desktop support positions in the process of my job search. I think this may have been greatly affecting my success because I haven't really considered other kinds of positions.

  

Second, I've been under the assumption that my long-term career goal is a Linux sys-admin position because I enjoy using Linux, learning its inner-workings, and shell scripting. My reasoning seems kind of silly and unrealistic now that I've read more about that kind of position. One of my long term goals is to learn more about *nix systems, but I probably shouldn't base my career goal off it. Are there decent paying jobs that entail working mostly with *nix systems? If so, what search terms should I be using?

Finally, how badly has my mediocre educational background (as described above) hurt my search, and how will it affect me as I begin applying for other types of positions?

  
  
EDIT: sorry, one more question. What kind of careers are available that would utilize both of my majors (Math/Comp Sci and Econ)?"
4wgnh0,47,2016-08-06,Finding housing in NYC- for interns,herebecats,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/4wgnh0/finding_housing_in_nyc_for_interns/,"So some people have asked how to go about finding housing in NYC. I've done a term there and learned a lot so I figured I'd share what I know.

First of all let it be known that finding housing in NYC is a mission and a half.
So if you want to avoid all the hassle and be sure you won't get scammed call up 92Y (Uni residence housing) and pay $1900/mo. 
Its a pretty decent place to live in terms of location and perks (even if its a little expensive).

Now if you really want to put in the effort of finding a place below are the expected min price for each part of NY. If you see a listing outside of these ranges chances are its a scam or a bait and switch (broker will say ""oh this one is taken but I have these 10 other properties you might be interested in"").

- Manhattan (below 100th st) -&gt; $1500/mo if you REALLY look but $1700 if you're in a rush
- Brooklyn  (close to the east river) -&gt; $1200 if you REALLY look but $1400 if you're in a rush
- Queens -&gt; $900 *but its really far from everything

In terms of safety vs geography if you REALLY want to stay in Manhattan (highly recommended for the first time since you will be within 30 mins of all the action and your commute will be short) just stay below 100th st and you will be fine (TBH all of Manhattan is fine if you aren't that picky). 
For Brooklyn the rule of thumb is to stay close to the river and near Manhattan. Absolutely avoid the south eastern half of Brooklyn.
As for Queens its all pretty safe.

Now on to the actual finding of housing. Before we get into details there are a few things you need to absolutely understand about NY housing. 

- The housing market is constantly on fire. An apartment can get snapped up within minutes of the posting going up (usually within hours or days though).

- You should make it clear to landlords that you will be on a paid internship and it will pay well enough for you to comfortably pay rent (most landlords aren't aware that interns can make as much as you will likely be making in NY and will try to charge you 4 months worth of rent deposit).

- You will likely need to give a 1 - 2 months worth of rent deposit (try to avoid giving 2 months).

- Brokers are everywhere (Brokers are people who hook up tennants with landlords often at exhorbitant prices).

- Landlords/ brokers will ask you for an application fee. They use this to run a credit check/ to make sure you are for real. An application fee over $50 is stretching it. Over $100 is an absolute ripoff (avoid them).

- If you want an apartment you will need to hand over the application fee + the deposit. Only then will the landlord take the apartment off the market. ABSOLUTELY do not hand the landlord cash for the deposit. Always use a bank check (not a cashiers check but an normal check).

- There are scammers everywhere. BE CAUTIOUS.

Alright now that you have some context here is the absolute optimal way to find affordable housing in NY.

Notes:

1. Do NOT commit to anything (and do not transfer any money to ANYONE) without having seen the property and spoken with the landlord
2. Avoid brokers unless their fee will be paid by the owner of the property
3. Deal directly with the landlord and try to go for landlord listings (ie. listings without a broker in the middle)
4. Use StreetEasy and Facebook groups to find landlords. AVOID craigstlist and padmapper. They're filled with scams and they're a waste of time (too many listings on a poorly made website).
5. Get receipts for ALL funds you transfer to ANYONE (this is essential).
6. The more roommates you have the better/cheaper (join up with other interns going to NYC from UW)

* Step 1: Book an AirBnb for a week starting a week before your start date (preferably starting on a Monday).
* Step 2: Fly out to NYC a week before your internship start date and stay at the AirBnb.
* Step 3: Start making appointments to see places a few days before flying out and continue to do so until you find your place.
* Step 4: Sign the lease and move in.

You should be able to find a place within a few days.

Some final things to note. 
In terms of subway stations downtown (south) Manhattan is packet with them. Midtown Manhattan doesn't have as many but still you're never more than a 5-10 min walk from a station. Upper East side and Upper West side subway stations are more sparse. 
Brooklyn has a alot less stations the frequency of which steadily decreases as you move east. Queens has even few stations.

The cheapest areas in Manhattan are Chinatown and Lower east side. 

Thats about all I have for now. I'll probably add more lated.

I did an online HackerRank challenge for a somewhat big company, which I expected it to be extremely hard and filtering because they take very little interns and I'm almost certain that hundreds of people applied. I honestly expected to have a better performance, but I couldn't even get past three of nine challenges without cheating.

It's kind of abstract and funny in a sad way. I expected to be really angry because I have been practicing for months now, getting ready for this challenge. Read Cracking the Coding Interview, read CLRS, did several challenges on CodeWars, HackerRank and LeetCode and even then I got utterly destroyed.

All it really does is make me wonder where I'm standing. I thought I was going to be capable enough, but seemingly I might not be. That's fine, I guess. There's no other way around. I'll just keep practicing and getting better, if my mood gets lighter than what it currently is.

Thank you all for the space to vent and for the continuos support towards every doubt we might have. I hope my experience is useful in some way, maybe for aspirants and people to see that failure and disappointment is real, but that it's not as big of a deal as it looks. Just keep being you. I know I'll try.

Best of luck to all of you in your careers!

For reference, I have been using mainly C++ through my schooling and internships. On my github I have done some exercises, like the ones listed in 7 languages in 7 weeks, using languages I am unfamiliar with. 


How would I go about finding jobs aligned with my interests? Is being a generalists not all its cracked up to be?

4whdju,2,2016-08-06,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major looking for Software Engineering advice.,J-Bobby,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4whdju/electrical_engineering_and_computer_science_major/,"Hello, I am a Sophomore student at a small college in South Dakota(SDSU).  I started college off by going for a biology major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln but decided that my interests were more on the math and engineering side.  I took a very simple programming class in my senior year of high school and my interest for coding started then.  With this new found knowledge that my interests were in math and that there was a large amount of jobs in computer science and SE (I didn't actually know that before going to UNL) I decided to switch schools and enroll myself in the computer science department at my current school.

I like working with computers a lot and not knowing how each piece of it works bugs me to death so I am also planning on spending an extra year to major in EE.  I have taken two computer science classes so far and I have loved them to death, I love being able to make small programs and I love showing them to my family(even though they usually don't take too much interest in them).  My dream job is to work for a big company such as IBM or Google but I am also kind of worried about a few things.

1) I have really enjoyed my first few EE classes but I am wondering if those are just wasting my time where I could be focusing on software.

2) I was wondering what are the next steps for me.  I am going to a small university that a lot of big companies probably don't know about so I am trying to find out how to set myself apart from other people from bigger universities, especially things I can do right now.

3) Lastly I was just wondering if there are some good internships I can look into that would help or if I don't have enough experience in CS yet what I class I would have to go through to learn them.

I would like to point out that my college has only a software engineering minor(and they only just added that) and I was wondering if that puts me at a disadvantage or not."

So I'm a first time poster and a longish time lurker. Been enjoying tfts for a year or two now. The best part of my internet day. Hope you enjoy my first tale.

I'm working at a computer. We do support, installations, homecalls and sell stuff. We're is a tight-nit group of very diverse personalities. The cast of this tale:

&gt; $HPI - honest, polite and not the brightest intern

&gt; $ASG - Awesome Sales Guy and kind of the boss.

&gt; $DNA - Yours truly

First off, we practice, or try to practice, OCD in everything we do. OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder and often mean that you check things more than once to be absolute sure. We don't all manage this every time to say the least. $ASG introduced this because he was tired of all the big and small errors we found after the customers arrived to collect their computers.

It was a pretty regular day, when $HPI comes over, looking pale and asks me if I'll join him in the other room. I'm his immediate boss and supervisor, so I'm the guy he would ask for most things.

&gt; $HPI: $DNA, please, please, don't be mad at me.

&gt; $DNA: *What the heck is going on here.*

&gt; $HPI: I messed up real bad.

&gt; $DNA: Care to show me? *How bad can it be?*

&gt; $HPI: I am so sorry. I can pay for it. Or you can take it from my salary.

&gt; $DNA: *OK, that bad.*

$HPI works at an interns salary, meaning it would be little left this month if he fucked up bad enough.

&gt; $DNA: No worries. Just show me and we'll figure something out.

He show me the laptop he's working on and tells me he was changing the HDD to an SSD. There are a lot of different screws and somehow the they got mixed up. He turns it over and voila.

&gt; $HPI: I managed to drill the longest screw through the computer. It's poking out on the top bezel.

On the palm rest of the laptop I see a screw poking out. I could not help to laugh. It's just too good. A little resistance? No problem. Use more force! My mind is screaming in all caps: **You drilled a hole in a brand new laptop!**.

&gt; $DNA: That's just... I'm... Heh. What. How. *What do I say to this?* No worries. Go talk to $ASG and let him figure it out.

$ASG is also the main hardware guy.

&gt; $HPI: Could you, please, PLEASE, join me when I talk to him? I'm honestly afraid of his reaction!

$ASG is unfortunately known for getting angry when people f+#k up. So we walk over together and do a little show and tell. To my surprise $ASG laughs as well when he realizes what has happened.

We ended up not taking the poor interns money, but he lost his power drill privileges. Yes, seriously. It's one of those power drills made for electronics and laptops, not the 24V **$Milkywayky*.

The laptop had the regular sticker on it with all the specs, and after assembling the laptop with all the screws in the right places, $ASG moved the sticker to cover the whole. To be fair, the hole was small and there was no real damage. You might be thinking we sold it to some unknowing bloke, but we're not that kind of shop. We really aren't. $ASG had a friend who bought it at a reasonable price, after we told him about the mishap.

**TL;DR:** Check, check and triplecheck.

4whruq,2,2016-08-06,ADHD and work,personposting,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4whruq/adhd_and_work/,"I just graduated college in May and am working full-time at a center for kids with autism. In college I was pretty lazy (or so it seemed - I wasn't diagnosed until very recently). I had very little interest in most of my classes and spent most of my free time getting high with my friends. At the time, the ideal life for me was working a job that allowed me to get by and continuing to prioritize friends and leisure time. I wanted to live in a cool place and ""live my life,"" as I often said. 

My job started out as an internship that I wasn't even crazy about. I had a loose plan to move to New York and do a service program there, but due to a number of factors I realized I wasn't ready to move far away yet. So I started working where I'd been interning because the alternative was possibly being jobless. 

At first it was really hard working in a high-stress environment. I was constantly making mistakes and forgetting little but super important things. I always felt like my coworkers were annoyed with me because they had to compensate for my errors. For a time I was really worried I was going to get fired because I felt like I wasn't ""on it"" enough to be a good therapist. 

When I started having suspicions about my deficits being pathological (I always have, but this was the first time it really concerned and impacted me), I decided to put more effort than my coworkers into my daily duties. I started making to-do lists for all of my sessions (I typically have 3-5 in a day) and another one that reminded me of what I needed to do before leaving at the end of the day. Even though it was a lot of extra hassle, these lists helped me stay on task and greatly reduced my (maybe irrational) anxiety about being fired. 

I've since been diagnosed and prescribed Strattera, which helps a bit but I may want to switch to something else eventually. I first noticed its effects all last week--I felt super clear-headed and a little more at ease socially. I was feeling really optimistic about it but then this week I sort of felt it drop off; I was forgetting things again and being really reserved. I've been a little sick and on my period so, I don't know, I guess those things could've affected the meds/my disposition. I'm just going to wait it out. 

OK, I haven't even touched on the reason I'm posting this. Since I started working my physical and mental energy is expended on very little aside from my job. Even though it's really difficult sometimes it's also probably the most rewarding thing I've done in my life thus far. The stressful nature of it keeps things interesting, and no two days look alike. Even though I spend 40 hours a week there, I still wake up every day excited to go and I keep myself up at night going over everything that happened that day. I've come to sort of dislike weekends because I find myself under stimulated even if I'm doing something fun or leisurely. Socializing also feels a bit like pulling teeth. That sounds horrible, right? I'm just so used to having and reaching little goals throughout the day and a day without any accomplishments feels wasted. It's like I've forgotten how to relax. Whereas in college all I wanted to do was hang out with my friends, now the idea of relaxation freaks me out and socializing feels like work. 

One facet of my job is being observed a few times a week working with clients, and while I've always experienced performance anxiety and tend to worry about forgetting something important during the observation, I love getting feedback. I've found I actually do really well during them and I love reading positive comments that highlight things I didn't even realize I was doing. Good grades have always been rewarding but they often felt undeserved because I procrastinated and didn't think the work I was turning in was good. I always preferred feedback on papers because I put more effort into my writing than other assignments and tests. Positive feedback feels like a drug. On particularly good observations I'll look over the evaluation 2 or 3 times just because of the utter joy it brings me. 

So, pretty much, my job takes up most of my life but I've chosen for it to be that way. Nothing else feels as stimulating and really I just want to put my energy into becoming a better therapist and also finding ways to improve my field and the lives of my clients. I'm worried that this intense involvement in my job will eventually lead to burnout. I feel like this is the way I approach things that are super rewarding--I have trouble balancing them with other areas of my life. It's as though I'm only able to zero in on one thing at a time and everything else feels really dull. Anyone else find this to be true? 

TL;DR: I love my job too much because it's stimulating and I have trouble enjoying other things because they are boring

I am working on a Scala project. This is the first proper software job that I am ever did in my life, so I ended up doing some really stupid stuff(I learnt that people don't talk about writing clean code and great designs just to be snobbish, most people actually care about this stuff and how you make your software matters just as much as what your software does and yadda yadda yadda..). I greatly annoyed, irritated and frustrated my mentor. He was yelling at me the whole time, it was embarrassing, demeaning and what not. His colleague is the person I am suppose to be working under and both the reviews he gave me were positive, dunno why. But I am not sure if I will get a full time offer from them. My mentor's another colleague and my mentor though want to conduct an interview for my intern team(there are 4 of us). The hr person tells me that it's for our own practice, but I am getting the feeling that the interview will decide whether or not I will get a return full time offer. Now because I have very little time to prepare, I am extremely confident that I will f*ck up the interview. So I don't see myself getting a return offer from the bank.

Now I could try to get a full time offer somewhere, but I feel like I can learn more as an intern then as a full time employee with responsibilities. People explain stuff to interns so well and so patiently. They just assume that I am an idiot. At first I found that very insulting, but lately I made peace with the fact that I am an idiot. There are shit ton of things I need to know and I already learnt so many during this internship, I bet I can learn even more if I do another internship. I could try to learn this stuff in my free time but as a master student and a TA I barely get any time. If I do get some free time I usually am in the mood to watch some movies/TV shows and relax or go to sleep. Internship would be a very nice convenient way of taking time out of my life, without effecting my visa status to learn stuff that are relevant to the industry. Also I am not sure if I can land a full time job as a masters student with very limited experience and shitty GPA who would need a H1B sponsorship in the future. I am not even sure I will get interview calls.

Now because of my visa status I cannot just arbitrarily postpone my graduation date. So I originally thought I will do a second masters in Stats. It would help me understand machine learning better. It will help me get better at maths and problem solving! Plus I get to flaunt two masters in my resume for whatever they are worth. I wanted to do a PhD too, but it looks like it will take shit ton of time so a second masters was a way to appease myself. Plus I could endeavor to get a better GPA in second masters to make up for my shitty GPA in CS. But the problem with this option was that my stats degree would become my primary degree and I am not sure if the stats department will approve my CPT application(thing I need to do an internship as a F1 student) to do an internship in a software company. Also, I audited a couple of courses in stats department and MY GOD they are insanely mathematical. Shit ton of calculus, probability, linear algebra and what not! It's being offered by the Maths department in my college. I am not confident enough to go down that road.

Second option would be to do a thesis, start off very late so I would need to stay another semester, giving me an additional summer. With this option, I can still do a PhD in the future after I repay my master's loan. Plus there is a chance that my thesis could be published(Could someone tell me if research papers help you advance in career in any way?). Plus I get undivided attention of a professor which is just like doing another internship imo!

Initially I was very interested in AI/CV/ML/Robotics/NLP fields, but I realized they are extremely math heavy. I am auditing few linear algebra &amp; probability courses so I am feeling more comfortable with maths now. These fields however don't feel like CS at all. You just type out some random scripts in a very high level scripting language like R or something. You don't deal with threads, you don't get to write any elaborate code to do something. But people say this is the future! I am not saying that I am not at all interested in this. This is interesting in a way :) I know a professor who is working on motion detection/pose detection and stuff like that. He is using deep learning to solve some of these problems and I find his work extremely fascinating. Not sure if he will take me up as a student and will be able to spend time on me.

Alternatively I could work with some systems professor. I do find stuff like OS, compilers, databases, networks very interesting. Of them all I only found a compilers professor's work interesting. The compilers professor finished his PhD only 5 years ago I guess, so he is sufficiently experienced and yet not too experienced that he cannot spend time explaining stuff to me. But then again, I am not sure if compilers will be as hot of a topic as deep learning or some AI stuff is in the coming 10 or 20 years. 

I also find computer graphics very interesting. We only have one professor in our college who deals with this stuff and he is a pretty cool guy, fresh PhD but has a lot of interesting projects. Graphics to me is like the perfect balance of maths and programming, I get to code up a lot of stuff in C++. The professor has a lot of industrial contacts too. But I heard people say that graphics is a very volatile and under paid field. Also, he kinda expects people to put in too much effort into his courses which kinda turns me off.

So essentially if I do thesis it would just boil down to AI vs Compilers vs Graphics.

**TL;DR** I am really very confused about what I should be doing at this moment in my life. Try to get a full time offer somewhere if the bank where I am interning doesn't extend an offer to me or extend my graduation by doing a second masters and doing an extra internship to gain additional experience(which I feel I very badly need) or do a thesis to extend my graduation. Also if I do a thesis, wondering if I should do a thesis in AI fields or compilers or graphics. I need to register for class soon, so I have to make this decision this weekend.

**Demographics:** White male from Georgia, average (that's being generous) public high school, senior in high school looking to apply in the fall


**Major:** Probably math, chemistry, or CS with a possible double major/ minor in a humanity


**Academics:**

* **ACT:** 35C (36E, 33M, 36R, 35S)

* **SAT:** Taking soon for national merit, will submit if it happens to be higher than my ACT score

* **SATII:** 750 Chem, 800 Math II

* **Class Rank:** 2 of about 300

* **GPA:** 4.0W, ~4.3UW

* **Course Work:** AP US Government (5), AP Bio (4), AP World (4), AP Comp Sci (5), AP Lang (4), AP Psych (5), AP Chem (5), AP Stats (5), AP European History (4), Various honors/ accelerated classes, AP Calc AB and BC, AP Lit, AP US History, AP Micro Econ, AP Physics, Dual Enrollment Linear Algebra


**Awards:**
4-H Statewide Project Achievement first place in Computer Science Category, 4-H Double Master Status, 4-H Statewide Food Product Development first place team, School HOBY ambassador, various school departmental awards, National Merit Scholar Commended (Hoping for semifinalist), schoolwide essay contest


**EC's:**

* Piano for 10 years

* Marching Band - 9th-12th (Alto Saxophone Leadership 11th Grade, Drum Major 12th Grade)

* 4-H - 9th-12th (On Food Product Development Team, County Wide Officer, County Wide Vice President 12th Grade Year)

* Math Team- 9th-12th

* HOBY - 10th-12th (Hugh O'brian Youth Leadership) (Youth Ambassador 2015, Junior Staff member 2016)

* University of Georgia Young Scholars Program - 11th (Paid Research Internship over the summer at UGA)

* Extended internship at UGA with proffesor

* ~350 accumulated service hours over the course of highschool



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So there are all my stats. For other very subjective things, I think I could get pretty good rec's and I am decent essay writer (despite my AP Lang score :/). I am vying for top schools. I would prefer a medium-large school with good racial diversity (this is the main reason I'm not looking at CalTech, too little diversity and too small of a school). More towards the liberal side of ideology if possible but that isn't an absolute must. A ""liberal arts"" education is ideal, because I'd like to spend college getting to know lots of different subjects and ideas, not just focusing on one specific area. I'm planning on majoring in a science/math field at the moment, but I would like to be at a school where I can change to a humanity like PoliSci or add on a humanity double major/minor if I realize that science majors aren't to me (so basically schools that don't ONLY focus on science or engineering). 



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In terms of location, it doesn't matter too much to me, but I would prefer a school that's not extremely far away from my family. I'd like a college with a fun student life where I can be comfortable going out and having fun one night and then studying and working hard the next. I'd like to apply early to a private school, however I am NOT interested in ED. SCEA is fine though, I just don't want to be bound to one school.



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am definitely applying early to two state schools, UGA and GA Tech, and would be content going to either one of them. Other than that I'm not really sure. I had a list but honestly I didn't like it and I based it too much off of prestige alone, so I'm starting fresh. I've looked a lot at both Harvard and MIT, and right now I think I'm going to apply SCEA to Harvard and regular to MIT. Of course these are both extreme reaches, so I'm looking for other schools that are more in the match area or lower reaches, and even other schools that are still extreme reaches but are good fits for me. 



Thanks so much for any help, and sorry for the huge wall of text.

When Doom released, I got excited. And after I got an internship, I could finally afford to build a PC for myself and get back to gaming after nearly 10-15 years of a dry streak. Hence the name The Redeemer.

I have overclocked the G3258 to 4.3GHz@1.2V. I know my choice of CPU may not sit well with many of you out there, but that's all I could afford right now, and on doing a lot of research, I believe that it should serve well for the short term. I will replace it with AMD Zen or an i5 depending on how Zen turns out.

I am including ALL the parts including cables, furniture and what not that I needed to get for my gaming setup, including the NY state taxes. I already had the keyboard, headset and thermal paste. Rest are all new except G3258 which I bought used off eBay.

I've been playing Hotline Miami and Undertale. I'm waiting for my RX 480 to arrive next week to test out other games I bought during summer sale!"

Right now, I feel like a lot of things in my life aren't going so well. But, last night was the straw that broke the camels back.

I commute 50 miles to get to work. I either have a smooth commute but can't find parking, or I find parking after being stuck in traffic for an extra hour. I love my job itself. But the commute is PAINFUL. Also, it's an entry-level position that makes minimum wage so I spend most of my paycheck on gas.

I got back in January from an internship at a VERY prestigious tourism firm. I moved from Calfornia to Florida and buses tables for almost six months. Even though I didn't like the work, I saw it to the end.

I wanted to stay on in a different role. But of course school's more important. So, I went back. 7 months, two jobs, and $110 in costuming fees ( that I shouldn't have owed, honestly) later, I finally find something that Im remotely qualified for on the website at the location near me. Wasn't what I wanted. But, I figured it would be better to settle and transfer later. 

I take the web interview, and 30 minutes of questions later. I get ****ing rejected. Are you kidding me? I passed the other two times I took it. I made so sacrifices for this company. I got recognized A LOT for good service and I got my language pin in French. Grrrrrr. Thanks for nothing.

TL;DR: Life is not so hot rn. Hate my commute. Tried to find a closer job and got rejected. Quite Sore.

This could be done over hangouts + google docs for coding. It would be a great way to keep each other accountable and have a study session where you can not only get better at coding questions but at explaining your thought process better during an interview!

To be clear, I am employed by a staffing agency for now but have worked at this company since January 2016 and expect to be hired on any day now. I was the newest member of my team by a month until June of this year when we got an intern. 

My boss has routinely given me jobs that are easier and/or domestic in nature. I am in a technician role and I am the second most educated on my team and have the most technical experience. I'm a good employee and have always received wonderful feedback. I have never asked for special consideration for being a woman and have no expectations of it at all. I am treated fairly by all other members of my team.  At first I was unsure if I was given these tasks because I was the new guy but after our male intern started I realized that is definitely not the case.

I'm asked to clean, vacuum, sweep, mop, gather food orders, take pictures, label things, organize, and take inventory. My team mates are not asked to do these things unless I am totally unavailable. I have been taken off projects I started or just never assigned any in favor of doing these tasks. Even in big, all hands on deck, projects I am asked to hang back and take pictures or make labels. My male team mates have noticed this behavior too and have pointed it out to me unprompted. 

To my understanding the woman who held my position before me had similar complaints and was relocated or fired after being vocal about it. I am completely capable of doing all the tasks involved in my job. There are mechanical aids to handle the heavy lifting parts of my job and the expectations are to have a lifting buddy for big stuff anyhow because it is expensive equipment. 

My boss was tasked with having one-on-one meetings with the team about 6-8 weeks ago after bullying another employee. In that meeting he told me I should never worry about that happening to me because I am a ""female"". He then went on to explain how he could never yell at a women and treats women differently, etc. etc. 

I guess where I am now is just unsure of what is happening is even illegal and if so what to do about it. This boss has some other issues and complaints about him have been swept under the rug before. Because of all of this combined I just want to put in my two weeks and move on but I also want to do the right thing and stand up for myself. 

Advice is appreciated. Thanks

Sort of feeling impostor syndrome. But I have a high GPA, scholarships, and an internship at the big 4 so I must be doing something right.  
  
What I want to do is make a list of the stuff I should know how to do, and practice it. I don't feel like I have deep knowledge in any particular area, more like the basics in a lot of topics, and I think I will be expected to know more than I do. For example, I can only do the basics in Git: status, add, remove, commit, branch, pull, push. I don't know how to merge, rebase, or any of the other fancy stuff. In C++ I have forgotten all the intermediate stuff from my courses and would have to read up on them if I had to use them or answer a question about them. I don't have too much experience with any particular IDE, so I don't know the shortcuts and my workflow isn't as streamlined as it could be. At my internship the code I'm writing isn't too challenging (in language features) so I feel that in that regard I am not advancing. I am however challenged in other areas like working in a team, designing software architecture, dealing with customer requirements, etc.
  
I see myself as a jack of all trades (too many) and I want to make sure I have deep enough knowledge in important things to satisfy interviewers and myself. Can someone point me to a list of subjects and specific subtopics that I should review and become great at, as a third year student? I want to be able to dive into something quickly without wasting time relearning things I should already know. I want to have a good workflow and spend more time writing and designing.

Lately, I've been on internship with an arch firm that uses Lumion, which I like very much despite its flaws, and I want to be able to continue using it.

I also now have a little bit of a higher budget for the PC, now around but not necessarily lower than $1400 US (it was $1200 before, overtime FTW).

Again, I'm a 3D visualization artist targeted toward themed entertainment and architectural visualization. I'm looking for balanced CPU / GPU performance (without any overclocking after the fact), reliability and future-proofing.

Here's what I have on PCPartPicker.

I have already purchased the GPU, it's the EVGA GTX 1070 SC variant, so that's set. I wish I could have waited longer for the price to go down more but, again, circumstances have changed and I need to get running with this PC in several weeks. That variant was recommended to me by supervisor and co-worker, who use EVGA cards in their built machines as well.

In regards to the processor, I'd like to stick with the base i7 6700 (instead of the K). If I were only gaming I'd go with a less expensive i5 but I'd really like eight threads to use when rendering with CPU renders such as V-Ray. The 6700 seems like it will be the best balance of price and performance for me.

I'd like to know what other stuff can be added / removed / changed in this new build. I have an install of Windows to use and the necessary peripherals. I also know that the 6700 comes with a cooler, I've added a second processor fan but it may be overkill.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks everyone!"

I have crippling social anxiety, and my resume is kind of empty - I was pretty new to CS when I entered in Fall 2015, so I didn't have projects/work experience. This prevented me from going to the career fairs in my freshman year, because I was too afraid of embarrassing myself (distinctly unimpressive resume). So I ended up without an internship for this past summer.

My only plus points are my GPA (3.98), and the fact that I will probably become a CA for a 200 level CS course in the upcoming semester.

I have tried to learn App dev/web dev before, the kind of stuff that seems to get my peers jobs, but I never make it to the end of any tutorial. I get stuck at parts and feel demotivated about finishing it, or start feeling like I'm simply not capable of it. 

On the other hand, I enjoy courses which involve more of theory and algorithms. I've looked at the research park job board but every job I see either needs a skill set I don't possess or isn't willing to hire international students. 

How bad is it to not have had an internship in my first summer?
What can I do to ensure I have one in my second one?

4wm4q9,0,2016-08-07,Looking to calm anxiety about my curriculum,HopefulPhDApplicant,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4wm4q9/looking_to_calm_anxiety_about_my_curriculum/,"I’ve been meaning to post this for a while but never got around to actually writing it up. It’s a bit lengthy because I have a lot to say and need some advice from people who might actually know a thing or two. In an effort to not make this a wall of text, I’m trying to cut it down as much as possible. Here goes:

I’m looking to change majors while entering my senior year. I’m at McGill university in “Physiology and Physics” but want to do more applied math classes. The school might allow me to make my own program but **I’m wondering if admissions from other schools care if I’m the only person to have graduated from my degree, despite having taken relevant courses**. I’m looking to create an “Joint Math and Physics” program that is non-honors, which doesn’t currently exist. I might only have one more elective to take so this will allow me to take some much needed compsci classes.

I’ve attached the courses that I’ve already taken in here: http://imgur.com/a/Cw4vG. As you can see, I don’t have much formal mathematics training (i.e. Analysis, Algebra) yet but I’m good with my applied courses. This brings me to question two: **I’m just wondering if it’s a huge problem to focus on taking grad courses that are more based on “continuous” mathematics (let’s say, numerical analysis, numerical PDEs, Optimization, Advanced Prob, etc) if I want to go into economics/finance or possibly computer science or even engineering for grad school or should I also try getting some discrete math courses in there**. I haven no idea what I want to go into and I believe taking these grad courses will help me realize whether or not certain fields are right for me or not (also maybe trying to get an internship next summer). The MachineLearning courses only require a solid understanding of probability, which I learned over the summer by going through the textbook. It’s currently the only field of compsci that I know that really interests me so I wouldn’t bother looking at anything else but that might change in a year’s time. Anyway, this is the curriculum I'm looking to have following the courses I've already taken http://imgur.com/a/DAfO6

Finally, **I’m wondering if school’s care that I took over 3 years to graduate (even though I’ve been taking more than a full course-load every semester)**. I have no idea if schools care. If they don’t care then I don’t care.

Some more info about me that might weigh in on whether or not I’m mildly competitive for top grad schools: cGPA is 3.87, mathGPA is 3.95 and phyiscsGPA is 3.875 (physiology is where things went a little sour). I have a summer of biomedical engineering research where I’m not super cozy with the prof and, currently, I’m some doing dynamical research in the physiology department (which is less math and more just matlab) but I plan on continuing during the year until I can get something meaningful from it. I’m also doing a bootstrapping-statistics project in the fall in the economics department (unfortunately no publications thus-far). LORs *should* be okay for the most part but there’s really nothing more I can do apart from getting even closer to profs from here-on out.

**Tl;dr 1) do schools care about me being the only person to graduate from my degree 2) which classes should I focus on for grad school? 3) does the length of the degree matter?**

I have severe anxiety issues so if I sound overly worried for no reason, that might explain why. Please PM/comment me if you have any input to provide in some capacity. I also apologize again if it’s a little incoherent. I would have liked to write more but was afraid that it would just get totally ignored (even though it already might).

Here's some more info about my background in case you've made it this far: http://imgur.com/a/yZs96"
4wm4tu,2,2016-08-07,Need advice on deciding between two jobs,haente,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/4wm4tu/need_advice_on_deciding_between_two_jobs/,"Hello! I'm currently a senior majoring in computer science. This year will be my last year so I'm trying to get as much experience in IT or web development as possible. 

Right now I'm working on campus as a ""Communication Systems Assistant."" I basically just set up phones for new employees. I've been here for almost a year and the issue I'm having with it is that it doesn't really pertain to my major. I think it will be much more difficult to find a decent job with no experience. The benefits include: **flexible hours (up to 25hr/week), decent pay ($11.25),  on campus, *and they let me do my homework when there's nothing else for me to do.*** That's a big one for me as this next semester's going to be pretty difficult (taking 5 upper-level classes).

I interviewed for an IT Support internship this past week and received a call saying they'd like to offer me a position. The cons include: **further away (current job is 2 miles away, this job would be 12-20 miles away), more commute time, more time doing homework at home, and it's only a 16-week internship.**  They mentioned I could continue interning there until I graduate, so that's not that big of a deal. The pros include: **slightly better pay and hours (12/hr up to 40hr/week), and it pertains to my degree.**

There are some other factors that I'm taking into consideration. One is that my car isn't the greatest. The benefit of being so close to my current job is that if my car were to ever break down, I could ride my bike or take an uber. The other is that I'll be starting a lease soon, and will need to pay roughly $450 a month until next August. I'm worried that after 16 weeks at the internship, they may decide not to hire me back on next semester, which would screw me on the lease. Another is that, given the distance, the .75 cents more an hour doesn't really make a difference in pay. I think the only real benefit of switching positions is experience. 

Thoughts and suggestions would be much appreciated!"

3 APs last year, 2 this year, with the rest of classes being honors 

for ECs, I have been fairly involved. 
Here's a list:

I've toured a good amount of schools and some of my favorites are SMU and Tulane. Merit aid is a huge factor for me, so any school where I would have a chance at getting a large scholarship is a huge plus. It's somewhat important that the school has D1 sports, as I am a huge football and basketball fan. Please feel free to ask more questions or throw out some suggestions, I really appreciate it!

4wmbdu,1,2016-08-07,Attempting to land a job in investment banking from a non target school,squid_the_kid,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4wmbdu/attempting_to_land_a_job_in_investment_banking/,"This summer I am interning in the controllers department at one of the top bulge bracket banks. After networking with alumni and professionals across the firm I have come to the conclusion that my educational background in accounting and finance as well as my career goals align with a job in investment banking. 

I am now going into my senior year looking for a full time job in investment banking and I have no idea how to even get an interview. Internal mobility did not work out for me as I wasn't even given the opportunity to prove myself in an in-person interview. I am at the top of my class at the state school I attend, but our finance program is not well established and the school is of very little help. I was able to secure my current internship on my own through my own personal initiative and I am more than determined to do the same this time around. Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about this?"
4wmuq7,3,2016-08-07,[software engineering] Need some tips on applying for entry level positions out of state,roharia,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/4wmuq7/software_engineering_need_some_tips_on_applying/,"Hello, I've been searching for a job for two months now out of college in May. I have a bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Multimedia Web Design and Development.

My focuses mainly lie in full stack web development, LAMP mainly. Things like PHP/JavaScript/HTML/CSS, I'm pretty good at all of it (or I think so anyway). Also done a little bit with Node/Mongo/Express.

For my summer internship I did a lot of .NET and Microsoft SQL stuff, and I see a lot of jobs with .NET.

I've created two seperate resumes for both of these things (web dev side and .NET and more of a general resume) to tailor myself more to the jobs I want.

I've applied for entry level, internships, and regular mid level stuff (just to try) and have had 3 interviews. 1 of the interviews just from the employers calling me out of a favor my dad asked of a friend. The recruiter gave me some advice on tailoring my resume for the job description, and he said my resume actually looked very good otherwise and that he was surprised that I could not find anything. They were looking for more senior level developers, nothing my pace.

My dads friend works at Chase/JP Morgan as a software developer and she officially referred me and submitted my resume to some of her friends at Chase. I haven't heard back yet, but it's been a week. 

I'm not being picky about jobs here. I am open to almost anything and have been applying as such. Pay is not a huge factor for me, I do not have loans and my parents are willing to help me relocate and support me until I can stand on my own feet. (Very thankful for this). I'm asking for pay like $40,000 in cities where the average pay even for an entry level is closer to $60,000 and adjusting per the average pay in those cities. So when I said earlier that I'm applying to the .NET and web developer jobs, I'm really applying to everything, but those are my two major focuses from my resume point of view.


I'm honestly just not sure why I'm having no luck. My roommate who studied the same thing as me is also having difficulties. We went to a decent university, nothing great, but not bad either (or at least I hope so).

Now, I am applying out of state primarily in San Francisco and San Jose. I understand that these are very competitive areas. These people want to be able to interview me in person. My uncle has a vacant house in the area which he has graciously allowed me to stay at if I get an interview at any places, or simply want to go to CA to look around. I figure this might be a waste of money if it doesn't work out. Instead, I've put his address on my resume when applying to any CA jobs. At very least I can use this as a gauge to see if actually being in the area will help me or not. If I get more hits or potential interviews, I am able to go out and interview if there is a reasonable chance of getting the job. My dad said if I really want to go out and search for jobs that way I can certainly do so. 

Also applying in NY. Washington, Colorado with no luck. I went to school in CT but do not wish to return to CT if I can help it.

Going to post my resume(s) here.

This is general resume I use for most jobs: http://imgur.com/a/kIHOz

This is the resume I use for more web based jobs: http://imgur.com/a/8HvxU


I'm looking for any input on any areas I could improve on, any places I could specifically look at. By the way, I did apply to some companies that my school is affiliated with, but most of them are in CT. Also, do you think I should actually make my way out to CA and stay there for a month or two? I understand that it is very competitive right now, and I should have probably applied for jobs well before I graduated. I ended up applying a couple weeks after I graduated which was just so late.

4wn8ka,25,2016-08-07,I can code in a few languages. But I want to become proficient in one and be confident about it.,spartan_noble6,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4wn8ka/i_can_code_in_a_few_languages_but_i_want_to/,"**Preface:** I ran this post by the mods

**Backstory:**

I will be a junior this fall majoring in CS. In preparation for applying for summer internships, I want to solve a load of problems like the UVa Online Judge or HackerRank. I want to focus on data structures, and solve enough problems to be able to confidently tell a recruiter that ""I'm 100% proficient in [this] language; here is my proof for it.""

This is how my college classes have gone so far:

Java was the first language I learnt.

I learnt data structure concepts in C++ by implementing every structure from scratch.

I learnt systems programming in C.

I recently started learning Python on my own time, but I dont have as much experience with this language. But its definitely a breeze.

So from learning C and C++, I'm very familiar with pointers, mem alloc, running times for most data structures.

**The Problem:**

I've never used the standard libraries to work with data structures, I've only used the structures I've had to implement from scratch. 

Can anyone tell me about the D.S libraries of the languages I listed? I want to know which language is the best to work with D.S. I want to pick one, code a lot in it and be able to say I'm 100% confident in this language.

Thank you

Edit:

Also, something I'm worried about: not being taken seriously when I say Python is my best language. Sounds dumb, but how dumb is it? Its a high level language, and people might think I dont fully understand programming the way you would from programming in C... :/ Sorry for piling on questions."
4wn8ox,1,2016-08-07,"Still don't know what I ""want to be when I grow up""...",MaximumIntroversion,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4wn8ox/still_dont_know_what_i_want_to_be_when_i_grow_up/,"So, I'm 27, quickly approaching 28, and I've been incredibly frustrated for several years, now, because I feel like my life is going nowhere, and I can't seem to figure out how to get a handle on it. Unfortunately, I've never really know ""what I want to be when I grow up"". Throughout high school, I considered myself a computer nerd, so I just assumed I'd end up doing something with that. 

After high school, I went into college and started with an IT-related major. For five years, I ended up bouncing between different IT majors, because I wasn't really feeling like any of them were the right fit for me. I also briefly tried majoring in business, but I hated it. By the end of year five, I was feeling like I needed a break from school. I then finally figured out something I felt like I could pursue; it occurred to me that I really like working with video production, specifically editing and post-production details, and that I wanted to learn and better my skills, and hopefully do something with it.

Having been burnt out from college, though, I didn't have the energy to pursuse another 3-4 years of schooling, and I ended up attending and graduating from a trade school program in media production. It's been two years since I graduated from that. Since then, I've been looking for and sending my resume off to any opportunity I can find, whether it be local or something that requires a move, whether it be a paying job or just an unpaid ""internship"" type thing just for experience. And I've made zero advancement towards this career. I've not even been able to get an interview with anyone, heck, I've not even been able to get any kind of communication with anyone aside from some generic ""Thank you for your interest, but we're looking at candidates with other skillsets"" rejection letters.

So, I've come to see that this venture of mine was nothing more than a failed pipe dream. Such is life, I suppose. The problem is, I don't know where I go from here. Since I was 18, I've just been working super low level retail and retail-ish positions, just to have some level of income, but I hate that, and I have no desire to advance up the ""retail"" path, into management and corporate work. It's just not for me.

I'm not opposed to returning to school, but I don't want to go back unless I have a plan in mind, because I don't want to waste another 5+ years bouncing between majors and aimlessly taking classes, and racking up debt for nothing. But I can't figure out what I want to do with myself. There's nothing that really strikes me, there's nothing I feel like I have an affinity for, there's nothing I can think of that I feel like I could reasonably do well and be successful at.

Over the last few months, I've been browsing over different majors at my local colleges, and I'm just not really finding something I want to pursue, nothing that stands out to me, nothing that interests me.

Now, don't misunderstand. I'm not naive, and I'm not looking for some magical ""dream job"", I'm not expecting to do something that will get me ""rich"", or whatever. I know that most people don't really ""love"" their job, and I get that. But I think that, for the most part, a lot of people will end up doing something that they feel makes sense for themselves, something that they're confident in their abilities to perform, something that they can be satisfied with saying they do. I'd be totally happy just to have that.

And yeah, I know that plenty of people have ""late starts"" in life, and may not hit their stride until their 30s, 40s, or even older. *Maybe* my situation might be better 10, 15, 20 years from now. Who knows? But what can I be doing now to have a more satisfactory life for myself in the short term? I feel like I'm wasting away, in a super menial job, making maybe 15k a year if I'm lucky, and I just feel stuck. More than that, I feel lost. I don't know what I CAN do that I haven't already done or been doing.

So... What do I do?"

I am a recent graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I graduated this past May with a 3.6 GPA and a minor in mathematics. I am now working for a company that designs and builds industrial robotics and automation equipment. Before that I had a part time internship as a systems engineer for a major international company.

I spent some time this past week reflecting on school and some of the things I wish I had known as a student that I now realize working in industry. I figured I might as well share some of my conclusions with people that might still benefit from it.

1. Academia and industry are two very different animals with very different priorities. In academia everyone cares about what you know, in industry people only care about what you can do.
 
 As a student every project, homework assignment, and lab required me to show detailed math working out the physics, signal processing, ect. I was required to include some kind of math on my reports even if I didn't need any kind of advanced math. I would find myself looking on google for relevant equations to include in a report even though the math in no way helped the project.  But this is the priority of academia. Academics do research and publish academic papers. In project classes, if you built the machine or accomplished the objective of the project but didn't use math, the professors would say ""Well if you didn't use math, then you aren't really engineering anything. You are just building something.""

 That was bullshit. I work for a company that designs large and complex machines, we do work for a variety of large companies in aerospace, aeronautics, automotives, and more. I work with engineers that have masters degrees and engineers with associates degrees. Nobody here is solving differential equations by hand, none of our documentation has linear algebra matrices, no one is including calculus on our reports. Actual math is done by software, or we consult charts (that were made by software.) By my professors definition, none of the people I work with are actually engineering anything. We are just building stuff. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a bunch of people with PhD's were telling us all that the only jobs that count are the types of jobs that are being done by people with PhD's.

  All of the math I did was helpful in developing a strong physical intuition for how things work. Being able to ""think in calculus"" is invaluable. I have a much deeper understanding of electromagnetics, mechanics, signal processing, and the like because I internalized the math behind it. But realistically, in industry, nobody is ever going to run into your office and say ""quick I have 5 differential equations that need to be solved in an hour by hand and the client needs you to show your work!"" 

   All of the math and physics you learn is a means to an end, not the end itself. Which leads me to point number   two.

2. Projects are more important than theory. In industry, real world knowledge is vastly more important than theory. 

  It doesn't matter if you are really knowledgeable about the electromagnetic physics that goes into the inner workings of a synchronous motor. It is great if you know all about the nonlinear equations that go into the power electronics of a motor drive. But the real question is are you familiar with the different brands and models of VFDs currently on the market? Do you know the difference between a powerflex 525 and a 527 and which one would you choose for a specific application? Do you know all the parameters of the 525 and how to set it up? Can you get it to communicate on a network with a PLC and then program it to do what you want through the use of an AOI? Does the PLC you are using even support AOIs? Would you use a star or ring network? 

  This is the stuff that matters in industry. You don't learn it from text books or studying for exams though. You learn it by doing projects. Maybe it is a school project, maybe it is a project at home, maybe it is a project at an internship, but you learn the important stuff from projects. If you go into an interview and can talk intelligently about the stuff that actually relates to the industry you are going into, that will be far more impressive than being able to talk intelligently about convolution integrals.

3. Network, network, network. Some of my friends that I graduated with are still looking for jobs. I had four offers before I graduated. I had great success because I went to every industry showcase, career fair, or industry lecture that I could. I talked to every engineer and HR person that would come to campus. And it was often times uncomfortable or awkward because like many engineering students, I am not a very social person. But the engineers and HR people from companies knew my face and knew my name long before I graduated. When I started putting out applications I got called back to places because I knew the names of people that worked there and put their names on my cover letters. Networking is very important even if it is annoying and uncomfortable.

 I got my internship by going to industry dinners that my school set up and talking to people. I think my one big regret is that I didn't push sooner for an internship. I didn't have an internship until my senior year. I reasoned I didn't know enough to be useful as an intern, but even a senior doesn't know enough to be really useful. You learn to be useful on the job from experience. Get an internship as soon as you can. Don't wait til you are a junior or senior. Trust me, you aren't going to be any better of an engineer when you are a senior than you were as a sophmore. You are only going to have more math and theory under your belt and I've already told you how much that counts for.

  Those are the most important points I can think of. Most people try to emphasize good study habits, do alot of practice problems, and things like that. That is the way to be a good student. But one day you want to be a good engineer, and studying is only going to take you so far. You can be great at solving problems on exams and still be a really crappy engineer in industry.

If any other graduates or working engineers want to add things they wish they had known as a student please add them. If you are a student and have questions please ask. With school about to start back up (or maybe your semester already started) this is a good time to have a conversation."
4wne18,1,2016-08-07,Advice needed regarding ECs and college shortlist,rawizard,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4wne18/advice_needed_regarding_ecs_and_college_shortlist/,"Hello all! I am a rising senior just now beginning college applications. I believe I am a strong applicant in general, though I honestly feel like my ECs might be a bit weak for my school choices (despite the opinions of my parents, lol). Obviously I can't do much to improve them now; but how should I describe them in the activities section and essays to make them sound as good as possible?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a male, White and Asian Indian (might not put that in applications), going to a public high school and regional STEM Governor's School in VA. Like I said, I'm happy with my academics and test scores:  

* 4.0 UW GPA  
* 4.37 W  
* 35 ACT composite  
* 780, 790, 800 on 3 SAT II subject tests  
* 5 on 4 AP exams, 4 on 2 others  
* Mostly AP and dual enrollment classes

&amp;nbsp;

Here are my ECs. They are not in order of importance yet because I am unsure about that. Let me know what you think:

**Programming**: This is a hobby that I got into in middle school and didn't have the opportunity to do in school until last year. I have taught myself languages/technologies including HTML, CSS, JS, Python, some Java and C++. Last summer I spent a large portion of time developing a game for iOS with Unity3D (game engine) but I haven't finished it yet. I have also completed 30+ problems on the math/programming website Project Euler.  I have competed in programming competitions with a school team (but not required), including 2nd place at an area competition.

&amp;nbsp;

**Guitar**: I have been taking lessons weekly for about 6 years now, learning rock, jazz, and classical. My teacher (who I might ask for a letter of rec) holds annual concerts where the students perform a song with a band, and I have been the headlining player the last 3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

**Soccer**: I have been playing in general for about 9 years, first a rec team and now playing with a club for the last 4 years. We practice or play games every week for about 3 seasons a year. I love playing but I don't want to give up all my time for it, so I haven't played in high school and won't play in college except club or intramural.

&amp;nbsp;

**Volunteering**: I'm not sure if I should split this up or keep them combined, so here goes. 
- I have been a volunteer at a local hospital for 3 years, in the emergency and guest services departments. It's a summer program, 20 hours/week for 2 weeks. I've done a few hours in the school year, too.  
- Starting last year, I became an assistant coach for a middle school MathCounts team (one which I was on just 4 years ago). I go to 2 hr weekly practices during the school year and help the students do practice problems, explaining some problems they can't do, and teaching problem solving skills. I have also led practice in the coach's absence.

&amp;nbsp;

**Work**: I feel like these are some of my more impressive ECs, but the first two are just starting this summer and onward. Also, should I split these up?  

* Paid intern at a local tech/business consulting company, working 30 to 35 hrs/week. My title is Jr. IT Business Analyst. I work with a team doing web development, using HTML, JS and jQuery, on a company product that's being marketed to large businesses. I have gained experience in real-world software development by doing testing and documentation, and soon I will get to work on feature development and backend/database stuff.  
* Paid intern at a local healthcare magazine (owned and run by family members but colleges don't need to know that ;)), working about 15 hrs/week. I am the solo developer of a companion app for the magazine. I'm self-taught in Swift and the use of iOS development technologies like Xcode and some APIs. I hope to finish and submit the app to the App Store before the summer ends.  
* This isn't really work because it is unpaid, but it is basically an organized business. In freshman year, I joined up with my precalculus teacher and several peers to cofound a group that develops web-based math games for high school level math topics. We began meeting weekly throughout the school year. In the first year, I contributed to two games focused on graphing. Then in sophomore year, we reorganized and I became a team lead for two other games, focused on geometry and trigonometry. We also started to demo the games to teachers in hopes of integrating them into classrooms. However, last year, meetings fizzled out because most of the group was seniors applying to college and they got too busy/lost interest. The website is still up but nothing has been done with it in a long time. So this was really only a 9th and 10th grade thing.

&amp;nbsp;

**Clubs**: I am in Mu Alpha Theta, the Science National Honor Society, the Spanish National Honor Society, the National English Honor Society, and as of this past year, the National Honor Society. I do tutoring for all of these groups, but I have no leadership roles. I am part of the school's Interstellar Team, where we compete every two weeks or so in an online math competition against another school. Also, this past year I joined the Scholastic Bowl team as a varsity member. We had matches every week in the fall and almost made it to regionals. I was one of the team's math specialists, usually put in for the team round when there were math questions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cubing**: Last year, I got into cubing (solving Rubik's cube-type puzzles) because I saw my friends doing it in school. I bought my own speed cube and now have been practicing almost every day since April. I average around 40s and my personal best is 26s. I haven't done any competitions yet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Languages**: For a little bit in past summers I was teaching myself Italian and keeping up my Spanish using Duolingo, some penpal websites, and some books. However, I haven't been able to stick with it so I might not mention it. Although I may write about it as an interest in essays, since ""language"" is a common theme in a lot of my interests (programming, music, math, foreign languages).

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have any advice about how I should write these in the activities section in order to best portray them?  
Also, in regards to my college shortlist:  
If you hadn't already figured it out, my intended major is CS and possibly math. My current list includes MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, Rensselaer, UNC, UVA, Ga. Tech, UIUC, W&amp;M, and Va. Tech. Are there any other schools I should be considering, especially matches?

Thanks!"
4wne6n,2,2016-08-07,I hate my father,Jersey--,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4wne6n/i_hate_my_father/,"My father is an awful man set in his own ways. Growing up it always had to be his way or no way at all. Now at 20 years old, nothing at all has changed. I am not allowed to sleep over anywhere. He's mad at me for working at a part-time movie theater because he does not think it is a good job, even though I have the ability to do my schoolwork there. He is forcing my 10 year old brother to only play one sport, tennis. My brother expressed interest in baseball, basketball, and soccer but my dad would not sign him up for any of these because they do not suit his interests. My brother is a very awkward kid and I think he should be playing more team sports where he can talk to other kids and have fun, but he is stuck playing tennis for 10+ hours a week because of what my father wants.


I recently got an internship at a dentist office because he asked me to, and I did that while still working part time at the movie theater for a month until my summer class started. I will also add that I was playing on a baseball team and a softball team at the time. I decided to cut down on hours at the internship because I am taking biology because thats what he wants me to do. I am struggling, which I am okay with, but he yells at me daily telling me I should have quit my job at the movie theater and kept the job at the dentist office. My test grades so far were an 84 on the first test and a 68 on the second, but the second was on 13 chapters of material that we covered over a period of 10 days. I was planning on moving out this year to live on campus again, and I was fine taking out loans to pay for but he told me I could live at home and enjoy some freedoms. I decided to spend a saturday night going to a friends house and I spent the night there. Ever since then I keep hearing that it was a mistake to stay over that one night.


Another thing that I hate about my father is how he is overweight, but criticizes my attempts to get in shape. Right now I am currently cutting weight with the goal of retaining as much strength as I can so I am in the gym 2 to 3 times a week. Today he told me I am ""Withering away"" Just because he can see my abs. He has been overweight my whole life and thinks any attempt to lose weight is unhealthy even though hes never tried it. I can't get a word in with him, because he is never willing to listen and my mom doesn't help out. He is retired and he spends all of his time either with my brother or at home on the couch or computer. I can't think of anyone that I hate at all except for him."

If I'm applying for some type of hardware or even software internship would it be a decent idea to put on my resume that I have built 3 computers and enjoying building computers and troubleshooting stuff? 

I didn't have it on my resume but during an interview I was asked about my tech side. I mentioned that I really enjoy building computers and troubleshooting and he said he really enjoys hearing that. So would it be a decent idea to be upfront about that and put it on my resume? Along with some programming projects I'm doing.

Thanks in advance!"

I've interned in three different start ups and each of them had multiple people who did some marketing and some programming. I decided that's what I wanted to do. I'm currently working in my third internship and I'm hoping that it will extend into a full time position. If it doesn't, I'll most likely work part time at a marketing firm that is hiring and stay as an intern in my current position. 

If you were hiring for a digital marketing position (or something along those lines) would my education be something that helps me stand out? Thank you for your help! "
4woodi,0,2016-08-08,Is being concerned that you'll make your referrer look bad a legitimate concern?,Marissa_Mayer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4woodi/is_being_concerned_that_youll_make_your_referrer/,"A relative I know somewhat well works full-time at Big 4 subsidary (he was hired at the parent company as a new-grad, got promoted to whatever the SE II equivalent is, and then recently transferred into the subsidary company), and in casual conversations at family gatherings, he's brought up the fact that he could probably forward my resume to a recruiter for an internship, if I wanted to apply. He's never seen my code or anything, but I'm attending the same school he attended. My parents are really pushing for me to send him my resume, but I've been somewhat reluctant, mainly because I don't feel like I'm that hot at coding compared to my peers. Moreover, I'm worried that if I happen to get an interview and do badly, it'll reflect poorly on my referrer's part. I've had some previous internships as part of my school's co-op program, but most of the interviews I've had so far have been pretty basic...

Is it a legitimate concern that I might make my referrer look bad? For what it's worth, the subsidary itself doesn't seem to hire that many interns, but the parent company does."

4wqyto,345,2016-08-08,The Anglerfish,lurefish,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4wqyto/the_anglerfish/,"I am beautiful in ways men shouldn't be.

Pretty boy, lovely boy, with his flaxen curls framing a sweet face and big blue eyes with big black lashes. My mother, when she was in our run-down trailer and not at the bar, would say such looks were wasted on a boy and that she wished I was born a girl. I'm certain she wished I had never been born at all.

School was hellish from the start. Girls viewed me as a living doll to play dress-up with, and boys hated me because I made them confused. My third grade teacher once made a comment about my cherry red mouth, the gym coach complimented my porcelain skin. The computer teacher got fired after cornering me alone. I did not understand it – I wore run down charity store clothes, spent most of my time with my nose buried in a book, and barely brushed my hair. And yet, here was the whole school bearing down on me.

Puberty made it worse. All my classmates grew and stretched, flushed with hormones and lust. I grew some, yet no straggly hairs or bright red pimples popped on my china doll face. Instead, the star quarterback would torment me so he could grope at my long legs and graceful hips. My teachers would compliment my academic achievements and then mention that someone like me being so aloof was a shame. The theater teacher asked if I was ""interested in boys"" in hushed, hopeful whispers.

I was not gay or straight. I was Uninterested. Why would I waste time chasing after shallow and petty girls who were jealous of my appearance? Why would I let one of those testosterone-hopped jocks paw at my body and call me a faggot afterwards? Why would I want my fat, balding English teacher to bend me over for an easy A? They called me frigid, uptight, bitchy, rude, prudish. I wore it with pride all the way to the top of my class.

I left my little Midwest town for a college in the big city. I thought it would be easier there, full of beautiful people to blend into. Towards the end of November, my roommate tried to roofie my water bottle, and the double room became a single room very quickly. For sophomore year, I got a studio apartment on my own.

That fall quarter was beautiful, the trees like brilliant fire throughout campus, and I took a communications class required for my major. It was about giving presentations and speeches, and the school website said Professor O'Malley was to teach it – classmates had described him as a jolly old man, a little longwinded but excellent at teaching discourse and rhetoric.

I sat towards the front, my empty notebook neatly dated, and my classmates chattered all around me. I paid them no heed, eyes casted downwards, but I looked up when the door to the lecture hall opened right before class was to begin. The man who strode in was not Professor O'Malley.

He burnt white hot, reality dimming around his gravity. Everyone seemed so tarnished compared to him, dark-haired bronze-skinned Adonis among the gray and listless dead. Square-jawed and towering, his presence was so thick it was sweltering, smothering, suffocating. My classmates all gasped as his eyes swept across the class.

Adonis-among-the-dead stood at the front of the lecture hall and said, ""Professor O'Malley had an unfortunate family emergency. I'm Professor Alexander Venus, and I'm taking over the class for the foreseeable future. Apologies to everyone who was hoping for good old John, he'll be back next quarter.""

He spoke like rainwater, Adonis-among-the-dead, and no one seemed too broken up about Professor O'Malley being replaced by Professor Venus. His emerald gaze trawled through the suddenly eager students, before finally landing on me, sitting in the corner of the third row. It lingered there on my face, and Venus grinned with perfect teeth. For the first time in my life, my face grew hot.

Professor Venus looked away, then, and the TAs handed out the syllabus as he crooned out the class expectations like love poetry. Despite the crimson flush on my face, I wanted to ace this class like I aced all the others before, a deep-rooted desire to prove myself as more than just pretty flesh and skin. I would not be bested by an unexpected crush.

The first two weeks of class were shockingly normal, just Professor Venus talking about the basics of speaking. He wore designer, tailored clothing and Italian leather shoes, his car a flashy red BMW all the girls wanted inside of. There was no doubt he was a natural at this, his charisma a thing unto itself, and my dreams were plagued with green and bronze and hands and lips.

Two weeks of lecture, and we received our first assignment: an informative speech.

""Make it something you're passionate about,"" Professor Venus had purred. ""Something that really makes your blood pump.""

Based on those standards, most of the people in the class would've spoken about Professor Venus himself. A girl had found his Tinder profile and a boy his Grindr account, leading to frantic little pow-wows about what made Venus tick before class started. He didn't respond to either of their half-nude and borderline pornographic messages.

I wrote mine about the Amur leopard, *Panthera pardus orientalis.* There are only around sixty or seventy left in the wilds of southeastern Russian and northeastern China, due to poaching and deforestation. I gave what I thought was an impassioned speech about the dying species, and my peer reviews agreed with that thought. One girl cried over the leopards, but she was a bit sensitive.

Professor Venus just watched from the front, eyes never leaving me even as he took notes with a black fountain pen. While the peer reviews were given back immediately, the professor wouldn't give grades until all the speeches were concluded. I gave mine on the first day, and ended up being the last person in that lecture hall, besides Professor Venus himself.

I was placing my notebook in my bag when Venus stepped up behind me and said, ""Dante.""

I turned, blinking, and Venus was staring at me with calculation. I had professors and teachers and TAs hot to fuck me before, undressing me with their eyes as they imagined me bent over their desk, but Venus's gaze held none of that. It was simply...assessing.

""You could rule the world if you spoke with a bit more passion, Dante,"" he continued. He pronounced my name like a Florentine.

""What do you mean, Professor?"" I asked. The thought of failure, of not being the best at something, gnawed at me like a hungry dog.

""Exuberance, joy, fascination, anger,"" Venus said with a laugh. ""If you fluttered your eyelashes right, people would rip themselves apart for you.""

I thought about his words all weekend, lingered on them as I stared at the shoes at the local department store. I needed nicer dress shoes for an internship interview, but even the discount rack made my bank account cry out. I pondered what luxuries I could give up – heating, warm water, coffee – when the man spoke beside me.

""Trouble picking out shoes?"" he asked me. He wore a tailored blazer and had gray in his hair, wealth oozing from his pores. I thought about Professor Venus's words, and did not brush off the man out-of-hand like I would've before.

""No, it's just..."" I said, looking at him between my lashes. The man touched the small of my back. ""I have an interview for an internship and need new shoes, but...""

""College is so expensive these days,"" he said. I left that store with practically a new wardrobe, and all I had to do was let the man grunt above me as I laid sprawled on a California king mattress in his mansion. I left before dawn. When I came to class dressed in my new clothes, Professor Venus grinned at me.

I didn't think of it as a con or even prostitution, though people probably feel differently. Women seemed less inclined towards me, so instead I found men, wealthier the better, and let them give me things. In exchange, they'd beg for more of my attention. I didn't really care one way or another about the sex, but the *power* I held over these CEOs and lawyers and stockbrokers was indescribable. They would do anything for me, and I could get anything I wanted with a pout.

It was coming towards the end of the quarter and the long stretch of winter break when Professor Venus approached me again.

""I see that you took my advice to heart,"" Venus said. I knew he wasn't talking about speeches.

""Yes,"" I replied, and Venus smiled, fingers trailing across my shoulder.

""There's a bar I want to take you to,"" he said.

The fallout had we been caught doing this would've been immense; he was still my professor, I was underage. Yet there was no thought of consequences as Venus – *Alexander,* he crooned at me – escorted me into the high class bar on the expensive side of the city without a single person even mentioning my ID. Rules felt like things that happened to other people.

""You're a natural already,"" Alexander had whispered in my ear. ""It's all the pity your father didn't teach you to hunt when you were younger.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked. I had not met my father. When I asked my mother about him, she spat on the ground.

""I'll show you,"" Alexander promised, and inclined his head towards a businessman watching us intently from a corner booth. Nice suit, nice watch, and lust in his eyes – exactly the kind I preferred, and it seemed Alexander did to.

Men are easily manipulated by their egos, and suddenly having two beautiful people make a beeline to you is quite the ego stroke indeed. It was easy to have him bring a car around to drive us to his lonely little penthouse, his wandering hands barely knowing who to touch.

It was Alexander who led us into the bedroom, peeled off the man's suit and pushed him on to the bed before stripping us both naked. He spooned up behind the man, arms around his chest and chin on his shoulder, and he said to me, ""Watch, Dante.""

Then his teeth sunk into the man's jugular.

I always thought that, if faced with a murder, I'd be disgusted and frightened like any human being would, even with my jacked-up sense of empathy. Yet as the blood splattered across me and dripped down Alexander's perfect teeth, I felt strangely...exhilarated. Alive. The blood was warm as it trickled down my pale skin, and my hands reached up to smear it across my white skin.

Alexander pulled out the man's throat with all the grace of a big cat, letting the body flop back down on to the bed. He looked triumphant, my Adonis-among-the-dead, and he pulled me into his arms as the man bled out on to his silk sheets.

""See, lovely?"" he purred into my ear. ""This is what you're meant to do.""

We cleared out the apartment of valuables before we left, laughing and singing as the man's body cooled in the bedroom. That was the first of Alexander's many lessons.

Some of our kind specialize in a single gender, like I do, while others like Alexander can turn the head of anyone they want. None of us stick around longer than a handful of nights – extended exposure can lead to madness, and stalkers are a pain to dispose of. We get what we want and then leave with a kiss. How we propagate ourselves is simple.

Brood parasitism is a strategy where an animal, such as a cuckoo, tricks another into raising their offspring. It's easy to slip inside a stable little nest with a few kind words to an overworked and ignored wife, and leave all the hard work to her husband until the son starts coming into his abilities. Then we come back and take him to where he belongs.

I guess something went wrong with me, and that's why my father never came back for me. My mother must've hated me for being a constant reminder of her failed marriage. I wasn't taught to hunt in my adolescence, not allowed to bloom like Alexander did under his father's tutelage.

Alexander isn't going to let that happen to our son. He's five years old now, with dark curls and big green eyes, and I have his room painted and ready. He's currently with his mother and her husband out in some suburb, and whenever we drive by, we hear yelling. A teacher had recently been fired from his brand new elementary school. Clearly, she can't protect him.

We're coming for him tomorrow night. Our family is going to be complete."

4wrlwm,10,2016-08-08,OSAP and Saving for University,amorebravekitten,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/4wrlwm/osap_and_saving_for_university/,"Hello, PFC!  

I am so, so sorry for the wall of text.

A little background, I am 26 years old and a self-taught web developer.  I've been working professionally with HTML/CSS/JS for a year next month, and I spent about a year prior to starting this job teaching myself using online resources.  

That being said, there is nothing in the world that I want more than to go back to school for a Computer Science degree.  

I attended college for two years in a program that didn't end up being the right choice for me, and I wasn't able to finish it anyway due to finances.  I left that school in May 2014 with ~$25k in debt, half owed to OSAP and half owed to a bank loan.  

I am $3k away from paying off the remaining OSAP loan in full (bank was paid 6 months ago), which I expect to take another 4 months at my current payment pace.  Maybe 2 months if I pause emergency fund contributions until the debt is gone.  I have no other debts.

I am also contributing to a secondary emergency fund (I have 3 months' worth of expenses on hand, would prefer to have 6 for safety) and making small ($25/week each) contributions to both a TFSA and RRSP investments with Tangerine.  I consider the TFSA also a retirement account.

Now, my first question is this:  I understand that I have the potential to withdraw from an RRSP to pay for my education as long as it is re-contributed within some time frame.  If I apply for OSAP in order to return to school, will I be *expected* to do so?  Would I be expected to empty out both the TFSA and the RRSP before I get any sort of financial aid?  I would prefer to continue making contributions to this investment until I go to school and let it simply sit until I am working again and can continue investing.  I have no idea if this is a feasible option and haven't been able to find an answer elsewhere.

Secondly, I don't just need assistance for tuition costs.  I live with my SO and I have bills to pay.  SO doesn't make enough to cover my half of things, and I could never ask it of him even if he does increase his income to that amount by the time I am returning to school.  I have been running numbers endlessly and I am feeling very lost.  

For example, if I spend the next 4 years saving up ~$50k (this is doable with my current income and expenses, hopefully I expect a modest raise once in a while) this amount could cover approximately 2-2.5 years of expenses (I currently require $1500/month for expenses and expect that amount to rise to as much as $2k/month during school to adjust for rent increases and higher transit costs -- I currently travel to work for free).  Would OSAP look at that pile of money and just say *hey look at all that money, you don't need any from us* if it happens to cover tuition fully for all 4 years (which that amount very likely would, and then some).  Will OSAP attempt to cover living expenses as well?  I did not receive enough to finish my last program, and I am petrified that this will happen again.  In that instance it was for the best, but I really don't know how much I can rely on the program.  I grew up in a very financially unstable household and money gives me a great deal of anxiety.  I currently make double what I actually *need* to get by for expenses and I still don't feel safe.

I fully intend to do a co-op program and earn some income during the work terms, as well as informal internships during the remaining summers if I can land temporary jobs.  My current employer may even let me continue during summers, or part-time during the semester.  

As an aside, I am not *naturally* skilled with math, and I do expect to struggle a little with the course load.  Ideally, I would prefer to get by without working during the semester but I fully understand that would be a luxury.



**tl;dr**:  Please help me understand OSAP:

* ~~If I have an RRSP and a TFSA as Tangerine investment portfolios, will I be expected to empty those out towards my education before receiving OSAP aid? (total value between something like $5k-15k depending on if I change current contribution habits and how long I take to save)~~ Answered, thank you!

* If I do save up some cash ($30k? $60k?) intended for use for personal expenses throughout a 4-5 year program, does that mean I won't get any aid for the first year or two and they'll expect me to burn through it all before providing loans? 

* It's my instinct to spend the next 3-5 years saving aggressively (5 years would mean ~$60k in a high interest savings account at my current income) to avoid *some* debt and help make myself feel more financially secure.  Is this a terrible idea?  I won't be able to save every penny I would need for expenses &amp; tuition, but I could save as much as half.  Should I bother at all, or just expect to take most everything I need as a loan and rely more on internship income?  

* ~~Does anybody know how mature/returning students will be affected by the new Ontario Student Grant stuff?  Every resource I've found regarding OSAP in general or OSG was written for high school students and only referred to parental income as a factor.  I live independently so the only factor is my and my SO's income.~~ Answered, thank you!"

1. I graduated with an environmental engineering degree in April this spring from an accredited university with a 3.33 gpa. 
2. I have various student organizations and sorority involvements and leadership positions on my resume - many positions (some executive board). 
3. I have had an internship during one of my summers and worked as a student research assistant to one of my professors for a summer and a semester. 
4. I know I was at least in the top third of my class, and I have had a few phone interviews.  I got a recent email rejection from one, but the other two have taken more than 5 and 6 weeks respectively to give me any kind of rejection or confirmation. I even have been sending personalized letters to each person involved in the interviews afterwards (I thought it was a nice touch - a little more than an email). 

At this point, there is a large career fair at my university in late September, so I will definitely go there and speak at all of the companies hiring for my major. I am feeling very hopeful, but I am scared that nothing will come of it. I will keep applying to positions online up until then.

I have been considering going back for a masters for civil engineering since there seem to be a lot more job opportunities for them. 
  
I know as an engineer who has a B.S., I may someday be expected to get a masters anyway, so is it reasonable to stop the job search to continue to get a masters degree if at some point I really cannot find a job?

I hope this post isn't against the rules of the subreddit.

I interned at a decently prestigious company this summer, and I have an interview at Google coming up next month. I usually do pretty well in my CS classes (3.8+) at a target school.

As preparation I've been doing questions out of CTCI and Leetcode over this summer. I've done a lot of questions but I don't seem to be getting better at these questions at all.... It's pretty rare for me to get the optimal solution to a problem and many times I can't figure the question out at all unless I look at the solution. Should I be worried? Is CS not for me?

The only way I got my current internship was cause I had seen 3/5 interview questions before, and the other two were extremely easy. I'm afraid that I'll do really badly during my Google interview cause I won't be able to fake it anymore. Not just that but all my future interviews.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? I really struggle with Leetcode medium problems, for example I successfully do maybe 1 in 5.

Any advice for me?

I had a Technical Phone Screen Interview for an internship today, it was estimated to be 45 minutes - it lasted 15 minutes...

To prepare for my interview I was practicing general coding questions, which was how i spent most of my time - as well as reviewing projects I have done.

As I get the call, we had a brief introduction and he asked me about one of the projects I was working as well as my contribution to it. That went along for 5 minutes and it went ok, I was able to explain my contribution but for some technical parts I just did not remember the specifics, such as how cookie sessions were used in conjunction with PHP and SQL.

But that was not the worst part. The complete flop came when he asked me the most basic questions, questions that I know the answer to, but was not able to answer them.

Explain what a hash map is.
What are some basic HTTP functions.
Another 2 i can't recall as at the moment I am banging my head in frustration. 

These are all pretty basic questions, ones that I know the answer too. The problem? I was so focused on writing code that I did not bother to review basic terminology. A quick google search is all it took me to jog my memory, but at the time I was at a complete blank.

Really what is comes down to is not that I failed the interview, it's that I made a complete idiotic fool of myself. I was unable to answer the simplest of questions that I know the answer to. 
Part of me just does not want to go through this again, another part is actually worried that the Hiring Manager (who is the technical lead) is going to pass word of this along to whoever that might damage my reputation.

Any tips on how to recover from this, it was a humiliating experience for myself.

4wsy0p,2,2016-08-08,"[UT] Former employer accused me of dishonesty &amp; theft, recorded video &amp; audio w/office cameras",thejoyofcooking,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4wsy0p/ut_former_employer_accused_me_of_dishonesty_theft/,"Hi reddit - longtime lurker, first-time poster here looking for some legal advice.

So I was recently fired from my position a small marketing office. During my termination meeting (and on an official termination of employment letter that I received), my employer listed his reasons for firing me, which included reasonable things such as poor performance, missing deadlines and complaining/poor attitude.

These reasons are all well and good, if somewhat exaggerated and untrue in some cases, but not altogether unexpected. However, my employer decided to go the extra mile in what I see as a clear attempt to smear my professional reputation.

The other, problematic reasons cited for my termination of employment include two charges of dishonesty, ""specifically, when asked about [my] theft of company property"" and ""specifically, in telling false and misleading statements to other employees with the intent to cause drama and problems,"" in addition to ""uses of blasphemy.""

It should be said that I did not commit theft of company property. That specific incident, as explicitly explained by my former employer, was about one time when I threw out a former employee's business cards along with other miscellaneous items (about a week after he was fired and failed to clear off his desk, which we needed to use). These business cards were made out of metal and apparently cost $350 to make. My boss was clearly butthurt about it. Anyway, that was my ""theft.""

The allegation of telling falsehoods to other employees with the ""intent to cause drama and problems"" has to do with a separate incident, again explicitly outlined by my employer. After a weekly performance meeting with a coworker went poorly, I was talking in with my coworkers in a small office room. An intern who was assigned to this particular coworker was rather distraught after hearing the results of her mentor's performance meeting, and in an attempt to placate her I told her that the boss hates pretty much everyone's work and that she shouldn't worry too much about it. The boss found out about this particular conversation through his audio-recording video surveillance system, which he regularly uses to listen in on employee conversations to which he is not a party. Anyway, my boss asserted that he ""never said anything about [intern]'s work,"" and ""only didn't like [coworker]'s work,"" which meant that I was lying and telling falsehoods with the express intent to cause drama, apparently.

As for ""uses of blasphemy,"" I will concede that my language choices when speaking with my coworkers were not always entirely professional. However, my boss only knows this through his audio-recording cameras. Also, I'm pretty sure blasphemy isn't a real thing you can fire someone for. In case you didn't already guess, my former boss is Mormon. 

Now I live and work in Utah, which is an at-will employment state. So my former boss didn't need any reason to fire me. The fact that he left me a whole list of reasons, many of which are damaging and untrue, at no clear benefit to himself or his company strikes me as petty and malicious.


So for specific legal questions, I have 3:

Is it legal in the state of Utah for an employer to record conversations to which he is not a party, without our knowledge or consent? Our office did not have a specific ""break room"" or other room in which one might have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Is firing someone for ""blasphemy"" legal? Can I file a complaint with the EEOC for violation of my religious freedom?

Can the written allegation of my ""theft of company property,"" which is both malicious and untrue, count as libel?

Thx in advance


tl;dr my former boss recorded both audio and video of his employees without their knowledge or consent, accused me of theft of company property &amp; fired me for ""blasphemy"""

I loved learning programming languages, and I'm wrapping up my first ever internship and I enjoyed the work I did (although it did get exhausting toward the end, glad the project is almost over!). I've always seen myself getting a job (or trying at least) in a field that's at the frontier of technology. That's just what interests me the most: doing something that revolutionizes the industry.

My question is pretty much what makes me as a programmer special? Nowadays people in many other disciplines are learning programming, and not just python either. A friend of mine who is a graphic designer did some VR work with C#, and people in biology learn C++ for computational purposes. It seems that other fields utilize programming in such cool ways, but software engineers just do it to do it. It feels like anyone nowadays can replace me since everyone is learning languages. A computational biologist can't be replaced by a software engineer because a software engineer isn't an expert in biology, a graphic designer can't be replaced by someone who isn't good with art and 3D modeling. There must be some job that computer engineers thrive at and are irreplaceable in obviously, and it's definitely not the 9-to-5 jobs of writing mundane code either (I hope). 

So my question is, what sort of programming jobs push the field forward and do cool amazing things? What are the jobs that I could do that no one else could? This isn't about job security by the way, it's just about pride in work and feeling satisfied."

I graduate next spring and am beginning to consider where I want to be stationed after college. I grew up on the east coast, but after a successful internship in Seattle this summer, I am interested in moving out to the west coast for full time. I have narrowed down my preferred cities to either San Francisco or Seattle, and I would love to hear some opinions/perspectives/experiences about the difference in cost of living between the two cities.

For simple comparison's sake, imagine I am able to reach the offer stage with at least one Big N company in each city. Notably, it seems like both cities have companies that offer new grad salaries of right around $105k, even though San Francisco and the Bay Area have a markedly higher cost of living than Seattle -- at least, that's what it seems like.

On [PaycheckCity](http://paycheckcity.com/), I've calculated monthly take-home pay for California and Washington on a $105k/yr salary. This is with no dependents/deductions/tax complications.

California take-home: $5,555.31/mo
Washington take-home: $6,263.39/mo

On top of that, the average rent for a 1br apartment in San Francisco proper is ~$3600/mo, while in Seattle it's closer to ~$1900/mo. Obviously these are just averages, and living right in SF proper will be more expensive than considering surrounding areas, but in both cases I am motivated to live in the city.

What experiences have you all had? Are those PaycheckCity figures at all accurate, or does stuff like Washington's increased sales tax begin to balance the two out? If you've lived in one or both of the cities, what is/was your monthly take-home like?

Thanks for any perspective you can provide."

Has anyone had this same issue here? Should I think of getting a job elsewhere or a Masters degree from a better school and come back?"

My country is in economic crisis right now, so everyone is really struggling here when it comes to work.

I am 23 years old guy and i found myself stuck in career dead-end because i made a lot of stupid decisions in my past and havent done a lot of things that i should have. It started with my school education - i failed almost all exams and got myself into one of the worst institutes in whole city (analogue of american college). It actually gave me good education and journalism degree, but the name of this institute has no value whatsoever, nobody among employers knows the name of this institute. 

While i was studying there i didnt do anything that might have helped me to search for a job in a future. I should have working in institute newspaper or taking an internship in some real newspaper or online-media. Instead i accepted invitation of my friend and began working in real-estate agency. At first i thought that it would be like a temporary thing. It seemed like a good option because i had to continue studying and it was part-time job and very easy. Believe it or not, but part-times jobs here are very rare, so it looked like a sweet deal. 

It was 4 years ago and i still work there. It has nothing to do with my education. This job is so stupid and easy that literally almost any 5-grade kid can do it. I basically change numbers in advertisements all day long and write simplest texts like ""This 2-room flat is located here...it has a balcony and combine WC...there is a pack of furniture..."". But it happens seldom, most of the time i just change numbers. If a price of certain flat goes up or down, my job is to change it on every website that has our advertisements. 

Needless to say, i came to hating this job. I stayed because of few reasons:

1. I like sleeping at morning. My working day starts very late.
2. Most of the time i actually dont work. Instead i pretend to work, while in reality i write a novel, learn languages or read educational books. If i had to do this job 100 % of my working time, i would lose my mind very fast because this job is soul-killing.
3. It is close to my home, i can get to office in 50 minutes
4. My friend, who invited me there, is still around sometimes. Its nice to hang out with him when he comes to work.

So, all past 1.5 years i have been actively searching for another job. During this time i realized one simple thing - the only available career path for me is copywriting in real estate. Basically, its the same job that i do right now, but on more serious level, where i should write about big apartment complexes instead of flats. 

Problem is - i hate real estate. Its hard to make up more boring and annoying topic to write about. I dont want to write about real estate for the rest of my life. But it seems like its my only available option because nobody will ever (ever) hire me anywhere else because i dont have any work experience. The only work experience that i have is real estate copywriting and it opens me the only road that leads forward. 

I would rather work as a journalist. But current economic situation caused a lot of media to close or forced them to live under constant thread of shutting down. They cant afford to employ anyone but very experienced people. I tried to write single items on various topics and showing them to the employers, but they never even bother to reply. They are not interested in anybody who has no actual work experience. If i was 18 yeas old once again, i would go for internship, but now, when im almost 24, i cant afford to live for even one month without money, i need to support my basic needs. So, there is no way to i will ever become a journalist, even though i have the journalism degree.

Tomorrow and day after tomorrow i will go to two different job interviews. They both are big real estate companies who seek copywriters. I have decent chance to successfully lang a position in one of them. But if i do it, i feel like there is no turning back - i will be STUCK in real estate sphere for the rest of my life. Basically, it will be my destiny - to work everyday on something that i dont like at all. Should i go for it?

The concept of ""everyone should have a job that he likes"" and ""job should be a second jobby"" doesnt exist in my country. My mother tells me to shut up and go for it, even if i will hate it. Just for money, she says. But whats the point of this money, if i will be miserable everyday? She tells me - you are miserable now anyway. She is right, but only partly - i am miserable only when i actually work, but most of the time, like i said, im working on my novel at this office. But nevertheless, she is right about money - i earn so little that i even ashamed to say the number. I have to think about my future here. With current job i will be almost free, but i will never afford anything good in life. With new job in real estate i probably will afford much more things, but i will be much more miserable. 

So what should i do?

4wyvb2,2,2016-08-09,anxiety about working and post grad-life,throwaway24416,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4wyvb2/anxiety_about_working_and_post_gradlife/,"So a bit of backstory on myself.

Right now i am 20 years old, and am going into my fourth year of a 4 year undergrad program in commerce. The school i attend is a top  institution in the world, with the program i am in being a very competitive school and highly desired school to get into, 6000+ usually apply per year, only around 300-400 are accepted. However, i have always been that ""kid"" who always managed to succeed with minimal to no work- i hardly ever did any homework in high school and achieved straight A's, getting me into this program. In university right now, i don't really do any readings or anything, just pay a little bit of attention to lectures and study a few days before tests, and i am in the top 20% of students in GPA. The program is not time intensive, its only around 12-13 hours of class time a week, with around a 30-40 minute commute back and forth.


After my first year, i got an internship through a family member at a very large and well known insurance company, and i worked there for roughly two and a half months with no real issues (i was bored sometimes at work, but i was mostly doing boring jobs with the occasional interesting business/client looking for insurance). Although near the end i kind of had a panic attack (mainly because i realized my internship was over and i was returning to school, and second year is touted as a notoriously difficult year of my program). 
Fast forward two years later (i did not work during the summer after my second year-i took summer courses to get ahead instead.) and i got another internship from the same family member at a smaller, small-mid sized company in insurance as well. I was looking forward to starting the job, making some money, and having some fun. I was a little nervous before my first day just because i didn't know what to expect.

When i got to the job, i had a quick little tour and meet and greet and a quick rundown of the business the company is in, what we do, what other companies we work with, etc. During this period, i felt fine. After this was over, they showed me my desk and i sat down. I had hardly no work given to me, just basically input 3 numbers into an excel spreadsheet for my first day. I basically had to pretend i was doing work for the rest of the 6 hours of the day, due to the office being completely open (there are no cubicles, more like open desks where my boss would sit in front of me). At the end of the day, i basically went full emo panic mode and had an existential crisis of what is the point of living, do i even like my degree, is this really what its going to be like after i graduate. I just felt like at the end of the day i only have 6 more hours until i have to go to sleep, and feel miserable like yesterday all over again. I tried to cheer myself up by doing the things i loved to do before, such as playing video games or playing guitar, and it just gave me no enjoyment at all, and the only thing i could think about was working tomorrow. I talked to my parents about it and they were kind of dumbfounded and mad, considering for the past 20 years of my life they always expected me to succeed with flying colours at everything i've done based on my past results. They convinced me to go back for the second day. I was anxious literally 24 hours a day, had literally 0 appetite due to being so anxious and panicky, and couldn't sleep at all. My dad said he would meet me for lunch tomorrow downtown because he was down there as well for meetings. I spent the second day there again with no work, just pretending i was working until lunch. I talked to my dad about it over lunch and he said to just talk to my boss and say i wasn't feeling well and would like to go home which i did, and my boss completely understood.

Needless to say when i got home i remained panicky and anxious, couldn't eat and i explained to my parents i can't handle this, being like this all day makes me feel the worst i have ever been in my entire life. They were mad, but at the end they said if this truly makes you this upset and miserable just call them and say you made a mistake and would like to just return to school. I did so and returned to school. I have always been kind of an anxious person, but never constantly depressed all day or constantly anxious. I did kind of go through this thing when i graduated high school, i was worried/panicky that this program was too hard and i would fail and be called a failure, just overall nervous in general about university, but after a few weeks at university i started liking it and realized it wasn't the ""oh no one cares about you in university and they will just hammer you with impossible tests"" speech that my high school teachers gave me.

Ever since then, i haven't been able to truly shake this feeling of anxiety post grad, when the inevitable work life happens. I feel anxious from when i wake up, till about 5-6PM when all of a sudden i feel fine and motivated, and its like i almost WANT to go back to that job and im motivated to work, even if its the most boring thing in the entire world, as long as i am getting paid for it. I have this constant fear through the day that my life is coming to and end when i graduate, and i'm going to be completely miserable 24/7/365 once i start working and i'm never going to have free time to enjoy myself. I feel like i'm going to be so overwhelmed with work that ill never be the same person i used to be. During my first 3 years of school i never had any doubts that i cant do this for the rest of my life, or i hate this program. Of course there were some business courses i didn't enjoy, but there were also some i found interesting. During my first job it never really crossed my mind that i'm not sure if this is what i want to do. I mean i had boring days (i was mostly doing menial work such as spreadsheet data entry and sorting files), but it didn't bother me a ton. I don't know why i got through my first job but couldn't get through this one, but a few observations i have was

- the first company was large and had a well developed intern program with another university, so they knew how to deal with/transition students into working. They knew how to run an internship program properly i guess.

- the second job was much a much smaller company and they were just developing their internship program. My boss did tell me on my first day that they had another summer intern who quit after two weeks. They didn't really onboard me the way the first company did, they gave me a quick rundown and then just threw me at my desk with nothing to work on. My boss was pretty much always concerned with his own work, and seemed like he forgot about me/forgot to check up on me.

- There wasn't really anyone my age to socialize with/be friends with. My first job had other summer interns from other universities that were the same age as me, and i felt like they were my friends. Everyone here was much older, the youngest probably being late 30's, with some in their 40's-50's. Although everyone there was really nice (no complaints about the people being mean or abusive or controlling).

- commuting really took a toll on me. I did take the subway for my first job as well (they essentially in the same location), but early in the morning the subway is busy as hell, hot inside, and takes a long time. My first job i did faint one morning on the subway (probably a mixture of exhaustion, standing up for and hour straight, the sweltering heat inside the subway because the A/C isn't working, and having my arm above my head for two hours holding onto a bar.)

I'm not sure why i can't shake this feeling, i've told myself it's just one job, every job is different, and i've done this before, i can do it again. I've also told myself that maybe i will grow to enjoy it, i mean at the end of my first internship i didn't really want to go back to school. I just always feel like there is some sort of impending doom on my mind. My friend took a job at another firm and said he had the same experience his first two weeks of being bored all day, feeling like work is eternity but he said he started to enjoy it 2-3 weeks in and says its way better than going back to school."

Hello everyone,

I am in my third year at UF studying **Aerospace/Mechanical** engineering. I am also, however, pursuing a minor in **Computer Science**. I really love programming, and would like to try to work as a computer engineer somewhere while I finish my studies.

I have taken just 3 programming courses, though I spend a good bit of time outside of class learning miscellaneous languages/algorithms/ideas. 

I can solve easy - moderate level problems on HackerRank consistently, and I have learned/coded a bit in a few different languages (Python, Java, Objective-C, C#, HTML &amp; CSS), but I use C++ the most by far. I know about common OOP concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and all that fun stuff. Though I haven't put them to a *ton* of use. The most involved code I have written is basic 2D game engine following TheCherno's *Sparky Game Engine* series. I wrote my own semi-functional physics engine for it, and I am able to code very simple games quickly.

My question is hard to pose succinctly, but basically, **am I at any point to be confident enough to apply for internships/part time jobs as a programmer?** I know this is a weird question to ask people who don't know me, but I guess I just really have no reference for what a intern or part-time programmer (if that's even a thing) might do. **Is it on the complexity of moderate algorithmic challenges that I can just do some research on and figure out myself? Is it writing low level code given prompts for bigger projects?**

I understand that this all very much depends on what kind of job I am looking for.  To answer that question, it is really anything! I'd help an indie group make a game, or just write code to sort through applications at an Allstate office. I guess that is another question, **what kind of places/companies look for a ~~novice programmer~~ advanced beginner?**

Finally, **what topics should I pursue if I want to be a well-rounded programmer that can tackle any opportunity that might arise.**

TL;DR Am I is bad program or no?

- **What do interns/part time entry level programmers usually do?**

- **What skills, as a ~~novice programmer~~ advanced beginner, should I learn to jump up to a level 2 true elite programmer?**

- **What type of companies other than Intel and company look for decent programmers? Local tech companies? Local businesses? Local farms?**

**EDIT:** You guys are the best! I really appreciate your time! Going to go research some projects to start coding, as well as local jobs I can apply for!

Thanks for any and all help!

SOLVED: We're giving up on getting them to boot together. We'd either need to buy a new projector with a 5-12v output trigger or get a room controller. Both are too expensive just to make 2 pieces of hardware boot together. Looks like we will just have 2 remotes."

Also, when should I decide if I want to be BS or BSA (I think I've ruled out a BA). Do employers at big, prestigious companies look down on the BSA, and for that matter, do ANY employers look down on the BSA. If so, what types of employers?

The work involves Apache Spark, Scala, Hive, Power BI and a little bit of basic Machine Learning. Th company which makes products/services for mostly US/Europe based clients. Recently they've been taking some projects in Talend ETL, Power BI and also Android App Development and not getting as many projects in Apache Spark.
Also I have my Accenture joining very soon at Bangalore. I am thinking of joining it for 4-5 months and then switching to a product based company/startup, so that I can get some work of my interest.
So,

1. Does one get enough time during free time in office and time after office to prepare for other companies, like competitive programming and contributing to Open Source ?

2. Does working in an IT Services based company act like a negative point while applying to product based companies who mostly don't use the technology I'd be learning at Accenture (like .net, SAP).

3. Will having the experience of a startup not so known but still able to grab good and known clients be more valuable or having the Accenture brand be more valuable for my future career interests( Apache Spark, Scala, ML)

4. Does having the work experience at Accenture be more valuable for a masters degree (MS/MBA) than that of a startup ?

5. Are websites like GitHub and HackerRank banned in IT companies ?

P.S. the pay is 33% better in my current company, plus the traffic and commute doesn't take much time, living is cheap. But I'm uncertain whether I'll get the projects I like here (as right now I've been assigned an Android dev project) . So should I join Accenture, prepare and pay the bond amount and leave Accenture or should I just stay here and prepare and try for other companies online. (After improving my programming/GitHub profile)

4x4e22,1,2016-08-10,Should I choose a startup in Jaipur or Accenture Bangalore?,gamebusterz2,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4x4e22/should_i_choose_a_startup_in_jaipur_or_accenture/,"I’ve been working as an intern at a Jaipur based startup since the last semester of my college and I’ve joined as full time employee after my 8th sem exams. The work involves Apache Spark, Scala, Hive, Power BI and a little bit of basic Machine Learning. Th company which makes products/services for mostly US/Europe based clients. Recently they've been taking some projects in Talend ETL, Power BI and also Android App Development and not getting as many projects in Apache Spark.
Also I have my Accenture joining very soon at Bangalore. I am thinking of joining it for 4-5 months and then switching to a product based company/startup, so that I can get some work of my interest.
So,
Does one get enough time during free time in office and time after office to prepare for other companies, like competitive programming and contributing to Open Source ?
Does working in an IT Services based company act like a negative point while applying to product based companies who mostly don't use the technology I'd be learning at Accenture (like .net, SAP).
Will having the experience of a startup not so known but still able to grab good and known clients be more valuable or having the Accenture brand be more valuable for my future career interests( Apache Spark, Scala, ML)
Does having the work experience at Accenture be more valuable for a masters degree (MS/MBA) than that of a startup ?
Are websites like GitHub and HackerRank banned in IT companies ?
P.S. the pay is 33% better in my current company, plus the traffic and commute doesn't take much time, living is cheap. But I'm uncertain whether I'll get the projects I like here (as right now I've been assigned an Android dev project) . So should I join Accenture, prepare and pay the bond amount and leave Accenture or should I just stay here and prepare and try for other companies online.

4x4elc,3,2016-08-10,Taking a low paying job early in your career?,beginDelawarehead,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/4x4elc/taking_a_low_paying_job_early_in_your_career/,"(throwaway, since I try not to discuss this kind of stuff using accounts that take nearly no work to trace back to me)

edit: I ran the numbers about cost of living and those make the compensation look much better.  Well actually they just make all the ""cheap"" areas near me look shitty.

I got a tentative job offer from the DoD.  Employment is (obviously) conditional on passing a background check) I need to complete the forms and pass the background check before I get a ""real"" job offer.  The job requires a clearance which I don't yet have but would likely (eventually) acquire wherever I go to work.  I have to get the forms back to the DoD within a couple weeks so they can start doing background check stuff.  The clearance would be TS.  I don't foresee anything that would make me ineligible for a TS clearance.

I've got two summer internships at a multinational defense contractor.  One was doing some security related stuff with network traffic for customers, the other was plain old software development.  I'm about to be entering my senior year in college and am planning on seeking employment at that company in a cyber-security related role.  Based on how these past two summers have went I don't think I'd have a problem finding a good job by the time I graduate.

Here's my dilema.  The DoD job is a offensive position.  The group I would be working for does offensive stuff.  To me that's really important because it's something I really want to get paid to do and IMO it's a heck of a thing to have on your resume.  Short of pen-testing there aren't many other opportunities to get paid to do offensive work.  The job sounds great.  What doesn't sound great is the pay.  I'd get ~50k + a $10k signing bonus.  The opportunities for increased pay aren't that great and are very well defined.  I know that there are very good retirement and health-care benefits available to federal employees but I won't be needing the former for a very long time and am very unlikely to need much of the latter.  What I'm worried about is this impacting my future.  I don't want to be that guy who makes 1mil less over his career because he started out making 10k less on day 1.  For comparison, I have three friends with similar qualifications, also working in cybersecurity that started with ~80k salaries.  After cost of living adjustments for where they work vs where I'd be working it's probably closer to 70k

Part of me says that I'm over thinking it and should just take the DoD job because it's a fairly unique opportunity and I can just negotiate my way out of being shortchanged by future employers (I'm not too bad at negotiating, I sure as heck don't fear it like some people do).

Another thought that crossed my mind is that I should email my recruiter and see if there's anything he can do to get me started at a higher spot in the pay-scale or include student loan repayment (I have under $30k in loans) or some other thing as part of my offer.  $50k seems really low to me considering that my intern hourly wages extrapolate to a ~$40k salary and employers are paying about double that for my college buddies with nearly identical qualifications.

Anyone have any advice?

tl;dr: Would you take a low paying gov't job as your first job out of college if it was something you really wanted to do?"

Many posters here claim to have great jobs and since my career is dead in the water right now I was wondering if I could ask you all for some guidance.

Here’s my backstory. I’m 26 and I live in the UK, I graduated in late 2013 from a shit university with a good grade in a generally worthless subject (journalism). Since the journalism industry is a wreck right now, I decided to try and find work in marketing, PR or internal communications.

Since graduating I have completed 4 unpaid internships, applied to hundreds of postings on job sites, taken marketing courses, learned enough basic CSS and HTML to build several decent looking websites to help promote a few local businesses as well as my own site to host my portfolio, run successful social media platforms for those businesses, started a marketing blog, learned useful skills such as using google analytics and email marketing, attended dozens of industry networking events, attempted to leverage my contacts, contacted recruiters and made numerous speculative applications to marketing and PR agencies.

All attempts have failed. Apart from a brief content writing contract position which paid minimum wage and ended in December last year, I have not been able to land any other paying work over the past 3 years. I have applied to entry level positions, basic admin positions, paid internships and simple manual labour or retail positions to make some money. I have approached companies through every conceivable channel and applied every job hunting technique I have read about online but my applications are either ignored or I fail the interview.

I have failed 23 job interview this year with feedback ranging from “we hired someone with more experience” to “we didn’t think you would bring the right kind of energy to the company.”

I have no idea how to find a job. I am almost 27 years old, I still live with my parents and I am going nowhere fast. Everything I have tried to find work, build a useful network or improve my employability has failed for no discernible reason.

I’m sorry for the text wall but I’ve run out of ideas and I really REALLY need any advice any of you can offer. Please help."

They give you room to learn, you get productive quickly, everyone's happy.

Now you look for work, and you get

Oh, you've got experience in all but one of the tools? NO JOB FOR YOU!

""We were looking for a Red Hat Linux guy, but we see you have experience in Ubuntu."" ""Oh, but the skillsets are similar - these are two different Linux distributions, I'm sure I can make the jump."" ""Sorry, but we don't think you'd be a good fit.""

WHAT THE FUCK?!

I've been looking for a job for seven months now, since I finished my master's degree. Seven months. And I have it better than some - I do have tech experience. Older experience, but it's experience. And I did take internships. My resume's good enough that I'm getting lots of attention from recruiters, and I get interviews, and even second interviews, but every time, I get told ""Well, your skills were good in A, B, and C, but we think you're not quite there with D, so we're gonna pass.""

Just today, I learned that one of the employers that I had interviewed with, that passed on me, had still not filled the position, because they wanted someone with another year of experience in Python. PYTHON IS NOT A DIFFICULT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. And I have experience with multiple programming languages. It's one thing if I'm not selected because they chose another candidate, but to learn that you were passed over in favor of an empty chair? That fucking hurts.

What the fuck? The unemployment rate is down, the recession is supposed to be over and the economy's supposed to be great, and everyone's finding work... except me. I must be damaged goods."

4x635a,5,2016-08-10,The Intern,Frobro_Baggins94,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4x635a/the_intern/,"Last week was supposed to be a relaxing one. I was finally finishing up my summer internship. This entire summer has been terribly boring. As far as internships go mine was pretty simple. Watch. Learn. Repeat. I expected the 40 hours of my last week to equate to several years. I was very surprised when my boss called me into his office last Monday to discuss a ""big project"" that he wanted me to be a part of. 

He always struck me as a strange man with his dry sense of humor and quirky posture. I jokingly told my mom that he seemed like the type of guy to have a basement full of bodies; however, there wasn't anything particularly menacing about the guy. He was lacking some serious charisma, but his polite demeanor made up for that. Strange? Yes. Dangerous? No. In general, most of the people at the factory seemed strange to me. They weren't the pleasant sort of strange either. The word grotesque even comes to mind when thinking about the employees. Something just seemed off. Some of their bodies were grossly misshapen. There were lumps and contours in all of the wrong places. Several oddities included abnormally long arms, bloated guts, menacing limps, and tainted smiles. I told myself to stop letting my imagination run wild.

I was kind of surprised when my boss said this project required me to come in on 3rd shift for a few days (11 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. here). I was also confused because no interns ever get moved to 3rd shift. I didn't want to mess my sleep schedule up too bad right before school started. I almost decided to quit a week early and take a two week vacation. I decided to stick it out as one week of work is roughly a month of rent. It was only going to be Wednesday through Friday according to my boss. The request was a little bizarre because I hadn't done anything of importance for the entire three months I was there. I printed documents, made spreadsheets, and pretended to be busy. Why ever would they need my help on 3rd shift? 

I was having trouble sleeping during the day Wednesday. My body can't get used to the adjustment that quickly, so I only had a small cat nap before it was time to head in for my first night shift. At 10 p.m. I ate a quick meal, then I proceeded to enjoy a few episodes of Adventure Time. After the few episodes I grabbed my work badge, put on my boots, and headed in for another boring shift at my internship.

Normally when I arrive I just sit at my desk that they provided for me. That night I didn't have any clue where to start, so I headed to my bosses office. I will refer to my boss as Tom going forward. The entire front office area was eerily dim. I wasn't sure if Tom was even there. I just barely glimpsed a hint of light peaking out from under his door. It was slightly cracked open. Common courtesy in the offices was to give a light knock and walk in. I did this, and Tom seemed pretty unresponsive. He looked unusually stressed in the yellow light radiating from his lone desk lamp. He was furiously writing something down and muttering under his breath. His hair was sticking up in random spots, and his usually clean shaven neck fat had patches of untamed hair. This guy looked like he hadn't slept for days. I didn't want to interrupt; I softly asked, ""Tom? What would you like me to start working on?"". He didn't respond. ""Tom?"" I asked again. He quickly jerked his head up. The last thing I remember seeing was a a sinister grin and the yellow light reflecting out of his bloodshot eyes. When I opened my eyes I found myself staring into a blinding industrial light. I was shirtless. My back was stiff against cold steel. I felt a droplet of sweat run down the left side of my face into my ear. This gave me a sudden chill. I went to wipe it away with my left hand, and I wasn't surprised to see blood on it. My feet were bound tightly. The most terrifying part was the machine press that my right hand was clamped directly under. I could not reach anything with my left arm to free myself. If the press were to go down on my skull it would be the equivalent of somebody hitting a jelly donut with a sledge hammer. 

I am starting to get anxious the more I write. I am going to need a small break to get my thoughts together. I have been super paranoid since these events. I just had to rant somewhere to prevent myself from going crazy.

I was proud to tell my family and friends who never believe in me that I have an amazing girlfriend. (Who they never got to meet.)  

Earlier today, I get a message from her saying 'hi.' I bite and say hi as well. She proceeds to break up with me, and give me the whole 'being just friends would work out better' spiel.  

Her reason was that with school starting back up and her not being able to drive herself anywhere (We're both seventeen, I have my license but can't legally drive non-family yet, she doesn't have her license) and that it wouldn't be fair for her to try to hold a relationship. I tell her that I understand, but I can't help but feel that I'd done something wrong. She assures me that I did nothing wrong. I tell her I'm sorry anyway. She tells me I have nothing to be sorry about. She says that a relationship won't work for her right now. I say that I understand again. And that was that. I'm honestly a little disappointed she couldn't at least have called me. I obviously didn't tell her, by I'm kinda calling bullshit on her rationale. I was more than willing and prepared to juggle school, a job, an internship, finding and applying to colleges, and her. It's confusing to think she wouldn't be able to juggle school, me, and getting rides.  

We weren't extremely close, (I always felt like I was more attached to her than she was to me) but nothing ever seems explicitly wrong. We had some nice times, I even kissed her a week and a half ago, and she kissed back. She'd always said she had a great time when we did anything. She regularly verbally assured me that I was worth a damn.  

Then last week I kinda lost contact with her for a few days, so I messaged her and asked if things were ok between us. An extremely awkward conversation ensued as she tells me that she's just been overwhelmed by vacation and family stuff, but things were left, at least I thought, well enough.  


I honestly don't know if I'll ever see or talk to her again. We don't go to the same school and don't live near one another. I just hate for things to end so abruptly, when I felt they were going ok. I don't know if I should press her for a more concrete reason, at the very least to give me some closure. I don't know if I should try to make her reconsider this whole thing. I'm just afraid that if I do, the chip of 'clean breakup, friendship still on the table' will be gone.  

As someone who is obscenely lonely and depressed, she brightened everything up. I just don't know if I should press to try to either close things up or maybe try to keep her around, or if I should just be thankful it was a clean breakup and try to let go. She made me feel like I had someone who saw value in me. Now I feel more alone than ever.  

**TL;DR-** One of the only people who make me feel like I'm worth anything just left, and I don't know if I should just let her go, or if I should risk hurting any potential friendship by pressing a bit. "

Came to the States in 2014 to start my undergraduate education at an R2 university. Will be applying to grad schools next year. One of the programs that I want to get into is the M. Eng. program in CS at Cornell - it is a 9-month, terminal, intense degree program made to prepare students better for the industry. Realistically, I believe I have decent chances of getting into this as I have a pretty good profile - 4.0 GPA, solid GRE scores, 2 semesters of research, and 2 semesters of being head TA for a core course. The program is undoubtedly hectic, but I like challenges, and I believe I can manage and afford it. What I want to get out this degree is to emerge as a top candidate worthy of being considered for a full-time position at companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.


The main problem I have with this program is the lack of any professional (internship) experience I would be having by the time I finish this degree. I don’t have any experience as of now. I would like to get an internship in the summer of ’17 (before I start my grad school) but I am not sure if I am legally or officially able to do that THEN since I am on a student visa. I also do not have any opportunity to get an internship once I start my grad school as my program will end before the summer begins, and I will immediately have to search for full-time jobs and find one within 3 months after I get my degree, as soon as I get my OPT (Optional Practical Training). I have also thought about the prospect of deferring my acceptance to Spring, in case they even allow something like this.


Would this career path hinder or make it difficult for me to land the job I desire of?"

He does not give me adequate information on how to fix problems, he seems to just figure things out as he goes and he has even given me incorrect information in the past. Oh and I just found out today that he's leaving, no preparation or warning. He just says yep I won't be here for month.

Does this seem like an odd situation? I'm a second year CS student and this is my first job in the field.

4x89ic,3,2016-08-11,Going back to school at 31 - would appreciate some input and life advice,balticviking,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4x89ic/going_back_to_school_at_31_would_appreciate_some/,"Let me start off by saying I've lurked this subreddit for a while and have read all the posts about going back to school. That said, I'd still like some advice and what my realistic expectations should be. 

So after a failed attempt at a career as an artist, I've decided to go back to school for CS. I took the edX CS50 course, and have taught myself some js on top of that. While I could continue on the self-teaching route, school will get me where I want to be much faster and cost isn't an issue. Right now I'm leaning toward a BS as I really want a solid core competency. However I'd like some input on my options, as life at 31 has its own demands. 

I have BA in Physics from a 'public ivy' and a 3.5 gpa, so I feel confident about my application for a second BS. However of the top cs universities, only CMU accepts second bachelor's, which includes all public universities in CA and Stanford. As for personal restrictions, my wife works as a project manager in tech, so I'd rather not end up in a small college town. My short list is:

* CMU
* UW - Seattle looks really tempting,  Wife could get a good job and good tech companies for internships
* UMD - We live, and have family close by
* USC - used to live in LA, city has its ups and downs.
* Columbia
* NYU

My ultimate goal is getting a really great job at a really great company. While education and opportunity is a priority, so is a healthy life balance. An education at CMU sounds great, but it would mean moving to Pittsburgh, and then potentially summer internships in another city (I'm guessing). UMD provides some family support nearby. As for UW, we have some friends and relatives in the area there, and internships could be local. 

I guess my question is whether I'd be doing myself a disservice aiming for a BS at UW, and forgoing a better ranked school? Even as I'm writing this, I think UW is the best choice, and would make us both really happy. We really like Seattle and have friends and some relatives there, and I'm confident my wife could get a well paying job at a good company. 

**However, there's another option**, which is simply moving to the Bay area, and focusing on self teaching until I get a job, and then continue educating myself until I can get an MS. However, if I were to pursue this, I'm curious how my application would fair. The catch is my 3.5 gpa in Physics is only for a BA (not a BS) and while I had plenty of A's in math, I got two C's in Quantum Physics I &amp; II. Assuming I get some junior developer job eventually and work there for a while. How would my resume fair for Master's programs? What would be schools would be within reach?

Would love to hear feedback on what my expectations should be for either a BS at UW vs CMU or aiming for an MS down the road, given my two C's and lack of a CS undergrad. Thanks in advance."

I've done a nonimpressive front-end internship and I worked in front-end dev for about a year, but no research jobs where I could get a letter from a manager. I've done well in classes, but as far as I know, no one cares about the typical ""kittu_katsu got an A in my class, she showed up, yay"" style letter.

Secondly, the school semester would not have even begun by then, which means I would not even have a chance to see what other companies are doing before making a choice. Is this normal? Or should they be giving more time, considering that school hasn't even started and that the internship is 8-9 months away? Thanks!

It's been over a month since this process started (applying/interviewing) for this internship and I'm not sure if I should just forget about the company or keep inquiring about their decision.  

(Sorry for the wall of text)  

So this year at my University's Career Fair I met a recruiter, ""D"", for this software company, she tells me that there aren't any internship positions at the moment, but they're planning on opening one up later on. She takes my resume, a couple weeks later, has me fill out a general application on the company website. I don't hear anything else from her or the company till early this July.  

**Week 1**: Another recruiter, ""B"", calls/emails me to see if I'd be interested in a new SWE intern position that opened up at the company. Has me apply for the job on their website, listing has already been taken down (before they even get in contact with me), so B has me apply to another position and he'll just mark it so they know it's for this particular internship. I do a coding assessment, turn it in that weekend so they can start doing interviews the following week.  

**Week 2**: I don't hear anything back from B.  


**Week 3**: I email at the beginning of the week about an update about my coding solution/continuing the application process. B emails me back saying the HM will get back to him about setting up interview. Calls me later and sets up an interview for later this week.  I interview with 2 Senior Engineers and then with the Director. I'm told that they'll make a decision the following week, so I'll hear then.

**Week 4** B calls to followup on the interview, see how it went, and then informs me that one of the Engineers is at a conference, it shouldn't last the whole week, and so I should hear back early the following week. 

**Week 5**: Don't hear anything from the company or B.

**Week 6**: I call and leave a message with B about a status update. B then emails me a couple days later saying he's at a company office in a different location and hasn't heard anything yet. He'll update me the following Monday when he gets back in the office.

**Week 7**: Current week, still no calls or emails.  

I feel like if I didn't get the internship, that's fine, it was nice to experience the whiteboarding process, etc, but they should at least be able to inform me of their decision. So my question is, should I email/call B again for an update? Or just let it go and move on?

I am definitely in need of some guidance so any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm about to start my senior year studying Computer Science and I've done well in all of the courses I've taken. While that's true, I have never worked on a project outside of Python/C/C++ code for labs in classes and feel as though it's time for me to do so. I have zero web development experience (which annoys me because I feel as though this is something I should have learned studying CS for the past 3 years) so I am at a total loss of where to even begin.

I want to create something simple, my idea is this: There is a paleontology database which has GPS coordinates of dinosaur findings. I simply want to retrieve these coordinates, plot them out onto a Google Map, and when a user clicks on a point information and a picture will be displayed about that specific dinosaur/finding. That's it.

I feel as though I am fairly proficient with Python (internship this past Summer was writing Python scripts to download data, web scrape, etc.). After fiddling around with this idea and looking at the JavaScript API for Google Maps, the first thought I had was to web scrape the GPS coordinates using Python, store those coordinates into a file/database, use JavaScript to read from this file/database and output the points onto the map.

I'm pretty sure I'm *way* over-complicating this and that there must be a better solution. I've looked at a bunch of different things but I really just don't know where to start. I obviously need to use JavaScript but should I use Python at all? Can I use Python for this whole thing? Do I need to learn and use jQuery/Ajax/something else? Do I need to learn a framework like Django/Flask? I'm feeling super overwhelmed even though this should be a really simple task (I assume). This is something that I'd ultimately like to deploy as a website/webapp.

Any help/guidance would be really appreciated. Thank you! "

2. Do I emphasze my coursework to a greater degree? For example, I worked in energy and im going to apply for computer science...there wasn't much comp sci related stuff in the energy job I was doing it (it was engineering 100%).
3. do I discuss irrelevant research and internships?

I know my resume can get me a job, but I don't know about how to go about changing it for graduate school. I think you guys are more familiar with grad school applications so I am posting here as opposed as opposed to resumes first to see what I can get. 

Also: I am planning on getting 1 LOR from a professor and 2 from my workplace (who had nothing to do with comp sci). Is that ok, or should it all be professors?

He told me he wants to personally train me over the course of five or six years. By then I will have graduated and presumably begun working full time at the company. He says that the job is very secure and that I'm basically guaranteed a job at the company if I accept.

He has tried this once before with another intern but found that the other guy just wasn't up to it. He lacked passion for the work and could not remain focused. He says, ""this is really something you have to love to do.""

4xbsxi,1,2016-08-12,Offer location,alsuhr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xbsxi/offer_location/,"I am asking for my partner, who I'm helping with career things at the moment.

My partner recently completed an internship at Big Tech Company where he received a lot of positive feedback from his team/manager, and was offered a fulltime position after graduation (he has one more year of undergrad). 

His company does not put fulltime location in the offer letters. They say that they don't know what positions will be available in those locations, and will notify the employee in Q4... which is so late! However, as far as I'm aware this isn't the case for all such companies (my offer last year was for a particular location without specific team position, at a different similarly-sized company). 

He doesn't want to work at their headquarters, but in another city in which they have an office (I am going to graduate school in that city). We aren't sure of the size of the office but it does have software engineering positions available. However, the number of open positions on their job board is 5% of what are available in their headquarters, so it is likely a small office. Throughout his internship he has emphasized that he wants to work in this city to his coworkers/recruiter.

His offer expires in a week, but I have personally been able to extend offers past those deadlines (especially fulltime offers).

He is having a lot of anxiety about the offer letter. I don't think it's reasonable for a company to leave off a location on an offer letter, personally. He also only has a week to decide. He hasn't spoken via phone to his recruiter, and hopefully can extend the offer and get more assurance that he can find a position in the city. He is starting to apply for other tech companies in the city.

Scam?,RevenantFiend,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4xbvkl/what_is_going_on_here_job_offer_letter_after_a_10/,"I have had an interesting history of getting job offers in this way, so I'm not as skeptical as I used to be, but still very skeptical. My very first job was as a summer intern for a large company. I went in to interview and I wasn't asked any questions, the CEO of the company just talked to me about random stuff like sports and what I'd be doing in the job for 15 minutes and offered me the job. Pretty cool right? Well it happened again with another company after I graduated college, I was looking for a job as a fresh graduate and got a call from a government contractor who saw my resume on Monster and asked if I could come in that day to interview. I literally walked in and he introduced me to the people I would be working with, asked me like 3 technical questions and offered me the job. I said maybe 50 words the entire interview. So to get the story. I got a call yesterday from a lady with a different government contractor. She went over my resume with me and said she was going to send me a contingent job offer letter that I had to sign after 10 minutes of just reading my own resume to me, saying ahh, yess good, yess, you know this, that and the other, yesss good.. I am really confused here because I literally was asked no questions. Again, I said like 50 words the entire interview. And this is for a very technical position working with high tech, costly equipment. I could have basically lied about everything on my resume. Do I have the best luck in the world for getting job offers or is this a scam? The other job offers I got seemed like pure luck because I said basically nothing and got the jobs, but this one just seems fishy because she never even met me in person. "

At the time of this story, I had just finalized the manual for the upcoming release.

Management knew that companies like theirs usually had a technical writer, but they had no idea what I did, and didn't know what to do with me. In the 9 months that I was there, my desk moved from one end of the building to the other, with some intermediate stops at offices in between, and I had at least 5 different managers. They tried putting me with sales and marketing, product management, UI design, and R&amp;D. I finally ended up sitting in a room full of the other employees who didn't fit in anywhere else, including their communications ""director"", my clueless manager, and a summer intern.

My first husband, who was also a student, worked at the same company as a developer. He accepted a position in a 3-month research project in another country, and negotiated an agreement with the company to continue working part-time hours remotely while he was away. I was going with him, so I went to management to discuss how to handle my own absence. I should point out that my clueless manager was not empowered to make these kinds of decisions, so I had this conversation with someone from middle management:

&gt;**finnknit**: Do you want me to continue working remotely while we’re abroad, or should I request a leave of absence?

&gt;**Middle Manager**: Well, now that the manual is finished, we don’t really need a technical writer any more. You can just put in your notice before you leave.

I was too shocked to argue, so I put in my notice and left. When I came home 3 months later, I found out that they had hired another technical writer. It turns out that the manual didn’t magically update itself when they released a new version of the product with new features.

&amp;nbsp;


I started with this company just over a month ago. I have two years of experience before that since college. I got hired into an ""early career rotational group"" which is supposed to be two 9 month rotations, and then getting placed into a permanent group. I've been in contact with our CISO (boss's boss) due to some unrelated, major issues. After expressing my interest in moving to a more technical role, he's given me the green light to move within a month. This will remove me from the rotational program and it will be a permanent position on the team.


From the get-go, I felt cheated regarding my salary. I was told I could negotiate but then they stuck at their original number and told me tough luck. And then I found out what my peers are making, plus a fresh college grad new hire joining my current group. I'm making slightly more than them, but not much.

&amp;nbsp;

**Few details:**
&amp;nbsp;

* I have my bachelor's degree in CIS
* Two years of experience at a Fortune 10 company
* I interned at this company for two summers during college
* Compared to my peers still in the early career program, I'm making slightly more, but I have more experience, a technical degree, and internship history here

&amp;nbsp;

Since I will no longer be considered ""early career"", is it appropriate to ask for more money after just two months? I don't want to come off as bitter, especially since I've had to bring up the other issues to HR and the CISO after just a month here. But I also feel like I got the short end of the stick.

**********

&amp;nbsp;
 
Oh my God… Oh my God… I’m sorry guys. I’m seriously freaking out right now. I wanted to put this up yesterday, to tell you guys as soon as possible, but I just couldn’t… I’m so freaked out, you don’t even know. We were right. My mom WAS hiding something, something huge. I can’t… Jesus, it’s insane... Guys, you were right. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

I am not Ari. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
My name is Elena. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
Almost everything I have been told is a lie. I did go to BU, but I was an English major, not Environmental Science. I have always hated running. I play(ed?) guitar and I was in the photography club. My favorite color has been and still is orange. I have never been religious, but have always had an interest in my mother’s craft. But I am not an only child. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
I’m going to start at the beginning for this one. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
My mom visited me on Wednesday. We did the normal; she asked me superficial questions and I failed to get her to say anything about herself. I waited almost the entire two hours for the right moment. I didn’t want any of the supervisors to overhear us. When they finally got distracted with another patient, I told my mom that I thought my doctors weren’t taking me seriously. She asked what I meant, and I told her my suspicion about the supernatural agents in the incident last summer. (Don’t worry. I didn’t tell her I’ve been posting here.) She told me that such a thing wasn’t likely, but I could tell she was lying. So I told her about my dream, the one where I saw myself standing beside the little girl, and my mom burst into tears. I was able to hear what she said though before the supervisors separated us, and, soon enough, I figured out what had happened.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Turns out I wasn’t seeing myself in the dream. I saw Ari, my identical twin, the sister they haven’t been able to find. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
I insisted the doctors give me answers. I was (and still am) furious that they’d been keeping this from me, so I refused to take my meds (they can’t have this) until they filled me in. Here’s what actually happened:  
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
It all went down just like I said before. My sister, Ari, got an internship up near my grandmother’s and decided that’s where she’d live and unplug for the summer. The two of us were inseparable apparently; we went to the same college for God’s sake and we roomed together there. So, when she decided to go off the grid, I said I’d join (I had applied for a job at a local bookstore and planned on spending all my free time reading). My parents didn’t expect to hear from us, and we never contacted them. When my dad and the cops arrived, they found my grandmother dead in the kitchen, and me acting like a wild animal in one of the bedrooms. There was absolutely no sign of my sister, except for her things, neatly laid out in one of the bedrooms. They have yet to find her. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
As for the whole mix-up (which, if ask me, is absolute insanity), because of my wild state, no one, including my parents who apparently have always been able to tell us apart, knew which twin I was. Neither of us have ever been finger printed, so there was no way of knowing. The confusion came when I didn’t respond to my own name. In my feral state, I answered only to “Ari”, so they assumed that’s which twin I was. Apparently they thought wrong. When I finally came out of my more permanent flashback state, it became pretty obvious that I wasn’t my sister. I hate running, the color blue, and enjoy reading and music. Also, I guess all my old mannerisms returned, like my constantly bouncing leg and my habit of cracking my knuckles. Why they made the decision not to say anything is just beyond me. Honestly, it’s probably one part medical bull shit, four parts embarrassment. What parent doesn’t recognize their own child? Well, who am I to say. Anyway, they said they didn’t want to disturb my fragile mental state by giving me, yet again, another identity crisis, so they were going to refrain from telling me until I was more solid or my memories returned, whichever came first I guess. Honestly though, with one twin missing and the other with no memory, what difference would it make if I thought I was my lost sister? So now, not only do I have to remember what it is that happened to me, but I have to know what happened to Ari… She’s been missing for almost a year now. The police aren’t physically looking for her anymore. They’ve assumed she’s dead and now they just want answers. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Hell, so do I. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
My mom isn’t allowed to visit me again. My head doctor told me. They’re worried she’ll only compromise my mental health like she did with this bomb shell. Here’s my question though; why would they keep her from seeing me if she’s made the big reveal? I mean, she’s already told me the thing they were so concerned about; what’s the point from separating us. That’s why I’m positive that there’s something else they’re not telling me. There’s definitely more to this crazy story. I just don’t know how to find out. They’re still going to let my dad visit, but only under close supervision. That’s my only opportunity I think. Unless… I can break into patient records and open my file… That would require some serious hacking though, and I’m not sure I have that skill… I bet I could find a way though…
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Oh my God… No this is crazy talk. I can’t break into the computer system. I’ll just have to find another way. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, throughout all this ridiculousness, I think one of the weirdest parts is that I haven’t episode since I found out about Ari, or myself rather… or, whatever… since my mom let the secret out. My doctors are kind of freaking out. I guess they’d been giving the information they gleaned from my episodes to the police, who were trying to piece together whatever happened to my sister and I. Needless to say, they didn’t really get all that much from me. But that fact that I haven’t been having episodes leads me to think that maybe my episodes were trying to send a message or something. I’m not quite sure how that would work but it’s odd that I haven’t had any in this long. Mind you, this has happened a couple times before, so I can’t say that this is something the doctors should be panicking about, but it’s just a tad unusual. Can’t say that I’m complaining though. The episodes were huge interruption to my day. Not that I'm ever doing anything of consequence. 

&amp;nbsp;

The only thing that's nagging me at this point about those episodes is why I respond to Ari and not Elena when I'm having an episode. I mean, everyone here is one hundred percent positive that I'm not Ari, but if that's true, why do I answer to my sister's name? Honestly, it feels strange with everyone calling me Elena now. Admittedly, they've been calling me Ari for months, so it's bound to feel weird, but what if they've just mixed us up again?  How do they know for sure that I'm Elena? Or I know some of you said in my earlier posts that I might be possessed or taken over by a new spirit, but what if I'm both of us. What if Ari lives inside me too? Oh God this is just too freaky. I don't know... Is something like this even possible? 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Moving on. Despite my disappointing lack of crazy, uncontrollable flashbacks, I have had two more dreams since my mother’s bomb. It’ll come as no surprise when I tell you that I was forced to tell my doctors about the dream I saw my sister in. Since then, they interrogate me every morning as soon as I wake up, so they know about these dreams too. Long story short, they don’t trust me anymore and they’re worried my dreams will lead me to start asking questions. And they don’t want that. Do they really have my best interest in mind? I’m starting to wonder… There’s definitely something else going on here, some sort of secret motive they haven’t told me about, and I just don’t trust it. I need to know. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, so the first dream I had was the night after my mom told me about myself and Ari. I saw the little girl again. She was sitting next to me with her head in her hands, and she was crying. I asked her what was wrong, but she wouldn’t answer. She just kept saying over and over again that she was sorry, she was so sorry. She wouldn’t look at me. When I asked her what she was sorry for, she said “it’s my fault she’s gone”. Then she looked up at me, and instead of crying tears, she was crying blood. Before I could do anything, someone grabbed me from behind, and then I woke up.  

&amp;nbsp;

I have couple thoughts on this one. First off, I think this little girl might be real. I mean, I saw Ari, right, and Ari was real. Could these dreams be memories or something, maybe flashbacks like the episodes? I don't know... They don't seem to be as intense as my flashbacks. But, the girl, could she have something to do with what they're not telling me? Why she is always so upset? Now that I have a little more of an understanding of what happened, is the ""she"" the girl was talking about my sister? Or someone else entirely? Also, I feel like the word ""gone"" could mean a lot of things... dead, missing, lost, running errands... Like what exactly does she mean? I also can't help but wondering what grabbed me at the end there. I wonder if it was that dark thing I saw in the other dream, the thing with the antlers/horns and the funny walk? It seems to represent the darkness that has been plaguing this entire event.  

&amp;nbsp;

The doctors think the girl is a manifestation of my guilt. They told me that I am blaming myself for what happened but I cannot express it because I don't have any memories. However, that theory doesn't fit into the other dreams I've been having about her. They had an excuse ready of course; they said she also represents my fear of remembering, and she is a physical representation of my memory block. In theory, she is the one holding me back. In addition to the little girl, they also say the dark figure is supposed to be memories themselves; they're scary, so I see them as a terrifying, inhuman thing. A part of me wants to believe this. Honestly, it would be easier to believe that these things, these people I'm seeing, aren't real! I want this to be the truth, because honestly, the possibility that they have something to do with whatever happened to me is even more scary...  
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Ugh, I don't even want to think about it right now. Moving on... 

&amp;nbsp;

The second dream I had was different. For once, the little girl wasn't in it. But I did see Ari again, and she was terrifying. She was standing in front of me and smiling, but not in a friendly way. She looked almost sinister. She was telling me to join her, that I should leave everything behind, that ""he"" would make the pain go away. I kept refusing though, and she gradually became more insistent and angry. She screamed at me to join her, that I would regret it otherwise, that ""he"" would make me suffer, that I would die painfully... Still I refused, and then her face went absolutely blank, and she said I wouldn't have a choice. That's when I saw a massive figure coming up behind her, it, the thing, ""him"". And I woke up.  

&amp;nbsp;

See, this one doesn't really fit into the doctors' weird, psychological theories. Why would Ari, my sister, who I was apparently very close with, be threatening me? Why would she be trying to convince me that this dark figure, supposedly my ""scary"" memories, would make me feel better? It doesn't make sense! I'm sorry. This is just so frustrating... I'm just really sick and tired of being in the dark and being afraid and I just hate it. I hate it! Ugh...  

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I'm not putting up any transcripts today... I'm too shaken up by all of this, I'm sorry. I'll post again next week. I'll keep you updated as best I can... I'm not sure what will happen, whether or not this episode dry spell will continue (honestly, I highly doubt it). My dad is coming on Monday I think, and I plan on asking him about the little girl again, and maybe the forest (that's really the only lead I have). Maybe he can tell me more about my sister. I mean, she is/was my twin, and admittedly I'm curious. It's not like the doctors know anything about her. I'm going to keep my ear out too, see if I can figure out what it is that they're still not telling me. It will be difficult; they keep me under constant supervision, but I need a plan. Thanks again guys for all the support. I appreciate it. Until next time, signing out under my actual name for the first time here...

I just graduated from college with a BS in Information Technology and about one year of IT entry level experience. I ended up securing a position in a county position because I had known the IT director personally. I really didn't know what exactly I would be doing besides ""project management"", but I know it's a good place to get into in the IT profession. At first this was going to be an internship, but when I told them I was willing to work more hours, they decided to take me in as a contractor (I signed up with a hiring service). 

The problem is that I have no experience in project management. Right now the Director has me making customer service follow-ups for internal and external users that call/email our operations techs, making sure I know what everyone is doing each day, and doing small projects for him (right now I am following Ethernet cords in switch closest a mapping where they go).

Here are a few questions I have:

1. What skills should I be learning? My boss said I should get into the PMI, but the only thing I can work towards is the CAPM and I would need to take classes for that, but I just started my job.

2. Everyone on both sides (Operations/Developers) are all really smart, specialized employees who have been working here for 5-20 years, and I feel out of place. I know this feeling will probably go away, but I could use advice on how project managers learn about what the team is doing. 

I need the skills to be able to get a full time position and be able to contribute to the team. Thank you for your help, and if you have other advice I would appreciate it!"

However, this student has worked on several side projects outside of class, attended and competed at hackathons (might have won 1-2) and has taught him/herself several different developmental technologies outside of class including technologies the interviewing company uses.  

So, which student do you guys think companies would typically hire? Someone who's good at questions during the interview and has an amazing academic record, or someone who has developmental experience under his/her belt and knowledge on many technologies?

Interview can be either for an internship or full-time position (Software Development)"

4xfevq,3,2016-08-12,Is this a reasonable college list? Advice appreciated!,throwingthis1awaylad,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4xfevq/is_this_a_reasonable_college_list_advice/,"International applicant here, ORM, male, looking to study CS , interested in getting into Silicon Valley / working for the usual big names(not sure of this bit yet). I don't need any sort of Financial Aid, fortunately enough!

2400 SAT 1 (Single sitting, second go), SAT 2s - 800 Math 2, 780 Chem, and will probably get 790-800 in Phy. Planning on taking French without listening as well.

96-97 percent average, ranked 1st-2nd out of 150ish students, no APs offered(self studied CS but got 4, don't know whether to send this), some usual ECs at national level / inter school level such as debating , football, quizzing, programming etc. Have one somewhat unusual EC which I have worked very hard at to develop from way before college came into the picture, all the way up to one of the best U-18s internationally and consistently placed there for more number of times than anyone else ever has(fact :)), and I have given back to the community and done a lot of other things with this EC(not really willing to specify). Placed runners up in national coding challenges, done a couple of internships, other stuff.

Essays will be decent, don't expect anything amazing from them sadly, and recs too are not gonna be anything special(never really had any teacher outright love me, shame).

So this was the list I came up with, comprising some notoriously selective schools:-

Stanford 

Princeton

CMU SCS

MIT

Harvard

UC Berkeley

Cornell

Columbia

UIUC 

U.Washington Seattle

UCLA

Georgia Tech

U.Mich

UC San Diego

USC

Purdue

And finally, University of Waterloo from Canada.

I'll be applying for CS to all of these, and was wondering if this list needed adjusting one way or another. I still haven't decided on what to do for EA/ED (the absolute dream is Stanford, highly unrealistic no doubt, but no one ever really got in from this country into Stanford through SCEA), thought I might go for either CMU SCS ED or Princeton SCEA. Any advice on that as well would be appreciated, thanks, peeps!"

So I'll be a senior in Computer Engineering this upcoming fall, and I never really considered going to grad school until this summer during my internship when I met a ton of people who were going to grad school. Can anyone who has done/ is currently doing a graduate program in Computer Engineering give me some insight as to what the program is like? I've had my fair share of struggles during freshman and sophomore year, but I hit the books pretty hard my junior year and I was able to boost my GPA all the way up from a 2.71 to a 3.19. I am just not sure if I am capable of doing well on the GRE, getting a couple letters of recommendation, getting into a decent program, and do well in this program. 

I guess what I'm asking is how difficult is it really? And what advice would you give me if I'm just starting to think of graduate school this late in the game?

Thanks a lot.

4xfxe5,19,2016-08-12,Really afraid to start my first programming job.,iheardacrimego,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xfxe5/really_afraid_to_start_my_first_programming_job/,"Hi all,

So first come backstory. I graduated in May with a BS in CS from a small state school in the midwest. Started late, at age 24, cause I didn't know what I wanted to do for a living (and still kinda don't if we're being honest). I'm now 28, which I think contributes some to my anxiety, cause I'm not some 21 year old kid just figuring stuff out. I'm at the age where a lot of people are established in their careers already.

I had pretty good grades in school (3.6) but I struggled in algorithms, discrete structures, other CS theory type courses. Our professors tended to let us through with B's or B+ anyway, which is bad, but what am I gonna do? Ask them to fail me instead? I put in extra time on my own to try and get a better grasp on stuff like big O notation or (insert algorithm here), but it still just confuses the hell out of me.

I didn't work on side projects, because I had/have little confidence in my abilities and when I tried, just had no clue where to even start. People would say stuff like ""build some Android apps"" and when I would pursue that, I would end up just totally lost. In addition to just not really being that passionate about programming. I didn't have internships for the same reasons (well, also cause I did not realize til finding this sub how important those were considered).

To be clear, I did fine in programming classes, mostly. Java is my strongest language, and I struggled at times with bigger projects, but usually was able to solve problems and get things done with it.

In spite of all this, to my surprise, I got hired at a junior programmer job where I get paired with a mentor and work with a small team. I start next month. I guess I must have interviewed well? It felt like the two managers liked me. They asked a few technical-ish questions, but there was no whiteboarding or any of that stuff. Looking back I almost wish there was, because then there would be no question whether or not I was ready. I would either sink or swim in that room, and then know for sure what I needed to work on even if I failed big time.

On the one hand, I know I should be happy about this. It's a well-paying gig, especially for someone with zero real experience. There are people out there,  more skilled than I am, struggling to find a job.

On the other though, I can't help but have a lot of fear. I didn't lie in the interview, but what if I oversold myself and they think I'm a lot better than I am? Like I said, I have no legit programming experience outside of school projects. I have a rudimentary understanding of git version control, but I can't even comprehend how programmers work on huge products in a company like this. The whole process is completely shrouded in mystery to me, seriously. What do professional programmers even do all day? I have no clue what this job is going to entail.

I just feel woefully unprepared, which is my own fault I know. And I feel like I got a job I don't deserve. I don't know if this is just normal nerves or something to be legitimately concerned about.

Sorry for the whinefest, thanks for reading.

I am a Hispanic living in an upper middle class town.
Both of my parents are from Colombia and came to America in their late teens. My father did not go to college, but my mother did. My mother does not work and my father does.

I am interested in the sciences, however, I don't have a specific major chosen yet. I am interested in a medium to very large school that offers opportunities like co-op and/or research. I like big campuses with lots of green and buildings that aren't too old. Little detail, but I would also like it if my dorm or townhouse has it's own bathroom and/or kitchen.

I am also low-income and do not have to pay any application fees. 

I am interested in studying neuroscience/Psychology. I have compiled a list of -*brace yourself*- 36 COLLEGES. Yes, this number is humungous. Yes, this number is INSANE. Thus, I need to cut it down. Big time. 

Help this crazy college hopeful cut down her list, please please. 

All of these schools have a neuroscience program. Most have a major but some have a concentration/minor with a psychology major I am happy with. I think I want to go pre-med but I also want to toy around the idea of going to grad school for Neuroscience and working in a research field for neuroscience. 

I can take Japanese classes at all of these schools

I can see myself going to a LAC because of the accessibility of Professors, Intimate Community, and often beautiful campuses. I absolutely love the idea of being so close to a professor that we can go out for a cup of coffee to just talk. Small classes are definitely where I learn best. I think it would be nice to have a close relationship with the faculty and be able to approach them for research opportunities.

I can also see myself going to a research university for the opportunity to take grad classes in undergrad, more course offerings, and a wider array of research opportunities to choose from. I am sure that I can get research at most LAC's but if I don't like anything that the smaller selection of professors are offering then that is tough luck. 

All the colleges on my list have a wide range of sizes too. from 1,800 to around 15,000. The Claremonts are smaller but they are part of a close consortium. Frankly, I don't see either size as a problem for me. I just really don't have a preference as long as a school is under 20,000 and at least around 1800. 

Also I can afford all of these colleges after running the Net Price calculator 

Now for the oh so anticipated **MONSTER** of a list. 

**Saftey**

* Syracuse

* Knox

* Lake Forest Univeristy

* Oregon State (Don't really want to go there at all but I better throw in my local state school :/)

**Match**

* Dickinson

* Occidental

* University of Richmond

* Univeristy of Rochestor

* Wake Forest Univistery 

* Bucknell

As you can tell this poor diluted soul needs some major changes. I have way to many reach schools like I need to just calm my tits cause I am being hyper unrealistic. I  JUST CANT GET MYSELF TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND REMOVE SCHOOLS.

I Have already poured HOURS AND HOURS into researching to get this monster list. Imagine it this way OUT OF ALL THE THOUSANDS OF UNIVERSITIES I brought it down to 36, do I sound less crazy now?


**My Stats**

* GPA: 4.0uw, something really high weighted, I have taken the max amount of IB Classes I can. I am a Full IB student. 

* Rank - Somewhere between 4-8/500~. At my school, all people with an uw 4.0 gpa and met honor requirements are valedictorians. There are around 10 each year, I will probably be one of them. Honestly don't know if my school reports unweighted or weighted ranks because of this. We have 2 official transcripts with both. I think I get to choose which one to send in, if I do I will send the rank 1 unweighted transcript. 

*SAT- Around 1400 New Sat, retaking in October. Chem and Math 2 in November

* EC- 2 Club presidents, 1 VP, 2 Officer, Tennis team, Science National Honor society co-founder, NHS, Japanese National Honor Society. Communications Internship, Meals on wheels volunteer, Library volunteer, Food bank volunteer. 

One of the clubs I am president of I am REALLY passionate about. It's a club where we fundraise for a different sick child each year. Last year it was for a girl who had the same cancer my mom died of. We raised $15,000 and I am immensely proud of that. I know I don't have a fancy research position but I really take A LOT of pride in this because of the history with my mother. Before I became president we raised $3000 so there was a big difference when I took over. The club only had like 10 people and the old presidents just wanted to give up and disband, but I took over. There is around 100 members now. 


NOW YOU GUYS COME IN. **PLEASE HELP THIS CRAZY PERSON BECOME SANE**

I want to go to a school where there is plenty to do without drinking. I don't party or drink, but I do want the option. This could mean I live near a city and could explore it. But it is okay for a college to not be near a city, as long as there is plenty to do on campus. 

I do not plan to join Greek life so I don't want social life to circle around it. I don't care if there is no greek life. 

I am interested in going to a college with a strong campus feel. I want to know I am in a campus, and not just a place that just feels like it is a part of the city (If you know Portland OR I despise the look of Portland State for this reason). I am fine with being in a city as long as there is a distinct campus feel. 

I also want to avoid any type of commuter vibe a college may have. Right now I think I want to stay on campus throughout all of my undergrad. This ties back into my desire for a strong campus feel. I am a liberal person, but not insanely liberal. A college does not have to be liberal as long as it is not conservative, so middle ground places are just fine and I think I would be fine in a more left wing school as well. I am not that artsy but I do not mind artsy people.

I come from a very poor background. My family has consistently been below the poverty line. I was even homeless for a period of my freshman year of high school. I don't want to go to an overly preppy-snooty college that has a really strong upper-class presence. I am afraid that my inability to pay for activities, concerts, events and just eating out may ostracize me. Similarly, I would like to have a lot of opportunities to have fun on campus without being a burden on my thin wallet.

I think I have a better chance at schools like Bowdoin, Pitzer, Bates, Wesleyan, Brandeis, Dickinson, Wake Forest and Skidmore since they are test optional. 

What school do you guys think I should cut? Do any of these schools have horrible psych/neuroscience and I just didn't notice? With the information I gave you which of these schools would I not fit?

I really need help guys T-T


**TLDR** GIVE ME REASONS TO CROSS SCHOOLS OFF MY LIST PLEASE GOD

ALSO- I plan on applying to colleges through QuestBridge as well. Emory, Pomona, Tufts, and Wesleyan do not require a supplement with Questbridge. Because of this lack of supplement and app fee I really see no reason to take them off my list. They take 0 extra effort so they don't need to be included in the number of applications I have to fill out. So I can be at a sane number of colleges with these taken on when my list is finalized. 

Also I for sure am applying to Stanford, Yale, and Princeton because they are non-binding schools in the Questbridge college match. Very few get in that way so I will just let my apps roll over to RD and that wont be any extra effort either. 


I need to be done with forming my list so I can focus on essays and SAT studying!"

I hope to stay at least until my EAD expires next August. I've been here for almost one year. My English is okay and still needs to be improved with time. My background was in applied mathematics and I switched to study computer science for my master's degree in 2010. After graduating in 2012, I worked for my own online shop instead of working for a job related to what I studied until 2015. I'd worked at a startup as a DSP engineer for 10 months while I was still working on my own online shop. After I quit my engineering job (because I was extremely busy with two jobs), I didn't keep my coding skills sharp. I shut down my online shop and came here last August to study a 9-month certificate program in Software Engineering, which allows me to have one-year work authorization in the US after finishing it. But I'm not allowed to be unemployed over 90 days during the period. That makes me feel more stressed. I have a hard time getting interviews. I intend to get a QA automation internship but I'm willing to work for any job position related to computer science and programming. I'm wondering what specific field is better for me to work in according to my studies and experience. Can someone give me advice about my resume and finding a job? I will really appreciate it.

She'd tell me after every time we did something that she had a nice time, and we kissed about two weeks ago. About five days before she called it off, things had been kinda stiff between us. She hadn't really been talking to me, so I asked her if we were ok, she said that we were completely fine and she was just really busy and without her phone. Then out of nowhere, she decided we were done.  

Her reason for it? School was starting back up later this month, and it 'wouldn't be fair' to be in a relationship. I even got the whole 'let's just be friends' spiel. (I know full well that I'll never see her again.) I was prepared to juggle school, a job, an internship, and her. I told her that I felt like I'd done something wrong, and she assured me that I hadn't, and doubled down on the whole 'it just won't work for me right now.' We haven't talked since then, and I know that I'll probably never talk to her again unless I do something unnecessary and reckless like reaching back out.  

Now I'm curious. I don't believe her, and honestly, I feel that I deserve to know why she ended things. I'm just not sure if I should prod, or if I should let well enough be well enough and be thankful that it was a clean breakup. I just feel like I let go too easily. Maybe I could also tell her that I really wished things would've ended differently."

Im working as a intern in a small firm (10 ppl) that does environmental simulations. I program some app for them. Recently i got asked to substitute my superior for some months and also do their IT. Sure, pay is good, and it will be a new interesting challenge. 

So my superior spends a week to hand over all the server data, passwords, mails, etc to me, talks me through stuff i have to do, we even start a trello board with weekly tasks, important server stuff. I also get a 20 page document that contains all the emergency procedures.

Im a bit overwhelmed, my major is on programming, im no sysadmin and i mainly use windows, not linux. But i can do it. I set up a raspberry pi at home to mirror the server setup (well, not exactly mirror, but i try to familiarize myself at home with all the backup procedures, etc)

Fast forward one week. My superior is gone, i prepared myself really hard. Time for some challenges! Here they come:

- Can i get a replacement mouse? -&gt; Yes.

- How do i print? -&gt; See that drop down list? Select a printer.

- Please reset my password. -&gt; No. You are writing it wrong. Its a small o, not a big O.

- We have no WLAN?! -&gt; Someone disconnected the router.

- Can you install word? -&gt; Sure.

- And my biggest dread: There is a modern coffe machine with a LCD monitor in the kitchen. For me its a ticking time-bomb. I just know it.

Totally not what i imagined my job to be. Well, ofcourse its great that the server works, but i dont feel that im doing IT.

4xk3rm,108,2016-08-13,Help needed for my niece. She was an intern at a newspaper for the summer and she was arrested and charged with trespassing for doing her job,trespasslegalhelp,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xk3rm/help_needed_for_my_niece_she_was_an_intern_at_a/,"She was charged with *California Penal Code Section 602* for trespassing. Basically it was a misunderstanding and she was just doing her job (she had an internship at a newspaper in our town for the summer)

What happened was that she was sent by her bosses at the newspaper to go and ask someone for an interview. The person had exposed corruption and bribery with people who worked from the town and was fired years earlier. Some of the people who were arrested in that case are getting out of jail now and the newspaper was interested in hearing from the exposer.

My niece went to the person's home and knocked on the door but the person wouldn't open the door. She told my niece to leave but when my niece called her boss at the newspaper the boss told her to keep trying so my niece knocked again. The person opened the door but wouldn't answer any questions and told her to leave but at the point the police showed up.

My niece was arrested because when the police officer asked her if she was asked to leave she did say yes but she was trying to explain that she was just doing her job. My niece was raised to be truthful and respectful to the police. She was arrested for trespassing. To add insult to injury the person who she was supposed to interview took pictures of my niece being arrested with her cell phone and posted them along with my niece's name on Facebook about how she was being harassed and continues to be harassed since she exposed the corruption. The police won't investigate our concern about my niece being slandered on Facebook.  

The person won't drop the charge. The prosecutor offered a deal where my niece would plead guilty and get a $250 fine but no jail. Her public defender told her to take it because she told the police she was asked to leave and because the doorbell camera on the front porch has audio where the person told my niece to leave four times and she was being recorded. My niece doesn't want a criminal record so her parents got her a paid criminal lawyer and he told them the same thing. They both said she could go to jail or pay $1000.00 if she has a trial.

This was all a misunderstanding. She's only 20 and has never been in trouble before and she still has two years of school left and a guilty plea means her losing her scholarship and a criminal record. Her bosses knew this person has never given and interview about what happened before and doesn't like reporters but they sent my niece anyways. What can we do here? Can my niece sue the homeowner for slander for posting pictures of her on Facebook without permission? Can her bosses be held liable? Sorry for all the questions but my niece needs help and I am going to do everything that I can for her."

I already tried searching to see if it's been asked/answered before but no dice.

Background: Young 20s college kid studying CS, right now working an internship making an iOS app for a local government agency.

Exactly what the title says, how do you get your mind off programming when it's time for bed? If I've been working on a project all day, when I lie in bed all I can see is lines of code fly across my eyelids. It's especially frustrating when I think of a solution to a problem I'd encountered and feel compelled to rocket out of bed to try it immediately because I know I won't remember it in the morning. 

I definitely try to disengage some couple hours before going to bed, but as a college kid there's just some nights where I'm up working until I physically can't keep my eyes open anymore. I feel like I'll pass out any second but just can't because my brain is stuck in developer mode. 

Sometimes it even sticks around across weekends or vacations! I'll be out with friends or even just chilling reading a book or gaming but my mind will suddenly kick back into programming mode and work on my project even though I'm not even physically in front of my workstation.  

I really really enjoy problem solving--that's what got me into CS in the first place--but sometimes I just want to disengage and do something completely unrelated...do you have any tips?"

Maybe it's because the success stories are the ones coming on here and sharing their good experiences while the unemployed and those who can't find a job are having a very rough time.

After going through so many threads on here of the CS grads talking about having side projects, good grades, internships, and still having a tough time finding a full time job at the entry level. So many stories of students applying through job boards and STILL being unable to get a job.

The reason I say this is because I have a friend who graduated with a biology degree and he cannot find a job in his degree. My friend has had an interest in CS recently and even started a second bachelors which he is not sure he will finish. Already, he has to pay 1k+ for his first semester where he will be taking his intro to CS class because the school has the bullshit ""mandatory fees"" nonsense and his area does not have any community colleges in it that offer CS classes.

Now if he manages to finish his second BS, he would have already spent 10k+ and the prospect of still not being able to find a job will be very depressing for him

Then you also read the stories here about all of the guys that went to bootcamp and were very employable afterwards and the ""high demand"" for people that can program or are competent in this.

Sometimes I wonder, is this sub painting way too optimistic outlook for the job market in the field?"

Meanwhile, I'm working on 2 part-time projects (unpaid), one locally and one in NYC, to hold off the unemployment day count, while looking for other opportunities within the area. Over the past 3-4 months, I had no luck. About 400+ job applications sent online but only a few calls for actual technical interview, most of which were unable to proceed due to USC/GCH requirement. Other kind of calls came from IT staffing firms which end up going nowhere as most of the recruiters were unaware of either my status or my actual years of technical experience. I want to keep trying, but my family fidgets and suggested me to relocate to San Jose where I will be living closer to my relatives and their supports. 

I've got a tough decision to make. 

My reasons of not to do it:

* Relocation seems risky since I don't know much about the job perspective for recent grad in San Jose, esp for those like me (I wonder if its going to be any different). 
* Google turned me down after an on-site interview earlier this year made me think that Sillicon Valley is only reserved for the most intelligents.
* Living expeneses there are probably higher than Dallas's as far as I understand. 
* Having to start making new friends and connections all over again (this will be my 3rd time doing this over the past 6 years)
 
Reasons to do it:

* Silicon Valley
* Family support, living closer to relatives
* Weather??

Please fill me in on this matter. I know if it's not much different from Dallas, I wouldn't want to move at all.

My mother and I moved to the United states when I was 5, we immigrated here illegally from El Salvador after we were denied a visa to enter the country. The main reason as to why we immigrated to the U.S. was because of the danger that we faced in the country, due to the death threats brought upon by the actions of my mom in reporting a crime that she witnessed. The period before my high school career has nothing of significance, I performed horribly in middle school and did not partake in any extracurriculars besides soccer. My Freshman year I was very unmotivated academically, due to that I performed poorly earning various B’s, this is what tanked my GPA. The following years my GPA saw an upward trend and since then I have not earned a grade lower than an A-. I also started to become more involved in extracurriculars after my freshman year.

Extracurriculars:
Technology Student Association (TSA): Founding member, served as vice president(2014-2015), president(2015-2016), and communications officer(2016-2017). 
First Robotics Competition (FRC): Co-Project manager: build team (2016-2017), as the co project manager I will be overseeing 4 separate teams responsible for building the robot. Before this position I served on the team for two years as part of the mechanical and electrical team. 

Internships:
Chemical Engineering: I’ve been working at the ChemE department for about a year, during my first 6-7 months here I aided my mentor in preparing materials for his classes and helped in his own personal research endeavours. In the last 3 months I’ve been working on a project that he assigned to me, it’s really close to completion. 
Molecular Biology (via a university sponsored research program): During the 8 weeks of the official program I was able to work in a lab researching a project assigned by the lab’s PI. At the end of the program a poster session was held and we were able to showcase our research. I will continue to work in the lab throughout the school year.

Senior project:
We are required to complete a senior project in order to graduate at my school, the project has to be approved by a board, mentored by a selected faculty member and presented towards the end of the year to a group of faculty.

In collaboration with the technology/engineering teachers and clubs at my school I will be launching a community outreach project. This project will be aimed at the children/ siblings of faculty and students ages 7-13. I will be teaching 4 classes in which the children will be introduced to the Arduino microcontroller, the final objective will be to create a small car from a kit of parts provided to the students. The kit of parts will include various electronics as well as an arduino microcontroller, I will fundraise the capital to purchase and create these kits. The last component of the project would be to create a website where I would upload videos and tutorials which cover more material than the class and have additional resources. My mentor and I hope that this program will become a legacy project for future students, I have high hopes for it and i'm working my ass off to make it a reality.

I'm going to start applying to full-time positions fairly soon, so I need to update my resume accordingly.

My questions:
1. Should I remove any information about my high school?
2. Should I keep my earlier work positions on my resume, even if they are not directly applicable? I was thinking of removing the descriptions, but just keeping the titles and locations. Example positions: cashier or receptionist.
3. Unrelated to resumes, but more so for my career, I did not have an internship this summer, but did last summer. I have been working all summer in a tech position (including 3D printing, PCs, etc.) with my time, however. Is this going to negatively impact my potential for employment, or would my internship last summer and current job (which I'm continuing throughout the year) kind of make up for no internship this summer? I was considering applying for Fall 2016 internships, but I don't know if my school schedule will allot me the time necessary for such a position.

 I feel so bad and nervous,I have one year to finish school but starting to think that maybe this is really not the accurate way for me. I know a person can learn anything with hard work, but I just cannot get this thing out of my mind since he was a really good programmer and he directly told that he doubts if I can ever become one.

My question is, has anyone faced with similar situation or dilemma before? What are your advices? "

I had to make a choice for my junior year internship between a very very prestigious quant firm and one of Facebook, Pinterest, Palantir. It was a hard choice and I ultimately chose FB/Pinterest/Palantir because I had worked at a trading firm the summer before and had never experienced a Silicon Valley tech firm. The quant firm respected my decision, but were disappointed that I didn't take their offer. 

Now that I'm looking for full-time jobs, I've realized that I want to do tech at a quant firm or prop shop instead of pure tech. As a result, I really want to reach out to the quant firm and ask to interview. How can I go about doing that? How can I convey to them that I want to go into their industry now instead of pure technology?

I just wanted to express my concerns and get some advice.

I'm a senior in Computer Engineering at big state school in the midwest. My gpa is kinda low, 2.97, so close to 3.0 if that even matters. Reason being is I'm not in the major I should have declared from the get go, but it's nearly impossible to transfer into CS at my school. I've interned two summers in a row at a fortune 500 as a software developer. I'm also working on a side project with a friend that recommends elective classes to students.

I just finished my second internship at the fortune 500, but I just don't feel happy with it. The people are great and everything and I know that the work I've done there is pretty standard intern work, it's still pretty meh. I'm at sort of a crossroads here as I was offered a position in full time, which I'm grateful for, but at the same time it's just not what I want. I could work at this place and I think I could accept it, but I really want to do software development out in California as I've wanted to live there for a very long time.

So what should I do? Suck it up and take the job I don't really want? Or go for a job in the location I'd like to be in? And for the later, how should I go about doing so? I'd very much like to hear from people that already work in the valley, but I'll read anyone who responds. Thanks in advance everyone :)



TL;DR: I want a job in California. I think I'm pretty avg, so how do I go about making myself an exception for recruiters?"

If it is not, I need a similar laptop. Things I do my computer:
1. Android Studio
2. Inkscape
3. 4-5 Ides like Eclipse, Visual Studio, Webstorm, etc
4. Unity Game Engine
5. Lots of web dev on chrome
6. Spotify/Netflix
7. Streaming hd vids
8. Taking good notes in class/recordings

I don't think I NEED touchscreen, but it has been useful. Battery life and portability are important, since I travel a lot. However, I used a Macbook pro for my internship, which was amazing, even though it was less portable than my windows machine.

Im kind of hoping that someone with said certs &amp; some experience might be able to get a working visa, but im not sure how in demand the job market is in the states for networking or AWS knowledge.

Should I retake the GRE and try to improve my quant score? I have heard many say that 163 is little on the lower side.

To give you a little background I've had a rough time in college to say the least. I'm a Computer Science major with a math minor. I started off living with another person in a dorm my freshmen year and we didn't get along that well. He smoked a lot of weed and drank and stuff and I didn't which caused some conflict between us. I didn't have any other friends my 1st year and was shy and stayed in my dorm most of the time, only leaving to get food.

My second year I moved into a dorm that was a single room and I've been in that room for up until now using a squatters right type of thing with my dorm contract. My second year is where shit really hit the fan, my grades sharply declined and I became depressed and it culminated in a suicide attempt and me ending up being checked into the ER. I still regret my decision to this day and wish I never did it because I know how much pain it still causes my family. I had to late withdraw from my spring classes because of my mental state

The third year didn't get much better. My fall semester I failed all my classes and got thrown on academic probation. I felt depressed as fuck again. I was able to pick myself up again Spring semester, but not by much. I barely passed all my classes and got off probation. Every assignment was a mountain to accomplish and every meeting with a TA or a Professor would always result in me crying and usually running off because I would be sobbing in front of other students and shit and it was awful. I'm still working on my issues with pills and therapy and I've been happier hanging out with old friends over the summer, but I dread going back to college because I don't know what to do.

I'm not in any clubs at my university. I've tried and looked for clubs, but nothing seemed to grasp my interest and whenever I thought about going somewhere I would chicken out and stay in my dorm room alone. I don't talk to anyone in any of my classes, they all have their groups of friends and are working together and talking and it's hard to introduce myself (especially if they've seen me crying at a TAs office hours).

I have horrible anxiety about my future too. Thanks to my mental breakdown and struggles I've wasted basically a year at college and driven myself into a hole of debt. I'm not going to graduate in 4 years which is humiliating since most of my friends managed to get the same degree I'm getting in 3 or 4 years and have high paying jobs. My GPA is completely shot which basically means I'll never get an internship anywhere and will hurt my future job prospects. Worst of all I'm really bad at programming. I get lost on core concepts and terms and just feel lost in class half the time. The textbooks they give us are dry as hell and it's hard to understand what the hell anything means.

I just really don't know what to do as a 4th year student. I'm not a freshman anymore which makes it awkward to introduce myself to anyone and I don't party really. I don't like to get drunk because they three times I've gotten drunk I've gotten into fights with people or made extremely inappropriate advances to women and it's embarrassing."

[I had this post some time back](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3vr2rh/a_new_job_offer_with_probation/) regarding my doubts with a new job offer and its weird probation (8 months) and 14% Bonus in total CTC / Pay.

Its been that time which I got my confirmation as permanent employee and it has been one heck of a ride.

However some points of note: 

* Whenever you are in a position when you are on probation or the likes, you will likely be treated as intern
* By intern, I mean, any night shifts or over-times or any L1 tasks would have to be done by basically you (which at once seems fine, just to learn the workings of workplace but for a continued stretch of 8 months becomes a bit tiring)
* That 14% of Salary bonus clause is only available on Financial year ends, so if I leave before Mar 31, there goes my 14% per month salary of each month over the time, in my case it would be 8 months. Get such stuff well sorted before moving to new job.

So I know that this has probably been posted a lot on this subreddit, but I just really need an outside perspective on my situation. I will try to keep this as short as I can.

I currently am working for a company that I have worked for since I was out of college (6 years, 7 including internship). I started out as an intern in IT, hired after graduation as a system administrator, promoted to business analyst, then senior business analyst/PM, and was just recently promoted to a lead BA position on our global SAP implementation. 

During this time, I have become recognized as a top contributor to our department and the CIO has taken an interest in my future. In discussions with him and where I want you get to in life (pretty much his position or executive IT level position), an MBA is really the best choice.  Now he is a big proponent of a full time MBA and thinks it is the best choice for getting myself out there, networking, and just an overall better education (we talked about me leaving and even though it would hurt him from a staffing perspective, he wants the best for my career).

This was my plan and I have been studying for the GMAT ever since. Because of this, other people started to notice that I have been studying (study at lunch) and have given their opinions. The 2 biggest are my current boss (senior director, pretty much go to guy of the CIO) and another director I have known from the first day I worked here and have a great relationship with.

Both of them feel that part time is the way to go.  As for their reasoning they both said the same quote almost word for word ""when I'm looking at applicants for a job, degrees are a plus, but work experience tell me more about your ability as an employee."" 

Another added thing to consider is my company will pay for 100% of the expenses to get my MBA. 

So this ended up getting wordier than I like so I'll stop here. The question I have is based off of this information and where I would like to end up, is part time or full time the best option? Even though I do enjoy my job and atmosphere I do not see myself staying here my whole life.  I feel I'm already at the top of where I could advance without additional schooling or experience and would also like to live somewhere else.

Anyway, that's my situation. If there are any other details that would be needed please let me know and I can provide them.


EDIT: Thanks everyone for all the responses! It is really giving me good insight. One question I wanted to add (which might be a dumb one) is if I would go part time, would that hurt my relationship with the CIO? From all the discussions I've had with him he has always been nice and we have talked about not just professional but personal stuff as well (go to lunch monthly just to catch up). He has been a bit of a mentor to me and I wouldn't want to lose that relationship."

I am currently 15 years old (soph in HS) and I think that I want to pursue a career in either finance, CS or some other branch of electrical engineering. I have not taken any of the programming classes that my school offers due to the fact that my course-load is already quite demanding, (3 APs). Last year I took my first PLTW course (DDP) and passed with flying colors. Since my schedule does not allow me to take any engineering courses I was wondering if I should take a CompTIA certification (probably the IT Fundamentals or A+) just to throw it on my resume. My school district is extraordinarily competitive and I feel that it might give me a slight edge when either applying for an internship next year, or applying to college in 2 years. I am a talented kid (humble brag) and have gotten very good test scores in math and science. (Practice ACT 32 and PSAT 1480). I am also fairly tech savvy. (built a few computers, basic python, etc.) What do you guys think? Also if you do recommend I take the course, how long do you think preparation will be, and what exactly will it entail? Thank you in advance!"

4xwg4t,1,2016-08-15,"Is this company run illegally, and what can be done about it?",throwawayforareasonk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4xwg4t/is_this_company_run_illegally_and_what_can_be/,"Hi guys, I'm using a throwaway account for this, as I don't want to give too much away about myself considering what I'm about to disclose. I won't use any names, and will not refer to specific nationalities, as this might make it obvious which company I am referring to.

I'm based in the UK, and started interning as a copywriter for a specific online streaming platform late last year. The films they specialise in are all from one country. Most of their internships run for three months, but recently they have made the internships 6 months in duration. They take interns from all over Europe, as well as locals. All internships are unpaid.

As my time there progressed, it seemed that there were certain things that did not add up. For example, many of the interns had to beg for weeks for any travel compensation. Some were travelling in from over two hours away. I lived down the street, so I wasn't affected. However, when the company moved to a new location, I had to pay for travel. No compensation has been offered.

When my three months were almost up, I told the owner I needed to finish and find a paid job. He said he didn't want to lose me, so offered to pay me. He would ""speak with his accountant"" and get back to me. A week went by. Nothing. Another week. I asked if he had spoken to his accountant, and he said it would not be feasible to pay me more than 300GBP per month for full-time hours. Of course, that's a ridiculous amount for an adult living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I said I would help out for one day a week while I looked for a job. He agreed.

I looked up some internship-related articles online. According to some sources, it is illegal for unpaid interns to do ""proper work"", and should instead do tasks that benefit the company on a small scale. However, this company is made up entirely of interns. The marketing team, the content writers, the admin, the video editors, everyone. They work their scheduled months, then are replaced by new recruits. The company is almost made up entirely of unpaid workers. 

I say almost, because there is one staff member who receives a salary of sorts. She works as a manager, and oversees the interns' work. For her 9-6, 5-6 days a week schedule, she is paid less than 15,000GBP a year through a PayPal account. Not through the bank.

Another thing I should mention is that this paid staff member recently suffered a nervous breakdown of sorts, no doubt frazzled by her stressful, low-paid job. She often took work home with her, and was required to do additional work on her days off. She took two weeks off to recover from her ordeal, and then found that she was paid less than half of her monthly wages because of her absence. When she confronted the founder about this, he tried to appeal to her emotions, saying that she ""made more than him"", as if he wanted her to feel sorry for him. He also pointed out that her position was ""self-employed"", and as such he did not need to pay her a regular salary for time taken off. To put it frankly, it sounds like manipulative bullshit.

There was another paid employee, who happened to come from the country the films were from. He worked in acquisitions, signing contracts with filmmakers. He was sent to work abroad in this country earlier in the year. Again, he was paid through PayPal. He regularly had to chase up his pay, and then found that he had not been paid at all for the previous month's work. Sick of all the bullshit, he quit the position.

Another detail - the company advertises its positions online under another foreign film organisation's name. This organisation happens to be a registered charity. It's a film festival company, and a separate organisation to the one the interns actually work for. I believe that this might be a way to cover the fact it's unpaid - if you can kid authorities that the interns are working for a charity company, you can wriggle out of the lack of compensation.

There are other details that I could add, but these are the main points. I feel like this company's founder is a bit of a manipulative scam artist, and taking advantage of people's desperation to boost their CVs. My question is - is this operation illegal, and if so, is there anyone who can be contacted about it? Would anyone even care enough to investigate?

TL;DR - is a shitty company run almost entirely by unpaid interns breaking the law, and what can be done?

4xyfka,59,2016-08-16,Story Time - Episode 3 - Wireless Mouse + Backup Exec = ???,IsaacJB1995,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4xyfka/story_time_episode_3_wireless_mouse_backup_exec/,"This story goes back to when I was an apprentice. We used to support many companies with a vast array of problems, whether it be something small like a password reset or even as far as hosting their website, and of course everything in between.

This one story begins on a regular day. Most of our contracts used old tape based backups and would simply have an admin intern swap the tapes each night before going home. However, one day the intern for a particular site was ill, so the Receptionist had to do it instead, She rang us up at about 4.30pm and asked how she did this. Now as an apprentice, I wasn't sure, so I asked my supervisor and he quickly showed me one we used to use years ago. I did a demonstration and I soon felt confident enough to talk her through it.

With Backup Exec, you load the tapes, perform an inventory so it reads the new tape that has been inserted and you leave the self-configured backup to run overnight. Sounds simple, right?

Well for this lady, it turned into a 3 HOUR phone call. That's right. Luckily the backup didn't start until about 10pm, but for something so simple, even by a user's perspective, that's bad.
Well the main reason it took so long was because of the following:

1. She was trying to plug a Wireless mouse into the computer for 30 minutes so she could use Backup Exec.

2. When she gave up and just used a nearby PS2 mouse (yes, this is an old story) , she then thought the wireless mouse was one of the tapes, so she tried inserting it into the reader.

3. After explaining that the tapes were on the shelf to her left as she walked in (several times), she eventually found a tape, however it was another previous day's tape. As those who have used Exec before, old tapes need to be manually wiped before reading new data, so obviously when she inserted it into the reader, it kept failing to read the blank data as data was already stored on it.

I asked her what date label was on the front and it clearly said the Tuesday (it was Thursday when we did this). I told her the blank tapes are next to the box of used tapes and she should use a blank tape. 

Eventually, she managed to insert the tape the right way round, I then decided to remote into the computer and performed an inventory and check everything over myself since she was clearly useless. I told her to go home as I could do the rest of the checks from this end.

Moral of the story is, as long as you're getting paid overtime, it doesn't matter how stupid the user is (probably a bad moral, but I couldn't think of a good one with a straight face)"

We went through everything together and were best friends for a long time. 

As we grew older our interests changed and we started to spend less time outside of school or training together. We now go to different universities in the same city and we see each other for training 2-3 times a week.

The thing is though, as of lately, I always end up feeling a bit worthless after we do something. He studies hard and has a good job, but my efforts always seem to pale in comparison to him. He never really seems to be happy for me and appreciate when good things happen to me, he only ever manages to see the bad side of things and make me feel bad anyway. I also study hard and had a really good internship that I should be proud of, but all that just seems like nothing. I usually are rather happy with myself but after we hang out for a bit I always feel like a loser. When we are around other friends, he always seems to be insulting me and make me feel bad (but that is of course just for fun he says). 

It has come so far that I don't really look forward to seeing him as I will feel bad afterwards. When I meet other friends I look forward to it and enjoy my time, but with him it always feels like I'm being yelled at like a child that can't do anything right. I always have to take the energy to think things through in order to be happy with my self. I just don't want to continue to use my time feeling sad instead of pursuing interests. 

Does he really want the best for me and just gives me constructive criticism or is this some sort of toxic friendship that I should cut off? 

I spend a lot of time thinking about this and I would like to know what you can tell me about the situation. 

Thanks,

UPDATE:
Had a talk with my friend today during lunch and explained the situation in pretty much the same way as I did. He said he only said those things in order to motivate me to do even better and was trying to be helpful.

He was sorry if he had gone a bit far, as he himself gets a lot of critique from parents and friends and was just trying to help me. 

We decided that I in the future will directly say when I think something hurts me more than helps me.

Hey everyone, hoping to get some advice about two offers I just received. For background, I am based in Toronto and have no formal education or experience related to graphic design. It has just been something I've always had an interest in and worked on during my free time, and only recently took it seriously as a career prospect.


I've been lucky to receive two offers despite my lack of formal training and experience, but I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on which one to accept.


The first offer is a 4-month contract position as an in-house designer for $3,333 a month (equal to $40k a year), which is way more than I expected for someone with my background for an entry-level job. It was originally going to be for 12 months, but they didn't want to overestimate how long they would need me for and changed it to 4 to be safe. That said, they did mention that if they still needed me after 4 months (they said they probably would, they just can't promise it) they would most likely extend my contract or hire me as a full-time employee. My only concern is that I would be the only designer there - essentially the marketing department (where the marketing manager would be my boss) have no clue about design and have straight up told me I would mostly be using pre-designed templates. 


I'm worried I won't be able to learn or improve my design skills at all, which means I'll have barely anything to add to my portfolio. (This company is also in the private finance sector so besides it having a more corporate culture, I may not even be allowed to include the work I do for them on my portfolio at all for legal reasons.) In addition, I won't have anyone in the office to turn to if I'm stuck or need some professional input.


The second offer is a 3-month internship at a small digital marketing startup that seems really cool, has great company culture as most startups do, and overall a great place to learn. They do have a creative/design team so I would definitely be able to learn a lot and develop my skills. Over half their interns have been hired as full-time employees so there's definitely a good chance for growth and career development if I choose to take this. However, they would be paying me $700/month and while money isn't a huge deal-breaker for me as an entry level candidate, I can't help but think of the massive paycheck difference compared to the other offer.

If anyone could offer their insights or give some helpful advice, I would really appreciate it. (Sorry for the huge chunk of text!!!) 

Thanks everyone!"

Homebrew was very useful, the hardware was incredible, didn't have to deal with annoying updates, and development was very enjoyable. 

Now that my Windows machine is kinda broken, I was thinking whether i should switch to a Mac. Thing is, I cannot afford a very expensive high end mac. Might be able to afford an Air though. Although I have done dev work on a mac, I have not worked with android studio there, nor have I worked with anything like Unity. Would these run well on a Macbook Air? Are there any more difficulties in developing on a mac?

I'm not sure if this is the wrong forum to ask this question, but I figured I should ask this question where most developers gather."

I have been working as a student assistant in web services for a little over two years where I spend 95% of the time copying and pasting html content. I have no other internship experience. I have a couple projects I worked on but nothing I think is worth mentioning to future employers. I even think my current job is not really worth mentioning...    

I would like to make a fully functioning game or Android app by next fall for my capstone project, but I find it intimidating despite how much I should know by now.

I have been working at another job before, during, and after this internship. However, I believe the accounting internship probably has stronger bullet points and is more relevant to my resume than my current work. This is not to say that my current work is not very relevant, I just think that the internship is a little stronger.

Linked below are my resume as well as the section that I have come up with for my accounting internship, and any suggestions as to where to put this experience would be greatly appreciated.

I interned at Microsoft this summer and received a full-time offer. Microsoft gives interns a two week deadline for these offers unless you attend a school that ""requires"" companies to follow NACE recruiting guidelines. This gives some interns until November 30th to decide (see: https://beam.stanford.edu/about-us/guidelines). A surprising amount of schools have this policy. My school simply ""recommends"" that companies follow them so I am only given two weeks.

This is the definition of an exploding offer and I've spoken with my recruiter many times about getting it extended. Microsoft recruiting will not budge, saying that ""we start recruiting right away and need to know our numbers come fall so we aren't recruiting for positions that do not exist"". This seems reasonable until you remember all of the interns that get special treatment because of the school they attend. For me, I live on the east side of the US, and two weeks to decide if I want to make a cross-country move to Seattle is too short for such a big decision. 

I worked really hard this summer so my manager is completely open to giving me more time to decide. She has expressed how much they want me to come back and has requested that I be given a longer deadline, but HR turned her down as well. 

I really enjoyed my time there. The people were awesome and my team was great. My hesitation to join is that the work did not interest me and it is very far from home. Because of this, I wanted to explore other companies and the possibility of someplace else being an even better fit. I don't want to make a decision I'll regret in a month, but recruiting is denying me that.

Any advice?"

I have been paying attention in every class, though, and am maintaining a 3.3 GPA.

My dad (network engineer) asked me a bunch of questions relating to IT, and I couldn't give him a solid response to any of them.  This truly opened my eyes to the fact that employers in this field do not care about your degree nearly as much as they care about actual knowledge.

I'm worried about not being able to find a job when I graduate next year due to a lack of experience. I'm starting my last year of college next week. I have one internship (manufacturing) under my belt, but it isn't all that related to my major (electrical engineering, emphasis in power systems). You'd think that electrical engineering has a ton of opportunities, but it really doesn't. I've been turned down from 6-7 internships in the past couple of months, 4 of which I've interviewed for, two of those were at the same company (different departments). I can't seem to find a common thread among them as to why I was turned down, other than a lack of experience (Catch 22 anyone?).

I'm still completely dependent on my parents. It's extremely embarrassing at my age (21). This has caused me to become very self conscious; I feel like everyone's judging me for not having a job. My girlfriend is very supportive and, for the time being, doesn't seem to mind my financial situation.

I would kind of like to change my major to computer science, but I just can't afford another ~2 years of school. I could learn independently, but that doesn't hold the same credibility as a degree.

I guess I just need some coping advice. I would ask for tips for landing a job but I don't think this is the right subreddit for that. I have days where I feel like I can do anything, and that everything will work out eventually. Then I have days where I can't focus on anything except the fact that I'm behind my peers. Everyone will be coming back to school fresh off of their internships, except me, and I'm terrified how I will be perceived by my classmates.

Anyway, thanks for reading my vent"

I've been working as a project manager for a fairly large project at a very large company and I'd just like to start by saying I've had absolutely no prior experience. When I applied for the job, I thought it was initially more tech related, coding, etc. But it seemed like they were running out of project managers and put me on a semi-large project that was a month behind schedule as the IT PM.

Now I was able to get the project through a couple of stages, but ultimately won't make go-live date due to several factors out of my control and just the sheer complexity of the project. Things such as countless vacations from my team, developer, business manager, etc, they all went on vacation practically leaving me alone to do alot of the requirements and also just the complexity of the technicals. The enterprise architect even has trouble finding a solution, and my program manager somehow expects me to be able to solve it (???). 

We're at the stage where we will now start development, but I was able to get the project through stages such as initial design and requirements and now I am going to hand it off to my manager in 2 days but he's now berating me about why things did not happen or why things happened the way it did. I tried explaining that people went on vacations, things were complex and no one was there to help me understand what to do very well but it doesn't seem like he understands the difficulties I had to face alone for this project. Constant no replies, etc, etc. He wasn't involved in the project until his manager told him to take over (and his manager is the current program manager for the project). 

He made me feel extremely shitty about myself even though I was able to take the project out of the gutter and get it all the way to development. But just unfortunate that peoples schedules didn't cohere but I was still to blame for the delays and why I didn't forsee these. I admit it was hard for me to navigate through nearly half my team being on vacation and just how complex it was, so I apologized to him and said it was something i now learned the hard way. He just seemed to brush it off and told me how its not ok to do this and that and now to learn from that. 

I just had a terrible experience receiving almost no help project managing a very complex project as an intern, yet other interns here were able to proudly say what they've done on their own projects which were substantially more simple than mine. It just makes me feel shitty and worthless. I've learned so much, but i feel as though there expectations of me, I just could not meet even though I tried my best. 

 I don't think I'll get a good evaluation, but I don't plan on working in this company again, would this somehow affect my future internship options or even possibly after graduation a job at other companies? I definitely do want to put this on my resume, but it makes me feel uneasy knowing I might get a bad evaluation and other companies would dig deep down."

This will make it easier to sort by the categories that interest you. Please provide some feedback regarding the proposed flair categories, color schemes, and your thoughts on whether this will be an improvement. The following is an initial list of categories:

* Case Study
* Startup Help
* How Do I ?
* Operations
* Internship Offers
* Best Practices
* How to Grow
* Feedback Please
* AMA
* Tools
* Investments
* Investor Wanted
* Other

Here's the color scheme http://imgur.com/a/3zza3 (which was borrowed from /r/askscience). Similarly we will have filterable tags on the sidebar, so you could display only certain categories. 

If you have thoughts on user flair, in addition to post flair, please provide those as well. I have tagged some of the top posts with flair to make it more apparent what it would look like. 

Also credit /u/BigSlowTarget for leading this effort.

Update 8/19/2016:

So so far it looks like the community:

* Doesn't support mandatory flair.
* Doesn't like the color schemes.
* Consensus is that there are too many categories.

I will be updating the flair to have 1 black and white color [Done]. 
We will not require flair on new posts. 
We will see how we can consolidate the list (for optional flair).

Coursework: AP Physics 1, AP Computer Science AB, Honors geometry, honors alg2, honors pre calc, and next semester, AP Lit, AP Stats, 1 unknown AP class.


Extracurriculars: 3 years varsity tennis, 3 years NHS member, 1.5 - 2 years paid software development internship at local company, ~40 hrs volunteering at local art museum (going to get some more hours in this year too).


School: UW Madison is my top choice, I think my application gives me a decent chance, but I can't help but feeling I'm teetering on the edge.  I do have legacy application or whatever it's called (Dad did undergrad at madison and Grandpa is a retired UW professor) if that makes any difference.

Failing UW Madison, I'm also interested in UW Seattle and maybe UBC but I haven't looked into that one too much.

Question: would you guys recommend that I do regular decision or would early action be good to go for?  I'm pretty excited to apply so I'm really tempted to go EA, but I feel like taking one more semester where I really kick it down for the last stretch would give my application a good boost (particularly in the GPA area).  If I do apply for EA and I get deferred and have to reapply at the RD deadline, does that hurt my chances more than if I just did RD?

4y4ru8,3,2016-08-17,"What's the best way to find a job in the development field in the US as a US citizen who grew up in the Philippines? Hoping to get an MA down the line as well, any advice there too?",NickFortuna,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4y4ru8/whats_the_best_way_to_find_a_job_in_the/,"Tl;dr: I have to leave home and lose my financial support by the end of November. I'm 23 and just about to finish my final college thesis in the Philippines. My goal is to get an MA related to development or Sociology, hopefully at a good western university. I was born in the US and have citizenship, but grew up in the Philippines and don't have much in the way of connections there, but I want to know if my best option might be to look there for work. Specific questions at the end of this post.

Long version: So after some recent family troubles, my parents and I agreed that it's best for me to move out of home, and they're cutting off financial support too. I'm not sure on the specifics of that but I'll just assume the worst and plan for no support at all. I'm 23, which might seem late to some of you, but it's actually pretty early here. People in the Philippines might not move out of home until they get married and some can rely on financial support for a while.

I kind of built my expectations around getting support. I want an MA related to development or Sociology or something like that, and was planning until after the MA to prioritize work that's more oriented towards others and looks good on a cv rather than something that necessarily pays well right away. I come from a top university here (Ateneo de Manila), but it's still from the Philippines, and I have dead average grades (about 2.7 out of 4). As far as I'm aware, I need good work experience (among other things) to make up for that if I want to get in to a good program abroad.

I realize that having a plan like that is a luxury and I'd be lying if I said that maintaining my privileged lifestyle isn't a motivator for me here, which I'm not too happy with. But if it helps, just think of it as me trying to do the best I can with the resources I have, in pursuit of my goals that I don't want to give up on, and hopefully motivated by a genuine concern for helping make the world a better place. 

I'm a US citizen but grew up in the Philippines. I have no idea how student loans there work, or what the job market is like. I've got some friends and family there, but no one in my field. I don't know if looking for work there or here is the better option for me. I'll be looking for work here, as well, though.

At the moment, I've got a potential internship lined up from before all this happened, at the office of the vice president which I know will work wonders for my growth and network, but there's not too much money in the job either, even for the people I know working there full time. I don't even know if it'll be a paid internship, since that wasn't my concern in inquiring about it at the time. Beyond that, if it even pushes through, I have no specific plans yet.

I decided late in college that what I wanted to do in life was some kind of development work, so I took development studies as a second degree after my first in business management, and pushed my self to a fifth year of undergraduate studies for it. I fell behind in that fifth year, failed to finish my thesis on time, and am now in my sixth, working on just finishing my thesis, which should be done by around September. Falling behind, along with some family problems at home, got me to seek out professional counseling, and then a psychiatrist, which led to me getting diagnosed with ADHD and getting the appropriate medicine/coping strategies for working with that. Each of those things were a massive help, both to my family situation and my academic performance, and things got better for a while, but here I am, with my parents wanting me out and a lot of emotional volatility all around.

I recognize that in the grand scheme of things, my situation's not that rough. I've got a degree with a second one incoming despite all my screw-ups, I grew up with my country's elites as schoolmates and friends so I was pretty much handed a great network through no merit of my own, and I had the space to focus on extra curricular work in college instead of worrying about earning for my tuition. But I'll put aside my pride and say I know I can still fuck this up. This sudden change in my situation throws a wrench in all my plans, so I'll take all the help that I can get.

Sorry if that's all a bit long and melodramatic, writing this up has also been a bit of a venting experience for me, but here are the key things I need advice on:

-finding work in the US

-financial considerations with moving to and living in the US

-saving up and paying for for an MA degree

-maximizing my chances of getting some sort of scholarship for an MA degree

Along the way, I'll have to worry about rent, food, transportation, utilities, medication for my ADHD, and hopefully have enough left over for some leisure.

I originally posted this on r/personalfinance and a mod suggested this sub might be a better fit. Seems about right to me but I'm not a regular here, so just let me know if this isn't the best place and I'll cooperate :)"

**How do I calculate the pressure inside the pipe at a given point?** I want to know what the pressure is, say, halfway through the line or at a point a few feet before the eductor. I know the length (1000 ft) and diameter of the pipe, the elevation difference between the top of the tank where the chemical is stored and the eductor, the viscosity, temperature, and density of the fluid and its flowrate through the pipe. I have tried using Bernoulli's Equation using the known changes in elevation and head losses I calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach eq. and the flowrate, but I get pressures close to (or even below) perfect vacuum, which doesn't seem right as liquid eductors shouldn't be able to pull vacuums that high.

I also made a professional LinkedIn profile that was reviewed by them as well, listing all of my skills and work experience, personal and school project descriptions.  They said my resume should be competitive and I should have no trouble finding a job.  But here I am.  

I'm keeping a spreadsheet of all the places I've applied, date of when, job title, a job description and what languages it used, any contact info received, last follow up, etc.   So far, since May, I have applied to about 100 positions at various companies and places around the area.  I don't feel like that is too many, or too few.  I usually do about 2-3 per day, but make a cover letter and tailor my resume to the specific position, and spend the time to research positions I actually have a good chance of getting.  Government jobs, small companies, medium companies, large companies, software companies, non-software companies, academia, and just regular old corporate programming jobs.  Web development, desktop development, and now even QA and application support type of roles.  Even roles that pay very low compared to the average for the area, at undesirable companies that get 2 stars on Glassdoor.  Contract, contract-to-hire, and full time.  Just anything to get my foot in the door.  Not limiting myself to any one industry or only targeting ""name brand"" companies.  Not being picky at all.  

My question is, how and where else should I be looking for jobs?  How should I be finding companies that are hiring?  It feels like I'm not looking in the right places. "

I graduated last December with a B.A. in economics from a pretty ok school, rankings wise. So during my job search, I've been pretty much stalking this one company for the past 2 (almost 3 months now) that I reallllllyyyyyyy want to work at (because I admire their mission, the service they provide, their innovation, company culture, they have extremely good reviews on glassdoor, etc.). I applied about two weeks ago for the data analyst position on their website, thinking that my cover and resume were pretty kick-ass at the time. Now, reading both of them over, they kind of seem mediocre to me now and I'm cringing but oh well, I can't do anything about that, already sent it in. I did make a point to express my enthusiasum and admiration (nothing too dramatic though) for the company in my cover letter so I'm kind of hoping I get some brownie points there.

Anyway, the point is, one of my old internship supervisors is connected with the CEO on LinkedIn, and someone who worked at the company I used to intern at now works at this company I want to work at (although I didn't speak to him much since we were in different departments, I'm fairly certain he would recognize me as we all met during the sales conferences. I've thought about cold-emailing him but I don't know if that's appropriate). 

So how can  or should I utilize my connections to get my foot in the door? I know for sure they are hiring, and I know it's kind of premature to do anything right now since it's only been two weeks. They did post a listing for another data-related position a few days ago but I'm not sure if I should apply for that as well with a better resume/cover letter? It's a small company, with less than 100 employees I think if that helps. And also, I share connections with several of the employees on LinkedIn as well.

What do you think? I really want to work here and don't want to screw up my chances. I know I shouldn't be too invested in one company and should broaden my horizons, but I really do think I might have a good shot here. I do have data-related experience to back it up and have been studying SQL, SAS, and Excel these past few months as well. 

I would appreciate any advice. "

I have only taken basic CS classes using Python &amp; Java, I have made a game in python and can navigate/use the terminal pretty well.

Refereeing Soccer - 4 Years  
Managing E-Mails/Invoices for my Dad’s Small Business - 2 years

Since my only jobs haven’t required a resume or CV, I still haven’t made one yet.

Luckily I am a bit outgoing, I am able to walk up and start a conversation at random. I just don’t know exactly how to say “Hey!

A lot of them - during initial interest conversations - will ask me ""what kind of work do you see yourself doing?""

And I honestly have no answer.  It's not so much that I don't know what I want to do - I enjoy computer science and I enjoy the process of solving problems and creating solutions to said problems - but I honestly have no idea what kind of field within computer science I would like to focus on. I've only interned twice during my college career, both times at the same company, and both internships kind of had me doing similar things (one year I developed an Android app, the other year I was working within the company's app store) which is all well and good - I learned a lot - but I don't see myself wanting to do those things forever, y'know?

I'm coming to you all because as I proceed further along in school, no doubt a lot of other companies will be contacting me, and presuming I get multiple offers, I haven't really figured out *what* I want to do, so I'm unsure on how to narrow down what companies I should be focusing on."

I'm looking between the P50 and the Y7000 - here are my needs


* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
~ $1000, USA

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I would like OKAY battery life. This is meant to be a desktop replacement that I can also take to class (hence considering the P50 mobile workstation, but most of the time all the heavy stuff I'll be doing is when I'm at home connected to a charger. 

* **How important is weight to you?**
I don't mind carrying around ~5 lbs, my current HP is 5.62 pounds. I would prefer smaller but I'm used to it. More important to me is that it isn't bulky.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
15.6

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.**  I'll be using this for school-related stuff (some SQL) and gaming.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  My current computer is so bad that I have to run GTA at a windowed center of the screen resolution and I still barely get 30 FPS. I want 60 FPS on GTA V and playable FPS on Overwatch and any other game that's come out within the last 2 years (Witcher 3 in particular), NBA 2K16/7, CSGO and the like. 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** HP build quality is trash, and I want no more repeats of my current laptop **literally** falling apart by itself. I want good quality, maybe even business-grade which is why I'm considering the P50. Good backlit keyboard and trackpad (my current one stopped left clicking), touch screen and fingerprints are plusses since I have both of those on my current laptop.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** Feel free to suggest anything non-Lenovo as long as the price would be lower than what I'd get with the discount. I would save around ~$200 after discount assuming customization. Waiting for new laptops next year isn't really ideal because I won't have a discount in a month. I would like at least 500GB HDD with 1TB preferred and some form of SSD.

Looking for any insight on the M2000M vs the GTX 960M, RAM suggestions (at least 8), HDD/SDD upgrade suggestions etc. Also, something that doesn't overheat would be preferable.

Thanks in advance!"

4y9a5j,2,2016-08-17,Legal Advice For this Renting Predicament--Frustrated,yvnsky,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4y9a5j/legal_advice_for_this_renting/,"I moved to a new city for half a year for an internship so I needed temporary housing. I found a nice Catholic Housing Establishment with affordable rent. I was in saw a rush to settle in and get started on the first week of my internship that I never received my lease. The nice lady at the office said she would put it in my mailbox. Even though I knew that when a lease is signed, you should receive it right away, I thought to myself that I could trust a Catholic establishment that is there to help immigrants and students. I never had a problem until.... new management came. When I signed the lease (that I never received) with the first management company, I had first worked with an agent. I was told that in order to book a room there I needed to first go through the agent however, she would discount me my first month to make up the difference of what I had to pay the agent. I wrote her a check from the first discounted month and a month of security deposit. The establishment is a place for temporary guests--although it doesn't cap a maximum stay. THe lease stated that I would be paying ""month to month"" and to give them a two week notice before moving out so that they could grant me my security deposit before my leave. I was happy with the way of functioning and had no fears. I felt that I was saving and I was very happy. When the new management took over, I was told that I had underpaid in my first check. I had explained to her that my first month was discounted due to me working work the agent and that it was formality for me to work with her. She immediately told me that they no longer worked with the placement agency and told me that I would need to pay the difference back which I agreed to out of fear and not wanting to deal with conflict. It wasn't much so I agreed. She had a strange way of making you feel very uncomfortable. She also told me that no one in the building had given their last months rent , including me, and that I would need to provide that as well. I gave her a shocked look and told her that I would need to check my finances and that it was impossible for me to provide that right away. She told me that for now, she was ok with the difference that I owed and that she would be expecting the last month  at the start of the month on top of that month as well. I left. I realized later that she was also charging me a different rate for my room than what was agreed upon in the lease (that I never received). In the establishment's guidebook, my room was rated at 775, however, when working with the agent, she said it was 725. I didn't mind paying the difference because I felt lucky getting such nice rent but am realizing now that there are a lot of things wrong here.


1. I never received a formal lease--although I do have proof with the agent that I would be renting at the establishment and the contracted 725 a month. 
2. I was given a different rate by the new management that was higher. Which rate should I be paying? The one listed in the guidebook or the one I was originally quoted and signed for? 
3. The new management is threatening ""legal action"" saying that it is ""federal law"" that all paperwork is filled out--meaning a new lease delineating a specific amount of rent vs. the original temp housing policy of month to month--and providing ALSO a last month's amount, which was never asked of us in the first place and is never listed on their website that is linked to the Catholic charity. 


What would you suggest I do on all 3 accounts? How is it best to handle this? Should I:
a. give them what they want and fear that they will be very difficult to deal with when it comes to exiting--aka being tricky with the security deposit etc. 
b. pay what was originally intended and refuse to sign the new lease. Leave my last month without paying and have the security deposit take care of that (is that legal?) I am held to anything since I don't even have a lease? And if so, the original lease stands--only anything that my signature is on stands, correct? Can they truly throw me out if I don't sign this new lease? I would hate to be thrown out, that's would be very very unfavorable. 

Any advice or understanding you have on legal matters when it comes to rentals, I would truly appreciate. Thank you"

However, I am not planning on pursuing a CPA, so I am limited me to advisory roles... and even within advisory, I understand that certain things like Deal Advisory (which I believe would fall more along my interests) look for a CPA too.

I switched major and was doing terrible in my previous one. 

This may be shallow but I want to work at a notable tech company, e.g. Microsoft/FB/Google/Amazon/Twitter/Apple/Nvidia/etc. I know definitely my GPA is not an issue to get a good job SOMEWHERE, but I really want to work at a notable tech company.

I heard some of these tech companies are not as strict, but I get the feeling that a lot of them still care. I'm guessing HR recruiters got to start somewhere, and GPA at the end of the day is an easy metric to start their hunt. 

Reading older post, one remedy is on my resume I can report both GPAs. But some companies require you to report one GPA through their application, and when they ask that I'm pretty sure they want cumulative. So if at that point they already written me off due to low GPA, they may not even get to my resume where I they can see I actually have decent major GPA and experience. :(

A bit more context, I had 4 software internships, 3 of them at notable aerospace companies. Also have a github with many small programs, scripts, and a few apps. 2 local hackatons, did not win. I think everything aside from my GPA is pretty stellar, and if I was invited to an interview I'm pretty confident I'll do well. But I need to know realistically if I'm going to get screwed by my cumulative GPA to a point of not even being invited to an interview.

If any of yall have experience or know anything, how's it like as a new grad with a low-ish cumulative GPA at a fancy tech company?

Here’s my resume :

Finished high school in France when i was 19, in 2008 (i was one year late, no biggie i guess)

2008-2010 : i had several jobs : assembling computers for gamers, working for an asset management company for a couple months, working for a wedding magazine

2010-2013 : bachelor degree

2013-2014 :took a year off, 4 months to travel in thailand (i had family there back then, and i wanted to travel a little), and some time to prepare for the BS's competitive exam when i went back to france.

September 2014-november 2016 : master’s degree in a good business school (at least in France. I had to prepare for weeks in a preparatory school), during which i had a 6 months internship in Bangkok, as a ""business analyst"", for a big company.

Now here’s the issue i have : I’m finishing my education this november, maybe december, and i’ll only get my degree next year. If i want to, i can take another internship until june 2017 (it’s called an « internship year » i believe) and it won’t change anything, i’ll receive my degree in 2017 anyways. What should i put in my resume if i finish my education at the end of the year, that i graduated in november/december 2016 right ? (a lot of people told me to do that) It doesn’t matter when i get the degree as long as i finish in time? And what about the option to make it a 3 year masters degree (with another internship), will employers be afraid of my age ? (if i finish my education in november, i’ll be 27 years old, but i’ll almost be 28 (born in the end of august) if i finish it in june 2017)

Honestly, do you think i’d be fine in both cases, 27 or 28 yo, since people can graduate with masters at 23 in France, just like in England i believe? (it’s not a majority though, but people tend to graduate early in France, 25 is probably the average with masters in business schools)

Thank you very much

nb : as you can see, i didn't have a job, apart from my 6 months internship since 2010 when i was a student, as i wanted to enjoy being a student (universities are almost free in France, although you have to pay for business schools)

My situation is: I graduated last December with a B.A. in economics from a pretty ok school, rankings wise. So during my job search, I've been pretty much stalking this one company for the past 2 (almost 3 months now) that I reallllllyyyyyyy want to work at (because I admire their mission, the service they provide, their innovation, company culture, they have extremely good reviews on glassdoor, etc.). I applied about two weeks ago for the data analyst position on their website, thinking that my cover and resume were pretty kick-ass at the time. Now, reading both of them over, they kind of seem mediocre to me now and I'm cringing but oh well, I can't do anything about that, already sent it in. I did make a point to express my enthusiasm and admiration (nothing too dramatic though) for the company in my cover letter so I'm kind of hoping I get some brownie points there.

Anyway, the point is, one of my old internship supervisors is connected with the CEO on LinkedIn, and someone who worked at the company I used to intern at now works at this company I want to work at (although I didn't speak to him much since we were in different departments, I'm fairly certain he would recognize me as we all met during the sales conferences. I've thought about cold-emailing him but I don't know if that's appropriate).

So how can or should I utilize my connections to get my foot in the door? I know for sure they are hiring, and I know it's kind of premature to do anything right now since it's only been two weeks. They did post a listing for another data-related position a few days ago but I'm not sure if I should apply for that as well with a better resume/cover letter? It's a small company, with less than 100 employees I think if that helps. And also, I share connections with several of the employees on LinkedIn as well.

What do you think? I really want to work here and don't want to screw up my chances. I know I shouldn't be too invested in one company and should broaden my horizons, but I really do think I might have a good shot here. I do have data-related experience to back it up and have been studying SQL, SAS, and Excel these past few months as well.

So, here's my dilemma. I am at Penn State (not main) doing a Information Sciences and Technology bachelor degree program. I will graduate in May, maybe.

My GPA is terrible. It was below a 2.0 and I finally got it past that. I'm not going to give the reasons why it happened; I don't want to make excuses.

Anyway, I need an internship to graduate. I'm worried for two reasons: 1) This isn't a traditional CS degree and 2) that's a terrible GPA.

Does anyone have any tips for making sure I get an internship besides 1) applying everywhere and 2) not putting my GPA on my resume?

Also, what about when I do graduate? I know many employers don't ask about GPA, but is there anything I can do to make myself look better?

I have one project that I feel is good enough for my resume that will be completed by the end of this year and I feel it's a fairly large project using a couple different technologies, but I'm worried that won't be enough.

Any tips?

Thanks all."

I'm currently a rising third year in UC Berkeley, majoring in Molecular Biology and Computer Science. 

I'm very concerned with my GPA in regards to grad school. Taking classes for both majors have made it hard for me to maintain high grades. I'm guessing that I'll be around a B+ to A- average, which is enough to make the minimum threshold but not enough to be very competitive. 

I've been working in a lab since my first year (and am starting a more independent project now); I briefly worked on a project in another lab that I'm still lightly involved in. I'm also TA-ing a CS course, and hoping to get an internship next summer. 

I guess my question is, what can I do to improve my chances of getting into graduate school (I have 2.5 more years of undergrad)? Would it be advisable to drop one of the majors to ensure higher grades? I'm also wondering if schools will take into account the slight GPA deflation in Berkeley. I'm looking to apply to a neurobiology program, although I hope to explore what CS research is like before I graduate.

I'd appreciate any advice I can get; thanks in advance for the help!"

I am entering my 3rd year at this school and will be looking for internships this summer as it will be my last summer before graduating so its my last chance to get an internship. I have none up to this point.

I want to return home to the bay area after graduating but i feel like i wont get a job here. The competition is insane in the bay area. Nearly every CS person wants to come here because it is the tech capital so there are tons of people from all over the world fighting for these jobs.

How much is having a bad school on my resume going to hurt me when i apply for these bay area jobs? Will being a local applicant help me out in any way? For example, the other day i saw a VMWare software engineering internship that required students to be pursuing a degree from a top tier university. 

My GPA is not great so if i want to transfer i could only get in to an average out of state school but would at least be more well known. Something like University of Nevada Reno, University of Arizona, Arizona State University. Would it be worth paying out of state tuition for these schools if they at least give me a more well known school name?

My goal after graduation is to just find a decent job here in the bay area. Decent job as in market rate salary and preferable a nice work environment. Is it possible? Or are my opportunities going to be limited because of my bad school name?

Thanks guys."
4yet8e,2,2016-08-18,22 year old grad student considering a complete career switch. What are my options and how can I manage the risk/fear?,cheesy_accountant,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4yet8e/22_year_old_grad_student_considering_a_complete/,"Hi /r/careerguidance, 

I'm 22 years old and I just started grad school to get my masters of accountancy. A little bit of background: I've never really known what I wanted to do in life, so when I was in college, I took some accounting courses and decided to major in accounting and finance. I interned at a firm for two summers and enjoyed it because the people were great, but I didn't really enjoy the work at all. At the end of the second internship, I ended up accepting a job offer that I would take once I finished grad school. Towards the end of my undergrad, I realized that I was just doing accounting because it was pretty easy for me, and not because I had any passion for the work. I had somewhat of a breakdown over the summer because I really have no desire to get my CPA and work in public accounting. I feel like I've just been taking the easy road because I'm afraid of failing or being a disappointment. After talking to my parents, they were eventually supportive of me foregoing grad school and trying something different as long as I had a plan. I spent a few weeks trying to figure out my options, but everything seemed so risky compared to my current path, so I decided to just bite the bullet and start grad school anyways. Unfortunately, I still feel terrible about my decision and it's making it hard for me to motivate myself to work hard in my classes AND try and figure out other career paths that I can take. Everyone in my classes knows that they want to be in accounting and I feel so out of place, but I just don't know what else to do. I'm worried that if I keep going down this path, I'll get comfortably unhappy and never try something else.

So I guess my question is, what do I do? I've started a free computer science course, and so far it's really interesting, but I don't know how viable a career in something like software development is for me at this point since I don't know much about it or whether I'm even good at it. If you guys have any suggestions for potential career paths or general life advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

4yfenv,1,2016-08-18,I need your opinions on a career change into IT,aymekae,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4yfenv/i_need_your_opinions_on_a_career_change_into_it/,"I'm a 31 year old female, married with 1 child, and I have a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I've always been drawn to technology, and literally spend most of my waking hours on a computer. I was valedictorian of my high school, and graduated cum laude from college. However, most of college and early adulthood I dealt with undiagnosed depression and anxiety, and I think it has stifled my career. 
I've spent the past 9 years as a bookkeeper for a law firm, a budget support specialist for NASA, and now an office coordinator for an engineering program. I've loved and hated all my jobs. Now that I am treated for my medical conditions, I am bored and work holds no challenge for me. I have no real career path as a glorified administrative support specialist, and I hate that I make $34k a year with no real prospects to increase that, even after years of experience. Living in California, I haven't gone back to school because public universities don't accept post-bacc students, and I can't afford private options. However, I am about to move to St. George, UT, which has several computer science/information technology degrees at Dixie State University. I might even become employed there, in which tuition is waived. Even if not, we have enough in savings to cover the costs of getting a second Bachelor's degree (except for the lost wages if I go back full-time, so I'd be hoping to get a paid internship).

All that said... I'm trying to narrow down my focus based on my talents, personality, and temperament, but it's hard to make those decisions having never been trained in IT. I'm hoping I can tell you a little about myself, and you can offer some pros and cons for different IT positions.

My Myers Briggs Type Indicator is very strongly ISTJ. Here is a brief description:

ISTJs respect facts. They hold a tremendous store of data within themselves, gathered through their Sensing function. STJs often work for long periods, devoting their energy to tasks that they see as important to fulfilling a goal. They prefer to work alone but can work well in teams when the situation demands it. ISTJs are capable, logical, reasonable, and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful living.

I also have the following top 5 talents (as assessed by Gallup's Strengths Finder):

* Harmony - People exceptionally talented in the Harmony theme look for consensus. They don’t enjoy conflict; rather, they seek areas of agreement.
* Analytical - People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They
have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.
* Discipline - People exceptionally talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create.
* Input - People exceptionally talented in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.
* Consistency - People exceptionally talented in the Consistency theme are keenly aware of the need to
treat people the same. They try to treat everyone with equality by setting up clear rules and adhering to them.

Basically, I prefer to work alone, but can work well with others. Too much people time drains my energy. I like to minimize conflict and work with drama-free people who don't waste lots of time with small talk. I'm an itinerant rule-follower; I prefer lists, structure, and logic. I like to work with details and organize complex data, especially when it comes to identifying and solving problems. (In my jobs, I liked tracking down billing issues and solving or explaining them, identifying Excel errors, making lists/databases consistent and error-free, etc.) I'd rather work for someone than be the boss, or be my own boss, but I don't mind being in charge of a project or supervising a few people as long as I have the resources to do the job well. I would love to telecommute some or all of the time.

I think I might do well as a programmer. Are there other IT jobs I might be well-suited for? Thanks in advance for your time."
4yfesg,3,2016-08-18,Intern that failed out of school before starting the position.,Liar_Liar_Intern,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4yfesg/intern_that_failed_out_of_school_before_starting/,"Alright, I am a 21 year old who has been working as an Intern with nameless mid size company for the last two months. Internship lasts 6. I went through the interview process and was accepted last fall to be one of three interns for this summer through December. It's a very competitive position, myself and three others were chosen out of 120 others from my school alone. I know someone that works there as well which very likely helped; but I still aced all the interviews and had a great ""click"" with everyone that was part of the process. 

So, I accepted the position last fall but ended up failing all my classes that fall due to anxiety and depression. As it stands I'm 3 years through the degree and have 2 to go. The company has no idea I'm not in school anymore, my parents don't, my girlfriend doesn't, no one. I failed out once before because of depression and anxiety but was able to reapply myself to school and get back in, only to fail for the same reasons. I neglected to get help because I thought I could manage it better this time, and by the time I knew it was too late I was too depressed and afraid to ask for help. 

When people ask where I go to school I still tell them the college, and that I have some time left. Because I've taken many of the core classes, I've been able to do really well thus far and no one has questioned my abilities the slightest. My internship is set up so that I go to a different department every 2 weeks, getting loads of experience in every aspect of the manufacturing of our products. Very few people will have the level of knowledge I will have of every part of the production process by the time I'm through, making myself a valuable investment in the company's eyes.

Though I know you're all going to tell me to tell the company as soon as possible, the reasons I haven't so far: I've been just as successful as anyone could expect through my internship so far, needing little guidance on almost all tasks. I will have and already have more knowledge than most people who work at the company about all our processes, ensuring I won't be outed for lack of capability. As I said above, I accepted the position last October. It has been 9 months and they haven't found out yet, and this company has extremely strong and close ties with my college. It seems unlikely to me that they will find out if they haven't already. 

I am looking for advice on what will be best for my long term future. The way I see it, I certainly stand a good chance to get away with it, land a full time job (i have standing offers from two departments so far) and simply never have it known that I failed out of school. Medium risk, high reward. If I make it known now, when I've had months to tell them before I even started, I'll probably just be fired. 

Yes, I know it's unfair as fuck to everyone else, and I'm a terrible person for all of this. Thank you "

4yg8df,37,2016-08-18,Sweet Elizabeth.,ByThePowerOfMetalNya,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4yg8df/sweet_elizabeth/,"I used to work in a nursing home for the mentally disturbed and the elderly. What I am about to tell you is the reason why I quit my job.

When I first came into the home it was relatively small and quiet. There were four staff members including myself. There were the head nurse, Lana, the intern nurse Lizzie and Joshley the janitor. Joshley was not exactly qualified to take care of the patients, but he had been around longer than any of us, so he knew the ropes pretty well. Hell, I learned most of the things I needed to know from him.

The ward I worked at only housed three people at the time. 

One of the patients was a sweet, blind lady called Ms Bentham. When I first spoke to her I noticed that mentally she was still fine, but her blindness in combination with her age had sadly rendered her incapable of taking care of herself. She was great fun to hang out with. To other visitors she was always polite and friendly, but when I was around she would tell the raunchiest jokes and jokingly yell things at me like “where is my bloody coffee, you twat?!”

 She told the most amazing stories about far journeys she had gone on with her children and grandchildren and about how she used to be a grandmaster of chess. I jokingly responded that she’d probably still whoop my arse despite her inability to see. She immediately sprung up from her chair and grinningly said: “You’re on.” And lo and behold, I was right. She beat me three times in a row. She could feel which pieces were which and she only needed to touch all of the pieces once at the start of the game and after that she just remembered where everything was. I would call out my move, then she would call out hers and I would move the piece for her. I even cheated the third time, just to see if she would notice. “Knight to B3,” I said. “Check.” “You’re lying, you sneaky bastard. Your knight was on H7 three turns ago and it hasn’t moved since, so I couldn’t have gotten to B3 even if God had wanted it to.”


Then there was Mr Worrick. He was a grey-haired, cleanly-shaven old man who wore small, round glasses that were pressed tightly onto his crooked nose. He suffered from dementia and was almost always sitting quietly in his room or in his wheelchair rubbing his thin hands together. He was very shy and every time someone approached him he would immediately stop rubbing his hands and fold his arms across his chest. He was nice enough to me though. He hardly ever spoke a word to the others but I would still get the occasional “thank you, dear” after giving him his meal or his tea. Nurse Lana said he must have been a soldier because his quivering hands were a clear indication of PTSD. I could not imagine how damaged he really was behind that sheepish look of his. 

Finally there was Whisky. Whisky was a 2 metre tall behemoth of a man with hands as big as spades and a jawline big and heavy enough to crush walnuts with. His real name was Harold Burns, but he was called Whisky because that was the only word that was left in his vocabulary. He had taken to alcoholism after his son had passed away under mysterious circumstances at the age of three and the grief and copious amounts of whisky had taken their toll on his brain. Whisky always frightened Lizzie and me a bit. He was really loud and cranky and would unexpectedly yell “WHISKY! WHISKY!” every time we walked by. A glass of his favourite brand would usually calm him down for a few hours. The doctors strongly advised against pouring more alcohol into his old body, but we figured it was the last shred of enjoyment he was getting out of his short time on this Earth. Sometimes we’d tell him he’d had enough booze for the day and then he would get really upset. He’d start shouting more erratically and he’d occasionally lash out or throw a punch at us when we got too close. Lizzie and I were uncomfortable going near him but Nurse Lana did not seem to mind his temper. She’d just put her arms in her sides and sternly tell him: “Now Harold Burns! That’s no way to treat a lady, is it?” Miraculously that would usually settle him down. He even seemed somewhat intimidated by her.

Things usually ran like clockwork under Nurse Lana’s watch. Technically I had the proper qualifications to run the ward together with Lizzie without Lana’s supervision, but her advice, confidence and her Whisky-compelling powers made me feel more at ease during my shifts.  I could handle things pretty well on my own, but as is to be expected with mentally unstable folk like these sometimes the patients would act out more violently than usual.

This one instance when Nurse Lana wasn’t around due to illness, I ran the ward together with Lizzie and some greatly appreciated assistance from Joshley. Whisky was being really obnoxious that day. He was constantly walking up to me and nudging me with his elbow. He would jerk Lizzie’s and Mr Worrick’s arms and blurt out shouts very franticly. He’d even make his hand into a fist and would make stabbing motions towards Mr Worrick. Whisky’s behaviour really seemed bother Mr Worrick but he seemed more annoyed than concerned. Mr Worrick kept staring at Whisky with a very stern frown and with his arms tightly folded across his chest.

It was just after lunchtime, so Ms Bentham had to take her medications. I went to grab her prescribed pills in the medicine cabinet and I left Lizzie alone with the patients for a short moment. I was rifling through the cabinet when I heard Lizzie exclaim a loud, panicked yelp, followed by a clattering noise. I rushed back into the dining room to find Whisky and Mr Worrick on the floor and Lizzie bent over clutching her ankle.  I asked her what had happened and she said that she felt Mr Worrick’s wheelchair bump into her foot and then all of the sudden it tipped over and Mr Worrick and Whisky were both flat on the floor.

Whisky was furiously pointing at Mr Worrick and kept yelling “WHISKY! WHISKY! WHISKY!”  Mr Worrick was none too pleased with what had just transpired, and yelled all sorts of profanities at Whisky. “DEMON! SPAWN OF SATAN! HOW DARE YOU LAY FINGERS ON ME! POOR ME!” he shouted. Whisky got even more frustrated and kept pointing and waving his hands at him. I was trying to get Whisky to settle down when I noticed the bloodstain on Mr Worrick’s side. The poor sod had probably cut himself on his wheelchair when he fell over. My calmness turned into anger and I reprimanded Whisky for pushing over Mr Worrick. “That is no way of treating your fellow patients, is it now, Harold Burns?!” Whisky looked at me with a startled look on his face, then sat on the floor and started crying. ‘’Whi...whisky…whisky…whi…sky…sky” he sobbed all while continuously pointing at Mr Worrick. 

Meanwhile Lizzie had managed to get Mr Worrick to settle down and had gotten him back into his wheelchair. “Are you alright, Elizabeth?” Ms Bentham asked. She must have had heard Lizzie’s scream when Mr Worrick’s wheelchair crashed into her. “Yeah I’m fine. My ankle is only a bit bruised.” All of the sudden Mr Worrick started thrashing about in an attempt to break free from Lizzie’s grip. “Let me go, you harlot! I don’t know you! You cannot trick me! You’re not real! NOT REAL!” 

Lizzie could not restrain him any longer and quickly jumped backwards to avoid getting hit by Mr Worrick’s flailing arms. I tried to hold him down but he was deceptively strong and he pushed me to the floor with minimal effort. I quickly called over Joshley and asked him to restrain Mr Worrick and get him patched up. Mr Worrick was no match for big ole Joshley and once he realised this he stopped resisting and fell back into his chair with a defeated and displeased look on his face. “C’mon Mr Worrick! Let’s get you fixed up and then poor some nice hot coffee into ya!” Joshley said. He quickly wheeled Mr Worrick out of the room and Lizzie and I picked up Whisky from the floor and set him down on the sofa. Lizzie quickly poured him a drink and pressed it into his big, shaking hands. ”How’s your ankle?” I asked her.  “It will probably get a bit swollen but I think it’ll be fine. I’m more worried about the patients.” Lizzie said. “I just can’t wrap my head around it. Why did Whisky act so strangely today? He’s never laid a finger on any of the other patients and all of the sudden he decides to pester Worrick and even push him over.” It baffled me as well, but what baffled me even more was that I had never in my time at this ward heard Mr Worrick speak a single word to another patient before, let alone shout curses at them.

That night everything gave the impression like the incident had never happened. Mr Worrick and Whisky were sitting side by side at the dinner table eagerly devouring their mash. Mr Worrick even grabbed Whisky’s hand at one point. Whisky was sort of startled at first, but almost immediately settled down and smiled at Mr Worrick as if he was trying to say ‘it’s okay’.

After dinner we put the patients to bed. I was in a bit of a rush, so after I had tucked in Ms Bentham and Whisky I asked Lizzie to see to Mr Worrick and then lock up the ward. We had called Nurse Lana after the incident and she had offered to take the night shift so that we could shake of the stress a bit. The patients would be alone for an hour at most between Lizzie locking up and Nurse Lana returning for her shift, so it was safe enough to leave the patients alone for a bit. I was already cycling home when I noticed that I had left my purse at the nurses’ office. I did not want to wait another hour for Nurse Lana to return so I sped back in the hopes to find Lizzie still there. When I arrived at the ward I noticed that all the lights had already been turned off. However, the door was not locked. “That’s odd.” I thought to myself. “Did Lizzie forget to lock it after turning off the lights? Or could she still be here?”

I stepped into the hallway and called out Lizzie’s name. No response. I called again. This time I heard not too far in front of me. It was a very faint mumbling noise. “HELLO?” I shouted. “Who is there?” The mumbling stopped but it made place for something violently banging on the floor. I flicked on the lights and was met with a horrible sight. 

Ms Bentham was sitting a few feet in front of me down the hallway. She sat in a pool of blood with streams of blood dripping down from her mouth. Next to her lay…her tongue. Someone had cut out her tongue. I rushed over to her and grabbed her hand. “It’s okay Ms Bentham! I’m here now. Who did this to you?” She put her fingers on the palm of my hand and spelled one word: “WORRICK.”

I turned my head towards Mr Worrick’s room and noticed that the door was ajar. I slowly inched to the door and hesitatingly pushed it open. Mr Worrick was sitting in his wheelchair in the corner of the room. Next to him lay Lizzie’s dead body. Her throat had been slit nearly down to the bone. Mr Worrick looked at me and sighed with relief: “There you are, my sweet. I was afraid you had left me forever.” 

“What are you talking about? Why did you kill Lizzie?” I asked.

“SHE WAS A LYING WHORE! She lied about who she was! She was not my Elizabeth, and she damn well knew it. But still she wore the name. Every day she pranced about with your name on her chest! And she acknowledged it too! That blind bitch! She kept calling her by your name! So I cut out her lying tongue…for you, my sweet!”

“I am not your sweet! Leave me alone!”

“Don’t be daft, my darling. You look just as beautiful as I remember. Now let us be together forever. I even brought you your favourite red dress.” Mr Worrick reached out next to him and pulled up Lizzie’s blood-soaked scrubs from the floor and started wheeling towards me. 

I slowly backed away. “Don’t come near me, Mr Worrick. I am sorry to do this, but I have to call the police. You cannot stay here. Not after what you have done.”

“No no no no no NO! Don’t you see? I made sure nobody would disturb us. We could finally be together again. Just the two of us, without any of these loons interfering. I wouldn’t want the police to ruin our moment.” he sighed. “Come, embrace me, my sweet!”

My adrenaline was rushing and in a split second decision I pushed him over, wheelchair and all. He fell on the floor and looked at me with murder in his eyes. 

“Don’t you walk away from me, you cheating whore! I will HAVE YOU!”

Then I noticed what was in his other hand: a shiv. That was what he had been hiding in those shaking hands of his. He had been sharpening that shiv all this time. He had been planning this…
He started crawling towards me, dragging a trail of Lizzie’s blood behind him. Luckily he was much slower than I was and I was able to quickly bolt towards the door and slam it shut behind me. I called the cops and Mr Worrick was subdued and taken away not long after. 

After he had been taken away and I had made sure that Ms Bentham and Whisky were in good hands, I went into Mr Worrick’s room to find out what else he’d been up to. I walked up to his nightstand and began rifling through the drawers. Nothing interesting to be found. Then I noticed the photograph on his nightstand. It was a photograph of…me! Or so it seemed at first glance. The photograph was very faded and obviously too old to be a picture of me, but the woman in the photograph looked exactly like me. She was wearing a bright red dress and at the bottom of the picture frame there was an engraving: 
“Sweet Elizabeth Worrick, 1929 – 1991”

I interned with them during school, then got offered a job. I have almost 1.5 years of development experience. When I leave it will be 2 years. But most of that experience comes from being an intern while still in school.

I've learned an incredible amount while working there. Ive done full stack development, learned a significant amount of linux, learned server configuration, played with different code repositories, worked under more senior developers in the same codebase, lead a project that consisted of gathering requirements, doing mockups, software architecture and implementation. Theres so much I had to learn because we lacked the resources.

My only concern is that I will be considered a sloppy candidate becsuse I worked at a startup. There are some hacky pieces of code I am ashamed of implementing, but needed to push a solution asap.

In 4 months I want to leave and work for a bigger company doing greater things. My question is, what should would companies expect of someone who graduated half a year ago?"
4ygnsi,7,2016-08-18,Natural talent vs hardworking,michaelconnery1985,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ygnsi/natural_talent_vs_hardworking/,"I'd like to gather some of this sub's thoughts on what you guys feel about the difference between someone who is naturally gifted (in this case for CS/programming) and average people who got good through sheer hard work.

To me, I can tell a pretty much big difference. I look at LinkedIn profiles of upper years from my school and it's easy to tell those who started out average and maybe got slightly better later on and the ones who are naturally gifted. Multiple internships at tech companies, contribute to open source projects - you know what I'm talking about. The difference is clear as day.

As someone who is painfully average (never programmed before college, don't have outstanding grades) a little part of me feels sad not being able to excel like the rest of them. Maybe it's because a part of me wants to be the best at what I do, maybe it's self-pride, maybe it's jealousy - who knows. I work hard in school but there's a ceiling that I will never be able to break through and I am fully aware of that. I'm not comparing with others, just making a general observation and stating facts. I'm slow in programming, sorely average in most of my academics, and most of the time need to put in double the effort to get somewhere slightly above average.

It's no secret that there are brilliant programmers and for some of them it comes naturally to them, whereas for the others not so much. How do I break out of this negative thinking? It's true that probably only the top 10% are as smart as I described, but as much as a part of me says just do the best I can, another part of me wants to be in that 'top 10%' as well, even though it's virtually impossible for me to do so. 

Thoughts?

4ygo4n,16,2016-08-18,Would anyone be interested in a mobile programming/mobile development student org?,nickfhs,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/4ygo4n/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_mobile/,"I'm finishing up my second iOS mobile development internship this summer and have been thinking that it would be fun to start an organization centered around mobile software development (iOS/Android) at UCSD.

FSAE builds a racecar all year. There's a solar car team on campus that builds a solar powered car all year. Let's build mobile applications with a mobile development organization. This organization could have a similar approach where everyone works on a single, or multiple, project(s) over the course of the school year. In addition, we could hold office hours for those wanting to learn more about mobile software development or hold some presentations every now and then talking about specific aspects of mobile product development on both iOS &amp; Android.

I understand that many CSE students have to take 110 which is similar, however, CSE 110 1) restricts students going for mobile products to Android, 2) has to be a UCSD-focused project, &amp; 3) is mostly for CSE/ECE students whereas if we did a single (or multiple) small-mid sized projects, we could take advantage of students in other departments that would be interested in say, UI design, for example.

I'm open to suggestions, comments, and those that would want to learn more about possibly starting something like this! Thanks!"

This is my first actual post so please bear with me regarding my formatting and thread selection. 

Lately, my life has been difficult.  As a 6th year graduate student (I will be a pharmacist in less than a year), I am more than capable of dealing with difficult problems.  Lately, life has thrown me some problems that are both entirely out of my control and incredibly difficult to deal with. 

In a time span of days, I have had a grade-school friend die of a heroin overdose and have also discovered that my father is currently heavily addicted to opiates.

Although I wasn't close with this friend as an adult, I had known him very closely until I was about 18 years old (I am now 23).  I will be attending his funeral in a few days.  I had no idea that he had a heroin problem until his death hit me in the face yesterday.  

Up to this point in time, I have managed to handle plenty of difficulties between my work, school, home, and social life.  Right now I feel like I'm drowning.  My mom is an absolute mess and can't handle what's happening with my father.  I'm almost a pharmacist yet I can't help my own father because he just won't listen to my advice.  I'm taking the death of my friend as a sign that my father is very close to meeting the same end (he is 60 years old with other chronic health problems, my friend was 22). 
 
Additionally, I start a new rotation soon, which means that not only do I have to prove myself as a professional, I also have to balance all of these problems simultaneously while still being competitive.  Very soon, I will be working 60-70 hours per week as well as juggling these problems. 

During my rotations, I have to work 40 hours a week, and pay tuition to attend these rotations. I have an internship and a catering side job to make money to support myself while on rotation. 

Somebody needs help.  I don't know if it's me or my father, but nobody in my family knows what to do right now. 

Thanks for whatever advice you can give, god bless. "

I have applied for the API bursary, I am doing well in my subjects at QUT, and I have a keen interest in EE. I've tutored previous semester students in the foundations of EE unit that I'm now taking in this semester. I've studied ahead. 

I know MATLAB, C/C++, Excel/VBA and am learning Python and R in this semester. 

I am good with math. 

I am going to apply for all the vacation work and internships that I can, as well as the Energex scholarship once I'm second year. 

I've heard that the power sector is very competitive. But this conflicts with some of the things I've heard about power side EE having one of the highest demands for new engineers of any sector. 

What advice would you give me? I really want to be a power side EE. Advice specific to Australian power side EE would be especially great :)

4yi8b1,3,2016-08-19,Worried I may not be competitive enough for pathology/immunology PhD programs,tripping_right_now,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4yi8b1/worried_i_may_not_be_competitive_enough_for/,"**TLDR: Recent Med Lab Science graduate worried about competitive application for this cycle. Good GPA, unknown GRE scores, great LORs and SOPs/Research Statement. Worried that the type of person and work that I am is incompatible with the PhD lifestyle. My dream career involves teaching undergraduate students or becoming a science editor/grant editor. Research interests include parasitology, allergies, and IgE-mediated disease states.**

I graduated this May from the University of Vermont’s Medical Laboratory Science program. I passed my board exams and am an American Society of Clinical Pathology certified Medical Laboratory Scientist. I currently work at a monoclonal antibody production company where I began as an intern 2.5 years ago (I’m an employee now).
 
As the application cycle for this year approaches, frankly I’m terrified that I’m not a competitive enough candidate for PhD programs. I knew early on during my undergrad years that a hospital-based lab tech job was not for me; I have planned for many years to pursue a PhD with the end-goal of being an academic professor/lecturer someday, or a professional editor/grant writer.
 
I feel very passionately about learning more, developing my laboratory skills, and asking the important questions. I know grad school is not undergrad 2.0; I am mentally prepared to take on graduate school as a profession and learn how to become an independent researcher and academic. But lately, so much self-doubt has been setting in…
 
My professors in undergrad have encouraged me to apply to top-tier schools: Stanford, UNC-Chapel Hill, Georgetown. I do not believe my application is good enough for these schools, nor do I want to attend institutions like these. I am more interested in the following schools: U Washington, UC Boulder, UC Denver, Dartmouth, UVM, UNH, U Michigan. 
 
My undergrad GPA was a 3.54. I only got 3 C’s in college, all in chemistry/organic chemistry courses. I got A’s in all of my major specific courses (Immunology, Pathology, Microbiology, Genetics, Parasitology, Hematology, etc.)
 
I have not taken the GREs yet; I am scheduled for October 1st. I did poorly on the SAT and very well on the ACT in high school. I’m going to assume my GRE scores will be average (155V/155Q/5W).
 
I will have fantastic LORs for my application and a very strong SOP/Research Statement. I am a strong writer and have been told I am very capable at conveying scientific information to an audience. Additionally, I am a decent public speaker and perform well in interviews.
 
I’m just so worried that I’m not qualified enough for these graduate programs… The average GRE scores/GPA for accepted students at almost all of these programs are 158V/158Q and 3.8, respectively.
 
I also worry that what I want out of life is incompatible with the PhD I want to pursue…for example, I would like to settle down in a rural area (not a city person). I want to get married and have a child in the next 5 to 10 years. I don’t know if I can compromise traveling the country and living in locations I dislike just to get the job. And I have a SO that I am beginning to plan my life with, and I worry so much about our relationship and going long-distance.
I have also learned (basically after reading this sub so much) that the way I like to operate in a lab doesn’t seem to be the way academic labs are run. For example, I’ll put in significantly more week-work hours if it means I don’t have to work the weekend. I am a very team-based worker and enjoy consulting other employees for help/wit questions. I worry that the kind of worker I want to be is incompatible with the realities of being a PhD student.
 
I am very capable in a laboratory setting and feel confident in my lab skills. A short list of my skills includes: tissue culture, mouse handling/immunizations/euthanasia, PCR, basic gene sequencing, various ELISAs, protein purification, antibody isotyping. 
 
The research I have performed at my lab revolves around the various binding epitopes on coagulation factors that our antibodies bind to and determining whether our antibodies bind to the zymogen or the activated factor. On a personal level, I am highly interested in parasitology and mechanisms of eosinophilia that encompass various helminth infections; I am also interested in the overlap between IgE-mediated allergic reactions and how these may be similar to/different from IgE responses during parasitic infections. Unfortunately I have yet to find a single lab on my list of schools that studies parasitology or allergies.

Any honest opinions about how competitive my application is?"

To quickly rethread on the setting, $Corp is a healthcare and care home for mentally impaired or disabled, it is run by a small IT crew who are the last light in the endless sea of darkness that is the end users. For 10.000 years the immortal Empe- whoops I got carried away there.     
     

**Our cast for this case are:**    
**$me: Drinker of coffee, hater of all.**    
**$TMLD: Nice guy who led us into battle (work) for roughly 6 months before running away screaming.**    
**$OLD: Guy who was assigned to me during my internship way, way back (T-minus 4 months before his retirement).**    
**$CTK: Caretaker for the clients in this particular story.**    
**$Client: Troubled youth with drug and mental problems, also a fish lover.**     
    

*For those who missed the last two tales, I had been getting tickets since the day I started at $Corp from a specific care home about a specific thing.*     
“$CTK: Can you send an engineer, $Client’s Playstation 3 (PS3) doesn’t work with online games, he needs to play online!”    
*Well, if your any self-respecting monkey in IT (disclaimer, I am not racist towards monkeys, unless it’s the poo flinging type) you’ll wonder what you’re supposed to do with this followed shortly thereafter by a rereading of company policy and or consulting your co-workers on the matter.*     

*Turned out we had jack all in place for something like this and the system administrators and network administrators simply glared me out of the room upon even asking them if there had been a precedence before.  So of to the plastteel and rockcrete cage I went to talk with $TMLD.*    

    

&gt;$me: $TMLD, can you spare a moment?    
&gt;$TMLD: Sure $techk, whats wrong?    
&gt;$me: Well you see I have this ticket…    


*To cut it short it boiled down us both agreeing we shouldn’t really be doing this and that we should politely decline them. Read, we both figured it wasn’t our problem or our divisions and that the caretaker should simply contact the provider for the clients internet (care homes had two networks, company and a private one for their clients).*    

*So as a good wrench wielding simian I went ahead and let $CTK know we wouldn’t be cooperating.     
He replied within 2 minutes tops. The response from a general end user was between hours and days on average so this was a wee bit weird. So I reply back stating that our team leader said no so in a nutshell go take a hike.     
His reply was interesting.*    


&gt;$CTK: You don’t understand $Client NEEDS to play online! He NEEDS to!!    


*I politely told him “no” again and closed the ticket (I wasn’t about to start playing a game of pong with him).*    

*A few days passed when $OLD walks up to my desk.*    
&gt;$OLD: Hey $techk, you play videogames right?    
&gt;$me: Yeah, why?     
&gt;$OLD: Well we need to go to #Location tomorrow, something about a pay station 3    


*A feeling of dread assaults you, what do you do… I cast FIST into the darkness!*    


&gt;$me: would this happen to be where $Client is housed at #location under $CTK?    
&gt;$OLD: Actually it is, how do you know that?    
&gt;$me: $TMLD and I had a talk about this a while ago, he agreed not to do anything with it.     
&gt;$OLD: Yeah well the board demanded we’d go there, something about client satisfaction and making sure their stay is pleasurable.    
&gt;$me: So $CTK simply pressured upstream, I don’t know what’s so special about $Client or his goddamn PS3 but I’ll come with.    
&gt;$OLD: Me neither, but a job’s a job eh, I can tell you more sailor stories!    
&gt;$me: Just give me the Emperors mercy now and get it over with.    


*The day passed, morning came, as did the 2 hour drive and sailor stories… the stuff that goes on around a boat will forever be engraved in my little squishy hard drive.*  
*At #Location we find a small little studio, about the same as you would shove a few college students in, big enough for them to move, sleep, eat. But not big enough to live in with more than a single person without violating personal space.*  


&gt;$OLD: Be careful around here, this is where $corp stores the loonies they can’t manage in regular homes.  
&gt;$me: gee thanks for the warning after I came all the way here…  


*As we move towards the studio we can smell a rancid smell, the type you get after a fish truck is left out hanging for weeks on end without proper cooling with plenty of fish still inside (don’t ask why I know how that smells, I’ve done weird shit for money during my education).*  
*We both look at one another but all $OLD does is shrug and mention a comment about his grandmothers mattress. We ring, tap the glass and sit there for a bit when $client (or what I hoped was him) opened the door.*  


&gt;$Client: You two the computer blokes?     
&gt;$OLD: We’re from $corp’s IT department yes, we’ve come to take a look at your pay station.    
&gt;$Client: Great… well, walk on in, don’t mind the mess.     


*Disclaimer, I am not the neatest person on this plant nor do I have anything akin to a cleaning fetish but right then, right there, I could of killed him.*    
*Piles of clothes everywhere, boxes of food are scattered all over, it looks like a bomb went off filled with everything a college student might do within a whole year.*     


&gt;$me: So we came here to look at your PS3, what’s wrong with it exactly?    
&gt;$Client: It dun wanna connect to CoD with online, I need to play cause I’m gonna be a MLG pro    


*He didn’t say M L G or Major League Gamer or anything akin, no he said EHM ELH GEE, for the record whitest person I have ever seen. Yes I realize this isn’t fair as he has behavior issue and probably some mental handicap, sue me I’m mean too sometimes.*     


*an eyetwitch later*  


&gt;$me: Old please go check the patch box and the ADSL line, I’ll look from the front end of things, $Client, could you open a window?    
&gt;$Client: You saying my place smells?    
&gt;$OLD: not if you like fish, you a fisherman son?    
&gt;$Client: Nah mang, I only like CoD, only fish for me     


*another eye is now twitching*    


&gt;$me: $OLD please just go check upstairs.    


*So after some grumping I’m left alone with $Client whom begins to talk about call of duty. I don’t care for the franchise myself, each their own off course but we all know that one guy who does that (talk about his hobby non stop without even pausing to check if you're remotely interested I mean) and how cringe worthy it can be.*    
*Meanwhile I’ve checked the most logical things, cables are in, LED is blinking, device is not set to any weird mode or IP as far as I could tell.*    


&gt;$me: $OLD, you good up there?    
&gt;$OLD: Everything looks fine, ADSL is up and running, no weird port configs or anything.. box was open though, is the client side fine? I only have two connections up here.    
&gt;$Client: I didn’t touch nothing in that box!    
&gt;$me: …

&gt;$OLD: That is weird, want to trace it?    


*Way ahead of you at this point, cable goes straight down then into the staircase (the two studio’s we’re connected in the middle with a singular staircase with a washer and a small rack upstairs on the makeshift attic). From there it goes into the wall and ends up in $Clients room…*

*I explained the CoD thing later to $OLD, even now he still doesn’t quite get it but that’s fine, he’s retired for a few years now and we sip coffee on occasion laughing about cases like these.*    

*Turned out that the Client was told by a ‘friend’ that in order to play playstation 3 online you need to modify certain settings in your ports (or at least when you’re having issues) same with watching stuff of a NAS.*    

*Now the Client didn’t know how to operate a Cisco switch (nor did he have the passwords) And he sure as hell couldn’t make heads or tails of the ADSL box so he figured “hey if I add a device in between then surely it’ll work!” So he pestered $CTK into buying him a Linksys box and then proceeded to pester him every single day to the breaking point to have an IT guy come over to fix it.*    

*For whatever reason he decided to hide the stuff in between his stash of other illegal stuff (well illegal on the premise at least) and to tell us there was nothing there. Upon removing the Linksys and NAS (we plugged that in for him directly into the Switch upstairs*    

*He got later moved over to the (then) newly build high level security facility for $Corp so that they could keep a better eye on him.*    
*$CTK got reprimanded and then send on leave, he needed to destress and yelling at a scared and burnt out person isn’t going to do anyone any good.*    
    
    
**Extra:**    
*Timeskip to about two years ago, a few months before I left $Corp.*    
*I arrive at the facility and check in at the gate security, am led to the caretaker for one of the homes and told of the issue. “A hard to manage client has a mediabox that has died, he mentioned before he has had PS3 issues with us”.*     
*No, it simply can’t be, the universe is not that mean.*    
*Turned out, it is.*    
*Also turned out he was up to his old tricks only this time with a mediabox.*    


&gt;$Client: Ain’t you?    
&gt;$Me: what did you plug in this time    
&gt;$Client: Nothing..    
&gt;$Me: Spare me 10 minutes of my day please    


*Out comes another router, I unhook it, hook up his mediabox to an empty outlet, patch it, put it in the proper VLAN and it runs fine.*    


&gt;$Client: Erm, thanks.

I'm a student and I am about to start my fourth and final year of university.

In my third year of uni I went abroad for an internship for half a year and met a great girl while staying there. Unfortunately I had to come back to my own country to continue my studies. We remained a couple. She came to my country to spend our holiday together and we had a great time. She has since moved to the US and will be studying there for 2 years and will remain there to work afterwards. We both decided we want to try to build a life in America together.

That's it for backstory, now to my dilemma.
I need to do one more internship before I'm done with my study, so I figured I would try finding something in America. I found numerous companies that offer services to find a suitable internship and housing in the US. Thing is, it costs money and I'm a student. Furthermore, I need to pay for a visa and flight tickets. The estimated total amounts to €3400. I've applied for a part time job and I can eventually borrow some money from my family. I can gather the money and go and be there for around half a year, but I am not sure if it is wise to do. Going there to do an internship at a company might be a good way to get a foothold in the USA, a way to come back after receiving my degree. However, this option costs a lot of money and gives very little certainties. Furthermore there's no guarantee I would get to do an internship at a company anywhere near to my girl, which also weighs on this decision.

Alternatively, I can decide to stay here for the remainder of my studies, and save up as much as I can and try to go to the US when I finish my studies. Doing so allows me to remain to work part-time while I am doing a (paid) internship in my own country. I have no idea how difficult it is to find employment in the US, especially for someone who has just graduated, doesn't have a whole lot of work experience and is not based in the U.S. to begin with.. 

I'm uncertain which way to go might be the best, perhaps some entirely different way that I have not thought of. And yes, I know I am naive.

tl;dr:
Want to move to the USA to be with gf and find employment there, don't know how.

Any advice or resources I can use are very much appreciated.
Thanks for the help. "

I worked at a university this summer doing a research fellowship. I worked with several grad students conducting experiments, and when I finished collecting data I analyzed it and put it all together for the grad student I was working for. When this was all done I was able to present this data at the company that was sponsoring the research fellowship, and I received good feedback there.

The problem is, I never had a great relationship with my grad student or the professor who oversaw the lab. I wrote a report for the professor, but when I sent it to the grad student for review, he told me not to bother sending it to the professor. I am now 2 weeks out of the program and soon will be heading back to school. I'll be applying for internships this fall and I was looking for advice on what to do about this experience. I think I will still put it on my resume, but I don't know if I should even bother asking the professor/grad student for a reference. How do you all think I should handle this? Do you think it is worth asking for the reference, and do how would you explain the whole thing to a potential employer?

We are now set up to fail and I figure I have six months to a year to prepare. 

My co-workers and superiors are all pleased with my work, but I also know that technical interviews are a thing, and I am terrified of them. I have only one year of experience and I have never had a really tough interview experience, but I am good on the job.

Right now I work in DevOps but I would like to push more towards development. I picked up [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) and while parts of it make me feel less anxious, the questions scare the crap out of me.

I managed to get an A average in my math courses through school, but only because of Khan Academy and lots of time and effort. The very first question in the above book was finding the difference in angles on clock hands, and I wouldn't be able to negotiate that question without google, let alone be able to come up with an algorithm, or get it correct, without a good chunk of time.

What can I do to prepare? Which of the interview sites are the best? Should I be spending a lot of time on my math skills? I know a lot of it is about how you think (which I am confident in, I know I write good code), but what if I don't have the skills to create the algorithm in the first place because I don't know the steps in the first place? 

Any help appreciated."

Any recommended career path?",IronSaviour,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4yksx5/currently_senior_student_want_to_eventually_work/,"First off, I'm located in Europe; I understand, that the job market/culture is different from the US here, but I believe that people and software development are similar in principle.

My current situation: I graduated in CS with no relevant work experience at the age of 25, because of health problems. I'm currently pursuing masters in CS (the curriculum is rather underwhelming though, and there are no opportunities to get involved either) and hope to graduate by the time I'm 27-28. I might get at least a short internship in the meantime (they're rather rare around here).

I believe I can get an average job after graduation and have an average career. The problem is: I don't really want to follow that path. I've recently asked myself, what I actually want to do in life, and two things popped up:

1. Work only as much as necessary to support myself, spare my health (low stress, minimum time spent sitting in an office) and focus on my (mostly intellectual) interests.
2. Find a fulfilling career in research: either CS (AI), or some other field, where I can apply CS. (Perhaps I should note, that I enjoy the academic environment for the most part.)

My current ""plan"" is to graduate, work in software development for a year or two, then try to get either another masters specialized in AI, or a degree in another field (presumably anything from non-molecular biology to social sciences)... I would try to get involved as much as possible and get my foot in the door. If I don't like it or fail, I can hopefully go back to software development and focus on working short hours/remotely. I'm not particularly worried about money at this point, because I'm single by choice, have a very frugal lifestyle and education is very cheap here (another masters would be under €1k total).

I wonder what kind of software development/technology I should seek initially. It's all information systems (Java/.NET), websites (PHP/front-end) or mobile apps, where I'll apply initially.

I'm unsure about a couple of possible pitfalls though:

* I've seen people mention, that senior-level jobs open possibilities for working less/remotely. However, the less I focus on a career in software development, (1) the less experience I'll have to actually get to the senior level (how long is it typically?) and (2) if I voluntarily stale at non-senior jobs for a long time, I suspect, that it might be seen as a red flag by some people.
* If I change my mind about starting a family (or anything expensive) later down the road, I'm not sure, if a sudden advance up the ladder will still be an option.
* I'm worried, that my interest in theory and all that jazz will wane, if I work in a common job for too long, and cognitive abilities usually slowly diminish with age.

Have I missed anything?

Thanks for reading; advice would be appreciated."

I spent my first two years as a Help Desk Technician at my school, then in the spring of 2015 moved to a local company of about 400 as an IT intern. I worked there for a little over a year and was eventually titled: ""IT Professional"". I ended up leaving on good terms in the spring of 2016 to pursue a ""server engineering"" internship at a very large medical group near me. I wanted some change, and the opportunity to experience an enterprise environment. My summer internship is coming to a close, and I've definitely learned a lot, but now I'm faced with the decision of what I will do during the school year and beyond.

I've already spoken with my company where I worked as an ""IT Professional"". They've stated that I can come back and work there part time, but have no guarantees as to full time come graduation. A couple weeks ago, I noticed a posting for a network/systems administrator at another company near me. I've always wanted to work as a systems/net administrator, so I immediately applied, thinking I would be rejected, as I had not completed my degree quite yet. I was contacted, and asked to interview, with the notion that I would work part time during the school year, essentially ""merging"" myself into the job come graduation. One thing has led to another, and I believe I'll be officially offered the job next week. I would be starting off hourly, but paid fairly well, and then move to salary after graduation.

I accepted a job offer back in January. I studied information technology in college and graduated this month. I just started this job and, I'm beginning to think if this was a huge mistake. When I interviewed for this job it was made to seem that it would be focused more heavily on IT security and I would be able to do things like penetration testing and testing systems companies have. Instead, my job will be more focused on accounting looking at financial statements and only looking at high level details of the IT side of the company. This was not what I was hoping for in my job. Beyond that, I have been getting zero amount of training for what I will actually be doing. They have also given me no projects to work on for my first two weeks. So I have been just sitting at my desk pretending to work for eight hours. Finally, the culture is very boring. Most people do not talk to each other and just sit at their desks all day. At my internship, I enjoyed the job much better and the culture of that company. The only reason why I didn't pursue that was because of the pay which I am starting to now regret. So, is there any suggestions for me in my situation? I feel like I need to give the job a longer chance but at the same time I feel like I will be miserable at this job.

4yn3v9,9,2016-08-19,Thinking about doing a masters program but not sure how much it will actually help me to reach my goals. Looking for some input.,blingblingscrackpipe,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/4yn3v9/thinking_about_doing_a_masters_program_but_not/,"I have a BSIT, but I have never worked in IT. I originally went to school industrial automation. In my senior year (I was going into the second semester of what would have been a 3 semester senior year) I ran out of money and chose to take the ""industry"" route of my program since it allowed for an entire semester internship. This meant getting paid and only having to pay for 1 class (messed up I had to pay to work...). My internship was 5 hours away from school and long story short they offered me a job as a controls engineer and a very competitive salary to stay. In my head everything would work out because out of the 6 classes I had left 3 were gen eds I had put off, 1 was continuing my internship and making a senior project out of it, one was a 300 level robotics lecture but it had previously been available at a satellite campus near me, and the other a 200 level that I found (or at least thought I found) a transfer equivalent at a nearby college. 

Long story less long, it all fell apart. The satellite campus closed a few months before this and to take that class as a transfer equivalent would put me under the required 300/400 level classes needed to be awarded my degree. So I ended up taking my 3 gen ed classes while pleading with the school to work with me with no luck. I thought about just going back, but giving up the money I was making to give more money to a school that wouldn't help me out (I know they didn't owe anything) when I needed it just didn't seem like a good idea. The degree was too specialized and I couldn't find a direct transfer, plus I realized over a year ago I really just wanted to be a programmer, so I started looking into starting up in CS. I ran into another snag where the college I was transferring from let me substitute classes like cultural diversity for diversity in education (an EDU class) and macro econ for psychology, all the colleges in my area weren't so flexible. I was looking at a full year (not including the semester I just took finishing humanities, communications, and sociology) of gen eds plus 2 years of CS core. It just didn't seem reasonable. I ended finding a school that took my credits by level and department rather than individual classes, but they didn't offer CS only IT. I figured it was good enough and I'd just get this damn bachelor's out of the way. 

So I knocked that out and got my piece of paper. I did well, graduated with a 3.8, but I'm 25 now and have been making over $80k (10-15K in OT) for a little over 2 years. There's not way I'm going to start an entry level IT job and take a 50% pay cut. However, I'm also over having my phone ring 24 hours a day to help someone navigate an HMI or robot teach pendant. 

So I'm back where I was two years ago. I want to learn CS, or more precisely I want to develop software. I'm considering starting up a Master's of Software and Information Systems program. I've had classes in Java, C, C++, Python, and a database management class where I went the extra mile and actually coded the database for our project even though it was just a theoretical project. I'm by no means particularly good at any of these languages, they felt more like intro to programming classes (with the exception of Java, that class was legit). I looked through the curriculum for the Software Engineering program and it looks like it is mostly theory. What I mean by this is I'm not confident I'm going to come out of this program with the technical skills gained from actually doing. 

I've been particularly drawn to the .NET framework but I'll admit I have not looked into a whole lot else. I considered The Odin Project but just like it's intended it seems from my point of view to be strictly web development. I liked that MVC could do web and app development, and that the Visual Studio and C# in it sets you up nicely for mobile app development with Xamarin. I don't really want to limit myslef to .NET, but as something to tackle that can cover desktop apps, web develpment, and mobile development it just seems like a good focus. 

I apologize for being so long winded and I'll get to the actual question.... 


I want to get the technical skills and knowledge to be able to code anything from desktop apps to web to mobile. Are any of these in particular the best way to go:

1) Pursue a Masters in Software Engineering without a CS foundation.
2) Get a second Bachelor's in CS now that I don't feel any pressure for not having my degree when I was so close.
3) Self teach/learn .NET or another framework. If option 3 any recommendations on a path to take. 

TL;DR
I have a BSIT with no IT experience. I have a beginners level knowledge of programming. Which of the following options above is recommended while taking into consideration my overall goal is to be able to do app and web development."

My GPA is crap. Honestly just straight shit. But my test scores aren’t half bad, and not to toot my own horn but my extracurriculars are pretty stellar. With an insane passion in niche fields and majors, and actual experience through internships, I’m a pretty interesting applicant. I write relatively well and have some pretty weird interests and hobbies. My letters of rec are very strong, coming from teachers and counselors. I really need advice on what schools out there might be for me and where I have a decent shot at. This is one of my first reddit posts, a friend of mine suggest I post something here due to the unique disparity between my GPA, test scores, and extracurriculars. 

**Demographics:** Male, Hispanic, Nevada, Magnet high school, Senior, First gen, low/low middle class

**Intended majors:** Archaeology, Anthropology, Environmental Studies

This year I will be taking AP Statistics, AP Government, AP Literature, AP Research (part of AP Capstone program), self studying for AP Comparative Government, Genetics Honors, and Computer Science. 

Besides the plethora of AP’s, all other classes have been honors/pre-AP (chem, bio, english in 9th and 10th, etc.). 2 years of Jazz band, 3 years of Japanese (honors classes), 2 years of Spanish (honors classes). I’ll graduate with 5 language credits.

**Extracurriculars**: Ok so this is where the strength of my application is

- Speech and Debate: Lincoln Douglas debate captain and Vice President 11th, President 12th, top 2% ranked all around competitor in the state, top 7% ranked in the country, World Schools Debate qualifier for this past year, went top 32 in the nation with some international teams thrown in (China, Nigeria, Mexico)
- Model United Nations: Founded the club my freshman year. Officer position held every year, President senior year. Won Best Delegate in the Security Council at LVMUNIII this year, lead the team to a dominating performance at RebelMUN, winning best delegation and taking the gavel in 3/5 councils.
- Varsity Quiz (quiz bowl (think Jeopardy)): Vice President (11th and 12th) of the most winning Varsity Quiz team in Nevada State history. 
- Habitat for Humanity Youth United: Out of school, city wide offshoot of Habitat for Humanity. Historian 10th grade, Vice President 11th grade. For those who don't know, Habitat for Humanity builds housing through volunteer work for those in need. Awesome organization.
- Southern Nevada Water Authority Youth Advisory Council: Council member and project head for 11th and 12th.
- Mock Trial: Competed 11th only, first year offered. Tried it, wasn't a huge fan, probably won't continue in 12th grade.
- We The People: Team open to seniors only by application and selection. I'm one of 15 selected this year
- Volunteer with the UNLV Archaeology department: Work under Dr. Karen Harry, professor of archaeology at UNLV. Help out with lab work and on digs.
- RYLA: Rotary Youth Leadership Awards
- American Legion Nevada Boys State, perfect record in moot court.
- World Atlatl Association: The atlatl is a 30,000 year-old spear-throwing device. I happen to be only of only 3 registered WAA competitors and event organizers in the state of Nevada. Atlatls are something I’ve studied for my entire life and along with other paleo tools and practices something I’ve become known for in the community and in the academic world, organizing community events and working with archaeologists from across the country on atlatl research. Still unsure how I’ll include that in my app but it’s such a huge part of my life I need to fit it in some how. Take a look at my username and you’ll see how important it is to me. 
- Part time job: Earl of Sandwich, junior and senior year.

**Schools:** I’m all over the place, but mostly looking at smaller, liberal arts colleges. I honestly have very few preferences on location or size. I need help finding target schools. With my crap GPA I feel like every school is a reach, which is bad.

- Oberlin (visited in February, loved it)
- UMich Ann Arbor (visited in February)
- Middlebury 
- Swarthmore 
- Rice University
- George Washington University
- Ohio State
- UNR (visited in June)

**Questions**
Please help me find more match/target schools. Also should I ED to Oberlin? The inability to shop finances with ED scares me, as my family in no way could even come close to affording college if I don't get substantial financial aid. Thank you so much!"

Please and thank you!",BeaconInferno,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/4yni3r/chance_me_for_dickinson_university_of_richmond/,"Hello! I will be applying to these 5 schools along with a couple state schools (UOregon and Oregon State) and reaches. Before I go on and narrow down my reaches more, I would like an opinion on my chances for these schools. I think that I will get into these schools, and at the very least 3 of them. I would like to get feedback if that is an accurate assumption. I feel that come April I will likely be choosing between these school and through my research I can see myself going to all of them.


My information-
* GPA: 4.0uw, something really high weighted, I have taken the max amount of IB Classes I can. I am a Full IB student, there is Usually only 20/500 students who are each year.


* SAT- Around 1400 New Sat, retaking in October and December if needed. Chem and Math 2 in November


* Rank - 5/468. At my school, all people with an uw 4.0 GPA and met honor requirements are valedictorians. There are around 10 each year, I will probably be one of them. Honestly don't know if my school reports unweighted or weighted ranks because of this. We have 2 official transcripts with either one. I think I get to choose which one to send in, if I do I will send the rank 1 unweighted transcript.


**EC**: (Most of these are volunteering related, I put the number of documented volunteering hours next to it, none of the hours overlap)


* Sparrow Club -**President**- 100+ hours
This is a club that I am REALLY passionate about. It's a club where we fundraise for a different sick child each year. Last year it was for a girl who had the same cancer my mom died of. We raised $15,000 and I am immensely proud of that. Benefit concerts, craft fairs, basketball games ect. I know I don't have a fancy research position but I really take A LOT of pride in this because of the history with my mother. Before I became president we raised $3000 so there was a big difference when I took over. The club only had like 10 people and the old presidents just wanted to give up and disband, but I took over. There is around 100 members now.


* Library Council -**President**- 50+ Hours


* Japanese National Honor Society -**Vice President**- 60+ hours


* Science National Honor Society -**Co-founder, Secretary**- (only this year)


* Communications Intern- During my sophomore year for a company online


* Key Club -**Officer**- -**Divisional assistant**- (Both roles are at separate levels of the club, so I have them simultaneously) 170+ hours


* Tennis - JV 9-11, Varisty anticipated 12th


* NHS: 70+ hours. Started an Oregon Humane Society fundraiser empty can drive that earned ~$500

* Meals on Wheels: Volunteer for 3 years, 1-3 times each week in the summer and during the school year on some non-school days. I am also a **volunteer coordinator** there, I get people from my high school to volunteer- ~60 Hours

* Food Pantry: Help out once a week for an hour for 3 years at a local food pantry (In a church but not one I go to)

* Food Bank: 3-8 times a year for 4 years.

Some other Volunteer things like at a family homeless shelter, Library, Metal recycling, Beach Cleanup, PSO Childcare watching; but these things are not as consistent.

Busser at a Hotel summer before Junior year and during Junior year. Quit because it became too much of a commitment


Major: Neuroscience or Psychology with a Neuroscience concentration/minor. Also Pre-med


First Generation, Single parent house hold. (Mother died)


Also would like to add I was homeless Durring part of my freshmen year and will talk about that in my essay


Applying to most of my reaches through Questbridge


* Income: $12,000.
^So financial aid is an absolute necessity. I can take out up to $9,500 in federal loans (I know my dad will get denied Parent-Plus and no way will any Private loan company allow him to co-sign). I also can do Work-study and perhaps ~$3,000 in summer earnings. With this guideline, all of these schools Net price calculators make them doable. How much can I trust those though?


Because of the financial aid I need to make sure that I can get into more than 1 of them, I am pretty positive I will but I am worried. I need to be able to compare packages. Should I add more safety/matches? True safeties are so hard for me to find because of the finical aid aspect. My Current SAT is just a bit too low for most automatic full tuition (But we will see after October) and most of those schools are too big for my preferences. Syracuse is already pushing the size limit.


So please chance me! Also, I will be including reaches but that isn't what I want to focus on for this post.

Also I did this on mobile so sorry if the formatting is bad"

This is a story from when I interned at *local computer store* or **$LCS** for short. I was there for a few weeks, and quit after a dispute over business practices emerged. This story is the reason I quit. No names will be named, instead they will be BigBoss (**$BB**), SweetOldLady (**$SOL**) and Me (**$DJ**).


We are at the end of the day, towards time for me to head home (**$BB** stays another 3 hours after I leave), when **$SOL** comes in with a laptop in a panic. I go to the services desk to see what the matter is.


&gt;**$SOL**: Can you help me? I was doing emails on my laptop and suddenly it says its going to install Windows 10!

*For reference, the laptop was at least 7 years old. As a rule of thumb at our store, we don't put Windows 10 on any laptop that has a Windows Vista or lower COA on it.*

&gt;**$DJ**: Sure, I can help you with that. It shouldn't be too long.

*I take her laptop over to the workbench. It's been left on, and the update has 6 minutes remaining. No sweat, just plug my USB in and run a tool. Before I can begin, enter* **$BB**, *stage left.*

&gt;**$BB** (quietly to me): Do the virus scans too and run sfc /scannow, so we can charge her $80.

&gt;**$DJ** (quitely back to **$BB**): But it's just windows 10, its as simple as deleting the update files and disabling it with that tool.

&gt;**$BB** (still quietly): Yes but just do it.


So I proceed to disable the Windows 10 update (in like 10 seconds mind you), and then (despite my objections) begin a virus scan and that sfc command. Neither were needed, but **$BB** proceeded to charge this eldery pensioner $80 for the virus scan etc. I couldn't look her in the face, I felt so bad.


I decided to quit the next day.


EDIT: Just to clarify, I did what I was told because I was an intern and this was my first job in I.T. I was still of the ""yes sir no sir 3 HDDs full sir"" mindset.

EDIT 2: sfs is sfc, duh. Thank you u/bezdancing, I got confused because there is a box of frozen chicken tenders called SFC in my freezer."
4yo86i,1,2016-08-20,First major project; any pointers on how to tackle it?,Statici,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/4yo86i/first_major_project_any_pointers_on_how_to_tackle/,"So here's the dealio: I have an internship where I have to take [this code](https://github.com/artiste-qb-net/quantum-fog) and add to it/rework it from an (apparently) java style to something more python-like so that others may employ it and use it for as many applications as possible.

The problem: While I have experience in java, C, HTTP, actionscript, python, R, matlab, octave, and a few other languages, that work was *extremely* limited...in total, throughout my overall 13+ years of coding, I may have written one or two thousand lines of code, none of which was used for more than a few specific things. I have no sense of how to structure good code, and my job right now is (essentially) to do just that. My sense of whether code is ""good"" or ""bad"" is pretty much nonexistent; in a few cases it's written in an obviously stupid way and I might be able to spot ways to improve it, but with this, it already looks fine to me...whereas to some of my friends, it is (stylishly) bad.

Could you guys maybe skim this code a bit, and point out what you think needs to be improved, from a very basic intuition side? I don't need you to like, do my job for me (lol) but right now I am reading everything from the discrete mathematics used in bayesian networks, to how the algorithms used in network inference function, to how python can be used in data analysis, and it is eating up a LOT of time. It would be great to start on things from the raw programming perspective (if there is a way to do that).

Oh...and if it's just the case that I need to spend time reading this code and writing other code until I get an idea of how to organize classes and functions in the best way for this project, then that's fine too...just seems like I'm missing some aspect that should make this easier."

As a preface, I'm a 21-year-old IT graduate in Malta, and apart from some very minor online freelance work, I've never had a job... until now. I just applied for a nine-month, paid, full-time internship (€300 a month, €500 a month after six months) to get some experience and a bit of financial help for my future master's course. I went for the interview, and they accepted me.

They told me during the interview what the salary would be, and I have it stated in writing in one of the emails I exchanged with them. However, I'm now taking a look at the contract they sent me before I start working this coming Monday, and in the contract it stipulates multiple times that the internship is *unpaid*.

I'm going to ask them if it was an oversight of some kind, but if it wasn't a mistake on their part then perhaps the reason the salary isn't mentioned in the contract is that they want to pay me off-the-book so they can avoid paying national insurance. This makes me a bit uncomfortable.

Is all this something I need to worry about as an intern? I'm extremely naive when it comes to this kind of stuff because this is my first proper job, and I would love some advice.

Even though I don't have any industry internships (I've done research with heavy command line interface/programming usage) I think I can still use my projects and school rep to land a job somewhere.

main questions: while dealing with interviews for medical school how feasible is it to also balance your first job? (if anybody applied to any other grad/law/etc school I'm interested in hearing those experiences) I'll possibly be interviewing within the first three months of starting my job if that makes a difference.

Second: if interviewers ask me where do I see myself in five years, how do I respond? Also, should I specifically disclose that I'm planning on attending medical school the following year?

Third: would it be smart to disclose this with my employees as well?

This school had gone through a few changes; the biggest change was their new tech director who had risen to this position of power because the previous director left.
We will call him $Sup.
He didnt have degree and he didn't have certifications. Now, I know what you're thinking:

&gt; Bit, he could have had experience.

I never said this guy had experience. This guy couldnt tell you the difference between a loopback and APIPA address.

As I had found out through the course of my internship, this guy barely understood how to maintain a PC let alone a network.

This story begins about 5 months into my internship:

At least once for the past three weeks I came into work to find a ticket put in about some random computer in a lab or a classroom not being able connect to the network. Everytime it was in a different building (this school had 6 buildings). Of course I would go up to the building's switch closet (or the correct one because 2 of the buildings had multiple switch boxes) and a patch cable would be missing. 

One instance is weird. Three is a problem. Who would take the patch cables? Obviously it had to be someone with a key. Why would they take the patch cables? Each building had an office with a box full of ethernet cables. Only an idiot would just take one out of the switches.

I decided the best first step to take was to print out each ticket that was tied this mystery and created relationships between each ticket in our system. 

Next step was to let the boss man know whay was up.

I sent him an email with each ticket number and attached the notes. I wasn't looking to light a fire, I just wanted to let him know that someone was going around taking patch cables. 

A little later that week I finally saw $Sup. It was his nature to show up at random. I had not received a message back from him so I had no idea whether or not he had even looked at my message. My bad for not thinking to enable 'read receipts.' 

Also, while I was waiting for a reply from $Sup, another ticket was assigned to me to investigate why another computer suddenly lost network connectivity. This school had two levels of IT. Tier I, the people who actually worked at the school everyday for small stuff, and Tier II which was a team of people who I barely knew. 

I only knew a couple of the guys there. Some were willing to teach you and others just wanted to come in, fix things and leave. Either way they were all likeable guys. Tier II came in when something was beyond our knowledge. They also had access to the switch closets.

I decided to strike up a conversation with $Sup to see what the next step would be to prevent this issue from happening again.

**$Me** &gt; Hey, $Sup, so I don't know if you saw my email but some how patch cables are going missing from the switches.

**$Sup** &gt; What? 

**$Me** &gt; Yeah, I've had 4 tickets in the past 3 weeks with computers that didn't have network connectivity. Come to find out there was a patch cable missing in each case. Different building each time.

**$Sup** &gt; Do you know what days they happened on? 

**$Me** I made sure to send you a copy of each ticket with the date stamp on them.

He clicks through the email and each attachment quickly and looks up at me. 

**$Sup** &gt; These are all days that Tier II was here.

This didn't make sense because at this time we only had a couple tickets for Tier II in our system. Those issues were both at the same building and only one of the ""patch cable tickets"" had been at that building. 

**$Sup** &gt; Im going to let everyone know thats not how we do things here.

A few minutes later an email was sent out to everyone in tech about the incident. $Sup realized it was almost lunchtime and left in his usual fashion. 
One minute he was at his desk, the next minute I heard the havy thud of the tech room door and he was gone.

Fast forward to the next week, one of the Tier II techs ($TT) was in the office with me trying to figure out the mess that was the VoIP system that had been installed earlier that year (I will post that story another time).

**$TT** &gt; So what was that email about that $Sup sent out last week? Someone stealing patch cables?

**$Me** &gt; Yeah, I've had 4 tickets where computers suddently couldnt connect to the network and then I found out the patch cable was missing.

**$TT** &gt; Who takes patch cables?

**$Me** &gt; I have no idea.

I was silent for a minute. I really wanted to ask him about the issue but I  didn't want to make it into a big deal.

**$Me** &gt; So hows that ticket going for 'X building'?

**$TT** &gt; Still waiting on $Sup to give the go ahead on a few things. He doesn't like replying to emails.

**$Me** &gt; So you havent been to 'X building'?

**$TT** &gt; Why? I can't do anything. Im not gonna drive out there just to see whether or not $Sup wants me to start on that ticket.

I just left it at that. I have a hunch who it was buch I don't really have the proof. I know that I never had a ticket with that issue again.



TL;DR
Cat and mouse game to figure out who took the stupid patch cables. It was either $Sup or $TT but I never got complete closure on the issue. Im sure it was $Sup"

Tier 1 support agents (myself and one other person) were essentially tied down to a phone all day. We were responsible for phone support, remote support via TeamViewer, ticket entry, documentation, receptionist duties, getting yelled at by higher tiers because they changed procedures and didn't tell anyone else, etc. Some of our employees worked on-site for our clients. These employees would have a company issued laptop from both our company and our client. Sometimes our employees could not tell the difference between the two laptops, which resulted in the following tale. Since this incident occurred two years ago, I only recall a few exact quotes.

&gt;Me: &lt;standard helpdesk drone greeting&gt;

&gt;Coworker: I can't get into my system!

&gt;Me: Can you be more specific? We have several different software systems.

&gt;Coworker: It's my system, I can't get into it!

&gt;Me: &lt;starting to get frustrated, my coworker and the IT intern watch as I get rather animated&gt; What does your screen say right now?

&gt;Coworker: I can't get into my system!

&gt;Me: What does your screen say right now?

&gt;Coworker: I need to get into...

&gt;Me: &lt;stern voice, but not yelling&gt; WHAT DOES YOUR SCREEN SAY?

&gt;Coworker: It says &lt;client username&gt; and it's asking me for a password.

&gt;Me: It sounds like you're using a laptop issued by &lt;client name&gt;. Can you check on the bottom of the laptop and tell me if there is a &lt;client name&gt; sticker?

&gt;Coworker: Yes, there is a &lt;client name&gt; sticker.

&gt;Me: You'll have to contact &lt;client name&gt;'s IT department. I don't have access to their accounts to reset your password.

&gt;Coworker: Okay, thanks.

&gt;Me: Is there anything else I can do for you?

&gt;Coworker: No.

&gt;Me: &lt;click, sigh of relief&gt;

&gt;IT Intern: Hey, can you help me get into my system?

&gt;Me: &lt;gives IT intern an evil look and makes an idle threat involving a stabbing&gt;

Up to that point, I had never heard anyone refer to a laptop or desktop as their ""system."" Come to think of it, the only other time I remember hearing the generic term of ""system"" was a phishing attempt (caller hung up after I asked their name) while working at this same position. Maybe it's a regional thing, but I always try to be a bit more specific than that. 

TL;DR: Coworker refers to a client's laptop as her ""system,"" can't follow simple instructions, IT intern makes a joke after the call ends."
4yu9kh,9,2016-08-21,"Need Advice, USMC Vet, Recent CS Grad",drewdinger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4yu9kh/need_advice_usmc_vet_recent_cs_grad/,"Hey everyone sorry if this post is too long. I am a recent computer science graduate of Colorado University(July 2016). I served in the USMC as an enlisted 0651 Data Network Specialist, or a sysadmin in civilian terms, from 2009-2013. I am really uncertain about which direction to take now that I am a graduate and am looking for any advice you guys/gals have. Here is some background about me to help.

* My MOS training consisted of A+, Net+, Sec+, and CCNA Mods 1-3.
* I received a Secret clearance.
* I was deployed with an infantry unit and have had to set up WANs/LANs in various countries abroad, often by myself or in small groups (1-3 others).
* I did enjoy my job. I did not enjoy working for people that did not understand technology, as they often undervalued our service. 
* I wanted to get out and get a degree because of the above reason and to open up my career path options.
* I did very well in my CS classes, the only class I did not get a B+ or higher in was Principles of Programming Languages, I attribute this to the teaching style of the class.
* I went to college before the USMC and had to drop out because I was failing classes/not attending, and in general was not mature enough to finish school.
* My original GPA because of this was abysmal (1.9). 
* Fortunately I worked hard and I graduated from CU Boulder with a cumulative GPA of 3.25, and a 3.51 in CS.
* I had a paid internship for 2 of the 3 years I spent at CU. It was in a scientific lab that was run by the university.
* I left that internship 9 months before I graduated to focus on project building for my personal resume.
* I took advanced classes in Machine Learning and Human/User Centered Design.
* I should have networked more in college, I realize that was a mistake now, but it is difficult when you have a job, a wife, and bills to pay, as well as trying to enjoy college on the side. I shouldn't make excuses though.

I am now at a crossroads and I am feeling overwhelmed. I did enjoy programming, but am not even close to being a master of anything. Classes were taught in C++/Java, my internship worked in Python and a language called IDL (Interactive Data Language), and my projects used C# and JavaScript. I feel like I am not robust enough in any of these languages to pursue a career in them. I have not done any computer network work since i left the USMC, so i am quite rusty. I am put off by some of the people in the tech industry. I do not classify myself as a stereotypical ""programmer"" and I do not program in my free time; I like guns, sports, and the outdoors, yet it seems like most of the private sector companies I have tried to apply with want these types of ""super nerds"" or ""programming enthusiasts"" and that I should be devouring any type of tech news/knowledge in my free time to be able to compete with other candidates. 3/4th of my friends during college were veterans, that shared similar ideals and values that I did. My questions are-

* Would working for a government contractor be better than working for a private company if I wanted to find other like minded people?
* Am I selling myself short if I work for a government contractor/the government?
* Would I be pigeonholing myself if I worked gov/contracting, would it limit my future marketability?
* Am I wrong in thinking that I need to be a ""super coder"" to have any shot at a programming job in the private sector? 
* Are my experiences with systems administration to far in the past to qualify me for entry level positions in careers such as systems analysis or systems administration?
* My internship dealt with current satellite missions and the data they sent, should I be looking at aerospace companies for positions or is my experience irrelevant in that facet?
* Do I have too broad of a knowledge base? I always get the response that they have found someone more qualified. 
* Should I hone one of the skills I have picked up over the last 8 years? Is it too late now that I am graduated? How would I decide which skill to hone if not?

I just have not had a lot of success when applying for jobs and it is really getting to me. I feel like i have a ton of experience, I did decent enough in school, and I even qualify for the 5 point preference when applying for government jobs. Yet I still have been striking out. As I had mentioned 80% of the time I get the response that they have chosen someone more qualified. The other times are mistakes that i have made during the interview process, but I have identified those issues and they have not come up since they originally occurred. Thank you for reading, any advice would be greatly appreciated."

4yvfve,4,2016-08-21,Going from a chef to Software Development,hiya19922,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4yvfve/going_from_a_chef_to_software_development/,"Hello, kind people. So basically I'm a 24-year-old chef. I'm on a degree course in my second year(BSc Applied Computing degree. http://www.stir.ac.uk/undergraduate-study/course-information/courses-a-to-z/school-of-natural-sciences/applied-computing/)

So I have gained an HNC in Software Development (will gain an HND after the second year) and a vendor certificate. Plus most importantly I love what I'm learning. I absolutely love the whole debugging code and trying to get it to work. It makes it difficult to sometimes go into work, to be honest.

My question is I don't know if my current job has many transferable skills related to Software Development which actually scares me. Do you think this is so? Also, would you in my position try to leave the world of cheffing for a more techy job before looking for an internship/future Software job? (My only worry with this option is it's quite difficult to find any local jobs in admin/helpdesk work and I don't feel qualified at all for even the lowest tier of IT positions).

I'm going through local software companies and emailing them about the prospect of getting some work experience days at a few them. My course has a mandatory summer work experience between 3rd and 4th year but I thought it'd be good for me and my CV to get some before looking for internships. 

Plus over the next few months, I've made a detailed list of goals and aims when it comes to coding and that to try and build a little portfolio of programs. Also, I've booked an appointment at my universities careers centre to discuss my CV and gain their insight.

TLDR: Worried I have no skills anyone will want and at 24 it'll be a hard to slog to get those skills."

At the year 2 competition, the GT team was one of a few teams to get our car running! However, there is still plenty of work to do in Year 3 and we have open spots on our team. Over the next 10 months we will finish integrating vehicle components, refining our controls strategy, expanding work on a computer vision based ADAS, and much more. There is also a separate part of the competition aimed at educating the public about hybrid vehicles, managing social media, finding sponsors, and giving presentations to industry sponsors. At Georgia Tech, EcoCAR 3 is part of the Vertically Integrated Projects program; this means that team members actually get 1 or 2 class credits for their work. 


In order to continue our success into year 3, we are trying to fill roles in the following sub teams:

* **Electrical (ECE majors):** Responsible for all of the LV and HV wiring in the vehicle. In year 3, team members will be integrating our electric motor and wiring our energy storage system.
  
* **Modeling, Simulation and Controls (ECE, CS, and ME’s with interest in controls):** Responsible for developing and maintaining vehicle models in Simulink, developing test plans for controls code, writing controls code in Stateflow, and using dSPACE to perform Hardware-In-The-Loop testing.

* **Innovation and ADAS (CS and ECE):** Responsible for programming the NXP S32V processing board to recognize different aspects of the driving environment such as traffic signs or children playing the street. Responsible for developing code that for our Innovation Topic of Predictive Powertrain Control. Using information from the ADAS and the GPS data, we can predict different properties about the road and thus choose a more effective charging strategy to significantly increase MPG.

* **Project Management, Development, Communications (CM, BA, IE):** Responsible for maintaining the scope, schedule, and budget of the team, finding sponsorships, managing social media accounts, helping engineering teams develop presentations and reports, planning outreach events, etc.   


If the work sounds cool, but you are still unsure, here are some reasons (other than working on a Camaro with an awesome group of people) you should join the team:

1. Your experiences on the team will make you *EXTREMELY* desirable to employers. You will experience every step of the design process, gain problem solving skills and work with people of different majors. When you go to an interview, companies only want to hear about what you do with EcoCAR 3 and you will have more than enough to talk about.
2. We are sponsored by big companies like GM, Bosch, Mathworks, NXP, dSPACE, Siemens, etc. These companies specifically recruit EcoCAR 3 students. Plus, they provide us with top of the line software and hardware that you don’t normally learn in a classroom or at an internship.
3. You may have the opportunity to travel. We have multiple workshops/competition events a year, and they are throughout the country in places like Boston, Austin, Detroit, and Washington DC. 



**If you are interested in joining the team, you can apply here: http://tinyurl.com/ecocarsignup**


If you want to know more about the project, we will be having an **info session** on *Tuesday August 23rd 11am-12pm in Van Leer 457* and we will be at the VIP poster session later that day *4pm-5pm in the Klaus Atrium*. If you have questions, feel free to send me a message!

This guy in my class named Fred who is from Ethiopia was my friend and also my roommate during our final 2 years of med school, we had to share a place with other guy in our class so we could all be closer to the hospital during our internship. In 2015 my other roommate and i graduated, he didn't. I was awarded a scholarship to continue my studies for 3 more years. We all had to move out because we couldnt find another person to replace the other guy. Fred owed me a lot of money during that month or so of moving out because his family was disappointed at the fact that he didn't graduate on time, so i paying for most of his expenses during the months of moving out. Now I have given him money before and he would also return it on time so i wasn't worried when it became a lot of money. After a month of moving out i found a cheap one bedroom apartment because i didn't want no roommates and I was planning on going home for the summer, I saw him before i left to remind him how much money he owed me and he told me when i come back he would pay all of it back. I came back and a few weeks later i saw him and reminded him about the money. He thought he owed me half of what the amount really was, and I was shocked and explained to him how much it really was and how i kept reminding you before and he thought that he had given me some money before i left or something like that. Anyways we argued and there were some friends with us at the time and he finally agreed with witnesses present that he would pay me back the full amount. Every chance i would get i would remind him over the phone or messaging to pay me back my money. He would always give me a sincere excuse and i would believe him. Now fast forward to the end of the year. He got his diploma and he left the country. He managed to pay me back half of the original amount and when i found out he left I messaged him and was angrily speaking to him telling him why did you leave before paying me my full amount. He got pissed at me! He got pissed at me?!? And was saying how he made a mistake that he shouldn't have even paid the half and that i owe him money because he paid me too much?!? I was shocked and angry, why? because why didn't he say that to me when we were both in India together. I didn't want to talk to him no more and so i got in touch with his cousin who gradated a year ahead of us and i was friends with him. And I explained the whole situation to him and he told me he would convince him to pay me back, but of course fred told him that he wouldnt pay me back. After a while i realized it wasnt a whole lot of money and so i decided to contact him and ask him one more time to do the right thing and pay me back if not to just let it go. I spoke with him over the phone and asked him one more time. The way he spoke to me was in a disrespectful way. He was calling me a liar for cheating him when i tried to explain how the money came about he would say show me the proof but i couldn't because we dealt in cash. Anyways after a while of talking i couldn't take it and so i let my anger take over me and I started cussing him off saying that I will be successful and you are a loser, stuff like that, and a few swear words. Finally i hanged up and he messaged me and said that he recorded me and that i insulted his mom and family, which i didn't (i think i did say MotherF*****). everything i said was directed at him. He then threatened me saying how he will come back to that city and he will find me and ""ruin my life"" and ""wishing you were never born"". Keep in mind that i am a scholarship student and in India fighting is not tolerated. And to make matters worse a week after the announcement of my scholarship last year, i got arrested doing something stupid and i was put on probation meaning that if they even hear my name in a negative way anywhere i will be kicked out, no questions asked. And Fred knows that. I can easily take him but i don't want to fight and get kicked out of school for over a few hundred dollars. But he's coming back in Sept to study something i don't know but not in the same school as mine and I don't know what to do. I want to tell my teachers but i don't want them to think I'm a troublemaker who fights or do something stupid. What do i do? Sorry in advance for the grammar and spelling mistakes"
4ywtgk,260,2016-08-21,Is it just me or is the software engineering hiring game becoming...more and more toxic with each passing year?,csthrowaway_dinosaur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ywtgk/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_software_engineering/,"I'm currently happily employed, but the last few recruiters and managers I've networked with have been extremely toxic and I've heard the same thing from friends. I'm curious to see if anyone here has experienced this.

For example, a recruiter recently saw my resume and asked me why I had so many internships on there. In a very rude and condescending tone. She actually called me a ""serial intern"" even though I pointed out that one of the internships turned into a full-time job until I relocated to California for another internship. (I was still in school when one internship turned into a full-time job, so I decided to explore California while I could still do so as an intern.)

I never expected that the hiring landscape would one day treat you with contempt because of ""too many"" internships. It's almost like she held them against me because I didn't turn each one into a permanent role.

I also had a hard time with a different recruiter who tried to bullshit me with the ""since it's your first job out of college"" card when he mentioned what pay range the company was looking for, even though I told him that one of the internships became a full-time job and that the internships themselves were high-quality experience.

Even more appalling was an experience I had with a VP of engineering at an up and coming start-up that was founded by some successful entrepreneurs. He was extremely rude when I went for a visit, and claimed he was being that way because he wanted ""to see if you're looking for easy money or if you're more interested in making a difference in the world."" No joke. He then went on to scoff at my previous work experience and to question my credentials, even though I pointed him to my references and publicly visible source code I've been working on.

So what's going on? Why are hiring managers and recruiters and even VPs of engineering seemingly on a rampage against people who ""have too many internships"" or who ""might want a lot of money instead of a chance to be excited about making a difference"" and all that bullshit? Why are my four internships (one for each year of college) held against me by some? Why do some sneer at my public source code?

Is it all just a cheap attempt to pretend like they don't want a candidate, so that they can possibly get talent for cheaper? Are there so many CS graduates these days that they can feel entitled to pick and choose and be downright abusive? 

I wasn't going to ask, but having been around the networking game for a couple of years now I wanted to see if anyone else has been experiencing this or if it's just the way I present myself. (I doubt it's my soft skills because I've had several pleasant experiences too. I'm just posting here about the increasingly frequent negative experiences)"

I'm a junior, so I'm not qualified to hand out much advice.

During that time, this sub has caused me a lot of anxiety (my own fault, I shouldn't go searching for things to worry about). When I was still in school, it was because most here said you need internships and projects as an undergrad to get a job. I managed to get a good entry level job without either. That's not bragging (because it still scares the hell out of me to feel unqualified for my job), just my honest experience.

Then I read people saying stuff like ""if you can't answer FizzBuzz in 3 minutes flat, you're a terrible developer and should quit."" Now, FizzBuzz is obviously pretty damn easy, but from my early observations in this field, there are a lot of working developers who could answer this but would probably need more time than that to get a working answer with no mistakes.

Another example: People insisting that to get a job as a developer, you need to study Cracking the Code Interview and have a great understanding of algorithms. Again, I interviewed many times for relatively big companies, and had only one whiteboard interview. 

What I'm getting at here, is this question: Does this sub present an accurate view of the CS field for newbies that come here looking for advice and information? Or should this really be called r/big4careerquestions? Personally speaking, I've caused myself a lot of unnecessary stress reading threads here that were clearly not very relevant to the job search of an average developer."

I am having a hard time finding a footing in a career as a developer. Graduated with an Associate's Degree with a high GPA 3.7 w/ Honors, more then a few projects started/completed on GitHub, and I have one coop work term completed as a Test Analyst for a bank. Test Analyst was a QA/Tech Support role for stock traders/stock trader software. Also a weird half coop as a jr developer that I was terminated from I won't go into much detail, but this coincided on my last day of probation, and I completed a full-stack POS terminal (using C#, .NET, HTML/CSS, and JQuery) the day I was terminated and I can't put this on my resume because of being fired I feel or get a reference.  
I can't find a job to save my life currently. I have bought Cracking the Coding Interview and have read a good portion. Applying to about 5-10 jobs a day through my schools career site, indeed, Angel, TalentEgg, Glassdoor, and other various job boards, for entry level and internship roles. 

ANY ADVICE? I feel totally f*cked, even though I know I took a lot of steps in the right direction and excelled beyond a lot of class peers in terms of understanding concepts. I have been unemployed since that last jr software dev job which was almost 2 months ago now. What gives in this market, I am by no means a unicorn developer and I am not looking to work in a crazy unicorn start up, just looking for experience and a job.

My fear is that its because I don't have a degree and that I don't have any dev intern experience. No one gives ppl a chance these days?

INFO: Toronto based, good resume and cover letter, not desperate but finding this post-grad process insanely hard."

I like math, science, and being able to learn things that related to my own ability to learn quicker and faster. But I have a learning disability so a homework that takes someone 1-hour to do takes me 4-5 hours unless I have done something similar in the past. I also enjoy financial planning and stock watching, as well as reselling on ebay. 

I have built computers, troubleshooted information, built a website, modded games. I tend to break part consoles and repair them, then sell them. Though I do not know if I could finish the schooling and get a competitive engineering job while accounting seems more safe and secure (for outside hobbies).  

According to my research so far: 

Accounting Pros - 

* Ability to work in most cities 

* Everyone needs an accountant 

* Flexibility, high time off in non-peak hours 

* Can get any business job 

* Can start your own business 

* Large growth 

* Once you get public experience, your skill set will be in demand in almost any industry 

Accounting Cons -

* Long hours in public

* Dealing with business students 

* Not really ""passion-driven"" industry

* The work atmosphere can be more toxic 

* More credentials are needed (CAP, Masters). The schooling is less for education and more for work-related information. 

-------------------
Engineering Pros - 

* Ability to think, problem solve, and relate to the world

* Engineering students are usually some of the best and brightest to work with and they can push you to learn new things 

* Higher pay, lower hours are potentially easier to attain 

* Life long passion for learning if successful 

* Once you get a job, your skill set will be demanded in almost any organization unless you are put into a dead-end position 

Engineering Cons -

* Slow growth for entry level positions leaves many flooding into computer related fields 

* Dealing with engineering professors and risk failing, dealing with arrogant engineers

* Potentially low GPA metric means lower chances for scholarships, jobs, internships.

* A fear of failure and causing someone to die. Though they tend to compensate by over-estimating EVERYTHING from what I read. 

* The work atmosphere can be static without direction 

* Lots of self-study to keep up with technology

So basically I'm a 24-year-old chef. I'm on a degree course in my second year(BSc Applied Computing degree. http://www.stir.ac.uk/undergraduate-study/course-information/courses-a-to-z/school-of-natural-sciences/applied-computing/)

So I have gained an HNC in Software Development (will gain an HND after the second year) and a vendor certificate. Plus most importantly I love what I'm learning. I absolutely love the whole debugging code and trying to get it to work. It makes it difficult to sometimes go into work, to be honest.

My question is I don't know if my current job has many transferable skills related to Software Development which actually scares me. Do you think this is so? Also, would you in my position try to leave the world of cheffing for a more techy job before looking for an internship/future Software job? (My only worry with this option is it's quite difficult to find any local jobs in admin/helpdesk work and I don't feel qualified at all for even the lowest tier of IT positions)

I'm going through local software companies and emailing them about the prospect of getting some work experience days at a few them. My course has a mandatory summer work experience between 3rd and 4th year but I thought it'd be good for me and my CV to get some before looking for internships.

Plus over the next few months, I've made a detailed list of goals and aims when it comes to coding and that to try and build a little portfolio of programs. Also, I've booked an appointment at my universities careers centre to discuss my CV and gain their insight.

TLDR: Worried I have no skills anyone will want and at 24 it'll be a hard to slog to get those skills."

Help from current and Alumni EE students,jeremyolar,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/4yy9sq/electrical_engineering_concentrations_help_from/,"Hi! I'm an EE Major and still have yet to decide what concentration of EE that I will look into. As there are different 14 concentrations listed on the website. 

I narrowed down my choices to the following:

-Analog Circuits

-Digital VLSI Circuits

-Embedded Computing Systems

-Power Electronics

-Controls

I read the reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/3v6ra3/electrical_engineering_concentrations/

I believe there is a high number of EE Major in reddit and I would like to ask a few questions: 
*How difficult are the classes?

*Is there a high chance that you will sleep overnight in school?

*Who are the professors/advisors that I can talk to about this?

*Among the 5 concentrations, are there any 
professors that is really stressful and are there really good professors?(From what I know, James Peckol will 'break your fingers' and Scott Hauck for EE271 is a really loveable professor)

*If there are any graduates willing to answer, How hard is it to get a job?(with respect to the concentrations you have taken)

*Is internship programs/ research programs easy to find ?

I would really appreciate if anyone (an EE major) would answer this questions(with experience and respective to the concentrations you have taken). 

As of right now, I do not know which one interests me the most(from reading the description of classes and each concentration)
So Help would be really appreciated

To Whom this May Concerns:

Since the beginning of my nursing education, and now into my nursing practice, my aim is to be a nurse who can provide the best quality of care at a high level of intensity and skill. I believe that the philosophy of St.Joseph’s Medical Center would not only align with my own, but would challenge me to continue to strive for excellence in my nursing craft. Improving the quality of life of my clients is my passion. I am motivated through generating results and using evidence based research to improve my knowledge as a nurse. 

In my present role as RN supervisor, I coordinate and direct care to individual and families using a holistic approach. I collaborate with a group of 20 nursing staff and other members of the healthcare team to care for chronic and acutely ill patients. Most of the time I provide leadership and support for staff and patients, but I also provide direct patient care on a regular basis. This position enables me to have experience in caring for a diverse number of patients with multiple diagnosis &amp; treatments, including those with COPD, infections, amputations, and other medical conditions. In this fast paced environment, I am constantly refining my clinical judgment, reviewing patient specific disease processes, and self-reflecting on my level of care to consistently provide excellent patient care. 

While my current position is not considered acute care, I consistently strive to grow as a better nurse, as evident by my certifications in ALCS, PALS, NIHSS, and EKG monitoring. I am also actively pursuing the NRP and TNCC certifications. I am experienced with IV's, wound care, CVCs, PICC lines, interdisplinary team collaboration, and developing plan of care. I am confident my evolving clinical skills, collaborative readiness, and positive receptiveness to feedback would be a great asset to the nursing team and department. My certifications, education and experience will enhance your organization. 

I believe that I would be a great addition to the St. Joseph’s and Dignity Health team. I would be grateful for an opportunity to meet with you and discuss further about my application and qualifications for this position. 
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration

It is very hard to get an internships that the school allows for international students so I tried to get a school internships but a lot of jobs are unrelated to my major (managerial economics) or requires too much time commitment as I am taking 16-18 units per semester. I have joined a club that is related to my major and specifically what I want to pursue (fashion merchandizing and marketing). I know that internships are very important, so much to say that it is way more important than GPA (which I agree). But with the current situation I am in, would club activity look good enough on resume? Ofcourse it is not as fancy schmancy as internship but I am doing what I feel like its best for me, but I also feel like there is something missing.

* Would not consider myself *strong* at any language, although I am decent with at least two
* Not at a ""strong"" CS school

I've messed up badly by not being more proactive about my situation. If you were in my position, what would you do to have a shot at getting a job? I'm trying to brush up on all of the essential topics, and I'm working on putting together an app but I know this is insufficient.

4yz95r,4,2016-08-22,"Wandering in circles, need a small nudge to wander elsewhere",onetallmofo89,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4yz95r/wandering_in_circles_need_a_small_nudge_to_wander/,"Hello, I am posting here because I am really lost job wise (27 male north east USA).  I followed a parent's advice because I have made it known that I need to go back to school for something while I am currently working, community college just for a few courses.  

I looked up engineering course work and my ego crumbled the pre-cal (prob still suck hard at math, quick calculations np but non-tangible ideas and thoughts lose me quick), physics (which I think I can pick up) but the rest just felt like maybe I overgeneralized and lost interest real quick.  Maybe it was a naive brief dream, I don't know, but my gut was quiet and did not feel like a huge disappointment a few hours later.

My current job is with the federal government.  The pay is ehh for my age (maybe? high 30's for tri-state).  I started working at this job about a year ago.  It's not permanent and that's ok because I wanted to go back to school during the off-periods.  It's an afternoon-to late evening job so it freed up my mornings but I can't see myself doing this job for another year or career.  Hearing people talk about retirement packages already makes me cringe and gets scared I am going to get trapped here.  I know the younger I am the easier it is to move.

I know this is not really relevant to this subreddit but the desire to find a career path is important because it is spearheaded by my at home life.  My dad had a traumatic brain injury a few years ago, likely bedridden for the rest of his life/minimal conscious state, and I take care of him with my mom and two siblings.  I come home, give him some medicine and help change his diaper after work and wake up in the morning and before work.  Before I got this job, I was doing that all day with my mom from time to time.  I want to get on a more determined career path to help take care of them and it would help my mental and emotional health.  I am a bit binded at home to help but the option to move is there.  I want to be able to go back to school and learn new skills so by the time I finish my family will move or go into more long term care strategy (new home, etc).

I graduated with a bachelors in business administration from a local college.  It was a bland and generalized degree which I never regretted but I feel I should have interned and maybe expanded myself more without the limitations of the course work (more excel skills) but I've gotten over that.

I quite frankly have no freaking idea.  I usually do not get envious at all but just reading and hearing about people on the path to their career or already on the long path of their career goals makes me incredibly envious.  They are likely not working dream like jobs but going to work day to day that you are working the top of your skills and work would feel rewarding for me.  This current job just feels like a very nerdy hobby and my co-workers make me look like an ambitious driven person their yet I am completely lost on the inside.

Interests are reading, video games (though job direction could finally make me quit playing); which im happy for) and watching sports basketball/football/euro soccer and playing basketball and lifting.  

Career/interests (things i like; generalizations I know)
politics - always liked the layers of politics from local to state to federal and the ripple of effects from policy but I just think pol science is too much of a risky major and I don't know if it'll pay even decent in a few years in the field.

Investing/banking - I've liked researching and reading up/discussing IPOs and mergers/acquistions when I can but I don't think I could put the time into it and craze like some people can.  May have missed the career for that seeing as most people my age are now associates or on the long term career path in their respective firms.

Sports - Nike/Jordan/Under Armour would be nice but most corp offices are far off and the skills they were require are a bit tricky but then again a bit lost on me (MBA is out of the question till much more career exp).  Would be cool to work on behalf of them or work for a professional/near professional sports team, being the competitive a-hole I can be sometimes.  Not interested in coaching in any sport.

Insurance underwriting - went on job interviews and briefly worked in some areas but the firms I worked/interviewed for were a bit sketchy.  Open to it because my dad worked in the insurance and his job coincided with underwriters.  

Law - I really like see the loopholes and studying arguments in courts or just in mediation but I have no desire to do law school.  I probably wouldnt have been able to even do well on the LSAT, I just struggle with standardized tests. Really liked intellectually property law but no law school and engineering hinders me on that too

Engineering - I know it's broad but I looked into it but just felt the coursework would be too much for me, listed above the reasons but I could be open to exploring it again in the future.

Pharmaceutical - I had a fam member work for a big company out the in the central USA area but she mainly focused on administrative work and those were where most of her connects were before she retired a few months ago. I would like to explore it more especially coupled with my intellectual property but I think I could only work in this industry thru the business angle and not the science one.

Music - listen to a lot of music, go to a few friends new band concerts but I have no musical talent and don't think a producer or sound engineer is too risky/over-saturated market.  Sigur Ros to Wu Tang to Tool to Isaac Hayes to Tricky to Mozart, I enjoy all types of music but don't see a career or reliable one for me.

Hospital/Health administration - Looked into it briefly and liked it but never really trusted the graduate programs for it and didn't see a lot of courses in non-graduate to get a feel with it.  Didn't want to pay a lot of money for a job that will start off maybe a bit more then what im making now.  Still open but very skeptical of the programs nearby especially seeing it on TV all the time made me more hesitant.  

career/interests (not interested in)

Accounting - good job market but no thanks, brother majoring in it and reading his text books and helping him with his internships have turned me off completely.  Have no desire to explore it or even go to school with it.

Nursing/therapy - too many rehab homes/nursing homes/hospital visits with my dad to really ever have any desire to work in the field; had a lot of bad therapists and nurses - jaded on that industry.  Looked into respiratory therapy but didn't like the career growth and flexibility.

Writer/journalist - I don't like writing. I like reading from time to time but yeah, no - no thanks on writing.  Maybe a hobby, but no desire for a career from either of the two.

Language - I've always been interested in learning languages.  Took Spanish and then German a bit in high school but briefly flirted with both in college and listen to Spanish/German stuff for sports/other things but have no desire to make languages my focal career point.  Always liked languages to open the door to travel further.

There's prob a bit more for both but these are the bread and butter, did not intend to insult any career path or person but these descriptions - just thoughts from a person who's lost and looking thru the abyss. 

I appreciate you reading all of this and I know it's still oversimplified but I just need some guidance.  I don't mind putting the work and doing the work to learn more and go to the career path but it's just finding it.  I'd just love a career/job that I can trust my gut and have everything fall in place after I work towards it (hopefully social life and relationship can get better too, to the next topic! just kidding)  Thanks again for your time and any advice you give.

Good GPA, unknown GRE scores, great LORs and SOPs/Research Statement. Worried that the type of person and work that I am is incompatible with the PhD lifestyle. My dream career involves teaching undergraduate students or becoming a science editor/grant editor. Research interests include parasitology, allergies, and IgE-mediated disease states.**

I graduated this May from the University of Vermont’s Medical Laboratory Science program. I passed my board exams and am an American Society of Clinical Pathology certified Medical Laboratory Scientist. I currently work at a monoclonal antibody production company where I began as an intern 2.5 years ago (I’m an employee now).

As the application cycle for this year approaches, frankly I’m terrified that I’m not a competitive enough candidate for PhD programs. I knew early on during my undergrad years that a hospital-based lab tech job was not for me; I have planned for many years to pursue a PhD with the end-goal of being an academic professor/lecturer someday, or a professional editor/grant writer.

I feel very passionately about learning more, developing my laboratory skills, and asking the important questions. I know grad school is not undergrad 2.0; I am mentally prepared to take on graduate school as a profession and learn how to become an independent researcher and academic. But lately, so much self-doubt has been setting in…

My professors in undergrad have encouraged me to apply to top-tier schools: Stanford, UNC-Chapel Hill, Georgetown. I do not believe my application is good enough for these schools, nor do I want to attend institutions like these. I am more interested in the following schools: U Washington, UC Boulder, UC Denver, Dartmouth, UVM, UNH, U Michigan.

My undergrad GPA was a 3.54. I only got 3 C’s in college, all in chemistry/organic chemistry courses. I got A’s in all of my major specific courses (Immunology, Pathology, Microbiology, Genetics, Parasitology, Hematology, etc.)

I have not taken the GREs yet; I am scheduled for October 1st. I did poorly on the SAT and very well on the ACT in high school. I’m going to assume my GRE scores will be average (155V/155Q/5W).

I will have fantastic LORs for my application and a very strong SOP/Research Statement. I am a strong writer and have been told I am very capable at conveying scientific information to an audience. Additionally, I am a decent public speaker and perform well in interviews.

I’m just so worried that I’m not qualified enough for these graduate programs… The average GRE scores/GPA for accepted students at almost all of these programs are 158V/158Q and 3.8, respectively.
I also worry that what I want out of life is incompatible with the PhD I want to pursue…for example, I would like to settle down in a rural area (not a city person). I want to get married and have a child in the next 5 to 10 years. I don’t know if I can compromise traveling the country and living in locations I dislike just to get the job. And I have a SO that I am beginning to plan my life with, and I worry so much about our relationship and going long-distance. I have also learned (basically after reading this sub so much) that the way I like to operate in a lab doesn’t seem to be the way academic labs are run. For example, I’ll put in significantly more week-work hours if it means I don’t have to work the weekend. I am a very team-based worker and enjoy consulting other employees for help/wit questions. I worry that the kind of worker I want to be is incompatible with the realities of being a PhD student.

I am very capable in a laboratory setting and feel confident in my lab skills. A short list of my skills includes: tissue culture, mouse handling/immunizations/euthanasia, PCR, basic gene sequencing, various ELISAs, protein purification, antibody isotyping.

The research I have performed at my lab revolves around the various binding epitopes on coagulation factors that our antibodies bind to and determining whether our antibodies bind to the zymogen or the activated factor. On a personal level, I am highly interested in parasitology and mechanisms of eosinophilia that encompass various helminth infections; I am also interested in the overlap between IgE-mediated allergic reactions and how these may be similar to/different from IgE responses during parasitic infections. Unfortunately I have yet to find a single lab on my list of schools that studies parasitology or allergies.

Any honest opinions about how competitive my application is?"

So I am thinking about transferring to a large university, like the University of Florida, Florida State, UNC, Georgia, etc,. The reason being, my major is almost useless if I don't go to a major division one university with the best possible internships, because of how competitive it gets. After this full year, my hope is to have between a 3.5 and 4.0 GPA at my current school. If I go to a large D1 school like this, the cost of attendance with out-of-state tuition can get near $40,000, if not more! My parents have recently been making way more money than they ever have ($150k+), and I will get little to no money at all from FAFSA. I personally can't afford this, and my parents recent income has come after a very hard couple of years when I was in junior high school, where they were both bouncing between unemployment and temp jobs because of the recession. My parents don't have the money to help me out yet, and I don't have the money either. My dad has an associates degree and my mom dropped out of UCLA in her third year to move to New York with my dad (dumb decision..), and my grandparents were highly educated (BS from UCLA and MBA from USC) so I won't get any ""first generation college student"" grants/scholarships. With my GPA, how much do you think I can expect to get through scholarships? I really would love to start my Sophomore year at a school like the ones I stated, but I'm not sure I can afford it, and I don't want to waste my degree at a SUNY (not that these aren't great schools, I just don't think I'll get anywhere with a Sports Management degree in central/western New York). If you guys have any experience or advice with academic scholarships and what is required, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you all so much!"

I'm a MS in CS student at a good-not-great university. I have completed three previous internships, and will be interning at Google starting next week for the fall semester. I already have a great full time offer from my summer internship company, and hope to get an offer from Google after my internship there, but I do want to apply to some other companies as well.

Should I apply now for new grad positions or wait until December? Interviewing while working full time would be tough, but I know that a lot of the jobs that I would be interested in fill up early. Advice?

Also, if I should apply now, should I put Google on my resume even though I haven't *actually* started yet?

I interviewed at a couple other places but was rejected, and took this job (I really wanted to stay in the town that I went to uni in, at least for a few more years). There aren't an incredible amount of tech companies here, so take that into account. At first I was kind of disappointed with the environment, as there are only a few other local people at the company (and I'm the only tech person in the office), but I've come to realize that it could be pretty sweet--the main guy I work with (who works remotely) is very understanding and detail-oriented, and I've definitely learned a lot from working with him so far (I had no internships during my time at uni). I can also work from home a couple days a week, and the work is pretty flexible. 

That said, a few thoughts linger in my mind. I a currently working hourly, and when I was asked for my “desired pay” I stated $32/hr (based roughly off the average starting CS major pay of ~60k). I expected my boss to counter-offer, but he went with that number without any sign of rebuttal. I don’t get any benefits, so in retrospect I feel like I should have now gone for a higher number, but at the time I thought I was high-balling anyways. I feel like after another couple of months, I could negotiate a salary, but the flexibility that the job has offered so far has been awesome. 

Second, working with one other developer is definitely a smaller team than I ideally wanted. Any tips for maximizing the amount of learning/growth at this job in terms of long-term career development? I could see myself working here for 1-2 years as is, although I expect the amount of developers at the company to grow in that time, which would maybe make me want to stay (even though I will probably want to leave the town by then)."

These students are probably paid on the lower end near minimum wage. 

Currently, the company is using a web development firm to manage changes to their website, but they have become frustrated with the time it takes to make changes and want to switch to in house development. I killed the pre-interview questions as well as the interview, and I was told to expect a call this afternoon. 

Pretty great, right? My problem is that I am worried that they will seriously low-ball me when it comes to pay. Especially since the position (found through my school) was labeled as an ""internship"" even though I was told to be ready to work hard, and even to be ready to answer the phone at night. I'm willing to work my ass off, I'm confident I can juggle it with school well, but I'm not going to be willing to do it for some lowball price like $12/hr.

4z22s5,6,2016-08-22,I was bullied by my roommate at home and at work. How do I get over this?,blue_teapot8284,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4z22s5/i_was_bullied_by_my_roommate_at_home_and_at_work/,"The person I moved in with in May (she's 28, I'm 24F and we're in the same Masters program) basically went full on crazy on me within 2 months of living together. She has moved out but not after actively working on making my life hell and stymieing my ability to get work done and network at the internship we both had this summer. 

It started out with her asking if we could not eat lunch together at work and have separate friends. I did the feel like I could say no, you have to include me but it was really weird. She escalated from there by making me feel uncomfortable at home. She was incredibly  passive aggressive. She'd be loud when I'd try to go to sleep, take over when whole fridge and freezer, and told me it was making her physically sick to live with someone else. She made me agree to a bathroom schedule where for a certain amount of time I couldn't even knock or get something. We'd previously been on different schedules but she started getting ready for and leaving for work at the same time I had been. She would also leave the kitchen a mess so I wouldn't be able to use it unless I cleaned up after her or she'd start cooking at the same time, or complain about being starving. She also set up two routers in the apartment - one network that I could access and one I couldn't. We paid for 30 mbps but I never measured more than 5. I had a hard time even watching YouTube videos but she had no problems streaming in HD. When I asked if she also had problems with the Internet she would say she was also really frustrated with how slow it was. I'm pretty sure she was throttling my bandwidth with the two router setup. She also wanted to talk about her life all the time and was constantly looking for reassurance of her own worth and that we were friends and that I was impressed by her. She would frequently send me we need to talk texts and then make me feel like it was my fault that it made me panic and that I should trust her to be reasonable. 
At work, she would whisper about me to other people in our cube neighborhood, tell other interns that I was obsessed with her and was always trying to get invited to do things, always wanted to know where she was. (I found this out because another intern at work told me about what was going on and said she was sorry I had to put up with this girl). She made me feel guilty because she was being paid less than I was (it was a research job and I have a BS in a hard science with considerable research experience and she does not).

Everything came to a head when she told me she was moving out to live by herself. I was overjoyed. We went out for a beer together to discuss but it turned out later she didn't give me all of the information I needed. She told me she had found a place and was moving out within the week and wanted to find someone to take over the rent immediately. I said I wouldn't agree to anyone I didn't have the chance to meet. She sent a snippy email saying of course she would and was offended that I didn't think better of her. 
I interviewed 9 people and chose a Fulbright scholar who was abroad because I thought she needed a place as soon as possible. My roommate did not tell me the building required a credit check and wanted me to tell this girl no because she was taking too long to respond to things and she was worried her international status. My roommate went behind my back to demand a commitment from this girl that she would start paying even before the paperwork was finished because she didn't want to pay double rent. In her defense, we live in a very expensive city. 

The girl backed out because she felt like I hadn't been upfront with her about the steps necessary or when she would have to start paying. My roommate confronted me at work in front of our coworkers and accused me of trying to screw her over, being dishonest and tried to get me to agree to take over her portion on the rent by 2 weeks out because I was taking too long to find someone. On my dad's advice, I contacted HR because I couldn't take her anymore. 

She was instructed to leave me alone at work and they moved my cube to be away from the her. I also told the director of our graduate program  (it's very small) and requested we not be put in the same groups for group projects. 

I'm really worried that she's going to besmirch me and prevent me from connecting to the people in our program. I'm afraid that she's going to yell at me in front of people. I know that she's not particularly well liked in our program and I know there are people who will stick up for me (my significant other was with me through all of this and also wants to keep me safe from this person), but this entire thing had been really overwhelming because my mother was BPD and there were a lot of similarities between her behavior and my mother's. 

What do I do from here? How do I let this go and move on from my life?"

I graduated from a notable university in Canada, majored in electrical engineering. Have internships, 2 of which are relevant, all were software related. I have been trying to delve into the software field.

I have been getting interviews, and initially I couldn't even get past the first phone screen. Then I started getting past that but then I couldn't get past the first technical phone screen or coding challenge. Recently I have been getting past those too. 

I have been practicing coding problems and learning CS concepts. I'm getting better at giving interviews, I can feel that but I'm wondering what happens if I don't manage to get a job for a long time. 

It's already been 3 months, if say I am still unemployed by like January what will I say when companies as what I did the whole time? I don't think that ""teaching myself programming"" would be a good response to that. Should I try to pursue a master's in CS? Though I'm sure getting into a master's program for CS has its own requirements.

My interest lies in game development and I have gotten interviews from 2 companies in that field, the first one I failed in the first round. The 2nd one which I failed in the third round recently (improvement, but empty handed at the end still). 

I don't know how long it will take for me to find a job, and I don't know how I will be judged by companies if I stay unemployed for too long.

Long time lurker, first time poster; was hoping you fine folks could help me with a quick smell test.

IT is half my job because I am in a smaller organization.  My passion is the operations side of running big systems, so I am a bit naive in corporate IT.

Earlier this week, my intern was verifying warranty status with the manufacturer for some newly purchased workstations in our inventory system and noticed that manufacturer's start date of the warranty was from May despite the products being ordered and purchased this month!  (Note this is a 3 year warranty; vendor lists it as 3 years on the order detail page).  

I would understand if there was a bit of slack time due to supply chain, but May to Aug seems very excessive.  It does seem like the manufacturer understands this as well, as they do seem to grant extra time at the end of the warranty (July vs May), but that is still one month short from the purchase date.

So short version: I would expect the warranty to start on or about the purchase date.  Is this naive or is my vendor being shady?

I recently graduated community college (3 months ago, to be specific). I had posted quite a few times on reddit seeking job hunting advice as I still haven't found work, and many of them suggested seeking the help of a Tech Recruiter (as I graduated with an A.A.S. in Programming). I've contacted multiple recruiters from various companies, gave them my resume and contact information, and haven't had any issues with it until now.

One day I was going on one of the websites for a recruiting company I've contacted in hopes of seeking information about jobs in my area. I stumbled upon a section of the site about talent information, and decided that I would look at my profile to see what was on it out of curiosity. I found that the recruiter posted information saying ""she is a talented developer with 4 years work experience in education"" on my profile. I don't have any work experience at all and I've told the recruiter this. All I have as far as experience is a 5 month internship at my college and a completed project. 

I know that if an employer saw this work experience information, hired me for a job, and found out I didn't have any of this experience, I would be fired immediately for lying on an application. So I don't understand why a tech recruiter is posting this false information about me. I also don't know why they're posting my gender, as I know an employer can't inquire about this information without consent. The recruiter never asked for my permission to disclose my gender.

I was seen as a drug addict by my parents. Next thing you know, I started drinking, but not just any drinking, BINGE DRINKING. I'd get fucked up, blackout drunk, then I'd go home, stumbling, and get yelled at.



 All the while I've been a successful honors student, going to a top tier college, completed internships, etc. I just graduated high school with honors and 5 chords, the first in my family to do so. I helped 20 kids graduate by doing all of their final essays, making over $500 in a week. They think I'm a fuckup with lots of potential.

 I've done loads and loads of cocaine and xanax, and in addition, just seem to have this void in my life that cannot be filled. I've never had a girlfriend, have had constant family problems, and never have felt true happiness. I bet my dopamine receptors are pretty fucked up as it is, but I can't quite feel happniess at all. I've urged my parents to take me to a psychologist, but they've been quite negligent. I went to rehab classes and then once I graduated I relapsed, because I simply wanted to graduate to show my parents I wasn't a drug addict.

 1 week ago, I was mixing xanax and alcohol, lost $300 and my wallet, stumbled into a fast food location, and was arrested for public intoxication. I was brought home to my parents, then subsequently, just went to bed. The next day, I got high as fuck, and got in trouble with my parents for coming home with red eyes. I've caused my parents so much misery, that I can't even imagine how they feel, because I feel like nothing really matters in life. I just shrug it off, and I do think about it, but I don't really understand. I know I have emotions and intelligence, but I don't really have empathy. I don't understand. My parents said while I was on xanax that I was threatening to kill myself, and even my dad? I don't know, I've been sober for a week and my head hurts like a bitch. Maybe it's a fried feeling I've obtained over the years by overworking my serotonin and dopamine receptors, or maybe it's just me. Over the years, I've been kicked out and beaten by my father, stayed with friends etc. I haven't really lived the life I intended to. I believe I have mental health issues, but my parents just don't understand. My life has this void that can't be filled. I'm just indifferent. Maybe it's depression or something, but given the fact that all of this shit has happened has made me want to just stop, think, probably just end it. It sounds cowardly yes, and I probably won't end it either way. I have too much in store for me in the future. If my parents had just taken me to a psychologist years back and let me smoke weed, maybe I wouldn't have had such a problematic life so early. It is a shame to admit all of this, but this is why I'm using a throwaway. I'm disgusted at myself, but don't really know how to feel. I'm just me. I'm going off to college in 3 weeks and feel like I don't need to be babied anymore. I feel too dependent on my parents, which I shouldn't be. I feel like a leach for even existing. My brothers make me feel bad that they're even helping me go to college, for even having faith in this lying sack of shit drug addict. Goddamn, just today I was to have one guest, a friend I haven't seen in three months, and when I closed the door to my room, it began reeking like weed. To say the least, my parents knocked on the door, kicked him the fuck out and told him never to come back, then proceeded to yell at me and tell me what a disappointment I've been. I didn't even smoke weed or anticipate my friend bringing weed, nevertheless he had it in a jar. He had enough kindness to drop off a nug in a secret location in my neighborhood for me to pickup later on, I'll probably be walking my dog later to pick it up in secret. I'm being surveillanced as it is. They tell me they're scared to live with me, and now I guess I'm supposed to live with that knowledge. It sucks being me at the moment, and I for one, despise my life right now. Hopefully it betters as I go to college. My dad cried today since he smelled weed on my friend, and I couldn't wrap my head around why I still deal with this? I don't feel bad that I got caught, I feel bad that I have to hear the same thing over and over again. It is really a shame that I've lived the life I've lived with such supportive parents, and have disappointed the fuck out of them, but for some reason, I don't really care. Nothing in life really matters to me, and I'm going to college for something I don't even know if I want to do. As long as it gives me a fresh start in a new city, I'm happy. I'm ready to move the fuck out of here. Advice?"

Specifically, I'm passionate about applying technology and data to health care, whether that means digital health or developing drugs.

But because I cannot code very proficiently (only did a little bit of scripting in MATLAB for data analysis) and I did not specialize in fields relevant to most tech companies (computer science, applied math, physics, etc), I'm finding it rather difficult to find a job in tech.
It also doesn't help that neurobiology is highly inter-disciplinary, which means that although I have a Ph.D., I'm not a ""master"" practitioner of any particular field.

I think that I'm hard-working and certainly willing to learn new skills (currently studying Python to become better at coding), but it seems that companies are unwilling to take a chance on someone with a unconventional background like mine, since I don't really belong to any of the divisions at companies, such as engineering/product development, business development, marketing, and sales.

As such, I'm thinking that an internship might change my fortunes, and perhaps could make my resume more relevant to the tech companies.

So the question I have is.... how can I find internship positions at tech companies/startups?

How can I get a tech internship offer?,Phdinneuroscience,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4z4b4h/im_a_scientist_with_a_phd_from_a_top_university/,"I received my Ph.D. in neurobiology, but have been interested in tech startups ever since I was a 2nd year student in grad school.
Specifically, I'm passionate about applying technology and data to health care, whether that means digital health or developing drugs.

But because I cannot code very proficiently (only did a little bit of scripting in MATLAB for data analysis) and I did not specialize in fields relevant to most tech companies (computer science, applied math, physics, etc), I'm finding it rather difficult to find a job in tech.
It also doesn't help that neurobiology is highly inter-disciplinary, which means that although I have a Ph.D., I'm not a ""master"" practitioner of any particular field.

I think that I'm hard-working and certainly willing to learn new skills (currently studying Python to become better at coding), but it seems that companies are unwilling to take a chance on someone with a unconventional background like mine, since I don't really belong to any of the divisions at companies, such as engineering/product development, business development, marketing, and sales.

As such, I'm thinking that an internship might change my fortunes, and perhaps could make my resume more relevant to the tech companies.

So the question I have is.... how can I find internship positions at tech companies/startups?

I got a D+ in a math class and it brought my GPA down from a 3.3 . I've got 2 yrs to get it back up and then transfer to a CSU or lower tier UC (university of California system). My GPA, super harsh grader but awesome professor, and math has given me some big questions I need help with. 

The best CS professor at my college is big on grade deflation. 2 people got 95% in the intro to c++ class and only 5 got B's. This was after 10 people out of 25 dropped the course. He is known for being a harsh grader and gets excited when the class average on an exam is 75%. I don't get why he teaches like it's a UC and not a community college. I don't want to sound mean, but people sometimes go to community colleges because they didn't have the best grades (including me). I'm at one because of money and my high school GPA was a 3.2, so why bother trying. My parents seem to never get it when I tell them about his grading. They are upset that I can't get A's in his classes, my only available major classes BTW (I always get A's in General Ed classes), and they've got me highly anxious now. This is likely my last class with him. How badly will his grade deflation hurt me in the short and long term? It seems like his class will be a GPA stunt or something. How do you get through these types of professors with a grade above a C+ (C++ pun intended)? 

Another worry is math. I usually get low B's or high C's in math, because math isn't my thing. I don't know why I'm better at programming than math, maybe it's a mental thing (I've heard they are similar). I've talked to a lot of people in the CS field who almost never use math beyond Algebra or ""cheat"" with google and stuff. I only need 2 yrs of it at this college and then it's pretty much over. I've heard that some specialties need zero to one elective math class at one of my potential universities. I won't be going into those field that produce people who invent languages or show stopping AI. How important is math beyond Calc for software or IT or programming or web dev. ? Again, math seems to be another GPA stunt.

And lastly, a question this sub gets a lot, is how will my GPA affect me in getting work? I have no confidence in me ever landing a Google job or anything. I'd be happy with a medium company or a typical heartless corporation or some bank that pays me $65,000+. I plan on doing internships, playing around with code (AKA personal projects), applying my code to my hobby in robotics, and getting my degree with at least a 3.0 GPA. I'm a social media director for a club at my school because I need something to put on my resume, make me take fun breaks doing fun stuff with Photoshop, and force me to go to social events. I do online transcription work (social anxiety, the last fast food job I had nearly killed my GPA, and the typical funky class schedule) and have a minimal social life because I'm so worried about my GPA affecting my job chances. My parents put school over everything, so that's also a thing. 

Any advice is appreciated!

I've been applying to jobs all over the US including but not limited to CA, NY, KY, CT, WA, TX, and CO.

Applying out of state is awful because as soon as I tell the recruiter that I'm from out of state it seems like I pretty much seal my fate. I am willing to travel for interviews if they seem promising.

I know it's a number game, but I must have applied to a million places by now.

I've applied for both Software Engineering and Web Development roles. I'm in KY but I've been applying in CA with my uncles address (he has a spare house he said I could stay at if I need to).

I've only had maybe 3 interviews and like I said, as soon as I say I'm out of state (like they don't see my address on my resume) it seems as if I'm done. The interviews themselves went very well I thought. I spoke very clearly and confidently, and answered all or most of the questions with ease.

I really want to begin working and building my career. I'm not picky about pay (basically I will take about anything that is paid), I am willing to work overtime, I am willing to be on call on the weekends. I am not being picky about what I need to do or my roles. If they want someone that will work overtime, I will be that person.

I didn't go to a top school or anything, but I would say it was at least average. Ideally, I want a web dev role but I am willing to get into just about anything.


I'm willing to consider just about any state (although I would like to stay away from the South, just because that is part of the reason I am applying out of state and I've lived in the south my entire life). I went to school in CT though.


I have 3 resumes for different locations/roles right now:

1) http://rohanharrison.com/resume/RohanHarrisonResume.pdf

2) http://rohanharrison.com/resume/RohanHarrisonResume1.pdf

3) http://rohanharrison.com/resume/RohanHarrisonResume2.pdf


I have a website, which I think looks decent:

1) http://rohanharrison.com/

A Github, which I admit could have a bit more:

1) https://github.com/rohanharrison?tab=repositories

And a Linkedin:

1) https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanvharrison


It boggles my mind that I haven't had any real luck. My internship actually reached out to me last week and basically asked if I wanted a job, I replied with yes and they never got back to me. My boss messaged me on Linkedin and I replied there. I also sent an email yesterday in case he doesn't check Linkedin much.

I know it's a numbers and waiting game, but I'm really sick of waiting at home, not making money, not working, having no purpose, and living in this awful state. I don't even know what to do. I've applied with Glassdoor, Indeed, Linkedin Jobs (I got the Linkedin Premium Trial).


My internship background was mainly .NET/ASP.net stuff with Microsoft SQL. My personal experience is more towards Web Dev with PHP/JavaScript/jQuery/HTMl/CSS/MYSQL, etc. In school our default language was Java, but we also used many other languages and frameworks.


Please for the love of god, tell me what I need to change or do differently. I am out of ideas and I want to be out of here so soon. My parents have been (thankfully) very supportive and have tried to help me, but my dad being in a different field does not have many connections in software/development.

4z4p79,1,2016-08-23,Asking for promotion / raise too early?,csthrowaway1666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4z4p79/asking_for_promotion_raise_too_early/,"Hey all,

So I'm 3 months into my job as a Junior Software Developer, and I'm considering of bringing up the possibility of promoting me from Jr to....not Jr, so Software Developer.  

**Some background**:  This is my first job out of college and I had no internships.  Only 2 side projects that weren't that impressive I feel, but apparently I did exceptional in the interview.  How much they were impressed with my interview has come up a couple of times since starting ( I honestly thought I completely bombed my phone interview with them).  I was offered a 60k salary and had no other offers lined up.  The company is situated in the LA area ( silicon beach/santa monica ), where apparently my current salary is significantly(?) under market.  I was planning on bringing up that I am attempting to save money to move closer and pay off student loans instead of outright asking for more money.


I'm not sure of typical Junior responsibilities so part of this post is confirming if I'm way over my head and am doing what every Junior is expected to do anyway.
The following can pretty much sum up my time so far at this company:

* I am currently working on building a new API along with one other Senior Developer.  The bosses seem to be very happy with our progress and we have exceeded the deadline expectations so far.  
* Been involved with a couple of calls with high level managers from important partners where I was expected to and did answer a few questions / concerns they had.
* Onboarding new developers (about 4 devs (one who left after 1 week ) whom are all also 5+ years of experience)
* Refactored a very delicate and major part of an existing service, which significantly sped up the process while also making it less prone to breaking.  (This is also related to the calls that I mentioned I have been on, as this is mostly what they typically were regarding.  Some calls are regarding the new API I am on)
* My bosses have mentioned that I get along well with all of the other team members.  And I do actually really like all of my coworkers with one exception.
* I am typically the earliest dev to show up and the 2nd latest one to leave.  Not requested any time off yet, and have been in office every weekday. 
* Not sure it's worth noting, but I am the only native english speaker dev who is on site.



With this would negotiating for a promotion / raise be ridiculous?  Am I just at the level any Junior Dev is expected to be at?  Should I wait for at least 6 months?  

Looking for any insight.

Thanks!"

I'm starting to look around for graduate jobs and am realising that:

1) The languages I have worked with, only cover around ~40-50% of the adverts I'm seeing. (e.g I've not touched C++, .net, C#, Ruby...)

2) Even the languages I have worked with, I don't seem to know deep enough (e.g. I know nothing about JEE, Hadoop, popular python libraries, other JS frameworks).

Question: 

What to do? 

1) Quickly pick up as many other popular languages as I can and be left with an okish, but not very deep understanding of any of them.

2) Stick with just the languages I know now, and dig deeper into each one+their related technologies.

I've spent most of the past year on and industrial placement with a decent-sized software company in the CAD/CAM industry. I was placed essentially in the internal infrastructure department, developing and improving the dev tools, plus some time with the automated testing team.

The tool I worked on most, by far, was the internal testing framework we used. It reads CSV tests, written by testers, that describes the steps to take, parses them and calls the relevant function. It's written largely in Java, with a Perl frontend.

I'd like to avoid being pigeonholed as QA, so how would I describe the experience above? This internship is the only software internship in have, the other being a Technical Sales Engineer at Cisco.

LTL, very cautious poster (kinda afraid reddit will nail me to the cross if I post anything even remotely off-topic). Tonight, I'm sharing a tale with you from back when I interned at **$LCS**. [My previous story](https://redd.it/4yo0vm) will give you all the insight you need into **$LCS**. This is another tale involving **$BB**, but a clear shortage of customers.


This would be my 2nd week at **$LCS**. I've just gotten the hang of the problem report form (which was just a sheet of paper I scribbled in, and I kept it vague because we only ever really did virus scans and generic 1st-grade diagnostics). I've walked in to the store to find a new laptop sitting on the workbench, with a sheet claiming that the screen is faulty.

I turn the device on, and sure enough, I'm greeted to pink. No, not the band, or the artist, just pink. Squinting through my glasses, I can see there is an image being displayed underneath. And now, for our star of the night, **$BB** (**$BigBoss** for those who haven't seen my last story).

&gt;**$BB**: This laptop came in yesterday, I don't know how to fix it.

&gt;**$DJ** (me): It looks like there isn't much to be done, it looks like it is thoroughly f*ire tr*ucked.

&gt;**$BB**: Can you try to fix it anyway?

&gt;**$DJ['Out Loud']**: Sure, I'll give it a shot.

&gt;**$DJ['Internally']**: Sure, I'll happily procrastinate for the next hour.


Short of replacing the screen, which is what this dinosaur of a laptop needed (it really needed to be thrown out), all I could think of doing was screwing with the display settings. I suddenly remember a fix I had to a problematic monitor way back when I was still in primary school: Drop the refresh rate!

I swap the refresh rate from 60hz to 50hz, and suddenly I can see the screen again! There were still minor graphical problems, (screen would flicker and duplicate the image with a bit of an offset and transparency adjustment, as well as other things), but all in all I'd say it could be used again to recover data and transfer to a new device (without using caddys and stuff). Making a return is **$BB**.

&gt;**$BB**: Have you fixed it yet?

&gt;**$DJ**: As fixed as it's going to get. You will need to replace the screen in it if you want it any better, but it's not worth it in my opinion.

**$BB** takes this opportunity to actually take a look at the screen. He immediately notices the flickering and duplicate image.

&gt;**$BB**: This isn't fixed, why can't you fix it?

&gt;**$DJ['Internally']**: Because I'm just a lowly intern who has literally 1 week of actual experience, this is the first time I've seen this problem, and I don't have a god damn replacement screen to place into this dinosaur.

&gt;**$DJ['Out Loud']**: It isn't getting any better than this unless you order a new screen for this device. I'll go ahead and call the customer and see if this is what they want.

&gt;**$BB**: No, just fix it.

I proceeded to turn the laptop off, sign off on it, and put it on the out-bound shelf.

**TL;DR** Boss-man asks me to fix broken screen without replacement screen. I change setting to make broken screen usable. Boss-man expects me to make replacement screen materialize out of thin air.

Also sorry if this isn't really on-topic. I just desperately wanted to share another story and I only have one left I can really share apart from this, which is honestly my favourite."

Our relationship is that they are the 'investor' and we are creating/selling a more younger and a more innovative product than they do. A few months ago, I became a member of the team as an innovator (they already started in December, but nothing really happened in those months). As I noticed and recognized the troubles they were facing, things changed rapidly the previous months and due to some hard work, we were suddenly building actual products, creating a new design, new entity name and a good working environment. However, as we take 1 step forward, we soon take 22 steps backwards. 

There are some major issues in our business structure are holding us down from further growth:

- We have to show the HQ everything we are doing (from a simple Facebook post to the notes of our meetings), resulting in major delays in our work and development; 
- Every member of the team (except me) is working parttime for the startup (the other part they are working for the HQ), therefore there is a lack of clear communication and coordination within our strategy;
- We have no financial insight in the actual 'investment' (we have to show expenditures we want to make to the board of the HQ);
- Our strategy seems to change on a daily basis;
- In order to make some money and pay rent, we have to work on business from the HQ, which slows us down from creating our own business. 

Obviously, I tried to address these issues in several meetings. I feel that everyone is aware of the problems, but somehow nothing is really changing. It is very frustrating for me. Nevertheless, I am trying to keep the team motivation alive every single day... but as the days go by, I feel that in de end, we are going to fail. 

I am working at the company under an internship contract. I get paid very little, but somehow I am managing everything that is happening within the startup. I notice that, even after two months of working there, I suffer from psychological problems. I cannot think of anything else other than my work and sleep very little at night. My friends and family are also noticing my issues. It is literally taking over my life. 

People tell me that this is part of entrepreneurial life, and I guess they are right, but I also feel that this is going to kill me in the end. On the other hand, I don't want to give up to soon. My question therefore is: is this all part being an entrepreneur, or should I quit? Is our startup failing, or am I failing?"

I already knew I enjoyed programming a lot when I started, but I looked at the undergrad program for CS and it seemed to mainly be geared towards preparing people for an IT career, and I was still interested in learning about Embedded Systems of which ECE had a lot of hands on classes for.     

My undergrad specialization was also in Embedded Systems and Robotics (I managed to get both in because I double majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering).  
In my senior design project, I had a Robotics project that heavily involved using OpenCV, that I enjoyed using a lot, so I decided to try and find a job in it while also applying for grad school, since again I knew most of those types of jobs required a masters degree or more.   

I still had the same problem as undergrad, deciding between Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I still felt like I enjoyed software engineering more than traditional ECE, but the dissertation projects I saw in the ECE department seemed a lot more interesting, and the fact that I already knew professors who were willing to work with me (both as a researcher and a TA) pushed me towards ECE.     

However now that I'm in my first semester I feel like the difference is becoming much more apparent. The specialization I'm in is called ""Computational Intelligence"", and it recommends taking two classes in the CSC department, but I'm also starting to realize where the differences arise.

For one thing, Computer Vision and AI is treated as a subset of digital signal processing (a topic that I completely ignored in undergrad) which also means that my degree will actually be in Electrical Engineering, and I'm a little bit worried about how that will look when I start applying for jobs (including ""backup"" software jobs if I can't find the ideal position).

A lot of jobs seem to require a ""PhD in Computer Science"", often with the caveat of ""or related fields"", but my experience from applying to internships as an undergrad was pretty much that a lot of company's filter out people that don't have the degree title on their resume, and that I really underestimated how different the skill sets of an embedded systems programmer and a computer science programmer are so i don't know how well my skills would translate.

I'm also worried about whether the classes are actually taking me in the direction that I'm trying to go because right now it just seems that they're focusing on signal processing and not algorithm and machine learning development.

I've been working full time as a Software Engineer for 2.5 years now - a year as Java/some python, and a year and a half now full time Python. Have 2 solid developer internships I took in college, as well as 3 month contracting work. I'd like to keep doing Python stuff presently.

Let's not talk about if the MS was worth it or not (I'm leaning towards ""not"", looking at all these loans I have), because I made the decision to start the MS work back in my Sophomore year of college before I knew anything. Let's talk about NOW.

I make 73k, with 5k potential bonus. Live in Chicago. I either would like a significant raise at my current job, or a really good new offer to help pay off debt/work on downpayment/have some cash for kids (wife and I plan on having a couple kids before we're 30 if all goes well). QUESTIONS:


* How much ""real world"" experience does a MS in CS count for? i.e., if I have 2.5 years experience, does a MS mean that I should look for jobs with 4.5 years - 5 years xp?
* Pay raises - should I look for an equivalent salary for the 4-5 year xp programmer as a result?
* What the heck should that range even be? 85k? 95k? 100+? I have way more negotiating power than I did when graduating with my BS. 
* According to payscale, the average is 80-85 for someone in my area with my XP (not counting grad degree).
* If I want a raise at my current job - is it smarter to ask for one when I have a counter offer? Would it hurt to just walk into my manager's office and say ""I have my MS officially, I would like my salary to be X now, thank you."" Etc, with no counter to back me up?

Transferring to a mid-level dev is an interesting experience. Thanks for any and all help!

I made a lot of stupid decisions and I don't know how to fix it. I'm not even sure its possible now. *TLDR at the bottom* 

After High school I had no idea what I want to do. I went to study mechanical engineering to college but I hated it and quit after first semester. I really needed money and a job so I accepted one with no contract. It was a printing company, all I did printing and work with photoshop. In college we had one programming class and it was only class i actually enjoyed, so I decided to go back to college to study CS.

 I was really excited. First semester was great. I passed every class and I even got a contract at the job I was doing so I finally had something on my resume. Second semester I didn't pass calculus II. I managed to get an QA internship at a really big and well known corporation. Next year (third semester) I didn't pass another two classes and I got really depressed. Next semester I barely visited any class or lecture and I ended up dropping out again. 

And now here I am with two unfinished colleges, no money, close to no skill or job experience and a huge empty space in my resume. I feel like a loser.

My job is going to end next week. I would love to work as a programmer or tester but I dont feel employable at all. I have some basic knowledge of python, sql and a little java. I have practically no portfolio.

I don't know what jobs should i apply, what should I do, or what should I learn to be employable asap.

Also what do I say if someone asks me at the interview about what i did between colleges?
Please help me, i will be thankful for any advice

thank you in advance fpr your advice and help!
Later this year I will be doing an internship in China for 6 month. I plan to travel after the internship, and thus I don't want to take my primary Laptop, which is a Thinkpad L450. It is just to large and to expensive to me. I don't want to bother much about material stuff while travelling and worry if someone will steal it or else. 
I do not need the notebook to be able to perform all the tasks during my scientific internship, there will be computers in the lab. What I need it to do is to be decent to write on, and be able to perform basic online tasks and office. Watch videos. Skype. 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Maybe 250 €, less is of course appreciated, am considering buying used, Germany 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I am not sure about this 2 in 1 would be nice maybe.

* **How important is weight to you?**
as I will travel with it, it is a main factor

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
11''-13'', during 6 month in china I would rather buy a screen, than carry around a large computer afterwards

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
N/A

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 


* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 a not completely horrible keybord would be great.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

I'm not saying this to be a douche, I just wanted to make it clearer why they contacted me about an interview.

Recently I've learned that data science is the field i want to get into. The problem is that my only experience is basically thru online courses (Python and R courses). I still have two years left in school so my plan is to take as many programming classes at my school as possible (esp in Python and R), while still completing my physics degree.

The internship is for a startup i found on angellist. The interview is a video call. The intern description says R/Python and machine learning are ""required skills"". The issue is my R/Python skills are beginner (at best) and i know virtually nothing about machine learning. I didn't lie in my application (i just said i have R/Python knowledge).

I guess the one thing i do have going is the fact the internship is unpaid, which does decrease the applicants somewhat.

Data science is something I'm really interested in and this internship could be a good start.

Does anyone have any advice for my interview tomorrow? I just feel at this point im pretty underqualified for it but at the same time I'm really interested in it because the company also interests me."

I'm one of three interns at a small contracting company. The office I'm in only has about 30 or less eployeees (including the interns). The interns are only allowed to work on capital projects, and to shadow other members who are full time employees. I am the newest one to the team. I've been there for roughly 5 weeks and seemed to have gotten along great with all but one of my co workers, or so I thought. Above me is my supervisor, Jimmie. We are on the face of the company as far as working with our clients. The other interns and I have been running out of work on a daily basis, finding ourselves ""bored"". However my supervisor and two of the full time members above us have been absent from the building for a large portion of my time there, often leaving us alone for full days with little to no work. So instead of sitting there all the time next to the large pile of completed projects I have been shadowing a few people on the networking side of the company ( with awknowledgment of the overall head of operations (nathan),  Jimmies equal on the ladder bill, and the person whom I am shadowing. Now, I've asked on numerous occasions to shadow people when there is no work, and haven't been told no or given warnings. I also jump to help all the time when someone in the office asks, even if it's just moving a mid sized computer to storage. I've spoken with the others, and have heard then complain about the other male intern being lazy and not helping. This all has been going on for weeks (at least the me heloing, shadowing and us interns finishing every task ahead of schedule). 

SKIP TO TODAY August 23rd

All is quiet in the office, then out of the blue someone asks for a few hands to help a large move. I offer my help, but then Jammie sends the others and drags me to his cubicle. He sits me down, 1 on 1, and the conversation goes a little like this:

Him: I'm not beating the bush, I don't like you, your personality, or attitude. I haven't for weeks. People are saying you're lazy, not helping, giving sass, and refusing to learn anything. People have complained that all you do is sit on the phone all day and play games. Let me also tell you, I'm not happy that you're going behind my back to shadow people and pick up other tasks. If you want work come to me, or inform Bill. I need to have some clue as to where you're at.  ( he says in an extremely hostile tone)

*keep in mind his boss requested I shadow people ok the network side, and even has them come escort me over there* 

Him:  I'm also sick of you asking the same question s over and over. You don't seem to take this seriously. If you're bored then just come to me and I can send you home. 

Me: I believe what you've heard is false, and what is it exactly you don't like? I'm sorry for using my phone. 
(In the heat of rage that was building inside me I forgot to tell him I've had permission, and to point out the fact he signed my internship forms numerous times saying that I've shadowed the other side and picked up projects on my own, giving me a 8+ on everything with no negative comments. )

Him: I don't like little things you do. I don't know, anyways I'm  done, I'll be discussing things with the others too. Get back to work. 

So as I go back to the intern room, the others arrive. He then shows up shortly after, closes the door, and in a gentle  voice says,"" I've gotten complaints about you guys being on your phones, being rude, and turning requests to help the full time employees out dowm. Let's try to change that, I figured I'd talk to you all as a group so BionicBrit  wouldn't feel singled out.  (Proceeds to stare at me the entire time) As far as you all having no work, come to me and I'll find something. If I can't I'll have you shadow someone, just like Bionicbrit is doing over on the networking side."" He then turns to me and says,"" sorry for giving you the brunt of the complaints,""smiles &amp; laughs. 
 
I don't feel like he was being genuine, and I feel like I was wrongfully targeted. Our HR rep is only available via email and phone. I have many questions, such as:
Why wait so long to bring up issues?
Why have the need to bash me one on one, then try to act like it's all ok, even though you did nothing to fix the issue?
Why complain about me to my face, not bring in those who made the false accusations and figure out the truth either before or during the meet?Is there  any documentation this conversation happened? 
But those are ones I mainly have him, and what I think I should ask if I get a meeting with HR. 
So to you reddit I ask, how should I approach the issue, what should I ask, and what should I avoid? How good of a case do I have at proving that his behavior is personal and not professional? 


Side note: there is a full time spot open, I have to see him again tomorrow, no one else knows that the conversation happened, and I think the accusations are meant for someone else. Names have been changed to protect those involved, and the strong language has been removed (all him, and my thoughts). Hopefully I gave enough information, if not I'll respond to any query in the comments. "

I got a parking ticket worth more than 400$ back in January in downtown Toronto. After having read that pleading guilty generally reduces the fine by half, and being a student with limited disposable income, I decided to go along the path of taking the ticket to court.

I was hoping this ticket would be settled in few months while I was in Toronto but I just got a court date today, almost 8 months after the incident. The problem is, at the time, until early August, I was doing an internship in Toronto, but I just moved back to Montreal two weeks ago.

I will be in Montreal attending school in the assigned court date; not to mention doing a commute from another Province with the round-trip ticket price and lost time isn't worth the reduction I'm going to get through pleading guilty. Hence I I rather not physically attend the trial. Also, asking someone to take time from their busy schedules to attend my trial as my representative is a huge favour to ask; something I don't feel comfortable with.  

At this point, I am considering just paying the full amount and by-passing this whole ordeal. Is this even a possibility? Can I just pay my ticket at the city offices and not show up on my court date?

Alternatively, is it possible to send a written statement to the court or attend remotely through teleconference?

Please let me know, if you know anything about legal procedures pertaining to my case.

I'm in desperate need of advice.

Here’s my resume :

Finished high school in France when i was 19, in 2008 (i was one year late, no biggie i guess)

2008-2010 : i had several jobs : assembling computers for gamers, working for an asset management company for a couple months, working for a wedding magazine

2010-2013 : bachelor degree

2013-2014 :took a year off, 4 months to travel in thailand (i had family there back then, and i wanted to travel a little), and some time to prepare for the BS's competitive exam when i went back to france.

September 2014-november 2016 : master’s degree in a good business school (at least in France. I had to prepare for weeks in a preparatory school), during which i had a 6 months internship in Bangkok, as a ""business analyst"", for a big company.

Now here’s the issue i have : I’m finishing my education this november, maybe december, and i’ll only get my degree next year. If i want to, i can take another internship until june 2017 (it’s called an « internship year » i believe) and it won’t change anything, i’ll receive my degree in 2017 anyway (and be considered as a ""2017 promotion student""). What should i put in my resume if i finish my education at the end of the year, that i graduated in november/december 2016 right ? (a lot of people told me to do that) It doesn’t matter when i get the degree as long as i finish in time? And what about the option to make it a 3 year masters degree (with another internship), will employers be afraid of my age ? (if i finish my education in november, i’ll be 27 years old, but if go with plan B I would almost be 28 (born in the end of august) if i finish it in june 2017)

Honestly, do you think i’d be fine in both cases, 27 or 28 yo, since people can graduate with masters at 23 in France, just like in England i believe? (it’s not a majority though, but people tend to graduate early in France, 25 is probably the average with masters in business schools)

Thank you very much

nb : as you can see, i didn't have a job, apart from my 6 months internship since 2010 when i was a student, as i wanted to enjoy being a student (universities are almost free in France, although you have to pay for business schools)

4zdphb,48,2016-08-24,Vast difference in engineering students,_Matterhorn_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4zdphb/vast_difference_in_engineering_students/,"So today it dawned on me how many different types of students are out there in the engineering program. I was talking with an old friend and he is doing great with good GPA, lots of experience (we are both sophomores) and really knows what he is talking about. I thought I was doing well with a dumb summer internship in an unrelated field but I cannot talk the way he does about engineering concepts. It is pretty obvious the difference between us. Anyway later that day a stranger started talking to me and he was a former engineering major but couldn't pass statics on his 2 attempts. Its weird cause me and my old friend were just talking about how well our high schools prepared us for college and how others were lacking in basic skills of problem solving. We were saying how if you can just keep your work organized you can do very well in statics no question. It is weird being in this type of environment where I want to achieve more when I am around people like my friend because I am comparing myself to him but when I talk to this stranger I feel pretty good about where I am in my engineering career. 


I think the reason that my friend seems so much better than me in my eye in this field is because he has had these experiences, he has been a part of multiple design teams and I have just done really well in my classes. At my school it has been hard to get on these design teams where you have to apply to them and they only take a select few. So I don't really know why I am posting this. Maybe its partially a rant. Maybe I would like people to give me advice on how to get on a design team so I can get an internship later. Or maybe I just want to see if you guys can relate to how I am feeling about this situation.

I started in Fall 2014 (27 years old) while working a 40-70+ hour a week industrial job in radiation safety. My end goal was getting out of that environment but shortly after starting the program I found a much better job in radiation safety at a research facility in a big city. With the pressure to get out of that industrial job gone and my hours dropping to 40 a week I decided to keep pursuing the degree because I had some money saved. My first degree was in Physics, so computation wasn't new but my only exposure to coding was a single Java class my freshman year.


I started the program taking 161 on its own. My attitude from the very beginning was always to prioritize my learning and comprehension, so I spent a few extra hours every week practicing my syntax and trying work through concepts that didn't come naturally. 161 was very exciting for me with seeing the potential of what I could do with this new skill, and I really believe between that class and 162 the next quarter I learned enough fundamentals to be successful later in the program. I ended up passing that class with an 'A' and was totally excited for the next quarter.


From there I jumped headfirst into 162 and 225. 162 was a big step up in terms of the amount of code for each assignment, but getting started early in the week helped me get there. 225 (Discrete Structures) was kind of new, but I had taken digital circuits in my physics degree so boolean concepts weren't foreign to me and all I needed to learn was proof structures (which we saw plenty of in Physics, we just never had to come up with them from scratch). This was also the time frame where I was starting my new job (that February), and moving to the city (prepping for my girlfriend to move in with me) so a lot was happening in my personal life, but I kept my head on straight and kept practicing in my free time in both subjects.


From there everything in my life just sped up and became a whirlwind of classes, new job, living with the girlfriend, getting cats, and more classes. That spring I took 261 and 271 together. Data structures was pretty straightforward if you know your pointers (know your pointers people!). Architecture whatever (Assembly) was pretty tough, but once you got the hang of it patterns emerged and its just another language (albeit very pedantic). Redfield is one of my favorite instructors because the expectations are clear, and everything is extremely fair in my opinion. His classes also feel more like my on campus classes did as far as amount of work expected so don't plan on a light workload.


That summer I took 344 on its own because I had heard how scary hard it was. It wasn't. It had a lot to deliver in 8 short weeks, but its a very cursory look at what an operating system does as opposed to how to design one. I feel like the class should be renamed to ""tools and utilities of an operating system"" because I didn't learn anything about what goes on under the hood, but I learned all about low level system calls and how to build things that interact with the operating system. My C/C++ skills had been fairly honed at this point so learning the system calls was pretty straightforward and it's not as beasty as people make it out. Plus Ben Brewster is another great instructor that is involved and cares about your learning.


In the fall I took the revamped 290 and 352 together. That first quarter of 290 was fantastic in my opinion. Talk about a mountain of new information, but staying on top of it and really learning the hard stuff (like closures, and high order functions) really nails home some solid skills for later. Plus JS is a really awesome language (coming from someone who loves the static typing of C/C++). Justin Wolford was teaching this class, and even through the growing pains I thought he cared a lot about our experience. He was always looking for input and came up with a few lectures overnight to fill in some gaps in the prepared material. 352 was a joke. Group work and this program don't mix, yet there's so much of it. It was essentially a feel goody art class in my eyes, even though I can now categorize some fundamental UI necessities (although creating them is a stretch...). Not my favorite necessary expense.


At this point the whirlwind settled down a bit. I had been living with my girlfriend for a while, work wasn't totally unfamiliar, and school had been going well. Padma sent out an email asking for peer tutors so I decided it would be a great way for me to practice my early class skills while making a few extra bucks. Turns out it was one of the better choices I made. It's really awesome being able to give back, but also to have a side income for how little effort it took on my part. I recommend this if you're doing well in the program and can afford the time commitment. I did this for the last 9 months of the program, and it felt like a bonus for getting good grades.


That winter, when I started tutoring, I took 361 and 340 together. I don't know why, it was stupidly easy. 361 was another kind of feel goody class, but it teaches you industry lingo so keep up on the big picture concepts (waterfall, agile, COCOMO, etc.). 340 was totally fun because the bar was really low. They give you a crazy easy framework and you learn a little PHP and you're done. I should have taken a ""hard"" class this quarter because it felt like a vacation after the previous quarters. Also, 361 has more group work (boooo!).


Spring quarter was coming and I had a decision point. I had planned on 2 classes in spring, 1 in summer, and 2 in fall to finish, but I was sick of school eating up my time. I jumped in head first to 372, 362, and 325. This was a busy quarter. 372 is another Redfield class and I actually loved it and learned a ton. I hated Wireshark labs (they didn't contribute much in my opinion), but everything else was top notch. Focus on quiz material and study study study since its mostly rote memorization of facts and terms and architectures. 362 was a pain. ""Testing"". Right. I spent more time learning Dominion than I learned testing. This is a donger of a class so mentally prepare for shallow lectures, links to udacity (fuck that), and the github repo getting nuked by your peers at least twice. The NASA guy who designed it has good lectures, but right when he's about to talk about something he recommends a book and shortchanges it. My teacher couldn't answer questions very well, but was super involved and super nice though (very understanding about git/github nuking your work). 325 was not that hard for me. Sorry, it is the truth. My physics background made about 50% of the content familiar, and really only the implementations of algorithms in certain styles (more group work...) was tough because I usually took the challenging non-trivial algorithms. You have two choices for the projects, work on them collectively, or split up the algorithms for implementation among your group. If you can trust your group, I recommend splitting it so that you don't have a bunch of time wasting meetings and can do your algorithm, dump it in your project and turn it in. A lot of people recommend skipping the class lectures. I'll say it again, this is not a good choice. Watch them on 2x or 1.5x speed so you know what the content covered in class in and what her expectations are. If you need more, then watch the MIT lectures or whatever. It's your experience, but I think skipping her lectures outright is not a good strategy for this class. Further Schutfort in my experience was pretty involved answering questions and with office hours as well, so while some make fun of her lectures she seems to care about student success.


Finally, I made it to this past summer and 496 and 419. I don't recommend this combo, but if you have to do it try not to do it in the summer. Good lord. 496 isn't hard per se, but as many people note if you don't use Google App Engine and Universal Windows Platform the lectures aren't useful until the last week where you need to watch a few so you can write your take home final. I went with Node/Express/Handlebars on AWS with an Android app, so I was on my own (but with the revamped 290 focusing on Node, it was doable). Plan on all your individual projects having to work together as your final project, and implement a login system from the beginning and you'll be fine. Just be prepared for about 15-20 hours a week coding. 419 isn't bad, but again it's group work. At this point you should be able to trust your peers but don't. Really. They may be smart, hardworking, and deliver good code, but you never know what's going on in their personal life that will prevent them from coming through to the highest level. I spent about 10 hours a week on 419 because I made myself trust my group. However, I had to spend 40 hours in my final week debugging and refactoring our whole code base because there were segfault issues internal to someone else's code who didn't have the time to fix it himself. We ended up with a fucking outstanding little project (alright, nothing novel but I'm proud of it for 8 weeks) but at the cost of almost shooting myself in the foot. The final week is also when the how to (due that first Sunday), and final project (due that Friday) and take home final (originally due that Friday, moved to Sunday) are due for 496. I didn't finish the final project by midnight that Friday due to my work in 419, and to my surprise late work was not acceptable for the final stuff in 496. The final project is 35% of your grade, so don't make that mistake. Fortunately I wasn't the only dummy who turned nothing in by midnight, and so Wolford made an allowance because of the short quarter to turn in the projects by Sunday for a capped grade of 80%. I repeat: DO NOT RELY ON THIS. This was a rare circumstance. Fortunately with high marks on everything I fell face first over the finish line and squeaked by with an A. I had to interact with Wolford about clarifications about my grade, and while I complained about his lack of communications (I was panicking, ok!?) he was totally receptive to the possible error and with his adjustments in policy to how the students were doing with the final project and involvement in 290 I think he does really care about the students as well. He just happens to teach the classes that have the broadest scope and most dynamic material while trying to cram it into an 8-10 week period.


I hadn't mentioned it for every class so far, but I finished the program with a 4.0 while working 40 hours a week, changing jobs, and moving in with my girlfriend. This did not come cheaply. The program itself, all costs included was probably close to $29,000 with text books, and ProctorU costs. Fortunately my original job paid me well for ruining my life, so I didn't have to take any loans. My new job paid well enough that I didn't entirely drain my savings either. The tutoring offset about $1400 bucks worth of expenses as well (seriously it's awesome if you can do it). My social life has been non-existent. It has been for a long time though. My old job moved me away from my friends, and took up all my time so I really only socialized with coworkers (which I generally avoid like the plague). By the end of the program I was drinking a bit more than I should because I never had time for friends, and it was something to do fairly quickly and cheaply for my couple hours a week of downtime. I gained about 20 pounds from lack of time to exercise (alright its an excuse! I just didn't bring myself to do it!). My girlfriend had a really tough time with my commitments and told me she missed me and felt lonely. I prioritized her the highest, but I always found a way to schedule everything in so it still weighed on us by a number of factors. I'm lucky I don't have kids yet, cuz damn.


All is well now though. I've spoiled the girlfriend with attention since finishing, I'm reconnecting with friends I've put on the back burner, my savings are rebounding rapidly, I'm back in the gym, and with the new addition to my resume my job hunt will begin shortly. I love my current job, so I'm not in a rush to move on to CS. I'm going to shoot for the big fish and take my time with offers since I'm already happy. I don't think with the academic projects I have to show that the not having an internship will be a major factor for me. We'll see though, I have a tendency to be optimistic.  


I've recently purchased a Raspberry Pi 3 which is the coolest ever. Since I'm losing access to Flip, my first concern was ""but where will I code?"". For anyone looking for the cheapest little Linux box ever, get a Pi. It was so easy to set up, and has a smaller foot print than your standard notecard. It cost $65 bucks to buy all the components($36 for the pi, $12 for an SD card, $8 for a case, and $9 for power), and about an hour to get Raspbian functioning. Another couple of hours working on port forwarding, and setting up a dynamic dns client, and I've migrated my homepage and all my work to the Pi and I can SSH in with a private key from anywhere just like Flip.


I'm excited about CS, and none of this would have happened without OSU. It's had high points and low points, but I think the cost has been worth it. This subreddit is a huge boon in so many ways, but remember when reading it that it is not always representative of everyone's experience. Not everyone in the program is here, and not everyone is super outspoken. Not everyone experiences bad moments with instructors, and arguably the good moments probably go under reported here. The courses are what you make of them. Put the time in to learn and practice the materials. Take advantage of the peer tutors if you need it. Time manage. Don't rush. Prioritize your learning. That's my unsolicited advice if you're starting. You're committing too many resources to not learn as much as possible.  
If anyone has questions, I'm open. Sorry about the wall of text and unsolicited advice, but I wanted to write everything out somewhere and maybe it will be helpful to someone.

Thanks to this sub along with many other resources I was able to get an internship helping a health organization. I've only done front end stuff, but they want me to do a small concept of a web app with a backend that allows users to sign up and help request blood donations. 

I've never really done a production backend and honestly have little experience with it. They gave me the choice to implement the web app on any languages and backend as my choice. Does anyone have any recommendation as to what would be easy to get started with, maintainable, and secure for me. If it's a detailed guide someone has already done that would be even better.

Again I'm just doing a small concept of the app, but they want me to start building a web all that will go into production after that.

1.  I have no experience in any IT/IS job at all(yes I should have got an internship)

2.  The security knowledge I have is mostly theory based and hardly any practical use(if any) same with networking. 

3. Unsure of what jobs I should be looking for(job titles etc) googling has given me very vague information.  

I was told certifications are useless unless you have experience so I'm not sure where to go. 

Ultimately I wanted to get into cybersecurity but have kept my options open as to where to shift self-learning focus. I guess right now I'm unsure of how much I'm worth with a degree and wonder what the best kind of job would work with me atm.

I'm stupid.

I was looking for housing and a guy contacted me saying he was willing to sub-let to me. I had to go to California for my internship and my current lease was ending so I never got a chance to see the house. I asked him about the condition and he said it was in good condition.

He sent over a lease and I digitally signed it. The terms are from September to May, 350$ per month.

I thought that's that. I have a place to live. However, I just landed and checked out the place. Its not what I expected, far less what I imagined. Its smaller and dirtier. And my roommates smoke pot ( I don't. Wasn't aware of this.)

I have to give the landlord security and rent tomorrow morning ( I was allowed to stay early).

I don't want to stay here. Is there any way I can avoid this?

I have to note that the sub-lessor (the guy I'm subletting from) did not provide me with a copy of the original lease ( while stating that I'm bound to all its terms in the sub-lease agreement ). He has also not sent back a copy with his or the landlord's signature.

Is there any way I can get out of the lease? Is it even binding at this point? As I haven't received a copy of the landlord's acknowledgement or the sub-lessor's signature. Please help."

To fully understand where I am coming from a little background about me. I am 24 years old, I live an hour and a half from Chicago driving from Northwest Indiana. I have recently graduated with a Bachelor’s of Computer Information Systems with a minor in Biology. I can code with Python, R, Java, HTML, CSS, MySQL. I did an independent study of Python for my capstone to graduate over an internship as my family wouldn’t allow me. I graduated last May, rather early May and began looking for a job even in the last few weeks of school. It is now the end of August, so let’s call it a total of 4 months. I have yet to get a single job. 
I was told that when I go to school, if I do well in what I do, it won’t matter that my biology grades drug down my GPA. I was told that a college degree would open doors but they all seem closed. I am overqualified to work a damn minimum wage job flipping burgers but I’m underqualified for my field. 


Let’s look at this using some numbers shall we: let’s say I applied to 1 job a day. And over the course of 120 days I’ve been rejected, presuming I apply at the same company for a different position. 120! Imagine looking for a date to prom and you ask over 120 women/men and they all say no, do you realize what that does to your confidence? Do you understand that they have all flat out rejected me due to my over qualification or lack of professional experience. At this point I am ready to just quit life as is. 


My degree has not opened any doors, it has only closed them. 6 years of my life are gone trying to get my degree and those 6 years I cannot get back. I am frustrated and tired of being rejected. Is there some secret I am missing to getting hired? Or is this what life is outside college? A series of closed doors that lead you down a path a despair and sorrow until your timely end. 


I didn’t even attend an unaccredited online college, no I went to a legit college where I commuted. I don’t drink, have no arrests, heck I can piss clean 400 days of the year I’ve partied that little. What is it that is wrong that I can’t get a job? Is it me? Is it my education? Is it the fact I don’t live in the city what is it! I’m tired and frustrated with everything. Indeed, hired, zipprecuriter.com, all of it! I’ve done it all and can’t get a job still and guess what, the way things are looking I probably won’t any time soon. I am simply distraught over what to do.


Am I really the only one in this boat? Fresh from college with a decent degree in something, not to bash a degree but art history or women and gender studies majors, who cannot find a job period. Not even a job outside my field. I am just so sick of what is going on and how little hope I have I just want to quit. If you have any suggestions I’m all ears because at this rate either my anger or my depression over the situation that has accrued for the past 4 months will be the end of me.

I just started my last year of high school here in Colorado and I'm planning on attending either CU Boulder (where I'm thinking at the moment), CU Colorado Springs, CU Denver, or Colorado School of Mines to get my BSCS. I would love to attend Carnegie Mellon or Stanford but I'm going to stay realistic for this post. I love coding and I'm planning on being a software engineer after college at the moment. I'm also considering Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. What I was wondering is, as of right now, what can I do to ""beef up"" my resumé for future employers?

**About Me**

 * I ""know"" Java, C++, Objective-C, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL (ew), and Python.
 * I've created two iOS apps in Obj-C but they're not on the app store (more for fun and education).
 * I run my own little website business (using WordPress though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
 * I'm attending a ""technical"" high school that is teaching me Computer Science and Cybersecurity in conjunction with traditional classes while simultaneously earning me CS credit at my local community college. (this credit does not appear to transfer to CU though..)
 * I competed in Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest in April and got to the interview stage for their Codequest internship. While I did not get the internship, I'm going to give it another shot this year now that I know what they're looking for.
 * I did however get an internship at a government agency but unfortunately it's more of a tech support job rather than coding.
 * I have a 4.0 weighted GPA and at the end of the year will have taken a total of 7 AP classes. My ACT score is 31.
 * I am part of one after school club that does volunteer work (similar to NHS) and did marching band for 4 years.
 * I have 4 **very** basic certifications regarding computer hardware/security (lower than A+ so they're rather irrelevant) and I have one Oracle Database Design certification which according to my teacher is actually semi-valuable(?) I'm also planning to get my Certified Ethical Hacker certification which I know is a low level certification but you have to start somewhere right?
 * I'm completing a capstone related to machine learning (I'm taking the Stanford Machine Learning class on Coursera then writing a program to do some machine learning stuff).

**My questions**

 * Would starting to build some reputation on SO and GitHub be a good use of my time or is there a negligible benefit? I searched around on this sub a little and I got mixed responses, some saying it's a total waste of time, others saying they got job offers at Microsoft from their SO profile...
 * I'm not too into the ""Big 4"" or whatever you want to call it, but I'm also not against it. I'll probably end up going wherever I can get paid the most while having a good location, doing work I at least semi-enjoy, and not having too many crazy work weeks.
 * If I'm thinking of starting my own software business 10-15ish years down the road is there anything I need to do now? This is obviously very tentative...
 * Living in Colorado, there's obviously a very good tech culture here - especially in Boulder and Denver - and I'm fine with California as well, but as far as outside the US goes are there a lot of job opportunities in say Europe? I would love to work across the pond for at least a few years.
 * Does anyone know how good (or bad) the CS programs are at Columbia University or Rensselaer Polytechnic? Both universities seem very interested in me and from what I can tell appear to be fairly good CS schools.
 * Is there anything else I can do to boost my resumé that I'm not thinking of that won't ruin my social life 100%?

While my overall experience has been positive I have to say one thing that is driving me up the wall is the box that people put themselves in all time. 

The moment work comes in that they aren't sure how to do they freak out and complain as to why they were assigned this work. When I was assigned work that was out of my range of knowledge and I tried to figure it out I was discouraged and told I would be better off escalating the issue to someone who had a better idea. 

What's wrong with taking on a challenge, even a small one? What's wrong with not knowing something and having to learn something new? Often times in college I'll have a problem and the response was always ""well you better learn"". I've been handed programming languages I never touched before and told I had a week or so to be familiar with it. I didn't bitch moan or cry, I got on google and every problem I encountered I worked through and solved. 

What is some of these workers' mindsets? Are they that afraid of stepping outside their comfort zone? Are they that adverse to learning something new? Are they content with the fact that they've been almost mindlessly handling the same types of issues for years and years without learning something new? 

I graduate next year and entering the workforce frightens me. It frightens me because the culture of ""well you better figure this shit out"" will be replaced with one where I do the same simple work day-in and day-out without anything challenging me. The most valuable thing I've learned in college was to overcome the fear of the unknown and to do something harder every day, and I will be goddammed if I have to give that up and spend the rest of my life doing mindless work.

I don't know why I am up this late and I am ashamed to be posting this (and probably will regret this later) but I got to get a few things off my chest. THIS IS HELLA LONG BUT I APPRECIATE ANYONE WHO CAN READ &amp; LEND A PAIR OF EYES/HEARTS. JUST NEED TO VENT. As the title suggests I am 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition &amp; depressed.
By squatters' conditions I mean: Living in a house that had two fires almost 10 years ago/on-going construction. Living without heat, running/drinking water, shower/tub, toilet, stove/gas. Aka can't shower, cook, or shit properly. Living in a living room/sleeping on couches with my parents. This is where we eat, sleep, ""lounge""
How I got here/Where I was: Almost a year ago. Got laid off unexpectedly. I was very unprofessional at this job and surprised I didn't get fired (due to depression). Weird but kinda saw this as a blessing in disguise. Mom got fired (again) from part-time job, lost apartment we all had to move back to the house. Mom previously left Dad after first fire. My mom has lost hope. Dad living paycheck to paycheck, constantly working. For months before internship, half-assingly looked for apartments, sublets, full-times jobs, but never really followed through because of depression, fear, and anxiety. Have savings but don't want to touch in case of emergencies. I am very disciplined when it comes to money. I save constantly and can pay for food/phone bill. Fear of being broke; also makes me afraid to spend money. Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years. I had a counselor for 2 1/2 years and she told me she things I have major depression.
Where I am/Present day: Let go from internship recently after a long bout of unemployment due to small non-profit budget reasons. Got let go in early August. Mom has part-time job. Before then used to help out/give her $$$ Dad has full-time job. Again half-assingly looking for apartments, sublets, and jobs. Actually have 2 job interviews today but I am not sure I am going (fear, developing slight Agoraphobia). Not sure if I want a job now. Managed to save money from internship (already on top of savings from last job). I can live off these savings for a couple of months. Family is divided. Father stubborn and overworked. Mother hopeless and slightly irresponsible. Etc. Constant fights. Feel alone, that no one has my back, that I can't trust anyone. Resentment, betrayal, anger, sadness/mixed feelings, towards parents/family. My parents has let me down so much. Don't have confidence in myself/ going out on my own because I don't have anyone to truly fall back on if I fail. 1st world poor.
Now that I got the backstory out the way it's time for feelings. This past couple of months have been the worst of my life. I have never felt soo lost and soo weak ever. On days that I didn't have my internship I used be afraid to leave my house. I only survived at my internship because my fear of being completely broke outweighs my fear of being outside. Towards the end of my internship it has gotten way worst (my developing Agoraphobia). I say developing because I can physically go outside it's just that I need to mentally distract myself (playing games on phone, listening to music, reading). I even experienced silent freakouts at my internship. The house has made me a bit crazy. Thoughts racing, constant stomachaches when I think about my ""reality""; feeling unhinged/unsafe. The only way I can relax myself is Netflix. I have developed escapist tendencies &amp; I don't think I can face reality head on.
LOGIC/HEAD IS TELLING ME Get a full time job Save some more. Get the fuck out. Don't want to enable my mental illnesses.
HEART/BODY IS TELLING ME: Slow down, take it easy, take care of your mental health FIRST. Be creative, use this free time to write and figure out life/career. Need emotional support. Fear I am heading towards a breakdown
I feel I always have to choose between them. To be honest I am leaning more towards my heart. I am not sure if it's my fear/mental issues talking or if it's actually what I want to do. The only real reason I am leaning towards my heart is, I never actually truly followed my heart. I always did what was expected of me, always was responsible, mature, put together. And for 5 years onward my programming/facade is breaking down. I always did my school work, hardly ever socialized, never got in trouble, always obeyed my parents. I was always smart with money, controlled, and careful. Got to college and all that I was, was questioned. I realized at 18 I was never actually truly happy. I did things because I thought that is what I should be doing than what I want to be doing. Negative thinking, social media, social community isolation (went away for college).
Before I close this novel of a post; I just want to let you know that I am NOT/NEVER WAS SUICIDAL. I also don't think I am completely hopeless. I know I am smart &amp; responsible I just need help/time/emotional support and to not be soo hard on myself. Even so, I don't believe it (I know this is statement contradictory &amp; weird). I struggling with knowing &amp; believing. I know things/have insight, but I can't put them into believing/action.
Anyway vent over (I got much more to say but this is HELLA long)."

I figured they weren't interested so I began job searching again.

Now, throughout my whole undergrad career I was working part time as a bank teller which kind of helped me because I was able to get an internship under my belt. After graduating one of my former bank managers asked me if now that I was done with school if I wold like to work full time and I said of course. He is an awesome guy to work with I did tell him about my situation with X company he said it was fine If I'm pursuing other things he would never hold it against me. Since I've started to apply I have gotten numerous phone interviews but no success and now there is one that may have an offer soon but its a contract position for 3 months after the 3 months there is no gurantee for a full time position.

I really don't know what to do. Please any suggestions would be great!"

I can give more information if necessary but...

* Does Chemical Engineering sound like a good path for me to take if I want to pursue medicine?

* What does a Chemical Engineering career look like if I were unable, or unwilling, to pursue a career in medicine?

* Does the coursework required for a Chem E student meet the pre-requisites for med school? Does it offer internship or shadowing opportunities that would be beneficial to what I need to know?

* What is my outlook compared to a Bio/Chem major when it comes to med school prep/acceptance and what is the comparison to non-medicine career options through both?

I am 23yo guy, and I have been dating my girlfriend since I first started my studies at the university. We love each other very much and I can't live without her. We had the same classes in the university, we have the same friends. We travelled many times together and spend many great time together. We bascically did everything together.
All the problems started when we learned about an Internship in USA and we were both very interested in doing it, so we both applied for it and after passing the interviews with the recruiter we both got accepted but we had to wait for some months in order to start our visa procedure, so we went to another internship in Ukraine, and it was where we really knew how much we love each other and how helpful to one another. We stayed in the same place and lived together for 2months, only her and I without knowing anybody in the whole country. This travel made us know each other more and to know each one's weakness, and we ended up loving each other even more.
When we came to our country we had to apply for the visa for the US, so we did. Sadly, her visa got accepted but mine got rejected. Knowing that we made the promess that if one of us is accepted but not the other, none of us will go and we finish our master's degree.

I know she dreamt for a year to have this training with me, I really want to go with her. But unfortunnalty my visa got rejected even tho we had literrally the same visa application documents. The officer did not ask her to prove anything but she did the exact opposite with me. She asked me for all my documents and I did provide it but the officer wasn't conviced that I would come back to my country, even tho I had all the documents to prove that I am coming back.
I really felt hopeless because I disappointed my girlfriend so much, I did all I could do to not to fail at the end of this.

The real problem is that now that we are facing this problem, that we knew that promesses we made were kind of not that easy to make. My parents always told me to never go without her because they love her very much, but it's not the case for hers. Her mother want her to go really bad even if I'm not going with her. And she said ""no"" and she wont go without me, her mother insulted her saying she was a dumb girl. She started to cry and that really torned me apart. 

I really feel hopeless, I feel like a trash because I failed my visa, I feel so much depressed, I thought about killing myself because everyone in her familly think that I am the reason why she will not go for her training in the USA (Knowing that in my country, USA means heaven and Eldorado). Now she has to make a choice between staying with me (We wanted to get married and have our master's degree together) or to please her mother and go to the US without me(which means our relationship will be done).

You can't even imagine how much I cried every night, I can no longer find sleep(about 2 to 4hours each night), I start to have a high bloodpressure due to stress and sadness. I loved this girl since the day I saw her the first time, I loved each second that we passed together, I love each smile of her that brighten my days.
I will try my best to reapply again, and maybe I will be accepted (or not) and all this will be just a bad dream. But if I get rejected again, we will be having the same issue over and over.
I feel destroyed, I feel hopeless, I never felt this way in my life, I want to die, so that she doesn't have to make a choice, I want life to be fair with her.
Help me, I am begging you, HELP!

I love her more than anything else in this worlds"

I'm currently seeking employment as a data analyst either in an an entry level position or through an internship. Thus far, in the span of about a month, my attempts at doing so have largely been unsuccessful. It's somewhat understandable however because I have no actual work experience in this area and some of my related skills are at a rudimentary level. I'm getting a master's degree in applied mathematics at a state university and have basic, not proficient, knowledge of SQL and R. I've set my eye on also learning Python, Hadoop, SAS and maybe even Tableau as many of these seem to be essential skills in the data analyst's toolbox.

Assuming I can't find a related internship or entry-level work in this field on my existing circumstances, is it a good idea to polish my programming skills and work on building an attractive portfolio that can potentially gain me such employment despite my lack of experience? I mean, is obtaining employment this way even likely?

I should mention that I have an upcoming interview for an internship that might include some aspects of data analytics (the recruiter wasn't exactly sure and instructed me to ask the individual interviewing me to get exact details). Were I to be offered the position, I would be somewhat apprehensive not only because this internship may not be entirely oriented around data analytics, but also because it's a non-paid, 3 month position and would require 20-30 hours per week. I only have enough money to last me the next two months, which might even be an optimistic estimate, so if landing a job through a good portfolio is possible, then I rather not take this internship and look for temporary paid employment. 

I'd be very grateful to hear any Redditor's thoughts on the matter. "

It's been three days. She hasn't moved. She just stands there in the corner of my room.. And she watches me.. It terrified me at first and I did everything in my power to make her leave.. But I couldn't touch her. It's as if she had a glass box surrounding her. A shield. 

On the first night, after my endless attempts of trying to rid her, I became restless. I was running out of options. So I began to try to speak to her, I mean really, what else did I have to lose? I approached her cautiously, remembering that I could not touch her. I hesitated and then quietly whispered, ""What are you?"" She blinked. She did not respond. 

This woman looked to be about my age, 27. She stood tall and straight and she had long curly locks,  luscious espresso brown, that draped her shoulders and danced across her back. Her eyes were soft, a mesmerizing pale blue and her skin was deathlike. It was pasty and dull, as if she'd never seen the sun. She wore a white cotton dress, tight around the waist and free toward the bottom, that fell just above her knees. I observed her quietly from across the room. Was I imagining this woman? I couldn't be. She was standing across my bedroom clear as day. She blinked. She is alive.. Is she alive? I spent the rest of my evening staring back at her and I eventually fell asleep sometime around 3 AM. 

The next morning I awoke to a lovely soft humming of a song I was all too familiar with. The Black Swan. I had remembered it from my childhood. It had been my favorite melody, so soft and charming. I froze in my bed. ""FUCK"" I thought to myself. I had fallen asleep with this.. This woman just standing in my room. At some point in my slumber, she had found her way to my bathroom and retrieved a hair brush. On top of everything else, she had managed to drag a dining chair into the bedroom, without waking me. She was now sitting quietly, humming to herself, brushing her curls loose into a soft wave. 

I was horrified. I couldn't call the police. No I couldn't, they wouldn't believe me. Who would? I thought I may be going crazy, because even when I tried to call the police I couldn't physically bring myself to dial the number.. I was stuck. I was stuck with this woman in my house. I decided to try and pretend as if she wasn't there. I got ready for work, cautiously locking myself in the bathroom. I pressed my back against the door and let out a long sigh of relief. What in the hell was going on? .. Id find out soon enough. 

I left that morning without a doubt in my mind that she would still be there when I got home. I just couldn't shake the feeling. I went straight to work, no stops, and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. I worked in a ravishingly large building in the center of downtown. Quite frankly, I was just the lobby girl. A receptionist who directed interns and new clients to offices of wealthy attorneys with beautiful families. I, however, was patiently waiting for my.. Well that's not important. I arrived swiftly and made it to my desk without any problems.. But when I sat down is when the trouble started. 

I obliviously turned on my computer monitor and put on my headset, as I did every other day, but when I looked up.. There she was, in the same white dress from last night and again earlier this morning. Staring at me from across the room. In a panic, I jumped to my feet and froze. I don't know how long I was standing there, but a voice interrupted my trance. ""Ma'am.. Ma'am, are you okay?"" I turned my head quickly and looked at the man before finally nearly shouting ""Yes! How can I help you?"" The man turned to see what I had been so helplessly staring at, but it was as if he couldn't see her.. He didn't see her. ""Lance Trino's office please, I'm a new client. 8:00 AM sharp, and we're wasting time."" I grabbed the phone and dialed for Trino and sent the man on his way. She was leaning against the wall across from my desk, smiling and twisting a curl continuously around her finger. 

She didn't move all day. She was taunting me. Showing me that I was entrapped, and I was. Her eyes were so breathtakingly blue, I caught myself gazing into them for minutes at a time. It was hell and I thought it would never end. As soon as my shift was over I hurried out to my car. She didn't follow me, and I felt a little too weightless not feeling her presence, until I hopped into my car with utter confidence. ""Shit!"" It slipped right between my pursed lips. Almost simultaneously I brought my hands to my mouth at an abrupt pace. In my rearview mirror, her ghostly glowing skin caught my attention immediately. She was humming that song again.. Our eyes met, and I still don't remember how I got home last night.. 

Today is the third day, Saturday. I woke up in my bed. It felt like I had been sleeping for hours, my entire body was stiff. I crawled out of bed almost forgetting about the mysterious woman until her white cotton dress moved with the wind of a nearby open window. I stood up straight, but this time I did not look her in the eye. I examined her thoroughly, however, and noted that she didn't seem to be harmed anywhere. I assume this was from her invisible force field, or whatever the hell she has going on with her. I spent the next few hours pacing my bedroom trying to figure out what this could all mean. 

After four hours of pacing the bedroom and listening to her melodious hum of The Black Swan, I finally figured it out. It could be the only answer. I had missed it all along. I stopped dead in my tracks and walked directly in front of her. 

I looked into her eyes as bravely as I could and managed to mutter one single word, ""Abey?"" 

""I've been waiting for you to say that.."" Her words sunk into me like the long healthy roots in deep dark soil, and the words wrapped around my every thought. It was her.

During my senior year in highschool I shadowed a senior software engineer at blank company. While I was shadowing him I felt like I gave a good first impression and he even gave me his contact information incase I want to talk to him again. Fast foward three months; I just finished taking summer college classes and I decided to hit him up and he decided to have lunch with me and some of his colleagues. He even played my tab even though I insisted I should pay. At the lunch I asked a lot of questions about being a software engineer, what to expect, and how they got into computer science. After that I connected with them on linkedin and started my fall semester of college. Then after 5 weeks or so I decided to contact the person I shadowed and ask him when does your company open internship applications. He then replied that I should just send him my resume and he'll give it to the advisor in charge of interns. Now in all honesty I feel like I'm not as good as other candidates that apply as intern to this company. The people that usually apply are sophomores and juniors that go to the elite tech/cs school 10 miles down the road (think GT,UMich,UIUC, etc.). Even my resume I feel isn't up to par. I only know java, and c# and I only was a secretary in two clubs in highschool. 

TL DR: Will the connections I made help me get my foot in the door for the company I'm applying even though I'm a freshmen and dont go to an elite cs school?"

I live in rural New Hampshire and was offered 45k with the 401k matching. 

When they hired me, I had been teaching myself Python for about a year and a half but I was at least syntactically familiar with the majority of the most popular languages. 

The place I work at is entirely Java based and I was hired as a Junior Developer for the Research and Development team which was previously comprised entirely of interns. 

Since then I have become proficient with Spring. I've built an SMS reminder scheduler, I've had an Amazon Alexa skill published, and I've maintained and expanded upon ~7 existing projects which are mostly database management tools for staff. 

I work by myself and answer directly to the CTO of the company. 


tl;dr 6 months experience in a Java shop in New Hampshire with no degree. I've developed and released 2 new money making products and am responsible for ~7 others that I've inherited. Is 45k salary fair? Negotiations are next month and I'm not sure how to value myself.

I am not sure if I am alone on this, but it seems most of the jobs out there require a lot of experience (2 to 5 years). As many, I worked during the day and went to school at night in order for me to finish my bachelor's. I am currently working in a grocery store (11 years), and they helped me with my tuition costs. During the time in school, I wanted to get a internship in the field. However, I decided to let that opportunity go since I had to work as full time in order for me to provide for my family (some of the internships were only part-time).
I am happy that I just finished with my bachelor's, and now I am hunting for jobs. From what my professors told me, HelpDesk Jobs are the best way to start since they provide a wide glance of how a company works in the IT field, and they also said ""...it would give you the best experience"". Currently, I am trying to talk with the IT recruiter of my company since I want to stay with them (benefits, seniority, etc). Sadly, I feel under-qualified for all the job openings and it seems that in order for me to get a job inside the company, I need ""to know"" someone inside. 
I know finding a job it's not a fast process and requires times and patience, yet it would be nice to hear some experience from people who have been in the same situation, and all your suggestions are always welcome. Thanks

Eventually I sacked up and I'm getting my things together. I grew to love coding now and I've been trying to create very mini - mini projects to try and make up for my early struggles.

The thing is I'm in my senior year and I haven't applied to any internships, I'm struggling to push myself out there AND I need two more semesters to graduate (after completing these 2 semesters).

Will this have a major impact on getting internships and jobs?

Any advice would be helpful.

My class load is fairly light this year (except for AP Calculus &gt;.&lt;) so I've got a fair bit of free time. I took AP Computer Science last year, and prior to that I had a bunch of informal experience in Javascript and Python, including a Python summer camp thing. 

The extent of my programming knowledge in all three languages is about the same. I know how to create objects and variables, how to handle scope, some basic File IO, the general loops/arrays/boolean logic knowledge and all that for all of them. I'd like to know more, though, but I don't know where to start. I made a little bit of a candy-box-esque idler, but it's come to the point that adding more is more about just writing new content with the skills I already have instead of learning new ones. 

Does anyone know the sort of slump I'm talking about? I've read that I should try to make something useful to myself, but I really can't think of any programs that I'd need (at least ones that I could viably create). I'm planning on going into Computer Science in college, but I still want to get more experience so I'll be better prepared and also possibly an internship or something.

Anyway, I'd be very grateful for any advice on what I should do to keep learning programming. "

Now my health issues are over and I am more hardworking, passed a class I failed with F with 100/100 test scores etc.

My major is Applied Mathematics, my current plan is:

1) Increase my GPA to 3.0-4.0

2) There is this distant education system that allows you to apply for a second degree during your first, I plan to apply for Sociology.

3) Find a part time job/internship related to my major (and fill up my mandatory internship quota of 40 days) to be free during summer to take extra classes in summer school.

4) Be nice to teachers, which I am already doing, one of them even motivated me back to aim for programming.

5) Improve my programming skills.

6) Learn a third language (already know English and my native language), which is German, and maybe a fourth one as French or Spanish (I already know German as a beginner)

7) Join a club and become a high ranking member.

This is my current plan for the next 3 years, is this enough to make up for repeating 2 years and graduate as a good student?"

First and foremost, I'm posting this because I feel like I have no one to go to for advice. No one I can trust without being judged.

I graduated high school back in 2008. I set my mind to go to community college and knockout all the basic prerequisites before deciding what I should study. Not knowing what my niche was/still is I couldn't decide where to go. I came across a Art Institute advertisement. It sold me. I was heavily into music and anything associated with sound and the recording arts. I was so stoked to go to Art school and learn about recordings. Once again, I was young and had no one to see counsel from. 

Started my first year at AI, and I guess my ambition drove me to go to class and get everything done. First year was done. I felt no challenge. I made no friends because I was busy working a retail part- time job. They recommended everybody to attend the networking events, but I'm such an introvert that I had no idea how to socialize with people. Still not well with socializing. It's my biggest setback. 

I started realizing how this career I envision was probably not for me. I still pushed forward. I did not want to quit something I started. 

Here comes my last year of school at AI, students who did not even try were getting passing grades. I felt like an over-achiever, yet I wasn't shining because I refuse to be the spotlight or the center of attention. I doubt my talents and capabilities and constantly out myself down. 

I finished school at AI with a BS in Audio Production. Not knowing where to go. No connections in the industry. Nothing. I had an internship that broke off because the company was shutting down. 

I find myself in huge debt. Settling for any job I can take. I come across this production rental house. Thinking to myself that this my be my foot in the industry. Wrong. Been there for about three years and I haven't don't anything remotely close to what I know or what I was taught. Even though I feel like my education was a big waste of time and regret dropping out of community college. 

Now I'm here, developing severe anxiety and depressed, a bit frustrated/ angry, and becoming irritable because of my past decision. My head keeps telling me that I'm better than this. That I'm capable of more. But how do I seek for more? This job sucks the life out of me and the pay is not even great. Hell, I'm just near the 15/HR range. 

I've been trying to do some soul searching lately. I realized that this dream I had has failed. That it wasn't meant for me. 

I picked up a book called, ""Three Feet From Gold"" which is inspiring as hell but I don't know what to do with this information. When I think about what I was into as a kid, I can't get any list. Again, my pessimistic mind kicking and shutting me down with negative thoughts. 

I'm trying to pick up anything. I love computers and I'm very tech savvy for the most part. The idea of programming is fascinating and I've tried doing some searching to teach myself to code (learn Java, C++, and whatever language I can) not knowing if I'm capable of doing this is my biggest dilemma. I bought a book on programming for beginners. Heck, I'm even on CodeAcademy doing the free courses. 

I wouldn't mind doing school again. My finances are a mess right now. My living condition is absurd. I can't afford to treat myself to anything and I'm living from paycheck to paycheck. I've tried budgeting but I don't have the will to stick to it. I keep failing. I'm getting pretty desperate and I keep overwhelming myself with the thought that I am a failure. 

I want to master the art of programming and maybe one day end up in cyber security. For some reason, when I think about everything and what I'm good at. It comes back to computers.

What can I do to achieve this career change when I have so many limitations (no money, no time, and don't know where the hell to start)? How can I keep myself motivated and not bummed at work? 

tl;dr: 26, made the mistake of going to a shitty art school. Still got my ""degree"". Now working a low paying job when I know I'm capable of more. Really bad at networking and socializing.I have interest in computer programming/cyber security but don't have the help from anyone or idea on how to come about. My job and finances are creating severe anxiety and depression. Feel down and stuck. "

Which sounds pretty good but I got the most average GPA possible (2.5) and wasn't able to get a single internship. Even though I applied for every single internship in my area that popped up from sophomore year to graduation.

**Current position:** Fast forward 4 months, I've had 5-10 interviews but I've never made it to a technical interview. I've applied for ~50 positions at various companies. Which is probably nothing compared to some people on this subreddit but I have very low confidence.

Anyways, I'm already getting burnt out and I haven't even started working yet. I've read posts where people did 300 interviews in a couple months and just doing 1 interview drains me for at least a few days. I'm introverted so it's physically draining for me to talk to a complete stranger for 30 minutes while under high pressure. I need multiple cups of coffee a day to get by and I hardly do anything except sit in my dad's house applying for jobs and working on side projects.

Speaking of side projects, the only ones I enjoy doing are where I use my coding skills to make games. And I'm sure not a single company gives a shit about the crappy games I've made so I don't even bother putting them on my resume. I made an app to show off on my resume but building that app wasn't as enjoyable as when I make games.

The other thing with side projects is that I know work projects are an entirely different beast compared to them. I'm not going to get the same enjoyment as I do out of my personal projects.

Back to interviews though, I can't do them. I feel like I have to lie to make myself look good and it's blatantly obvious when I lie. I always hear how it's important to smile and be pleasing but I just can't do it. I can't put that mask on. Every interview I've had the people I'm interviewing with or other people I happen to talk to in the office just seem so depressingly fake. I don't feel right in environments like that and it makes me feel sick to be honest.

**Looking to the future:** It looks awful. I've read posts about how people say they're wasting their life away working and the only responses are ""That's the real world"". I'm draining my energy trying to get something that's just going to take everything away for me in exchange for money so that I don't end up homeless. That's not a future I want.

There was a comment on another post on this subreddit regarding someone who was unhappy with their job. The comment had 50+ upvotes and said:

&gt; That's life. It sucks.

Why would I want that for my future? That doesn't encourage me to keep applying and keep working my ass off for a job that's just going to make me hate my life more.

Is there some kind of middle path that I'm just not seeing? I just keep hoping that one of my personal projects is going to end up sustaining me. I'm not looking to get rich or anything, all I want is to not be homeless. Not looking for highly competitive ""every man and woman for themselves"" environment. I just want to earn enough to afford a comfortable one bed apartment, groceries every week, and light entertainment. I'm not planning on having kids or getting married even though I have a wonderful girlfriend but she's not interested in either of those things too. I don't want a nice car or a nice house, maybe a nice computer but that's about it.

**Edit:** Grammar fixes"

4zqq8s,379,2016-08-26,Mourning Wood,decomprosed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4zqq8s/mourning_wood/,"My sexual awakening came in the form of the Ents from the Lord of the Rings series. 

I was thirteen; a fat, awkward, late bloomer. Sitting with my cousin in his basement, a stuffy teenage paradise piled high with video games and beanbag chairs, we’d finished an original-trilogy Star Wars marathon and had moved onto the other big name in Nerddom. Shoveling handfuls of popcorn and oreos into our piggish mouths, we reveled in the gluttonous glory of youth. 

Then, they came lumbering through across the screen.

Towering, magnificent beings with so much bark and so much bite. After so much confused fumbling, something just clicked. My sexuality was personified and laid bare right before my very eyes. Seeing those titans traipse across the screen, hearing the gravelly anciency in their guttural voices, I found myself unable to breathe. 

The pinnacle scene of the last march of the Ents is what really sealed the deal for me. Up until that point, I’d barely been able to contain myself, squirming uncomfortably in my seat and trying to ignore the raging forest fire in my pants. When they came upon the horde of orcs and used their pure brute force to demolish their ranks, I lost it. 

“Be right back,” I said, slightly panting. 

“Hurry up, fag. I hate pausing shit.” My cousin Perce was such a charmer. 

“Don’t have to pause anything, asshole.”

He threw an empty soda can at me. It missed. “Bring more chips.”

I scurried away, hands shoved deep in my pockets to cover my shame, and crept around the corner where the bathroom door stood slightly ajar. I lingered in the doorway, my pale, chubby face illuminated by the moonlight pouring in from the small window at the top of the far wall. My heart was pounding in my ears, chest, and groin; I’d never been this aroused in my life. Unfurling myself from my shorts, I saw a strand of amber-tinted goo dripping precariously from the tip of my dick. Something compelled me to catch it with my fingertip, and I brought it up to my nose to sniff. It was oddly heady and sweet. 

My tongue crept past my lips with a mind of its own, drunkenly dancing out to catch its fated partner in an erotic salsa. As soon as it touched the unknown substance, my mind lit up like an enemy battalion.. 

It tasted like maple syrup. 

My entire body shuddered uncontrollably, spasming from head to toe. The former felt light as a cloud, the latter curling and cracking hard on the stone floor. Unconscious of my body’s actions, the roaring, vicious assault of the Ents soundtracking my ascent into heaven, my hand crept downward across the rough cotton of my shirt and found its mark. I’d just barely touched myself when I felt the surging power of a millennia of sexual tension spastically rip through my body. Heaving, I lurched forward, gripped the doorframe hard, and coated it with an eruptious glaze of my sweet, sugary nethercream. 

Slumped against the doorframe with weak fingers splayed, I wheezed. My head was swimming somewhere in the hazy, fluorescent lights of the basement. Just over the crest of my orgasm, a shrill scream snapped me back to reality and I was caught, literally pants down, by Aunt Cheryl coming to turn over the laundry.

Needless to say, I was never invited back to my cousin’s place.

*****

I’d always felt strangely at home in the forest, but it wasn’t until after my explosive revelation that I fully realized my place in the world. The reservoir for my desires had, until then, gently ebbed and flowed. The dry, crusted banks of my youth were not to be wasted, dashed upon the shores of mediocre handjobs and spray-tanned porn. I refused to be an ignorant child, a walking turbine of waste, a feedbag with a crotch that drooled effortlessly into a sea of crumpled tissues and hidden socks. 

Thus, my descent into the fervor of arboreal eroticism began, and I became one with nature. The rest of my teenage years were spent in fevered daydreams at school and belabored trips to national state parks and garden centers. The scent of fresh-cut grass became a sensory overload of seething pleasure and I found myself pressing my fingers deep into the soil of potted plants on more than one occasion, sometimes to the misplaced dismay of teachers, friends’ parents, and strangers on the street. 

Despite my initial catalyst of Tolkien’s walking, talking trees, I never quite felt the need to dress up as one and fuck or be fucked. I didn’t beat off to worn out copies of *National Geographic* and *Discover Magazine*. The thought of hearing something like “oh daddy you make me so thorny” from a *seriously* understanding sexual partner *never even occurred to me* as a way to get off. No, I needed the real thing. I needed soil in-between my toes and the promise of chlorophyll on my lips. I needed nature *au naturel*. Mom was a cleanfreak, but I managed to convince her to let me keep one plant in my bedroom; a potted Dracaena Marginata. I named her Marge. She was more woman to me than any girl I could’ve ever made eyes at or sloppily swapped spit with in-between classes. She carried me effortlessly through countless sweaty nights. The odd amber ooze that’d escaped me on that fateful day never returned, but I didn’t mind. I could’ve stayed in the rapacious thrall of youthful sexual exploration for the rest of my life. 

Unfortunately, adulthood calls. 

Once I graduated from high school, I got into a decent town college. From there, I got a bachelor’s degree in business management, had a few solid internships, and by the age of twenty six, landed a huge job opportunity at a bigwig manufacturing company in New York. My parents and friends were ecstatic for me. Myself, less so. The City had glistening skylines with endless horizons. It had bustling workforces and meaty buzzwords and crisscrossing ladders with pots of gold at every top rung. But, I lamented, it didn’t have the forever forests of my youth, underbrush rich with the rolling wild. The final drive from West Virginia to the big apple was a morose one; I truly felt like the worm. As I got on I-79 with all my worldly possessions rattling around in my car and Marge strapped safely into the passenger seat, I felt like I could almost see the ghost of the forest in my rearview, shimmering trees waving farewell in the gentle Spring breeze. 

The first few months were rough. The city was harsh, cold, and unforgiving. Gone was the small town hospitality I was so used to. Instead, a grunt and a shove on the subway platform were there to greet my sore body and exhausted mind. My office was bustling, but the air was stale, recycled with the pained breath of a thousand empty promises and extended due dates and forms, forms, forms.

Four months in, Marge died. The plant and partner that I’d had for over ten years was gone. She’d been drooping for weeks and I just didn’t have enough time to tend to her; even when I did, I was so worn out from the seemingly interminable workday that I just forgot. I held her wilted leaves against my tear-stained cheek as I wept, unintentionally watering her for the first time in recent memory. As I sat there, mourning the loss of my dear lover, a growling sensation of retribution and warmth began to spread throughout my body, starting with my groin. Without thinking, I set her wasted leaf down, unbuttoned my trousers, and quickly disrobed. I sat down in the armchair flanking Marge and ran a shaking hand over her stilted body. Her bark, though still firm, was supple and receptive to my touch. 

“I’m so sorry, my love,” I whispered aloud. “How could I have let you fade? I’m a monster.” Tears began to well up and pour down my face anew, lightly pattering against my pale, splotchy flesh.

Then, she shook her head. Well, her leaves. Startled, I looked around. The window in the far corner of the room was open; just the wind. I raised my aching form from the chair and padded over to the window, closing it with a heavy sigh. I stared out at the city street below, people passing by in the dozens, unaware of anything except their destination. How had I let myself become so lost and jaded in such a short amount of time?

“Phillip?”

I spun around, almost falling over. A voice. A soft, woman’s voice. There was no one in the apartment. I quickly ran to the front door, just to be sure. Locked. Was I hearing things? Too much coffee at work, probably. The boss had really been getting on my case lately and I was on the edge of -

“Phillip, it’s me.” 

This time I did fall over, tripping over my own foot and landing hard on my bare ass. The voice was coming from Marge. I crawled forward a bit, unsticking myself from the floor, and placed a tentative hand on the small endtable. Shaking it just the bit, I watched as the remaining leaves swayed lazily from the movement. Was this really happening? Was she talking to me?

No. It’s a plant. She’s a plant. No matter how much I personified her, she’s still a fucking plant. I was honestly losing it. I picked myself up and turned around, grabbing my clothes, and started to head to my bedroom. 

“Come back. Don’t leave me.”

I whipped around, threw my clothes at the wall, and dove to the floor, ready to tear the plant up and end this nonsense. Instead, I was greeted by the strangest sight I’d ever seen in my life.

A dozen or so small green and white tubes were protruding from the soil, slowly wriggling in a synchronized formation. As soon as I acknowledged them, they began churning faster and faster. 

“What. The. Fuck.” The words squeezed themselves past my pursed lips.

The tubes, thin and stringy, instantly straightened, looking like a demented organic pincushion. 

“No curses,” trilled one in the back right corner. 

“We love you,” from the middle. 

“We need you.”

They spun a few times clockwise and straightened once more. In perfect unison, they rang out “we can’t go on without you”. The words were like a song; a sweet, dulcet soprano hung in the air. 

My knees gave out and I sat down heavily. What the hell was going on?

“What…” I began, unsure of the words even as they left my mouth. “What are you? Who are you?”

The tubes flattened against the soil save for one in the dead center, slightly bigger than the others and leaning up against the stalk. I subconsciously dubbed it Large Marge. Although it had no eyes or other distinguishable features, I could feel it staring directly at me. Into me. When it spoke, the words came from behind it, underneath it; all around it. 

“We are you. We are your love. We are your fancy. We are Marge.” As soon as it said the name, the rest of the tubes began slapping back and forth in a frenzied fit, all shouting “Marge” in the same shrill voice. 

“You planted us,” the last two words echoed back and forth throughout the rows, “planted us with your Father Seed. Your Seed made us whole and you loved us but you left us to dry.”

I rubbed my eyes and dejectedly shook my head. “I’m sorry. Work got so busy and things at home fell to the wayside and I just ran out of time. I didn’t mean to hurt you.” Yep. This was it. I was talking to a fucking dancing worm parasite that’d invade my plant. Real top of the charts here.

“We forgive,” said the left half. “We forget,” claimed the right. “But we aren’t dead yet!” cried the whole lot. They doubled over, as though giggling at their little rhyme, and then seemed to regain a more serious posture. “We thirst. Please feed, Papa Phillip, please feed.”

Numbly, I looked around, There was a glass of water sitting on the edge of the kitchen counter. I slowly rose to my feet and started towards it, but the chorus pulled me back.

“No, no, no water, no water. We need Seed. Father Seed from Papa’s Life Stem, please.” The last word swelled and broke in the air like a balloon.

I looked down at my fright-shriveled dick, remembering countless masturbation sessions ending in a cloudy white release trickling down Marge’s lush green leaves. 

Glancing back up at the tubes - Marge - I cupped my little white worm and offered it forward to the ones in the pot. “Is this what you want?”

“Yes! Yes! Please! Life Stem! Father Seed!”

A cracked smirk crept across my lips, and I stepped closer, feeling a twitch deep inside my balls. I hadn’t jerked off once in over a week. No wonder the plant had died. 

I began stroking myself, hardening beneath my grasp, and draped my body across the chair. The Marges began flailing, whispering excitedly back and forth. Large Marge stood tall, quivering, waiting. I maintained eye contact with her as my pace quickened, remembering a particularly steamy session one night during a thunderstorm. I edged closer and closer to the brink, and The Marges went wild, flailing in no particular pattern. Just as i reached orgasm, the voices rose up in an almost whitenoise wall of sound, reveling in the shower of voluminous amber discharge. 

It was back. 

I leant back into the chair, soaked with sweat but wildly satisfied, and watched with absolute rapt fascination as The Marges lapped up every drop with greedy abandon, scouring every nook and cranny of their pot for more. When they were done, an endless chant of “thank you”s filled the air. Large Marge, looking beyond full and brimming with light, slowly slid from the pot, inching closer to me. She ran up my thigh, her slimy yet coarse skin a welcome touch, and began cleaning my distended member for the rest of her prize. When she was done, the rest of The Marges settled down and she curled up my arm, over my shoulder, and nestled next to my ear. We fell into a deep sleep in the sated embrace of lovers. 

*****

The next month passed in a blur. On the subway ride to and from work, sitting at my desk all day, getting a hotdog from the cart outside of my building - all I could think of was Marge. The Marges. It almost sounded like a band. Large Marge and the Little Tubes. The Tubeway Margey. Ha! 

My mood had skyrocketed. Things were going better at work and I felt healthier and happier. Daily feedings became an absolute ritual of morning dew and nightly fertilizer. It was bliss. With each passing session, The Marges seemed to grow bigger, louder, stronger. Large Marge was my favorite, of course, but I divided my attention fairly. We talked for hours, though they didn’t seem to be capable of forming completely coherent sentences. When we were tired of talking, they would sometimes sing to me. Other times, I would read aloud from my vast collection of botanical tomes, dedicated to all walks of greenlife. We became inseparable. 

Then, I fell behind on rent. I sent a few emails around at work, put up a notice in my local coffee shops, and finally resorted to the festering cesspool of Craigslist. Within four hours, I’d received 12 spam emails, 7 sexual solicitations, and 2 hopefuls. One was a young professional in the city looking to move closer to work, and the other an aspiring “artist” trying to find a homebase so they could “make it big”. Stars in their eyes, I’m sure. I rolled mine. I called the suit and came up with smoke; they’d found somewhere cheaper and even closer. Disappointed, I reluctantly punched in the number for America’s next underground breakout. 

He could move in tomorrow. Great. The Marges sensed my frustration and soothed me with a pretty little tune. 

Loud, boisterous, and arrogant, Salide came bursting through my door. Yeah, Salide. Pronounced like “salad”. You know, the fucking edible bush. His real name was Darrell, but I only knew that because of his ID - he swore me to secrecy the second he handed it over, flourishing a stubby pinky capped with a gaudy fake gold ring. Fashion designer by day, crossdresser by night, he flounced into my life and puked glitter and sickly sweet perfume onto everything I owned. Coming from a very traditional and dirt poor black family in Georgia, he vehemently shunned his roots and chalked them up to an alien abduction or some other bullshit. I learned very quickly to ignore almost everything he said. I kept to my room, only coming into the common areas to get food, leave for work, and visit Marge when he was gone. Sadly, she had to hide when he was around. I would’ve moved her into my bedroom, but there just wasn’t enough light. It put an unhealthy strain on our relationship, and the stress quickly grew. 

After a mostly silent feeding session, the tension in the air finally broke, and The Marges spoke up.

“We love. We need. We miss.” 

I sighed. “I know, darlings, me too.”

Large Marge, more vibrant and beautiful than ever, wriggled closer to me. 

“Take me with you, Papa. I can leave, they will be fine, I can leave and come with you.”

I looked her over and smiled broadly. “I’d love nothing more. But how?”

She waved back and forth in response, and began stretching. She curved across my thighs, still moist and sticky with our lovemaking, and wrapped around first one, then the other. After a good ten seconds of stretching, I saw the soil where her body was connected begin to tug up. Another moment, and it gave way. She slipped out of the pot completely with a little popping noise, crumbs of dirt trailing behind. Continuing to wrap herself around my body, she made her way to my crotch, slid sensually across my shaft, and stopped at my urethra. With a little wiggle, she softly split the skin and entered me. It felt like a warm, dull fire coursing up through my stomach. I’d never felt a greater pleasure in my life. I could feel her spreading first through my abdomen, passing through organs and muscle alike, snaking her way through my intestine like a lovelorn parasite looking for food. She pushed gently against the wall of my stomach lining and I giggled, tapping on the taut skin. I watched, fascinated, as the very last of her emerald body disappeared into me, feeling her traipse lovingly around my lungs and then up through my neck, flicking her tail against my heart. She stopped just neighboring my brain stem, rubbing her tiny head against my fleshy walls. When she spoke, I heard her inside of my own head, as though she were a thought. 

“I love you, Papa.”

“I love you too.”

We slept soundly that night, the tiny coos of the rest of The Marges a gentle lullaby for the ages.

*****

I rose for work the next day, rejuvenated as ever. Getting dressed and grabbing a bagel from the kitchen, I shook my head at the filthy state of the apartment. Darrell - sorry, “Salide” -  was disgusting. What a wreck of a person. 

Passing him in the hallway, no doubt on the way back from one of his ill-fated auditions, he shouted something about a party later that night that he was throwing in the apartment, some celebration for his “drag mother”, whatever that means. I shrugged it off. No use getting into it with him now; I would be late.

After a long day of endless paperwork and not wanting to deal with a party full of loud, drunk queens, I took off to a local bar and proceeded to get shithouse smashed on $2 happy hour beers. The entire time, Marge whispered sweet nothings in my ear. She always knew just what to say to take the edge off. Around 1 AM, properly tanked and ready for bed, I stumbled home. I could deal with a few unwelcome stragglers if need be. To my delight, when I got inside, the apartment was dark and empty. Trashed, but empty. With a sigh of relief, I snagged an unopened but still cold beer from the counter and headed to the bedroom. I had my hand on the handle when I heard it.

“Papa,” a whisper, gentle as a dust mote. 

*Something’s wrong* said Marge.

“Papa, help.”

*Go to them.*

Unsteady on my feet, I walked over to the pot and looked down. Once my eyes focused, I gasped and fell to my knees. It was scorched earth. My tiny babies were all withered, black husks. They looked almost burnt.

An unintelligible scream sounded from somewhere deep under my skin. On the surface, a sob was lodged in my throat.

“What happened?!” I nearly shouted.

“Bad men, bad men. Rained ash, smoke ash. Yellow showers. Hurt so bad, Papa, hurt so bad.”

Even through my drunken haze, I could clearly picture Salide and his guests ashing cigarettes and pissing on my helpless love. Instantly, my blood was set to a boil and rage coursed through me like lightning. My feet were pulling me towards his room; whether it was my own doing or Marge’s, I have no idea, but it didn’t matter now. 

His door was locked, but we made short work of that. The flimsy wood splintered under my second kick and flew inward. The smell of sickly sweet perfume was like a punch in the face, but I powered through it, running up to Salide’s bed. His bloated, drunken face curdled my stomach, false eyelashes fluttering open and smudges of makeup creating a clownish horror as he sat up, looking around and blinking heavily. 

“What… what the fuck?” he said. I just stood, shrouded in darkness. Then, I realized through my rage, it wasn’t all that dark. My skin, previously covered by shadow, was now glowing with an unearthly green, luminescent light. It was almost rippling. 

“What the fuck!?” Salide repeated, fully awake now and quickly shuffling backwards. I opened my mouth to say something, but before I could get even a sound out, I felt a solid form shoot past my lips. It was Large Marge. She curved upwards and arced back down, tail slipping fully out of my mouth. She’d reshaped, her head now ending in five razor sharp points, glistening kaleidoscope eyes set deep in the center. Giant black mandibles protruded from her face, rows of similarly black teeth extending back into her open maw, and her cavern of a mouth oozed with the same amber goo that’d birthed her. 

Salide screamed, then vomited, sending a cascade of chunky effluence in a waterfall down his pudgy stomach. He choked and tried to scream again, but Marge surged forward, catching his mouth and throat in one bite. Her jaws unhinged in a horrific horizontal angle and closed with a sickening crunch. Salide flailed wildly, but Marge wrenched up and down in quick succession, severing his jugular and sending a spurt of blood across his bedsheets. Body flopping with limp effort, he succumbed to her crushing vice and drowned in the backwash of his own blood; a symphonic gurgle his last gift to the world. 

Covered in blood and steaming viscera, we retreated into the living room, but it was too late. The rest of the clan had taken their final breaths minutes before. Slumping to the floor, I leaned against the wall and cried softly. Marge coiled around my neck, her head now back to its normal smooth exterior, and licked away my tears before sliding past my lips, back down my throat, and cuddling up next to my heart. We sang, in harmony, The Marges’ favorite tune.

*****

It’s been a few months since the incident. Salide suddenly up and “left town”, but that’s alright; the arrangement wasn’t working out anyway. All of his things found a lovely little home in the dumpster out back. 

Large Marge and I held a nice eulogy at home. A quiet affair. I miss The Marges, but I know they’re resting well now. 

Good news, though - I’m expecting! I don’t know what the twins/triplets/quadruplets version of 2,238 is, but hey, my degree was in business management, not math or english. I can already feel the eggs, gently throbbing deep beneath my skin. They’re scattered in my organs, threaded in muscles and up against bone. A few are even nestled right behind my eyes. In just two months time, they’ll begin to burrow and surface, and we’ll be a family again. 

I see a bright future for Marge and I. There’s really nothing like true love to plant the seeds for a better tomorrow. "
4zqr06,136,2016-08-26,TIFU by hooking up with a girl at a strip club and nearly breaking her neck - NSFW,Criblu,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4zqr06/tifu_by_hooking_up_with_a_girl_at_a_strip_club/,"A few years ago I was at one of my best friend's birthday party. It was while I was in grad school and she had invited a bunch of people she knew from undergrad and our internship. A few months before she had told me about this girl that I might like, but who was kind of crazy. I didn't ask for her to elaborate, assuming that crazy meant party girl because they were a couple years younger than me.


So the party is a blast, everybody's having fun, and I am the DJ/MC. I played a few Backstreet Boys songs, dancing and singing along with them. 
At this point I noticed the girl talking to my friend Kylie about me. They keep looking over at me and giggling.
The girl, Amanda, then comes over to me and starts up a conversation. We get along great for the next few songs, and are really starting to hit it off.
Kylie's bf then suggests that we all go to the strip club. 
Fantastic idea! I'm already drunk, and have never been, so there has never been an idea I've loved more in my life.


We get to the strip club and I'm just completely blown away. Naked girls everywhere, dudes being creepy. Girls watching what's happening awkwardly. 
The part of me that loves to see other humans at their most vulnerable and  natural state was in heaven. The primal look in the guys eyes as they burned holes into these girls naked flesh was something I'll never forget. Even though very drunk, I can still picture their focused concentration. It was as if they diverted their eyes for a second, it would all just disappear, and they'd find themselves right back in their mom's basement.
Now while I've been observing the going ons inside of the club, one of my buddies had paid one of the dancers like $20 to dance on me solo for a few minutes.
In my distracted, surveying mode, I barely even registered what was happening to me. I don't remember what the girl looked like, what color her hair was, or whether I was sitting or standing. Apparently she noticed, and in a last ditch effort for my attention, forcefully shoved her pelvis into my face while possibly hanging from a pole (?... Not sure how it happened to this day). Completely caught off guard, my drunken self loses balance and tumbles straight into Amanda, who was watching what I was getting from an adjacent table.


After mopping up her spilled drink and apologizing profusely, I ask her how she's enjoying the strip club.
""Well, so far it's been a waste of the cover charge. But you don't seem to be too into it either.""
""Yeah, I wouldn't come here on my own, but I enjoy just watching how people who come here act.""
""You're weird.""
""Yeah... I realize that.""
She then just grabbed me and started making out with me hard core in the middle of the club. 
Like throwing me against the wall, rubbing all over me.. Doing things I've only seen in crappy pornos.
Kylie's boyfriend sees us going at it and starts cheering us on. He then gathers everyone up and said we need to get home now so everyone can do it. 
Drunk me is like ""yeah!!!"".


So we get back to Kylie's house, our other friends go home, she and her bf go to their room, her roommate goes to her room, and Amanda and I are left in the living room.
Apparently, she hasn't had enough, and starts tearing into me like a hungry lioness.
Having never encountered a girl quite as passionate before, I figure it's time for me to take the lead and give her a good time. 
She was a tiny little thing, 5'2"" and maybe 115, so once I started taking control, she didn't have much choice. 
I'm feeling like a rockstar, drunk and hooking up with a hot girl the first night I met her.
Keep in mind we are in a living room, with no lights on, no bed, and both drunk as shit. 
But I'm trying things I've only ever seen professionals attempt, and she seems to be enjoying it, so I decide to get real creative, and have her do a hand stand (facing away from me), while I'm standing on the couch. 


If you can imagine the logistics, this takes a fair amount of coordination, especially from two inebriated, albeit highly athletic individuals. 
She then tells me to put it in her butt. Normally, I'd be fairly hesitant, especially since I have no idea when the last time she had showered or emptied her bowels. 


But on this night of exploration, I was like Aladdin, seeing a whole new world. 
Again, in the middle of a living room, and without a repertoire of typical sexual staples (lube) some improvisation was needed. 
So once that was achieved, she told me to take it slow and ease into it. 


Slow and easy while sober is difficult enough when you're in an  aroused state, but intoxicated it took every ounce of determination I had to not jam it like I was trying to rupture her spleen.
Unfortunately, the concentration I was putting into keeping a slow, steady rhythm took away from the focus on my precariously placed feet.
I had slowly inched closer and closer to the edge of the sofa cushions, and seeing as I was basically supporting all of her weight, it was as if a 300 pound man placed all his weight on the outer 4 inches of the couch.


As my momentum took me forward in the thrust, the two front legs of the sofa snapped outward, causing me to tumble all of my weight, penis first into this girls ass.
Of course her scrawny arms could not take my sudden weight transfer, and she crashed face first into the ground. 
Somewhat fortunately, I was still holding her legs, so she didn't bang them against the coffee table, and I landed on my feet, no worse for the wear.
I laid her legs on the ground and was terrified I had just snapped her neck.
I roll her over and her eyes are shut. 
""Fuckkkk me... Amanda.. Amanda...""


At this point I hear our friends stirring in their room, and I'm just like holy fucking shit...
So I quickly put my underwear on, place the feet of the couch back into a position where they can at least bear stationary weight, lift her onto the couch, and cover her up with a blanket.
Kylie comes into the hallway and asks me if everything is ok, I said yeah, I just fell off the couch while sleeping..
She sleepily mumbles and heads back to her room. 
I'm still like ""oh shit, oh shit""... And crazy thoughts about leaving the country are going through my head.


I sit on the ground next to Amanda's head and am quietly saying her name. Nothing.
So I do the only thing I can think of that everyone reacts to - I tickle. 
She gives a little jerk and swats my hand away... Omg I have never been so relieved in my life.
Hoping that she's passed out for the night, I sit in the recliner and nod off to sleep.


The next morning I woke up (after about 4 hours sleep), and Amanda is coming back from the bathroom. 
She sees me awake and asks, ""did we have sex last night?""
Not sure of how to answer I reply, ""a little, but you seemed pretty tired.""
""Wow, ok... I got scared you stuck it in my butt or something, I can hardly walk right now.""
Again, unsure of what I should be saying ""huh, I'm sorry..""
""It's ok, I went too crazy last night, I've got a fucking ridiculous headache right now.""
""Damn, you want me to get you some aspirin or something?""
""I'm good, I'll just sleep a bit longer."" She laid back down.
""Ok, well I need to head home, but that was fun. We should hang out again.""
""Yeah, text me.""


I left Kylie's house in a state of disbelief.. Apparently the blow knocked the whole memory of what happened out of her.
We actually went on to date for a few months, and I didn't tell her the story until after she tried punching me in the face for laughing at something stupid. But it was like this crazy secret I couldn't help laughing at whenever it popped into my head.


So moral of the story, always have lube and a bed.

TL;DR - party leads to strip club, leads to drunken acrobatic sex, leads to amnesia and a broken couch"

I'm really need this cosmetic surgery ASAP since I'm getting pretty depressed about it.

Unfortunately, this can take up to a year. **Will I have a hard time finding an entry level job after I recover from the surgery? Or should I just omit my graduation date?** Do employers really care that much about a year gap?

Summary of my resume:

* CGPA 3.6

* Honors: Magna Cum Laude

* Computer Science at one of the top 3 schools in my country (I'm scared to tell which one because classmates might find out I'm planning to get cosmetic surgery)

* 1 software internship experience (school requires us to have one internship before graduating)
* Several extra-curricular activities
* Won several hackathons
* Knowledge in Java EE, Spring, Maven, SQL, Git, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Android




I also plan to do side projects while I'm recovering from the surgery. "
4zqsfm,1,2016-08-26,Hard Time finding an Engineering Job.,EliteBagger512,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4zqsfm/hard_time_finding_an_engineering_job/,"So I recently graduated in May of 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from a good University. Graduated with 3.9 GPA-Magna Com Laude. I have 2 years of internship experience. With in the 2 years I had a 1 year internship of experience working in manufacturing, 4 months in an R&amp;D internship, an 8 month Senior Design Project to design and build an automated labeling machine from scratch for a company. My CAD software includes 6 years experience using Autodesk AutoCAD, Inventor, Solidworks, MathCAD, Matlab, SAP, and PTC Windchill, Microsoft excel, project, word, ppt. My other strengths include good communication, public speaking, written/oral skills. I am also getting ready to take the FE exam to obtain an EIT license. 

For a year now I have been applying for jobs, some I have been rejected from some during my senior year since I could not start working until I graduated 8 months later, this is understandable. However, currently since graduating I have neither been accepted nor rejected by many of the jobs I have applied for. I have applied for great positions that I qualify for, however the problem I am having is that it is taking forever to hear back from the company whether it is a rejection or for an interview. 

I have had a lot of staffing agencies call me and they have led no where. They call, ask for why kind of job I am looking for, and then after following up multiple times they say they are still trying to match me with a position. Has gotten me nowhere

Since graduating I have had 1 in person interview. It was probably the worst interview experience I have every had. The interviewer, although he honest, did not do a very good job of selling me the job. He told me that currently the company has been slow for the last 1.5 years, he said that he has placed some employees on unpaid leave since their works is slow, he said the reason we are looking engineering graduates to join the team ix because the cost of their engineering services is to high so they are looking to hire young people to reduce cost of doing business (i.e-under pay me), and lastly the best line of all....he said ""if we hire you we expect you to work their for the next 15-20 years.""  During this interview I did not get to answer any questions. Based on my qualifications as mentioned before, he said that I am more than qualified for the job, it's just a matter of do you want to be there. At the end of the interview they asked me so do you want to work here yes or no? They needed to know right then and there. I said I am very interested in the job I will need a few days time to make a decision based on the notes I took during the interview. Within next couple of days after the interviewer had told me that I was the most qualified and that my resume was selected from over 300, they said they found a better fit with someone else. Basically since I was not willing to commit during the interview they were not interested. 

Based on this I was curious about following, below are some questions. 




Question 1: I would say I would make a strong candidate for a job based on the interview I had. Although it did not go as well as I wanted, I did separate my self from 300 resumes to be selected for an interview. My question is would you agree with this assessment? What is your opinion on my skills and credentials and how it would stack up to other job candidates?

Question 2: Why does it take so long for companies to give either a rejection or an interview for a position? As noted before, I am able to separate my self from 300 resumes but what is frustrating is that after 4 weeks I still have not been contacted for the positions that I have applied for. Is this a normal experience everyone else goes through? 

Question 3: What is your Opinion on my interview experience?  Do you feel that it was unprofessional for the company to ask for a job decision without the company even making a formal offer? 

Question 4: Based on my credentials, I believe I can attain a starting salary around $67K-$69K. As noted before when speaking with staffing agencies they have confirmed that this is a reasonable expectation based on my skills, GPA, experience, etc. Also based on the average in the area i am applying for an Entry level mechanical engineering salary is $65k.....DO you agree with this? What is your opinion? 

Question 5: What advice do you have for me moving forward on how to better my job search? I have applied for lots of positions and just waiting to hear back? I am applying to positions in areas away from home (i.e willing to relocate). What websites are good for applying? I have already used indeed, linked in, monster, career builder, glass door, etc and have posted my resume on their websites so recruiters can search them. 

Question 6: Is this struggle I am having normal? Any advice to help me from getting frustrated all time? 

Question 7: What is your opinion on my situation? 

Thank you for your feedback!!!

4zqttz,44,2016-08-26,$90k Kickstarter from Growth Hacking Free Traffic,hypekilla,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4zqttz/90k_kickstarter_from_growth_hacking_free_traffic/,"We did an interview with a really amazing growth hacker, and I just wanted to share the nuggets here. Hope you guys enjoy.

Tip - To easily convert your blog posts to Reddit self-post formatting, use [Reddit converter](http://vyper.io/reddit_converter?utm_source=r_entre). Great way to syndicate your content to Reddit.

Reposted from [VYPER](http://vyper.io/blog/vincent-dignan/?utm_source=r_entre).

---

The best growth hackers in the world aren't necessarily going around teaching their skills. They're usually just making tons of money for themselves. A few of them consult with other companies for thousands of dollars per month. That's what Vincent Dignan was doing for years before he recently decided to reveal his secrets in a tell-all book entitled _""[Secret Sauce](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ultimate-growth-hacking-guide-secret-sauce-marketing).""_

The reason that Vincent has decided to stay underground and not reveal his secrets for so many years is because growth hacking channels die when too many people use them. How many users are now posting inspirational quotes on Instagram to try and ""growth hack"" that platform? How many people are using Auto-DM and Auto-Follow on Twitter? These hacks still work, but they're no longer as effective since you see it all too commonly now.

That's why to this day, he still doesn't reveal his best tactics. In fact the people who do reveal their tactics end up making it harder for themselves because those tactics end up overused. The _best_ growth hackers experiment relentlessly to get ahead of the curve, and then exploit the hacks ruthlessly before they're found out.

But we got an exclusive with Vincent to talk about a few of the tactics that are still working now, and how he creatively uses Twitter and other channels to get free targeted traffic for his clients and his own projects.

**You went from being broke and on welfare 4 years ago, now you’re giving growth hacking talks, how did you gain those skills in that time?**

Yeah at the time, around 2012, I was homeless living with an ex-girlfriend. I didn't have my own place and was living off her.

My ex told me I needed to go do something. So I decided to make an online magazine since I enjoyed writing and figured I wouldn't make money blogging off Tumblr. Within 6 months the magazine had 350,000 visitors per month. Within a year it had a million. We raised about $250,000 and got into the Techstars accelerator program. Soon later after that I was giving talks.

**Wow, amazing. But it sounds like you had no knowledge of the digital world before this. So how did you get up to 350,000 visitors so fast?**

One of the things I believe is you should learn from one of the best. At the time I wanted to start an online magazine so I talked with a girl who worked for a successful magazine and got advice from her. She told me just get as much traffic as you can -- the rest will fall into place.

So the first thing I did was call every University in the country and told them we were building the coolest magazine in the world and would you like to be apart of it. So in essence it was user generated content but we had editors to make the content look good. But the idea is to generate as many articles as possible.

Then our strategy was to hit up as many people as possible -- send it through news sites, social communities like Reddit, send it to large publications, send it to people via social media. Our articles got picked up by places like the Huffington Post and other sites like that, which drove massive traffic.

We also growth hacked our way with Twitter and got tons of traffic that way (editor’s note, we’ll talk more about Twitter later on in the article).

Another thing we did was we used a widget called Zergnet that was essentially a traffic exchange. Every time we send them 1 visitor they send us 2 back. So that was extremely good.

**You eventually made the transition from PlanetIvy to a growth hacking consultancy called Magnific, why?**

We got a lot of offers from other companies to learn how we were doing what we were doing. All the stuff we learned growing our Twitter, growing our traffic, that's stuff that companies wanted. The offers were too good to pass up. It made sense at that point to turn Planet Ivy into our own agency, [Magnific](http://magnific.com/).

Another main reason for the transition -- when we started in 2012, it was easier to get advertising dollars from publishing. Even with a lot of traffic, an ad-supported website is getting harder to do, especially now with Facebook dominating online advertising. Now Facebook has such a monopoly on traffic that most publications just can't compete with that kind of targeting and reach.

At the same time I still work on side projects just to keep myself interested while I'm helping clients grow their businesses. Secret Sauce, my book has been my biggest project this year. We wanted to create something for the people that can’t afford our services, which cost thousands of dollars. I also created a Facebook group called “traffic and copy,” which now has a few thousand people.

**You have a book on Kickstarter that was recently funded successfully (to the tune of $80k+). What was your marketing process for getting sales off Kickstarter?**

We first compiled a list of several different marketing channels then we arranged them from easiest to hardest.

The list looked something like this:

- Compile a list of people we know and let them know about the book -- Linkedin contacts, Twitter, email contacts.
- Accelerators and coworking spaces that I’ve talked at, I asked them to send things out to their newsletter. These all have pretty good newsletters that are tech/startup focused.
- Hacker News - we couldn’t do this channel as well.
- Posts on Reddit did really well - self posts. (Editor's note: Use [Reddit converter](http://vyper.io/reddit_converter/) to convert your blogs into self posts formatted for Reddit).
- Posting in Facebook groups.
- Interviewed on about 8 podcasts, get them to do interviews like this one.
- Reached out to some influencers to try and get referrals, although this didn’t help as much.
- Did talks throughout America during the launch.
- Our pre-existing mailing list.
- My partner Austin wrote a Medium article that got a lot of traffic.

Then send them to a queueing system, we used [Queue At](https://queueat.com/) to do this. You got a free chapter of the book if you signed up. This queue system asked you to share the book’s landing page in exchange for moving up the queue. As you moved up the queue you could get free webinars, free consultancies, free blog posts about your company, etc. This was definitely the key to the whole thing since it gave us a lot of viral shares.

Then we launched and we made about $15,000 from the first day, and now over $80,000 from Kickstarter.

**You’ve done a lot of growth hacking around Twitter. Can you share the basics about how you use Twitter for traffic?**

First of all I signed up several different accounts. I recommend beginners to start with 4 accounts -- you could do it like @company_name, @company_help, @company_usa, @company_country -- something like that.

- Then make sure you’re tweeting a LOT. I tweet on all my accounts every 30 minutes. Twitter isn’t like Facebook. You need repetition to get your content out there.
- I have an intern Tweeting for me.
- I don’t use automation currently, but in the past I’ve used Audiense to automate the replies.
- I follow people with certain attributes. Currently this isn’t automated because my intern does it, although there are tools like Follow Liker that can do that for you.
- Find a conference going on in your niche and follow those people. They’re super active so they tend to follow back.
- Don’t follow more than 500 people a day &amp; unfollow more than 400 people a day.
- Don’t send more than 250 tweets a day.
- I post and find interesting content.

**How did you start getting a lot of speaking engagements? That’s sort of a growth hack in itself isn’t it?**

Yeah I was randomly asked to talk at an accelerator and they were going to pay me for it. From there it was just by referral. Someone there wanted me to talk at another place, and then so on and so forth.

One other thing I did to get speaking engagements was just hit up the organizer to various startup meetups in my area (through Meetups.com), give them a deck I had on growth hacking, and do a cold email asking if I could speak.

**You mention on your site that forums are where you learn real growth hacks. What forums do you go on?**

BlackHatWorld.com. It’s black hat but they have a lot of amazing tactics on there.

The thing with blackhat, of course, is that the hacks don’t really last, but they’ll be doing stuff that gets them tons of traffic for a time, until Google finds out and destroys it. So you can’t make a real business out of it, but you can get some temporary wins from Blackhat.

However, the site itself has actually tons of really good advice that’s not Blackhat, so I recommend people checking it out.

**What’s a last growth hack you want to share with our audience?**

The key really is knowing that there are tools out there for anything. A lot of stuff can be automated and a lot of knowledge and info can be scraped.

[CharlieApp](https://charlieapp.com/) -- Finds anyone’s info.

[Audiense](https://www.audiense.com/) - Automated Twitter/Instagram mentions and scrape Twitter/Instagram for certain keywords.

[Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/) - Find email addresses.

Depending on what you’re trying to achieve, there’s going to be a way for you to reach people without spending a lot of time or money."
4zrccm,1,2016-08-26,Embedded Systems experience but choosing a career in software engineering,aliitani,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4zrccm/embedded_systems_experience_but_choosing_a_career/,"im currently a cs student, and theres a embedded venture project course at my university its a 3 credit course lab work, were we work with a company and a professor in our department, the venture project is about embedded application development working in groups or teams of students and gain real world experience as mentioned by them and to be honest it sounds interesting and i think we will be working with C.

my main question is, is having C(low level language), embedded systems programming experience and those skills on a resume good for a software engineering/Developer career target, or should i focus on gaining experience through a software engineering internship and gain knowledge and experience with a high level language or something like that?

i would like to hear from you guys and thanks in advance!"
4zrcjg,2,2016-08-26,Negotiating a low offer?,_Hokie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4zrcjg/negotiating_a_low_offer/,"I am a recent CS grad, and I finally received my first offer today for a web dev position.  The offer was for $16/hr, or $33k/year.

To give you an idea of the position, this is a small-ish business using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript / jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and CodeIgniter.  I have a good amount of experience with everything except CodeIgniter, including an internship with a company that paid more than what this company is offering for a full-time position.  They are adding employees to help address a lot of technical debt while continuing to improve their product.  Their online presence generates the majority of their income.

For more context, I completed a programming test and an interview (side note to employers: this 2-step process was amazing).  In the interview, they said my code was the best of all of their applicants so far.  

There are a few reasons why I feel like I **need** to accept this job:

* I had a 2.0 in college.  Employers have not hired me because of that.  I want to get that behind me.

* I have been living with my parents since graduation, and I would like to move.  We have... different views on things.

* From what I've seen, I would enjoy the job and the people I'd be working with more than any other job I've found.

But compensation seems extremely low compared to the average entry-level web developer position in the area ($45k-$50k).  The area has a low COL, but I think I should be able to be productive without much training.  I thought I would be offered about $10k more.

I asked if salary is negotiable, and I was told ""Feel free to make a counter offer and reasoning for it.""  I think I am worth more, but I really don't want to lose this opportunity.

How should I go about negotiating a better offer?"
4zro2m,2,2016-08-26,I just want to be a bitch,ThisIsNotAlright,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4zro2m/i_just_want_to_be_a_bitch/,"I want to preface this by saying that I don't want to post this in /r/relationships because I'm not looking for advice, I just want to rant and get this off of my chest.

About 8 months ago, my boyfriend cheated on me in a pretty screwed up way. He had an ongoing emotional affair for months which eventually turned physical. The girl he had his affair with had just turned 18 (he's 26) and was under the assumption that he was in an open relationship and that I was cool with what was going on. He got drunk one night while I was busy with a school project and drove to her place. Long story short, they fucked without a condom, he felt bad and left. He then proceeded to ignore me for DAYS by leaving town and staying with friends (we lived together). I knew something was up, but he adamantly denied it. I found out because he has NEVER pulled that shit before and I had a sneaking suspicion that something was up, so I snooped ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

We broke up for 6 months and I got on with my life and partied, went to frat parties, slept with as many people as I wanted to (we were together for 12 years), made connections with people that would have been inappropriate while in a relationship, snagged a sick as fuck internship that payed $30/h.. you get the idea.

However, in the end I still missed him and I missed the connection we had. His reasoning for doing what he did weren't too far out there. I ignored him (because I was busy with school, not maliciously), spent most of my days in the city I go to school in, made him feel unwanted and unloved. Shit excuses for cheating, but I can buy that he was attention starved and she gave him what I couldn't. I'm a fucking engineer major in the last year of my program. Of course I'm busy and I have no time for anyone or anything other than school. I could tell he knew he fucked up and I could tell he regretted every second of what he did. I could tell how lost he was and I could tell that he felt the full weight of his actions. Some will call me an idiot, and some will say I'm just asking for this to happen again, but I believe we all make mistakes and that whole ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" mantra is crap. I forgave him and moved back in with him under the condition that  he is honest with me from here on out and he communicates issues before they become a ""thing"" and he fucks up again. Of course I have to abide by the same conditions. If I forgive him, I need to forgive him completely and I need to not let this hang over us like a dark cloud.

I cant though, I have days where it's literally all I can think about. The images of him fucking this 18 year old blond bitch flood my brain and I just want to curl in a ball or scream at him. I cant though, because those kind of actions are toxic and completely counter-productive to both our relationship and my mental state.

I know I could find someone loyal and loving. I'm a catch. I'm tall and slender, people find me incredibly attractive and I catch men staring at me a lot. I'm also very, very smart with 2 degrees, one in an incredibly difficult and demanding engineering field. I'll be alright in life if I didn't have him. I don't want to though, I want him. I want him and I want our life to be like it was pre cheating. He was perfect, and attentive and caring. I never for a second doubted he loved me or admired me. We started dating in middle school for fucks sake. We can have entire conversations with facial expressions and he's enriched my life by just existing. The last 3 months we've been back together, he's never been anything but an ideal boyfriend and I an ideal girlfriend. I just cant shake the feelings I get periodically where I want to yell and scream and destroy his entire life. I've had sick thoughts of messaging this girl to interrogate her and, to be honest, just straight up harass her. Everything I've read about forgiving a cheater says to ACTUALLY FORGIVE THEM and to not let this be the elephant in the room, but I cant deny the feelings I have and the anger inside of me. I've always been a major proponent for fairness and equality in a relationship, but I want to see him grovel.


This is not healthy, but ranting helps. I'm getting over it, but why does it have to take so long?"

I'm not sure about programming, she has never tried it and she's not sure she can do it at all.

One of the obvious choices is graphical design, at least she's good with Photoshop so there's something to start with.

Are there any other options? She doesn't need much money, but the job should be something to be proud with. So it should be some area where she can progress and engage her intellect.

Update with clarification.

&gt;How much money does she need?

Honestly, if she makes $400 after 6 months of studying it will be awesome.

&gt;Why does she need an online job vs. an in-person job? Is there any particular reason why the job needs to be remote/online?

She wants to move to Vietnam. She doesn't speak Vietnamese, so local jobs are mostly inaccessible.

&gt;What is her educational background?

Political science bachelor.

&gt;What is her skill set? What has she done in the past, work/school-wise?

Apart from her education, she has fluent English (much better than mine), she has been volunteering on a snake observation station for a couple of months, she used to be a punk drummer (irrelevant, of course), she has basic PC user skills. She has also worked in a government organization in Thailand for a few months as an intern, mostly working with documents plus some translations from English to Thai. She can apply as a government official easily, but she doesn't want to work in Thailand.

&gt;Is she looking for something freelance, or ongoing?

It doesn't actually matter, it just has to be something to be proud of.

&gt;What computer skills does she have, and does she have some sort of portfolio that highlights them?

Basic user skills plus some Photoshop experience, nothing worth a portfolio. I'm considering buying her some graphic design courses."

And I knew I wanted to be a part of that.

I don't want to do android work though, that is about as specific as I can get with a chosen path right now (for some reason, and I could be/ probably am wrong, when I think of software development work for android I don't see much opportunity - I'd like to stick to PC work).

My aunt said that I need to stick my nose in a book 24/7 for a month and learn Ruby and Python and within a month I should be able to have some form of work (if I learned well enough), even if it's just intern work.

I'm looking for the fastest way to get into work of any sort that will then continue furthering my knowledge and opening up more opportunities for larger companies.

I've been told self-taught is the way to go if you're motivated enough...because during that you can start buidling a portfolio faster, and that you can be more hands on in the learning process.

Is self-taught the way to go? Is my aunts advice sound? Would some form of schooling be reccommended? I live in Portland, Oregon...if I am going to do schooling I'd rather it be in person than online (unless there's this unfathomably amazing online program that is a MUST).

I am sick of min wage jobs, I am sick of feeling like nothing is getting accomplished, and I am sick of scraping by. I want to be a part of something huge...and I love technology, always have. I am smart enough to pick up on things quick. I just really need someone with an answer that looks like ""you need to start here, work your way to this, and then find work in these areas"".

A lot of answers I see to this question is ""it's all dependant on the individual"" which is a sweet thought and all, but I do better when I am given one direction I can work off of. And then once I've got my bearings in the work I have something to work off of in exploring new paths.

So basically, if I am as dedicated as I am making myself out to be...how soon can I get a job (any job), and what do I need to do to get there?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

EDIT: So my aunts wild declirations of being able to self teach a very involved languages of coding within a month AND land a job have been proven to be, what I had originially thought, too good to be true.......still though.......there was that hope

Anyway , I suppose I am seeing why it's a far more difficult answer than ""start here, work towards this, and you should have a basic foundation to go into most areas""

Regardless of all this new headway, I am actually far more pumped to start this journey. The idea of putting more time into it is exciting. Due to personal life events, funds are going to limit me to (what feels like) resorting to self teaching at first. These bootcamps sound like they could be incredibly helpful though. 

However, I did save all the resources all of you have provided me thus far...and I really appreciate it! Thank you very much :D

EDIT: apologies if this post made any software developer, software engineer, or any other team member (who's position title I don't know yet) like their work was being belittled by this thought of being able to go from no knowledge in the field to landing a job in a month's time. Or my skewed thoughts of thinking web development may have been ""lower"" on the totem pole in terms of career options. It only further explemlified just how much I'm not realizing I'm about to embark on, and how young, unrealizing, and ignorant I made myself look. And I'm even more grateful for making this post and everyone being chill enough to gently put me in my place without cutting me down. Thank you 😁"

It certainly helped to land me this job (actually more of an internship).

Anyways, in short, here is the situation Im in:

* Got a job 3 weeks ago at a start-up in a language I had no idea how to use, JavaScript/TypeScript. 
* They put me in a role developing their mobile app, Angular2/Ionic2 Frameworks.
* For the past three weeks, I have been plugging away for &gt;10hrs/day getting down the basics. 
* They threw a tough problem at me first, I guess to see if I could sink or swim. They were surprised when I said that I had pretty much finished it this past week. So I asked what I could start working/thinking about next. 

The CTO told me that he wants a feature of the app to be a task manager for the company, connecting the bosses on desktops sending tasks to the employees on mobile. He wants me to design it and produce it from the ground up.

I have no idea where to even start.  
I began looking at other task managing apps and I liked some features which I want to incorporate. But other than that, should I sit down at a piece of paper and sketch this thing out? Should I just start plugging away at code? Should I start with the desktop app first or the mobile? Should I think about my DB structure first? 

How do you go about developing an architecture/layout/design? 

Even though they are not paying me even minimum wage, I still want this to be the best it can.  I cant wait to begin, I just have no idea WHERE to begin. "

Already took courses for CS, and trying to pursue CE.

I spent a long time coming up with an academic plan with my university's school of engineering recently, and it is very possible for me to petition and declare late. If enrollment is in my favor and the stars just align just right, I could still finish in 4 years. 

I still have a ""pre-med"" mentality, where I'm willing to take any volunteer experience, job opportunities, and internships relative to the field. Currently I do volunteer to teach children how to code, work in CS position at my university and intern in IT, however I've been told that those positions will be completely irrelevant when applying to my first job after graduating. 

I know that if I dropped all these responsibilities, I could definitely take on more course work. I could also try to purse the BS/MS program (maybe I'm a little to eager, but I would just like to *try*). However, I am not quite sure what an MS will do other than showcase you have an MS degree and have a bit more educational experience. 

Also on a plus side, I don't have many unprofessional friends, have bonded with a lot with my professors, tend to like working alone, and don't plan to have any love affairs anytime soon.

The reason I'm posting this is because I'm having trouble determining what my next step for employment should be. I would like to get into routing/switching and network operations, I find it much more interesting. I just don't know if I can go from 'tier 1' to network operations engineer, it seems like a big jump.

What I have now:
I had a 6 month internship in 2012.
I have an AS degree in Network and Cyber Security.
I have the A+ certification
I am a contractor at tier 1 Help Desk, and there are no spots for advancement within the company been here for 11 months exactly.

What I am doing to improve:
Currently in school pursuing my BS degree in Network and Cyber Security. My current class is directly correlated with the CCNA.
I am studying for Net +, and Security + and I want them by the end of this year.

I know I need to look for internships but I really needs some ideas on where I might be a good fit. Here's a basic summary of my skill set and interests:

-I don't mind coding, but wouldn't want to spend all day doing it

-Good at broad picture (like being given a project and knowing I need to create x number of classes that do XYZ) but not always great at actually writing the code to make it efficient

-I enjoy writing sorting algorithms, and trying to organize data

-I like more abstract math and patterns, like working with the Fibronocci numbers, finite state machines and inductive proofs

-I'm not a big fan of Calculus or Stat, but once I really understand how a specific problem works I don't mind doing that same type of problem again

-I've only taken one Networking class so far, but I really enjoyed it

-Not at all interested in working with the hardware aspect of Comp Sci

-Computer security and ethics was super interesting to me, but I'm taking my first security class with actual coding this semester

-I like working with other people, in the sense that I like having a project to work on with a team and each member takes a portion and completes it individually. I'm not a big fan of everyone trying to do every aspect of the project together.

-I like to think I'm good at both thinking outside the box for solutions but also with being given a specific task and carrying it out concretely.


Sorry for the length,I just wanted to try to be as specific as possible! I'm really stressed about figuring out where I'll fit into the working CS community. Any ideas would be amazing"
4zvw2p,6,2016-08-27,TIFU by getting too drunk at my company's annual works outing,AnotherThrowaway_xyz,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4zvw2p/tifu_by_getting_too_drunk_at_my_companys_annual/,"For the last two months I've been doing an internship at an amazing company. I got along nicely with everyone and I honestly couldn't have had a better time. I had been hoping that I might even get the chance to start there after I'm done with school.

Yesterday was my last day there and the annual works outing happened to be on that day.   
At first, everything was fine. Everyone was drinking a bit, we get tipsy, I make some jokes, people laugh. Basically, everything was perfect. Sometime later that night I fucked up though. Don't ask me when it happened but at some point I had obviously had too much alcohol. I can honestly not tell you when things took a turn for the worse but basically what happened is that I sat next to a colleague of mine and probably spent like 45 minutes hugging him and telling him that we're ""bros and homeboys"" now. I probably also slurred incoherently. I tend to do that.  
That whole time two of the three CEOs were sitting next to me, both pretty much completely sober.

When the time to leave came around, I got on the bus with all the other people. At that point, I realized that I had fucked up. I started whining about how dumb it was of me to drink as much as I did, since I'm only an intern and that I probably will not be welcomed back after this. The guy who sat next to me told me that it's fine but I'm pretty sure it's not.

Don't worry, it gets worse. I don't know how or when it happened but basically, at some point I got out of the bus and threw up. Thinking back, I might have even thrown up in the bus. I can't remember.  
Imagine that: A bus full of people looking out of the window and the intern who's been working at your company for just two months now is collapsed on the floor, throwing up everything he ate 2 hours ago.

One of my colleagues was nice enough to give me a ride home afterwards but I'm sure that even though I probably left a lasting impression, I won't be their first pick when they look for interns again next year.

I'm currently trying to figure out how to deal with this situation now. I'm considering sending the CEOs an email and letting them know that I'm sorry, though I'm not sure if that would be a nice gesture or if it would make things just more awkward. I could also just send _my_ CEO a message on Facebook or something, though I'm not sure if that's enough.

I'm obviously not good at dealing with people, so I'd love to hear what you guys would do in this situation.



TL;DR: Got too drunk at company's annual works outing and made an ass of myself. Probably threw away any chances of working there again even though everything seemed to be going just perfectly before this incident."

1. Boot-Camp: There's one locally in my area, and if I get accepted, they work with local companies for internships and FT positions. 

2. Online CS Degree: This could be from 1-4 years, but if done, I feel like I would be in much better standing than I am now. The only issue is getting loans for it; I owe about 25k federal and 6k private now.

3. Air Force: Enlist in something IT-related and go from there? I have only done some light research on this.

4zxewg,9,2016-08-27,"[MN, USA] I think I have bad mold... already moved in, haven't signed lease",IDefendMyself,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4zxewg/mn_usa_i_think_i_have_bad_mold_already_moved_in/,"I moved to a very small town in northern Minnesota in mid-July, 2016. Since then my original landlord refused to pay for a broken washing machine that was in the lease. She said I had two options: for her to raise my rent by $50 a month and fix it, or to let me out of my lease. I took the second option and found an apartment. Now her son claims he's really the owner of the house and that I don't have a right to move out. The landlady said her other son told her she had ""no business"" making those offers and now she and her family might sue me.

I found this new apartment on a short notice. It's big, I love it, and it's right above a shop owned by the new landlords. My lease is due to start on September 1st and I haven't signed it yet, but I did pay for my first month's rent and deposit. She let me move in early because she ""would rather have someone here,"" so I've been at the apartment for a few days. 

The first time I came to see the place all the windows were open and while there as a little bit of an odor, it's an old place (built in the 20's) and I didn't think much of it. Since I've moved in, however, the smell in the bedroom and kitchen has become overwhelming. Especially when the windows are closed, it's so strong I nearly can't stand it. I started putting my things away today and going in and out of the kitchen and bedroom. Now, I really, really want to like this place, but when I went into the kitchen a few minutes ago I started gagging and almost threw up.

I'm afraid if I say anything to the new landlords they won't want to pay to fix it, and given the trouble I may now be in leaving my first lease I may be in trouble with two places. I haven't signed the lease here but I'm due to sign it soon. 

What should I do before next Wednesday when I have to sign the new lease here? I am really afraid the new landlords will tell me it's a whim or I'm making up how badly it's bothering me, but I'm not acting at all - the smell is truly awful. I looked up some tenant laws in MN and read that landlords aren't required to let someone out of the lease due to mold. I am truly getting nauseous going into the kitchen/bedroom. I could threaten to move back into my old place and keep that lease, but I really do not want to go back there as that family is awful and the son called me names on the phone when I told him his mom offered to let me out of the lease. I am new in this town, I don't know anybody, and my internship is really intense. I need to spend time working and studying not dealing with legal problems, but I'm really don't think I can live with this apartment smelling like this. 

The apartment also has an opening from the upstairs kitchen into a roof that the landlord told me already is not up to code or regulations. I don't know if I could use that to my advantage in any way but I'm just putting it out there in case it's relevant. The Minnesota Department of Health does not provide direct services, such as inspections or testing, for mold problems. [http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/renters.html] but they might come for something like the roof are that's not in compliance, however, I want the mold taken care of not the area outside the kitchen.  

Here is a picture of the floor next to the fridge in the kitchen http://imgur.com/a/QuzhQ - it may be where the smell comes from. But it's really strong in the bedroom too and the floor is okay there, so I don't know. I have never been in a place where there was bad mold before so I didn't know what the smell was or what could be causing it. It's starting to irritate my throat too; I am using a wax warmer to cover the smell but it's not really doing it. It will get cold soon too and I will need to close the windows. I don't know what to do, whether to sign the new lease, or how to get them to fix it if I do.

It’s an internal tool.

I barely wrote a line of C Sharp before this project.

Writing the tool was easy - but apparently there are TONS of conventions that C Sharp developers are supposed to follow. 

I suppose there was a miscommunication. The developer correcting my code always told me not to rush, not to hurry, etc. And now my boss has come down on me like an anvil, after he tested an unstable build of my code and it didn’t work as promised (inaccurate data was being passed through).

This was supposed to take me two weeks and now it has taken five. Replacing different functions in C Sharp with other ones that do the exact same thing but are considered good style. (I guess LINQ is supposed to be used instead of foreach?) 

There were problems getting the team's codebase and integrating my code into it. It was a sink-or-swim environment and I think I did really well considering my inexperience with these sorts of things and the lack of guidance.

I never actually had this problem before, that I wasn’t working quickly enough, because at my last job, not such a great company, I dramatically exceeded all of the time expectations. 

The thing is - what can I say to my boss to let him know that this was just a hiccup and that I really want to succeed at my other assignments? "

My situation is that I'm a community college student who will get his AS in computer science next year (I know that doesn't count for anything in Europe) and I'm at the point where I'm applying to other Universities/State Schools in the US. My plan (or rather dream) is to complete my bachelor's overseas and maybe my master's and find some job as a software engineer out of college. 

I have about $10,000 saved up for my education and the rest I suppose I will have to loan out/work for. The only work experience I have is as an intern at a traffic engineering company. And I can speak English and conversational Japanese. Obviously that's not useful but I'm gonna work hard to learn the language of wherever I choose to move. 

So how can an undergraduate student with barely any qualifications and not a lot of money survive and get an education in Europe? Is it feasible? Is it advisable? If so which country gives the best chance for international undergrads? Any other advice/criticism would be appreciated. "

- What books should I read to better myself in a Data Science mindset 
- What internships or job opportunities should I search for as a sophomore in CC with a 3.5 GPA. (If any)
- Are there any programming languages anyone highly recommends for the job field?
- Any good books for math review of important formulas (for calc 2 series and stats)
- What can I do to set myself apart from other people of the same major?

I want to note I have only taken two programming courses so far in my life (So one year in total of programming). This is only a basic python course and java course. I will be taking data structures this year. I know this is a lot to answer so answering any of the questions listed above is more than amazing!

This next course I'm finishing college. I will only have one class, plus my final degree dissertation and an internship. I should be pleased with this, since I have spent four years complaining about how much college work I had.

But instead I am filled with dread. I fear that having too much free time I'll start ruminating on my life. Every summer, when the classes finish and I stop having to meet people everyday, I get somewhat gloomy and depressed, even though I go out with my friends. I fear that next year it's going to be just that but much worse and for much longer, since I'm going to have very little social interaction during the weekdays.

I'm going to try to counteract this feelings by joining some language classes. I want to get some certifications on English, German and Italian, so that should keep me busy, but I'm afraid that this won't be enough, and that at some point I'll get depressed, I'll give up on all those goals and feel miserable. 

Do you have any advice on how to go though this?

I use canes to get around and have minor Ballance issues. These generally haven't held me back in school or lab environments; however, in a past internship I was pidgeon holed into  sitting only jobs in a lab environment.

 When all the other newbie interns were being trained on lab equipment I was given an ""important"" coding project that lasted the length of everyone else's training rotations. When that project ran out I was getting busywork while everyone else was doing lab work. When I asked to do anything lab related I was thrown a project with no instruction or training, which all the other interns had before working on real projects, and the project i given was a ""don't fuck this up"" type project. When I took too long and asked for help I was told no one had time to train me, and I was sent back to BS work with everyone feeling justified in their assumptions of my uselessness. 

Obviously I fucked up by not heading this off earlier, but how should I deal with this when I start a real job? I am worried anything I say like ""if you think I might have trouble doing something ask me first please"" might make hr afraid of lawsuits, or come off as accusatory. Help?"
5023l6,1,2016-08-28,"Having Second Thoughts About My Job - New Boss, Possibly Better Opportunities?",concernedfullstack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5023l6/having_second_thoughts_about_my_job_new_boss/,"A little bit about me. I do post on here on occasion and lurk, but I need to use a throwaway for this one to avoid being identified. I graduated from a state school in December with a degree in IT, focused on web development, minoring in CS and Business. Since May of 2015, I had been interning at a marketing agency in my city, getting paid a reasonable wage and working on a major project for their top client. I was offered a job with said agency straight out of college, and after some negotiation, took it. I make $55K as a Full Stack Developer, working on a team of 3 developers including a lead. I also work closely with creative and business development, and in a way also take orders from their managers.

For the most part, I don't have an issue with the place I work. My co-workers are nice for the most part, despite a lot of cliques and silos existing in the workplace. The CEO absolutely loves what I do and praises me often, although he tends to run his mind very fast and act on ideas without much thought, which causes the other managers of the organization at times to come into conflict in attempts to calm him down.

The main point that is making me rethink my decision to stay with the company is my direct supervisor. When I began as an intern last summer, she was very nice, included me with every decision, every activity, always giving fist bumps and pats on the back to myself and my co-workers, and taking us out for food/social events/etc. She then stepped down from her position due to her feeling too much stress, and our division director took over managing our team. This guy is awesome, calm, cool, experience with our organization, and friendly - almost father-like to our team. Things are going incredibly well with him until late June when he left to become a director at an oil company.

With his departure, my old department supervisor takes over our team again, but this time with less actual day-to-day work responsibility and a focus on management instead full-time. Since she took over again, I noticed her attitude, especially towards me, has changed. She is personal friends with the other developer on our team and they are working on massive R&amp;D projects together, and they seem close both in and outside of work. Her attitude towards me has become less personable, more rigid, and she is nitpicky about ideas that I propose. She argues that we ""need to be our own worst critics"", but I feel that the feedback is not being delivered with tactfulness. When I or the other developer have given feedback to her, she has often responded seeming personally offended and defensive.

I have also noticed what seems to be not-so-good circumstances internally. For example, our HR director (who I've met with regarding some of my concerns) drunkenly admitted to me during a conversation at a social event a while back that our company only has 12-18 months of capital left - we are expanding, but our revenue stream at the moment is not to account for it. In addition, there is somewhat of a tone of desperation amongst management for all of us to try and create things to attract new clientele. We are currently dependent on one client's retainer and the rest of our clients do not utilize us as much, only on an hourly as-needed basis.

At the same time, two recent opportunities came my way to become a software developer at other companies. One recruiter recently contacted me about a position they have at an area non-profit organization that is stable, has better benefits, and helps a cause I believe in. The starting pay would be much higher than I make right now. Also, an agency recently contacted me about putting my resume out for me to potentially relocate and work on contract for organizations that fit my skill set. I eventually want to start a company of my own, and am working on some things on the side, but we all need money to survive - I still live with my mom, but I have student loan debt and other debt to pay down before going out on my own.

I am feeling conflicted in my mind as to what to do. I am planning on polishing up my resume and sending it to the recruiters for the heck of it. I just feel like I deserve a better employment experience and that I am capable of getting better. Any thoughts from more experienced professionals would definitely be appreciated. Thank you."

If I don't give my response in 3 business days (tomorrow), this offer will be rescinded. I tried to negotiate this, but they were firm on it. I reached out two the two other job positions to see if I could expedite hearing their choice for a candidate, but because its government that process is very hard to speed up and they said the best they can do is by the end of next week. 

My internships were both with one of the government agencies I'm waiting on. I have no experience with consulting, therefore don't know if I'll be good at it or like it at all. I'm really outgoing and love working in teams and being out in the field. Though I consider myself an ""engineer"" I'm not the most technical... new concepts don't always click immediately for me. I had to try really fucking hard in college and really worked for the grades I received (3.3gpa). Not sure if this is useful information for determining what career is best for me. I really enjoyed the people who interviewed me, the type of projects I'd be working on, and am intrigued by the company that made the offer. I think it would be a great opportunity to network and learn a ton. But, I can't help to feel anxious about the possibility of getting offers from the other options. One of them is an amazing opportunity with the US Forest Service in California. The other is with the same agency I interned with in Washington. Deep down I know I want to get out of the midwest and move out west (PNW or Cali), but moving across the country would be super stressful right now because I'm broke and still need to buy a car. I honestly feel like I have a chance at getting an offer from one of them, but I feel like it would be ignorant not to accept the offer I have now because there is a chance I won't get an offer from either. I think the most intelligent choice economically is to accept the offer I have, but I'm still so anxious and unsure. ooooh the paradox of choice... Any advice would be appreciated.

Most of that seems confidential, obviously) and I guess I only know the basics. Anyways, my college STEM group announced in the spring that there will be a brief internship that I can do to experience computer science and will be a project that is related to gaming and another one about some topic that isn't decided. Anyone could come and we would learn how to contribute as a team and succeed. Well, the internship was CANCELLED. I don't see how they think we'll find out if this is for us if we can't ever experience any kind of non-class-related stuff. That seems to be what internships are looking for now, because the summer internships I applied to didn't even respond for one fucking interview. I never really enjoyed comp sci class, it never really came easily to me, but it seems like such a desirable career these days and from my experience talking to microsoft devs they are really happy with their jobs. So my question is: What am I missing? Comp sci class was basically just practice problems, no real understanding of how this all works. No learning of how to work in a team, blah blah blah, other stuff. So I'm lost because I'm starting my second year of college, have tried C# and more java, and simply don't know how to find if this is for me. And even though I didn't earn the internship promised to me, I was going to let this determine whether or not this is all for me. And I was fucking excited to do this. Now I'm just sitting here confused. Trying to learn C# has been confusing/boring, and now I'm just out of answers. I want to proceed in computer science, but I'm just so confused.

I tried searching this sub for people in my position, but it seems like a majority of the people asking for advice have either already graduated or are about to. I think I still have a little more time, which is why I wanted some guidance while I'm still early in my undergraduate. I have currently started my sophomore year in college, and I am majoring in Computer Science. My freshman performance was painfully average: I got a GPA of 3.3 overall, 3.4 major. Of course, I will try moving this up to at least a 3.7 by the time of graduation.

But besides this, is there anything else I should be working on? I've read some posts here saying I should get involved with research, and I have contacted some of my professors about this. Is one or two semesters of research good enough? And is it better to work on research your junior or senior year, when you work on more advanced topics?

I have had two internships so far (both coding), one for a start up and one for a mid-tier Fortune 500 company. I have performed alright, I think my boss in the bigger company would give me a letter of recommendation. I will of course try getting more internships, and will probably work for two or so years after college before applying to grad school. Also, whose letters of recommendations are preferred? Professors, employers? If I had to get an employer's letter of recommendation, does it have to be someone very recent (my last job or two) or is an employer from 5 or 6 years ago still a good idea?

I am currently looking into an MS, but I have still not completely removed the possibility of pursuing an MBA. I love business as much as science. Will technical jobs and research still help in getting admission into a good MBA program? Or would you have to get experience from more business-oriented jobs?

Finally, where were you guys at this stage in college? I know so far my GPA is very average, but I think I have good work experience for someone only entering his second year. How about you?

Thanks for all the help, guys!

EDIT: Also, as asked in a comment below, when should I start preparing for my GRE/GMAT? If I want to pursue an MBA, I will need 2 or 3 years of work experience, so I could study during that time. Though this isn't the case for MS. "

1. I like coding, do any of these jobs keep at least some coding in play? The network admin where I'm an intern at does no coding that I see.
2. Which certifications and when? I've seen so many letter combinations, it's making my head spin and I don't know which ones are really important to have and at what point.
3. How many years of experience are needed before trying to jump to the security side of the industry?
4. Master's? Is it terribly difficult to get an employer to pay for it in this field?

So I started gaming while I was bored. I got caught a few times, and was approached by my manager. I wrote him an apology, and never did it again since. It didn't really phase me because the department in general is pretty laid back. However, we recently had a dinner where we were pointing out some of our accomplishments, and one of the other employees pointed out that my gaming was all that he would remember me for. Now I realize that I probably won't be invited to come back next year. So yeah, don't be an idiot like me.

While this company was fantastic to work at, I think I want to explore the other 3 big-four companies, hedge funds and smaller startup-like companies (Pinterest etc.) but find it tough to risk the return offer in hand (a bird in hand is worth two in the bush?). I have a few questions about this:

1) If I do accept the return offer for next summer, how hard is it to switch out to a big-4 company or something like Snapchat for full-time next fall, given that I would never have interned for them? I've been told I'll be facing a really similar deadline next year again. For new grad jobs, do companies accept people who haven't interned with them and if they do, can they start the process in the summer? I'm talking about companies like Google, FB, MS, Apple, Two Sigma, Snapchat, Pinterest etc.

2) What happens if I sign the return offer and then renege on it for a better one? I've seen various conflicting views on this, but wanted to know what Reddit has to say about this particular situation. (Some further context: some of the recruiters at these other companies know about my existing offer deadline and they've been asking if I can get an extension. I did try really hard to get an extension but I could get it only for a week. So these recruiters would sort of know if I do renege on my offer.)"

Answers or the semi-disabled, well-meaning (but annoyingly preachy) old people on 7 Cups, someone on Reddit might actually understand what I'm posting and the deep sadness I have, considering this is a sub-reddit and all.

This is my first time even using the site so I don't get how it works, as a disclaimer.

I graduated college with a 4.0 GPA, moved away from an abusive family (physical and mental, ranging from getting hit in the face so hard I'm a little deaf to being told to kill myself and that everyone hates me, then two seconds later being told ""you imagined that""), and am now looking for a job. It has been a year since I moved here and I still have no job. All my friends have jobs. I had a killer internship and a few good temp jobs at major studios, but nobody fucking cares and I am getting really fed up with the ""if you play your cards right, work hard in school, have great work ethic, don't do drugs, be nice, you will succeed"" shit. I have this sudden and uncontrollable urge to blow my fucking brains out. I was the one who was doing everything right, who prayed at night when she was 8 years old and her father was slamming her face into the corner of the kitchen wall, that one day I would be successful. 

I feel like it is so taboo to even MENTION that you've had a hard life-- you are expected to be fucking happy all the time in my industry. I am depressed because of my unescapable past, not because I'm some monster. But I feel like they see me as some damaged shelter dog. I am told by every counselor, temp agency, friend of a friend, mentor, etc. that I am doing everything RIGHT. So why is nothing working? Why do HR people tell me I killed it in the interview and then I NEVER get hired? I feel like every piece of the universe wants me to kill myself. My life has been Murphy's Law.

Thing is, my life took a turn for the worst when I got this abusive roommate. She treats me like shit and breaks my stuff. She never showers and rubs cigarette butts into my clothes. My other roommate is horrified, she doesn't understand either. On top of that, this triggered my OCD, which is now consuming every minute of my day because I am afraid she is giving me thirdhand smoke and cancer. My feet turn black from walking on her side of the room, and I haven't slept in weeks for more than 2 hours because I wake up sweating and crying. I mention this because the living situation I have (lasts for 3 more months and I can't escape the lease, I've tried) is making my depression worse.

I also have an awful eating disorder and the shame of it is killing me. I was anorexic a year or so ago and then I developed binge eating disorder, going from 72 lbs to 160 lbs (at 5'2) and everyone at college making fun of me for it behind my back. All my acquaintances left me when I got fat. I got kicked out of clubs (all clubs at my college were student run) all for being a fat fuck. It was a vein and political school. We had no administration to mediate this. They saw how much I was eating and people texted me mean shit about it. I think about this every day, even after I have been out of school for a whole year. So I lost down to 116 lbs and now I am creeping up to 118 lbs again cause I binged all week while plotting my own suicide. I feel myself getting fatter and fatter and I want to blow my brains out because I have no control. It is just like college all over again. I have tried medication so don't propose that. I was a transfer student into this college (abusive life in high school prevented me from getting in because I had low SAT scores) but I stayed determined, and left school in the literal top 1% of the class. 

OK SO WHERE IS MY FUCKING JOB? If you do all the work, if you have been working for a year cleaning up puke and snot and bathrooms, why can't anything work? I can't go back to my abusive dad! He is the only other place I can go or I am homeless, and rent is high. 

All my friends are getting super cool jobs and I can't take it anymore. They don't deserve it. They are not as smart or as good at the job as I am. As someone with low self-esteem and who has tried the slow release of starving herself to death before, it takes A LOT for me to say I am smarter or better at something than someone, and with that said, I mean it. 

If the world works like this: ""You can be the hardest worker of all time, rise up out of an abusive household, escape cardiac arrest from anorexia, going deaf from child abuse, and moving all the way to the other side of the country alone-- YET you still won't get hired over someone with a well-connected uncle"" then guess what? I don't WANT to be alive. I have been plotting my suicide for quite some time now and yesterday the cops came to my house because I told my sister I wanted her to have all my belongings and she got scared. I don't CARE about my sister being sad after I die. She will get the fuck over it like everyone else will. Everyone moves on, it's just how life works. And I'm so fucking done."

508iny,1,2016-08-29,Advice for my mom... in the middle of a divorce with my dad who just filled bankruptcy against her,teach_me_the_way12,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/508iny/advice_for_my_mom_in_the_middle_of_a_divorce_with/,"To start off my mother is the strongest women I know... but right now shes completely lost... internet people please help.

My mom and father have been in the process of getting a divorce for the last year. Currently they are in a process called collaboration in MASS. It has not been going well at all. It seems as though each time they make an agreement my father then changes his mind and asks for something different or wants something more. This process has been going on for a year and they have made NO changes.

The basics of the divorce is two credit cards in my dads name, one joint credit card, a trailer loan, and a paid off truck, and then there is my moms retirement and then my fathers military.

Because they were married for more then 30 years my mom automatically gets half of my dads military.

They continue to go back and forth and at this point in time my dad has stopped paying all the bills (this really only effects my moms in relation to the trailer and the joint card) He has also stopped giving my mom her half of the military retirement.

In the last few weeks my father decided that he will be claiming a chapter 7 bankruptcy in regards to his credit card bills and then will be filing against my mom for the trailer loan and the joint card.

NOW here is where things get interesting...

my dad is asking for the truck which is paid off as well as half of my mothers retirement. in return he will take the two credit cards that are in just his name and my mom must assume responsibility for the joint and the trailer.

My dad currently lives with his girlfriend, if this happens he will essentially not have to pay anything and will get enough money to pay off all the bills from my mom plus his military retirement. Which intern leaves my mom with a shit ton of debt but yes he will have a chapter 7 bankruptcy on his file.

My mom now has to deal with a new lawyer because she has to fight the bankruptcy claim against in Rhode Island while the divorce is taking place in Mass. She feels like her lawyer isnt helping her any more and has no idea what to do.

Any thoughts, suggestions or ANYTHING would be appreciated.

I'm already in my 4th year of school and I need to decide my major in the next 24 hours. I can either:

1. Major in Comp Sci Engineering and graduate only 1 year late (but I'll have to take summers, so no internship experience)

2. Major in Comp Sci Enginering and graduate two years late (opportunity for internships during summers).

3. Major in Data Analytics (basically like CSE but more stats and a few less Comp sci classes) and graduate two years late (opportunity for internships during summers).

A few questions:
I've heard that finishing early with no internship experience puts you in a worse position than taking your time with internships. Does the same apply to my situation (graduating late)? 

Also, will I be at the same disadvantage if I finished a option 1 then a masters and still lacked internship experience?

Do you think a traditional CSE degree is a better idea than the more specialized Data Analytics even if I want to get into machine learning?"

&amp;nbsp;

Lately I have been thinking a lot about a move to a data science career. Before I move on I should tell a little bit about my background. I have a bachelor within Geography (well technically a combination between Earth Sciences &amp; Economics), which included some classes in data analysis. Note that I am speaking about the period 2007-2010, so it is quite a while back.

&amp;nbsp;

Afterwards I moved to Denmark (being Dutch myself) and got a Master degree within Nature Management. This covered a variety of courses, including some in GIS (which I loved), and I ended up doing a hedonic pricing study as my master thesis, concerning the influence of public amenities on house prices (proximity to lakes, parks etc), and actually used GIS and R for this. After being done in 2012 I tried finding a job in Denmark, but even do I had pretty good grades I had trouble finding a job mostly due to a language barrier (most jobs I applied were within municipalities or ministries, requiring fluent Danish).

&amp;nbsp;

Since I always had an interest in programming and needed a job, in the period between 2012-2014 (in between internships related to my studies) I learned myself programming. I landed a job in 2012 as iOS developer and currently at my second job in another company doing the same. Even though I am fairly happy as developer, I do feel that I am not as passionate about architecture etc as others. I am starting to feel that I do miss doing something related to my studies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then lately I have been reading a lot about data science/data analysis and actually have a great friend with a big interest in the field. I suddenly realized that I have had quite a few classes that were more or less directly related to this field, as well as me writing a thesis with help of GIS and R, and my lifelong love of maps, graphs and stats.
I suppose my 2 years of working as a developer could even be a great investment for a move towards data science. So I suddenly realize that perhaps data science is a way to combine my studies, with my experience within programming..

&amp;nbsp;

As I have taught myself programming, I am actually not so intimidated to pivot my career again. I would probably start with reading up on statstics, as well as start playing around in Python and R, as well as some D3 (always have liked to!). Then I guess I will write a blog about my experiences learning, and create a portfolio to show my skills. Perhaps this could be enough to get a job within the field in a year or so?

&amp;nbsp;

What I basically would appreciate is some opinions on my thoughts and on the feasibility of this plan :)"

I'm a student who is in his third year and have three internships (including one with a somewhat large company in SV). I should have another two (not at the same company) before I graduate.

This subreddit has me slightly stressed out as I always feel like I'm not doing enough to get a top job. Mostly because my side projects are garbage (trivial websites or school projects) and I have no network. Not because I lack ability (I think), but because I like doing things other than programming after work/school. 

At the same time I notice that many of the people commenting mostly have only one previous internship. So my question basically boils down to if that eight extra months of experience (and excellent reviews from my employer) can cover for a lack of side projects? 

P.S. if you are willing to help me with my resume I am would like to PM it to you because my friends read this site and could identify me even if anonymized "

I'm going to be going to school to  retake a class I failed in the Fall and another class I need to take in the winter, after which I will finally obtain my degree in Applied Math.  The only problems are I have no work experience, never had an internship/project, and a GPA of 2.3, my major GPA isn't much better.  I know no programming languages because when I tried to get into Computer Science classes the wait lists were ordered by GPA so I had no chance of getting into those classes :(.

I have recently started filling out applications for jobs at places like Target and Home Depot and other retail stores but it's going no where.  My parent, whom I live with, are very well off self employed in real estate and suggested I could get my real estate license and work part time for them.  They also suggested that my cousin who is an engineer might be able to get an internship for me once I get my degree.  


Here's also some additional details about me I should mention:

-I was the Risk Reduction chair at my fraternity for a few months and The chair of our leadership and ethics program which was the highest rank outside of the execute board

-I have a minor in Statistics that I completed in my second year of college

-I had a major falling out with my fraternity my senior year and lost many connections as a result :(

-I have been arrested five times during my college years, mostly for drunk in public but once for felony vandalism.  Long story short none of those arrests led to convictions except for a disturbing the peace infraction.  This is something I am not proud of at all and I am very lucky that things always went my way during these scenarios.

-I have ADHD and anxiety as far as mental health issues go

-Not sure if this matter at all but I am a very fit person that loves to exercise and lift weights and eat healthy

My main questions are: 

1.)How can I land a job while I'm finishing my degree with no work experience?

2.)Even if I do get my real estate license and that internship, how much does it help in landing a job that relates to my major even with a poor GPA?

3.)Where can I teach myself some programming languages or how to use some statistical software programs?

4.)Finally is there anything else I can do to pad my resume for gaining an entry level job related to my major while I am finishing my degree?

So after waiting what seemed like eternity for the GPU to arrive, I powered it on and was over the moon when it booted first time. GTA V was played immediately after windows and various drivers were installed, and I couldn't believe how much better it was than the peasant Xbox 360 life I was leading beforehand.

However... two weeks later, I was on my second to last day at an internship. The boss pulls me in for a great chat about all sorts, and then tells me he has a present for me for my time there. I was confused and didn't know at all what to expect. Thought maybe some gift vouchers which would have been a really sweet gesture.

Boss: ""I believe you were looking for one of these?""

...

I couldn't believe what I was looking at... A Zotac 1080?!?!? Jeeeeeeeeeeeeez. I lost my breathe, completely stumped as to what to say. I mustered as many thank you's as I could. Genuinely the best leaving present I could have hoped for.

But then it hit me; the build I have isn't going to do this card justice! Especially given my lust for the smallest mini-itx case I could get my hands on. Now currently I don't have the money to change any of the other parts, but tell me reddit, as time goes by where do you see the obvious bottle neck in this system which I should look to upgrade first?

50d592,1,2016-08-30,I'm 25 years old and I just switched my major to engineering. I have a few questions.,kookofalltrades,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/50d592/im_25_years_old_and_i_just_switched_my_major_to/,"Im 25, married, have a toddler, work full time as a medical lab technician, and have an AA degree. I live in SoCal. Just yesterday secured funding for 2 years worth of school (tuition and room and board) from a reliable family member. My employer provides 100% reimbursement for any community college classes that I take.

I am choosing engineering because it would be a perfect match for my skillset and personality. I am creative, logical, and a numbers guy. I love to solve problems, take things apart, and improvise. If I am not constantly challenged mentally, I get bored. 

Also, after being in the workforce for 5 years, I believe I have an edge over the younger kids. When I was 19 I failed out of community college because I was a lazy brat. Since then I got a real job, worked my way up the ranks while going back to school full time, got married, had a kid. Also, I've endured some hard times at work, meaning long hours and short staffing. I'm no stranger to hard work, but I've also learned to deal with failure.

The most math intensive classes that I've taken are Precalc and General Chem I, both of which I excelled at. High A's in both. Not trying to brag here, just trying to give you guys an indicator of where I'm at. In fact, I'm a little embarrassed, because my brother took Precalc in 11th grade.

So here's the plan. I will spend the next 3 years completing all of the lower division courses at my community college while working full time (school part time, 8-10 units per semester). This will be on my employer's dime. When I transfer to a university I will quit my job and go to school full time. Like I said, two years of this will be funded by a family member. I may wait and do some lower division coursework after I transfer so I can extend my time at the university to 3 years (I would get a loan to pay for the extra year). This will give me an extra summer to do an internship and more time to seek out special projects and clubs on campus. Then I will graduate and hopefully get a job.

A few questions:

At what stage are most prospective engineers weeded out? If I get A's and B's on my prereqs (calc I-III, DE, LA, physics I-III, circuits, statics, materials, graphics) is it a pretty good indicator of how I'll do in the upper division coursework?

Will my work experience be an advantage on my resume? I am a medical lab technician (albeit unlicensed) and worked my way up from secretary over the course of 5 years. I do plan to quit once I transfer to a university.

Is there a disadvantage to transferring to the lower-profile Cal States? I'm worried that if I go anywhere other than the Cal Polys or San Jose State my opportunities for internships will be significantly fewer. Would going somewhere like Chico dampen my prospects?

Any tips? I know I am taking an unconventional path, with a family and all, so I'm trying to set myself up as best I can. Does anyone have a similar story that they would like to share?"

I know the early I start searching and getting my information out there, the better a chance I have. Honestly, I am looking for an amazing internship (think Google, Twitter, LinkedIn - along those lines, higher level companies) and something that can really set me apart from others down the road when I am job searching. 

Some background information about me;

* I am not *technically* a CS major but very similar field, Information Assurance &amp; Security
* I do not go to a prestigious school by any means, but a decent affordable state school
* My GPA is not incredible, just OK (around 3.0)
* I am confident though with my past experience and the ability to have great interviews

Simply put, the advice I'm seeking and questions I have are

* When should I start looking for internships for next summer? How early should I be doing this?
* Who should I be contacting and following up with to try and get as many interviews as possible?
* Is there anything I can be doing right now in order to try and get a good internship for next summer?

50dnrm,0,2016-08-30,Preparing for summer internships... should I even consider applying?,cheeekyslug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50dnrm/preparing_for_summer_internships_should_i_even/,"I am preparing my applications / resume / CV so that I can apply for the following summer. Fortunately, I go to school right by Silicon Valley and only a 1.5 hours away from San Francisco and there's a lot opportunities. 

I switched to computer engineering this summer, but I have more in the field of biology / chemistry / statistics. I like the idea of data science, and I feel like it would be perfect for me to get into data analysis / big data, however my work experience makes me a perfect candidate for HR due to extensive clerical experience and customer service. I've been referred to HR before by tech women, and while I would only like it because I know how to handle the job, but it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to get into software, but I'm definitely not the most experienced. I've just been lurking around Github to get some ideas, but in reality, I don't think I'll finish any personal projects before applying. 

A lot of the current software internships are pretty standard - pursuing a CS related field and know a couple languages. What I'm more concerned about is the pre-tests. I remember I had tried out for an internship and failed it soon right after; I was embarrassed. Ever since then I haven't been practicing as much as I'd like to. I just practice day by day with HackerRank but I don't think it's enough. I hope when I get back into school mode that I will be able to practice a bit more. 

I've been offered advice on here and have found it very helpful. Now reflecting on that, I do think that there's more for me to learn. 

Now onto my questions.. do you think it's a bit suspicious to apply for an HR position then try to pursue the company later on for an engineering position? I also haven't declared my major yet. I'm technically proposed in Molecular, Cell, &amp; Developmental Biology but my academic advisors have listed Cognitive Science and Information Management as my secondary proposals, which both I have already qualified for. 

Would it be okay for me to say that I'm in the latter to apply for these  HR positions since it's too early for me to declare anyways? Lastly, will applying for internships with Facebook, Google, Cisco and the like at my very novice stage of my computer engineering degree be looked down upon? I know I'm already going to fail any test they give me and I don't have projects at the moment. Whenever I read the intern descriptions, it says you'll learn more about the field and work on projects with other leads and managers. I feel like it would be a great way to learn about the field a bit more to refine where I want to go with my degree. Some even allow freshmen to apply  and I'm only a sophomore, so I can't tell how if I should approach these internships lightly or seriously.

Current experience related to CE degree: teaching girls how to code through new start up (with questionable cash flow), IT intern for pharmaceutical company (only because I was pursuing pre-med at the time)

Any advice is really appreciate! "

I've been programming for about seven years now (I'm 25), having just finished a M.Sc. in Computer Graphics. As I initially planned on being a full-time academic, I don't have any work experience aside from a couple internships on UI, QA and mobile development. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances and disappointments with the academic life I was pursuing, I decided to make a career change and take on software development, specifically on graphics and/or games.  

I'm, however, facing a problem: I can't get any job interviews due to my lack of experience. To compensate for that, I'm making a technical blog and portfolio, but I'm unsure of how many projects I should have in it. Currently it has my bachelor's and master's theses, which are a cloth and a fluid simulator in Java, respectively, as well as a 2D game I made with Unity. Right now I'm finishing a second game, this time a 3D one.  

Is it ""safe"" to start applying to job openings with those four projects on my portfolio? I'll be applying to companies around the globe and wouldn't mind working with other types of software. I just need to get started so I can build a career from there. It's worth to notice that, due to the aforementioned unforeseen circumstances, I'm in a slight hurry and want to find a job ASAP, but also don't want to send a CV with a poor portfolio that could backfire and end up closing some doors for me in the future.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

50enbk,2,2016-08-30,Is a minor important to employers or grad programs?,keepitsalty,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50enbk/is_a_minor_important_to_employers_or_grad_programs/,"Hello, 

I asked a question here the other day regarding going to grad school.

I'm a Financial Economics major with a Computer Science minor and have taken quite a few Statistics elective courses. 

I pretty much made up my mind after the advice you guys gave that I needed to focus on getting a few key math courses in order to be prepared for a PhD program.

I think due to some other advice I might pursue industry first and then pursue a MS or PhD down the line. 

I think that would mean that I need to shelf my Computer Science minor in favor of the extra math credits. 

I have taken quite a few CS courses already and also have had 2 internships that required me to use a lot of R and Python. So I do have some programming experience to maybe solidify my knowledge of CS. 

Does a minor mean anything to employers or grad programs or can they just see my relevant coursework on my resume or transcript?

Say I was applying to an analyst position at Goldman Sachs. Would a legitimate Financial Economics major with Computer Science minor look better than Financial Economics major; relevant coursework: linear algebra, calc ll &amp; lll, discrete math, data structures, algorithms, machine learning, bayesian statistics, etc.?"

I'm 21. I worked mall fashion retail for four months. I wrote MATLAB software for six months at a university RND lab. I've got a handle on C++ and C, and I've got exposure to Python, Java, SQL, shell scripting, Git, and a few IDEs. 

I've spent four very difficult years working on a Computer Engineering major and an Economics minor, and I’ve still got an estimated graduation date of summer 2019. As my school's academic calendar regulates, I'm currently looking for a six-month full-time internship. This internship will probably be paid, and would start mid-late September and end sometime March.

I'm not sure if I should come back to school in March. I’m afraid school may be a waste of energy, time, and money for someone like me. I’m omitting a lot to save space; I can elaborate if asked.

I want to stay in my current city, not relocate or go live at home with my parents, but I don't think the Philadelphia job market is as friendly to programmer-wannabe college-dropouts as some places are.

**My options:**

Work at a paid internship for six months according to the plan (I should not bet on the employer immediately offering me a full-time job). After this, leave school. Probably get a part-time. Self-study for an indefinite amount of time, maybe six months. Are CS/SE Associate's worth anything? I could maybe get one of those. And work on personal projects:

* get involved in some open-source projects
* try modding PC games
* make that calendar/planner/to-do list I've always dreamt of using
* might as well learn CSS and make myself a website

When I’ve got a nicer resume and I’m feeling confident, I’ll try my damn best to get a full-time programming job. I understand that to keep myself busy and end up with a good salary, over time I’ll job-hop, etc.

Or I could keep trying to do what I've tried to do for the past four years, for *three* more years. Get an internship, and then go back to class and tell myself I'll work harder. Try new doctor/drug combinations for my diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADHD. See what happens.
	Come out with a “nicer” resume and find a 9-5, like usual, etc.

**I'd appreciate reactions and advice. I expect the wise users here to tell me to stay in school, and I do invite such advice. Additionally, I'd love advice from those in the biz that have also faced psychological/neurological problems.**"

I was born and raised in Texas and moved all the way across the country for these people. And it was Hell from the first day onward. 

Long story short, I got close to a co-worker of mine (located in TX) and he helped me through a lot of the ins-and-outs of my job when I first started because my training was subpar at best. I was 6+ hours away from my bosses and any peers, so it was a hectic situation for 22-year-old me. 

Said co-worker gets promoted to be my supervisor and we were such good friends, we had trouble dealing with the new roles we were given. I didn't like how managed me, he didn't like how I was trying to be managed. So the whole thing kinda fell apart until I knew I needed to get out before my GM (who I didn't report to) got me fired. Found a new job after only a few months of looking by going to a Quality professionals meeting and left.

Since I left, I've been missing that first company. Not because I don't like my job (I totally love it), but I had a lot of friends, lots of people my age, and my commute was 15 minutes compared to the 45-minute drive I have now.

My job had an opening in our warehouse and I reached out to a buddy of mine to see if he'd be interested, since he'd been wanting to leave since before I started. He said he'd think about it and less than 24 hours later, he texts me and says they made the announcement: the facility is shutting down at the end of October.

I laughed the most mean-spirited laugh at my desk. They had been doing sketchy and stupid things for years and the GM was a total ass without a good bone in his body. It's too bad he isn't out of a job (he runs two facilities), but it feels good to have gotten out before all this.

TL;DR: Quit my last job, but missed it sometimes. They sucked enough that they're closing the facility in October. Much rejoicing."

I am just about the start my fourth and final year of a CS undergraduate degree and have just completed a four month internship. 

The internship was kind of an eye-opener for me as I realized that I am currently not a skilled programmer.. I know almost nothing about best practices, am unfamiliar with most technologies/terms/concepts (even common ones), and anything related to data structures and algorithms flies over my head.

I have coasted through my education so far based on it being quite an easy degree at my school as well as the fact that I do enjoy the creativity/problem solving aspect of programming. Being tasked with solving difficult problems is fun for me, but that can only take me so far. I am willing to learn whatever I need to learn to do my job, but the issue I am facing is that I just don't care to advance my skill or learn new things on my own time. So going into any interviews, I inevitably look technically unimpressive. I have read lots of sample interview questions and know that I have A LOT of work to do to get myself to a place where I could confidently answer them. 

Am I setting myself up to fail in this industry right from the start? Have any of you felt something similar regarding your place in the industry? If so, what happened and where are you now?"

I decided to ask about my major.

I am a student in Applied Mathematics, I will graduate in 3 years, 2 if I take double credits and spend more time on my last year.

Some people say I should focus on web design but I don't really like it. I sometimes make algorithms of concepts we learn in classes, code them in C#, which is the only language I can safely say that I know it.

**My first question is related to my major and what classes should I choose:**

In the next 3 years, I can choose classes like the following, each choice is divided with a ' / ' so I can only choose one of them.

1. Finite Elements Method / Integral Equations / Tensor Calculus (I am not sure if this class has a high chance to be attended, so little students choose it) / Difference Equations

2. Analytical Mechanics / Special Functions / Data Management And File Structures II / Integral Transformations

2. Introduction to Insurance Mathematics / Operating Systems / Computer Design / Fuzzy Logic

3. Numerical Analysis 2 (Numerical Analysis 1 is one of the classes I made algorithms for) / History of Mathematics / Differential Geometry / Perturbation And Asymptotic Methods / Computer Aided Symbolic Calculus

4. Calculus of Variations / Software Engineering / Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations / Introduction to Error Correcting Codes

5. Matrix Analysis / Simulation Techniques / Mechanics II / Time Series Analysis / Internet Programming With ASP.NET

6. Object Oriented Programming / System Analysis and Design / Dynamics / Project Planning and Management / Biomechanics for Mathematical Engineering

7. Mathematical Modelling of The Engineering Problems / Introduction to Game Theory / Theory of Elasticity / Complex Analysis 2 / Programming with C#

9. Inequalities / Mathematical Structure of Communication Theory / Introduction to Data Mining / Computer Vision

10. Introduction to Functional Analysis / Introduction to Cryptography / Visual Programing / Image Processing / Occupational Terminology

11. Web Programming / Fluid Mechanics for Mathematical Engineering / Philosophy of Mathematics / Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations / Computer Ethics

12. Artificial Intelligence / Computer Based Learning Systems / Data communication and Network / Computer Graphics and Multimedia / MS SQL Database

What are the best classes to choose from and which are more important than other choices?

**Second question is:**

During my free time, what should I learn? I want to improve my programming skills but don't know where to start and what to focus on.

I have a personal project right now, making a C# program that solves a linear equation system.

I will also try to find an internship next year with help of professors.

Dear Lead Developer, 

I'm getting in touch to express my interest in internship and junior positions.

I'm a full stack Developer living in Chicago. After 1 year of teaching myself programming fundamentals I enrolled in a prestigious full stack node.js web development bootcamp, Founders and Coders, in the fall of 2015. The emphasis on the course was strong core skills and learning by making. After graduating I worked on paid freelance projects (example work: Unitie) for small businesses for a few months before gaining some contract work for the Apple website. 

I think what sets me apart is that as someone who has made a career change from Education to the Tech field, you’ll find I’m a self starter with real world experience and maturity that isn’t always common in fresh graduates. 

Please find my resume attached, I'm currently looking for opportunities in Chicago and available immediately. I'm looking forward to hearing from you in due course.

Based on my equity level, if we get bought it's not going to be a situation where I can just chill in the Bahamas; I will have to find another job.

Our founder has a lot of great connections in our space who he's introduced me to, I've met our investors, I've met other companies in our space, we've been featured in some decent press, and I think it would be cool to be one of the initial employees for a startup that gets bought out by somebody.

However I don't really know much about job opportunities post college. I was thinking Finance/Consulting (I'm a Business + CS major but I'm more Business oriented), but aren't those kids usually heavily involved in finding Finance/Consulting internships while in undergrad? I'm planning on staying with the startup up through my junior year (maybe find a new internship/job for post junior year summer), but I'm thinking if I do that I'll be behind all the kids who have already been doing Finance/Consulting internships.

How about VC Associate or Product Manager?

Any suggestions on opportunities to take advantage of while working for this startup, or any other jobs for me to check out?

Sorry if my questions are kind of vague but I would appreciate any kind of advice. I like working for the startup but at the same time I see some of my peers interning at JP Morgan in the summer and I'm just hoping this startup pans out (which I think it will) so that I can eventually get a 'real' high paying job after college.
