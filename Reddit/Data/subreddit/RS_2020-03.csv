fbn4vw,530,2020-02-29,What year did CS students stop working normal college kid jobs and start only focusing on tech internships?,QsCScrr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fbn4vw/what_year_did_cs_students_stop_working_normal/,"Just realizing the massive shift I somehow missed. When I was supposed to be in college right after high school my peers were all working at restaurants and retail no matter what degree they were pursuing, including CS. A few may have lucked out and landed help desk summer jobs, but no one was doing the kind of interning that y’all post about here. Fast forward 15-20 years and it’s unheard of (or maybe just evidence of the bias in this sub) for CS students to do anything beyond pursuing the highest tech internships; forget bar tending, lawn service, or menial “mail room” type jobs. 

When did this shift happen?

Do you think it’s good or bad for technologists to have employment experiences outside of tech?"

I need some advice in choosing a political job. 

Sime background: I'm graduating with a BA in Political Science this May, and I'm native to the Chicago Area.

 I've made it past phone interviews with several firms/for several positions mainly located in either Chicago or DC. The positions are for research analyst and field director (for grassroots campaigns) in Illinois or research associate (internship with 80% shot at full time offer) or legislative correspondent for a Congressman in DC. 

I want to finish my education with either an MPP or JD with career goals of policy making/lobbying, PI law, or running for office. I'm not going to attend law school right after graduation, party due to less-than-stellar grades, but also because I'd like to finally earn money and am a little burned out from school atm. So my next level of schooling, I'm hoping, would be part time while working a full time job (I have excellent time management skills).

For each of the positions above, I've made it past the initial screening and a phone interview, with face to face/Skype interviews coming up in the next 2 weeks. So, while I realize this might be too early in the hiring process to think about how location impacts my work experience, I'm a little giddy since I'm the first in my family to graduate college and get a ""real"" job.

So can anyone comment on which job(s) might be best if I want to attend grad school/law school part time, or which positions would offer the best opportunities for future political work?

I can answer questions and add more info in the comments. 

Thanks!"

fbp2wc,0,2020-02-29,How to move out from toxic household to college dorm?[20M],fatt_merri,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fbp2wc/how_to_move_out_from_toxic_household_to_college/,"Hello, everyone. Thanks for tuning in and I hope this explanation is enough for any type of helpful advice!

Firstly, I currently live in a 3 person household. My father [70], and my step-sister [7]. Our budget is very tight because my father receives Workers Compensation, and SSI, which provide the very bare minimum to survive. My father had a physically/verbally abusive relationship with his father(Italians are crazy sometimes). He has always been very impulsive, overreactive, verbally abusive, and has
a history of drug abuse. At his age of 70, he is becoming increasingly senile and aggressive. He is not capable of correctly taking care/raising a child. He had her with a 21 year old who is obviously not around and watched by CPS. It was a mistake and in his eyes he’s going to make things right by taking care of her until the day he dies. Every afternoon/night I come home from class or work, I hear yelling between the two of them. I’ve mentioned many times that he needs to slow down and stop yelling because it will just provoke my step-sister to do it too. There’s no changing it because he either forgets or has a stigma about yelling being effective. Any time he asks me to do something he almost yells/screams up the stairs and I feel bothered by it every time. Because he takes his anger/stress out on me. Essentially, he’s overly aggressive and has mental issues with depression/anxiety etc.

For me, I’m a junior in college going for Public Health(very high employment rate in Buffalo). I work about 20 hours a week just to be able to pay a car payment ($320). My father is the “buyer” of the car and I’m the co-sign. I have cut down my hours recently to 12-15 in order for me to focus on my heavy workload at school. Also with my financial aid situation, I can only make at most $5000 before the aid is taken away. 
I have ADHD and I need more time for things than the usual person. I am not by any means mentally declined, but it does take me a little bit extra time because I get distracted. 
Unfortunately I have not been able to come up with the $ for the car payment this month, I’ve had no time for anything besides studying, normal daily life activities, paying for gas, and trying to have a social life. I have 9am classes every weekday so I cannot be up too late or else I sleep through class. My father presses me about avoiding him every once in a while. I avoid him because he never has anything positive to say and is always critical. Additionally, I try to focus as much as I can on school because that’s what he’s been preaching to me my whole entire life and now it’s “I don’t give a fuck how you get the money” even though has has thousands saved. 

Wrapping it up:
I have a long-time on/off “girlfriend” that lives 1.5 hours away that I visited for the beginning of february &amp; haven’t since. The EZ-pass bill for toll booths racked up $30. I came home from work today and got screamed at because I didn’t tell him and I don’t have the money to pay when I forgot because it was so long ago and I would be broke anyway because of the car payment. He basically said that he’s going to kick me out, but I think I have time before he’s actually serious. But I also NEED to leave this toxic environment for good so I can graduate and make a life for myself. 

This is my predicament. My college is debt-free right now, but I want to get a federal college loan to be able to dorm/have a meal plan. I’m not sure if an ON-campus apartment is smarter because of cheaper groceries. I’m just contemplating: How can I live on campus without any parental support? What will happen come summer time? Internship? I have a very supportive best friend, but that’s about it until a certain extent. Any advice will help &amp; if ask any questions. Thank you so much."

It would be awesome if I could impart some of that kindness and knowledge back to the community and so with that said, ask away!"

What can i do to increase my odds at getting a job when I get out? The military has a program where you can do an unpaid internship for the last 6 months of your service (you have to find the internship). I could also do a coding bootcamp instead of an internship in that 6 month window. How hireable would I be with an internship/bootcamp and no completed degree?
What steps can I take to being ready for an internship? So far I've only taken a few CS classes (c++) and done some Freecodecamp and odin project.

Any advice is appreciated!"

I'm kind of at a loss right now. I appreciate any help.

I graduated last spring with concurrent degrees in compsci and a foreign language humanities. I did pretty well in language, not so hot in compsci. I loved certain aspects of compsci -- I loved when things worked, and I loved designing and bringing a project to fruition. Unfortunately, I wasn't very good at it. I didn't like it much, either, and more chose it because I thought it was the responsible thing to do.

Besides that: a month after I graduated, my father passed away in an accident. It was devastating, and I had to devote a lot of time to taking care of the rest of my family. I'm still not fully recovered, but it's definitely time I get a job. I just don't know for what -- and, in addition, I *can't*.

It's been so long since I graduated, and I feel like I lot a lost of that compsci skill. Plus, I don't think I was all that good at/passionate about it. With the interviews I have been getting, too, the year gap is so suspicious that a lot of employers don't seem to trust me (not just tech jobs -- I've been applying for sales and logistics, too). I've been getting nowhere with interviews -- it's the fact that I'm 23 and have like zero work experience beyond crappy internships that were years ago, now. I have no connections, no references, no experience. I really don't know what to do with myself. I feel really hopeless -- like I missed my chance at life already. I'm... really defeated. 

Plus, this loss has kind of reshaped my view on the world. I'm wondering if I should go back to school, maybe, for something I'm more passionate about? But that sounds like a dangerous hole to go down, too, especially because I'm not sure what job I would be able to get pursuing my interests: linguistics, creative writing, analytical essays... pretty much anything to do with English. I'm considering this as an option, because I paid back my student loans already (had a really great scholarship). I would appreciate any advice on that front, too.

Sorry for just kind of venting. Any advice anyone could spare to help get me out of this rut would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I work at a startup in India as an intern. I am new to Reddit and I think a question like this in StackOverflow would be frowned upon. At the same time, I could not find a course that covers these problems in detail. I am a beginner in machine learning. Although I have taken a few courses in ML, I think I need help with real-world data. My boss told me to create a model for sentiment analysis of reviews.

## Background: 

I have knowledge of NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and SpaCy. I am also familiar with NLP techniques such as Bag of words, TF-IDF and Word2Vec. I also have an idea regarding stemming, lemmatization and POS tagging. I have some time to look into or learn other techniques.

## Problem Statement:

My task is to classify a sentiment as positive or negative, with a certain confidence k. If k &gt;= 0.6, it is positive or if k &lt;= -0.6, it is negative. However, the document containing confidence -0.6 &lt; k &lt; 0.6 (intermediate confidence level) should be sent to a human, who would then label it as positive, negative or neutral. The model should be updated with the new document. I should also deploy this model using the Flask framework in Python.

The data contains 800 reviews, out of which, only 500 are text-based reviews. The dataset is also pretty imbalanced.

## Questions: 

1. Is this a valid machine learning problem?
2. I don't think the training data is sufficient. Should I add more data? If so, from where?
3. There are a lot of reviews that are duplicates. Should I perform data deduplication? (This may bring down the size of the data even further)
4. What should be my approach towards EDA in text data?
5. Should I store the data in a database?
6. Which model should I use? (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural nets or any other model)
7. How do I update the model with the human-labeled document?

I am open to feedback, suggestions, criticism or advice.

Thanks in advance!"

I also hear a lot of people saying after your first job GPA is essentially useless and not looked at again, Is that True?? Also it’s super early to be thinking but I was wondering incase I graduate with a GPA under 3(potentially 2.5-2.9) does that automatically eliminate any chances in the future to work in big companies such as google, Microsoft, amazon etc. Also how would a low gpa affect me in terms of getting in Toronto’s growing economy. Also since I live in Toronto I would prefer to get a job here and settle here and so far the companies I heard good reviews about are IBM, AMD, and Shopify. So was wondering if anyone got any jobs/internships there and would be willing to give advice on what to do going forward for a better chance at locking an internship.

fbtk8g,1,2020-03-01,Aunt Problems,p4nda_ammonium,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fbtk8g/aunt_problems/,"So my mom had a pretty emotionally abusive family. Her parents were firm believers in conditional love and liked to compare her and her 3 sisters all they time in front of them. Because of this they are all pretty messed up in their own way. Thankfully my mom had my dad and his family when growing up and they are super loving. My mom is my absolute best friend. She has always been there for me and we are extremely close. Honestly my parents are my two favourite people in the world. I recently moved across the country meaning that I am now super far away from them and it's been really difficult for me. I was recently diagnosed as bipolar which means I have long stretches of depression (to the point of being suicidal) and random manic episodes were I don't make the best decisions. So this move was really difficult cuz I lost my immediate support system. 
Now enter my aunt. She wasn't really a participant in my life from birth until I was about 18. We would get random cards or Christmas presents but I never really knew her  even though I was her only niece because she lived on the other side of the country and she was involved in her own life and honestly wasn't a huge fan of kids.
One summer she randomly helped me get an internship when I was 18 and I lived with her for somewhere around 4 months. We got pretty close during this time and I realized she never had anyone really care about her and show her what unconditional love and support is. She had her flaws, mainly because of her upbringing, but I was determined to show her how family is supposed to act.
The last four years we have gotten closer and she has made a few changes for the better.
Now I live relatively close to her (about 8 hour drive) and we work for the same company so I see her about once a month. In the last year she has started commenting about how unhealthy she thinks my relationship with my mom is and that I should be more independent.
My mom is planning a trip out to see me in march which I am very excited about. (She was here in January with my dad). I found out that she told my aunt to see if we could get together and my aunt straight up told her to cancel the trip, called her a bad mother and told her that she is stifiling my ability to be a real adult (even though I am completely financially independent, have a job working 50+ hours a week and have been living in my own since I went away to college).
My mom was so upset by this she has been crying and depressed for the few days. She told me not to tell anyone she was coming to visit (especially my colleagues) lest it get back to my aunt.
I am incredibly mad about this but also super conflicted for a few reasons. My aunt doesn't get my relationship with my mom because she never had that growing up. She had absolutely no one in her life to show her genuine caring and she has had to fight for everything she has. So on one side I get it but I am also incredibly defensive of my mother. My mom never wants to cause problems with her family even though they treat her like dirt most of the time. It breaks my heart to watch her try so hard for their approval and always come away hurt. She told me not to say anything to my aunt about it and I honestly don't know what to do.
I know my aunt is looking out for me in her own weird way but I want to let her know that she can't decide when my mom comes to visit me, how often or how close I am with her. And she also has no right to call her a bad mother or comment on her parenting style especially cuz she has never had kids nor been apart of most of my life. I don't want to upset my mom any further and even though I am grateful for everything my aunt has done for me the last few years and do love her, when it comes to my mom there would be no question who I would choose.
I honestly have no idea how to handle this situation so any advice would be helpful.
TLDR: My aunt was mean to my mom about how close we are. Mom doesn't want me to say anything. Idk if I should or not cuz it feels like she overstepped her bounds."

**Job Skills**:

* Mid-level IT/Cybersecurity with expertise in risk management, analysis, networking, forensics, SIEM, and incident response.

I am a freshman CS student. I really want to do gamedev, and currently, I am working part-time for a company making a MOBA in Unity with around 6 people. I have been working here for about 10 months after doing an internship the summer after high school, and it was alright for a while, but now a lot of the tasks have gotten boring and do not really challenge me or teach me much. However, I am still working 10-12 hours a week.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I participated in a game jam. Here is the game I made in four days. I am extremely proud of the work that I made on my own, and it is currently one of the top 10 games out of almost 800 entries. I learned so much from making it, and it was only for four days. 

&amp;#x200B;

This summer, I am lined up to do an internship at a big military contractor (software engineer). I applied for the internship online by myself, and got it. The listing was designated for freshman, which is why a big company was interested in hiring me rather than a junior. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was to maintain part time work at the game company while working full time this summer (which I have done before), but now I am feeling a huge desire to work on my own projects and learn on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is more important, developing skills, or having a year+ of game development experience on a resume? I feel like I would learn a lot more by myself, and I will already have that on my resume in addition to an internship at a big company... my main goal is to get an internship at a big game dev company. I am really lost... can someone with experience please provide me with some input? Thank you so much in advance."

Academic/internship background:
-Big 10 engineering degree with CS minor, 3.1 GPA
-Software QA engineering internship at a large software company
-Software engineering internship at a startup

Current position:
-First job out of college
-Midsize consulting firm 
-Starting TC $86k, promoted at annual review to $92k TC

New offer:
-Software engineer 
-Finance industry (private equity)
-$100k base, 10% annual bonus, 5% 401k match

What I learned during my brief job hunt:
-The highest paying employers in Chicago are either FAANG (obviously), finance (private equity and prop shops), or the big Chicago software companies (Braintree, ActiveCampaign, etc.) 
-Getting a phone interview is way easier once you’ve spent a year in the workforce
-$100k+ jobs with one year of experience are not at all unheard of (in Chicago)
-Unless you’re applying to FAANG or to a particularly intense technical role, interviews really aren’t that bad (spent weeks memorizing algos to only be asked basic easy and medium LCs and one design problem)
-NETWORKING IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF (I landed this interview because an old work buddy is currently employed at the company)

fbx3t0,2,2020-03-01,"Deciding between front-end development job and new engineering manager offer, advice/opinions needed.",SmartTest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fbx3t0/deciding_between_frontend_development_job_and_new/,"Some quick background - I have been in the coding world since I was in 8th grade, got really into it once I was in 12th grade, went to college for 3 years before dropping out since I got a really nice job offer with the experience I already had. The current job is a full stack development position working mainly in React, GraphQL, AWS, Mongo, that sorta stuff.

During college, I worked full-time for a web development company that made regular website, e-commerce websites, and stuff like that. It was great and allowed me to get paid decently to learn web development as I went through school. I moved on once I got an internship where I worked in more web application development using more advanced front-end stuff beyond just basic websites where I learned React, and similar frameworks. I then moved onto the full stack position I have now.

At this point, I feel very comfortable moving into most front-end/full-stack (whatever that means anymore) positions in the JS world. I've been here for about 1.5 years.

The web development company I worked for during college recently contacted me (I'm good friends with the CEO there) and asked me to come back and manage a growing team of developers as they have grown tremendously and continue to do so since I stopped working there. It would probably require a low amount of coding, and a lot of mentoring, management, etc. with a team of developers that I manage.

I love coding, and I am fully aware that I wouldn't be doing that much with this job, but I do have a side company that I started and am growing where I do 100% of the development for so it is not like I would lose my skills at coding completely. That being said, I do learn **a lot** at my current company as the developers on my team are super-smart and we learn from eachother nearly every day. It is a great company with great benefits and stability.

The engineering manager offer would give technically a $20k salary boost, but taking my current salary and stock bonuses and vested stock, I would be netting only a bit under my new potential salary. I am hoping to get a higher pay boost for the new position because of this but I'm not sure they can go much higher.

**So I am torn between my current company where:**

* I practice advanced full-stack web development and learn from my co-workers daily
* Has greater job stability as it is a bigger, more established company
* I have good benefits and job flexibility
* Big, public company with great reputation

**and going back to be engineering manager at my old company where:**

* I would have a ""more important"" job title and position
* Get to manage a team of devs (I want my career to move to management from development eventually, I don't wanna code for the man forever but I also didn't imagine it would happen so soon)
* Be able to work from anywhere, pretty much whenever I am needed and break the 9-5 cycle I am currently on (something I definitely I don't wanna get used to)
* Work with my friends in building a robust company that has already got great momentum
* Small (\~50 person) company 

**In summary**

* I would make a bit more money at my new position (net)
* It would be a less stable, probably more stress at the new position
* I wouldn't be learning as much in terms of becoming a better coder, and would be teaching more since I would be the head of development
* I am not sure if there are any cons I am not considering with moving from a dev position early in my career to a management position, even though I would still be exercising my coding ability and passion on my personal projects.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, but I am really stressing so I wanted to put everything down."

How did you find a field of study/job that makes you happy?,MergatroidSkittle_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fbx4jd/feeling_lost_and_like_im_losing_time_where_do_i/,"Hey everyone! I’m honestly lost and need some opinions/advice/wisdom.

I’ve been going to college and working for the past 5 years and have nothing really to show for it, no certs or degrees. I believe that it is mostly due to me switching my field of study repeatedly. I do this because I feel I just can’t find my niche, my role that satisfies me and pays the bills. I’m getting older and I’m watching all my friends and family getting degrees and finding their dream jobs but then there’s me, just floundering.

My most successful job I’ve held was as a Manager at a fast food restaurant. I loved the job! I thought it was fun, engaging, I developed people, and I got to see the efforts of my labor reflected in the work environment around me. It was so fast paced, I was always busy, and I worked with my hands! My close family however, looked down upon the job due to its poor pay and because it’s fast food, which lead me to resign. It hurt to leave.

I’ve since fallen into an administrative assistant-like role after a brief internship with a small company. I’ve been studying the field at college and getting solid work experience. My family is proud and very excited for me because it’s what they’d consider a “good job” but I just don’t feel happy in it.

I know I like working with my hands, I love restaurant environments, and jobs where I have a clear task with clear expectations.

I don’t know what I’m doing or how to stop floundering. I just feel like I’m getting nowhere and I’m not satisfied with my work. I’m afraid to start digging into another field because what if I hop over there and it’s the same thing all over again, I end up hating it?

I can’t continue on like this because it affects my relationships, starves me financially, and I’m always losing benefits.

Have any of you ever felt like this? And if so, what did you do to control it or at least make it work out for you?

Tl;dr: Don’t know what I want out of a job. Feel lost and unhappy. Things are getting tough and I need to find stability."

These examples are not the worst things that have been said.

I'm a third year at community college, transferring to my 4 year in the upcoming fall semester and took it as a challenge upon myself to find an internship without the help of a big name university! 

I started off with nothing pretty much, my cc only offers 2 cs classes that are necessary for transferring (Class/OOP and DS&amp;A) but I took those in my first year so I hardly remembered anything honestly. So basically, I hardly remembered how to code and I had no projects to show either... And on top of all that my GPA is only a 2.9. So I'm fucked, right?

Well, I think most internship stories here don't talk much about the entire process, but I wanted to give my personal insight on mine!

So now that I've prefaced my story, where do I begin to start?

1. Apply

I just decided to mass apply everywhere and sent about 50 applications before realizing no one was even responding! I got maybe 2 declines? I think my GPA and lack of really anything on my resume was a huge factor. So now that no one will get to me... I know that I need to work on my resume. How did I do this?

2. Projects projects projects

Now I hardly remembered how to code honestly, but I needed some project to showcase. I YouTubed basic portfolio projects, and did a Tic Tac Toe game in python and uploaded one of my old class programs as projects. Afterwards, I tried to apply again.

3. Rejection, once again

I was getting tired at this point, I had no idea why I was getting rejected so much. So I told my friends about it and everyone wanted to see my resume, and it was horrible horrible horrible. So I completely changed the layout of my resume as well as start a new project with my friends.

4. Projects, again, but this time actually projects that show initiative

This time around, me and my buddies wanted to develop a mobile application for my college since we had no app! As soon as I threw that onto my resume as well as built up my LinkedIn more, and created a portfolio website, my response rate grew much higher! However, they were all rejections still.

5. Interviews

So although I mainly had rejections, I had about 5 coding challenges, and 2 companies that wanted to interview me. I completely bombed the coding challenges so never even got a phone interview. The other 2 companies, one was JP Morgan, and the other was a relatively large consulting company. I didn't even want to go through the process with JP Morgan since I have a embezzlement charge on my record that's still in trial currently and I know they wouldn't hire me. So my only option was the consulting company. I did a phone interview, and a case study but never got a final interview.

6. Giving up

So at this point, I literally gave up. I stopped interviewing, I stopped applying, I never even touched leetcode or CTCI. However, all of this didn't leave me with nothing. It left me with a great resume, it left me with a project that I could talk about (the mobile app) and left me to be relatively desirable. But no one was willing to give me a chance. However, I work as a server and just chat with my diners every now and then. One of them asked me if I was in school, and I told him I am and then told him what I'm studying, etc. He later on told me he was the CTO of a startup and I asked if he was looking for interns and this was after I told him about all my projects and experiences and he went ahead and offered me an internship! We had another informal interview later on and the internship offer is still on the table! 

So, although I never got anywhere through applying online, all the experience I gained through the process was the main reason I even got hired! And I guess networking is even more important than I would have ever thought! So if you have career fairs at your school, go to them! If you have hackathons, attend! Just do whatever you can to get your foot in the door!"

I'll be honest, going into a career in this field wasn't something that I had ever planned for myself from the get go, and it wasn’t a passion of mine, I came into college with a messy plan, but I wanted  to pick something that would serve as stable, this be it. 

I've been trucking on along the way learning what I can. I'm a junior now, and I finished an I.T. internship a few months ago. In a few semesters , I'll have to pick a couple areas within the I.T. range. First one may be web development. 

The second one is Database Administration. I have been learning bits and bits about it through googling. Though I wanted to pick the brains of whoever has already gone down this path here. 

The big constant I've been seeing is learning SQL. I will dabble in it one of my current classes  ,""Website Construction and Management"", but seeing as how I am taking it with one of the worst professors in this department for the second time, I have made plans to take a separate online course that will help me learn SQL.

Need advice.,newgradnyc2020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fc3zw5/new_gradfirst_job_out_of_college_struggling_to/,"Planning on graduating this May and have been looking for new grad positions in NYC. I know the market is competitive there but I've sent out a lot of applications since last fall and have received a ton of rejections without even a phone interview. However, I have avoided those that require a cover letter though so i'm not sure if maybe a cover letter would boost my success rates. Am I doing something wrong? I have internships, a decent GPA, and projects on my resume but I'm not getting invited to interviews. 

I've gotten my resume reviewed by others too but they've said that my resume looks good (of course more work can always be done) so maybe I'm not applying to the right positions? Should I be reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn/cold emailing them? I've only applied on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and on some company websites; haven't used indeed or handshake too much (which i should I guess).

My preference is most definitely NYC if possible so any tips are appreciated on how to apply for jobs as a new grad or anything that would make me stand out more. I've set up a couple of job alerts on LinkedIn, Google Jobs and Glassdoor (some search queries are ""software engineering new grad"", ""(""entry level"" OR junior) software (engineer OR developer) -senior"", and ""software engineer"") and have applied to the one's that I see myself qualified in but haven't had too much luck.

fc70b8,1,2020-03-02,Help... car body shop nightmare...,jmry,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fc70b8/help_car_body_shop_nightmare/,"Alabama

&amp;#x200B;

On December 30, 2019, I was driving home from work in evening rush-hour. I had to make a decision between staying in my lane and running over road debris or having a car accident. Needless to say I chose to run over the road debris. I was able to get as far over as possible so that I only ran over a small portion of it. Sadly there was damage to my car. My driver side fender was dented and scratched at the bottom portion and my front bumper had multiple scratches and a gash where the debris cut into it. I contacted my insurance as soon as I inspected the damage and insurance ruled as no fault to me, as this incident was covered under comprehensive.

My insurance provider has a specific collision shop which they have a contract with so intern they want you to use this chain collision shop. after contacting said collision shop and setting up an appointment for them to assess the damage, we set up a timeframe for me to drop the car off the middle of January for the repairs to begin. A few days from the date when I was supposed to drop my car off I was contacted by the collision shop and informed that everyone was out with the flu and my date was pushed back to February 3rd. so I dropped my car off on Monday, February 3, and I was called to come pick it up the following Monday, February 10.

The day of pick up it was raining as it has been the past few days and I requested for the car to be kept in the shop dry so I could look over the repairs that were done. This collision shop calls you to come pick up your vehicle 15 minutes before closing, so there really isn’t enough time to properly inspect your vehicle for any issues. when I pulled up to the shop my car was outside in the rain and when I requested for them to dry it off like I was told it would be dry over the phone, I was met with hostility and a manager who assured me that everything was perfect and that their quality check would’ve caught any issues and they would’ve been resolved before I would be notified that my vehicle would be ready. I did not sign anything since I was not able to look it over myself. I was told that I had 90 days in which if I found any issues just to call them and let them know.

The following day, Tuesday, February 11, I was on my way back home from work when all of my safety sensors on my dash were giving me errors. I have a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta that has multiple safety features including adaptive cruise control and front end assist. when all of these codes showed up the body shop was closed and I had to wait until the following morning to contact them. Upon doing so they wanted my car back so that they could send it to the Volkswagen dealership so the dealership could re-calibrate all of the sensors that are throwing codes. I was told that the guy that they use as an outside hire was not available when my car was in the shop and that even if he was he did not have the software needed to re-calibrate the sensors on my vehicle. when I asked the manager at this collision shop why I wasn’t made aware of this possibility of my car throwing codes, he simply stated that as soon as they finish their work and reassembled the front bumper assembly that they checked my vehicle and it showed no codes at the time and so they assumed everything was fine. I told him that I contacted Volkswagen directly to inquire about this situation and they informed me that no matter what, if the front or rear bumper containing these sensors are tampered with the entire system has to be recalibrated. his response was now they know. So the collision shop transported my vehicle to the Volkswagen dealership to have the sensors recalibrated, with every expense billed directly to them. Thursday late afternoon, February 13, I headed to Volkswagen to pick up my car.

Through this entire process it had been nonstop raining. Saturday and Sunday, February 15th and 16th, it finally stopped raining and the sun came out. Since the vehicle had finally dried off, it brought light on so many mistakes. The entire front assembly on the car was incorrectly put on (per the statement of the manager at the Collision center — body shop for The Volkswagen dealership). Parts of the grill are not even clipped into the frame. The alignment of the grill is off. There are scratches on the left headlight as well as moisture in the left headlight as if they damaged a seal. I have paint dripage down the side of the doors, overspray everywhere on the left side of the vehicle, and scratches in multiple places on the vehicle. The cover on the driver door that covers the key insert was broken and then attempted to be fixed with super glue or something. The top part of the driver door is bent inward causing the exposed exterior seal not to line up correctly with the driver side back door. The panel on the driver door is pushed down exposing the inside of the door frame. Trim pieces that were poorly removed and poorly put back on the vehicle (Manager at the original collision center recommended by my insurance — after bringing it to his attention — acknowledged that a new part should have been ordered). Double-sided sticky tape sticking out from the trim pieces. The seal on the driver side door completely coming off with scratches all up the door as if they struggled terribly getting the previous adhesive off before installing a new seal. The manager from the collision center that was recommended by insurance went as far as to blame the seal not sticking on Volkswagen parts not coming with strong enough double-sided tape (He wouldn’t entertain the idea that his guys didn’t properly clean the old adhesive that remained before installing the new seal).

The car looks as though it was not taken care of at all. When the car was picked up originally on Monday February 10th, it was absolutely filthy. There was white powder dust all in the interior and in every nook and cranny on the car from where The original collision center buffed (blended) the exterior of the car. It was as if they just let all of the sanded particles right into the car. I assumed and expected that they would clean up the mess they made.

My vehicle is now at the collision center body shop that my Volkswagen dealership uses. All of the damages have been assessed and are on schedule to be repaired correctly. Throughout this entire process insurance has been understanding and cooperative through the carelessness of the collision center body shop they recommended. Initially they wanted me to return my car to the same body shop that inflicted all of the new damage. I explained to insurance that even if I did allow them to rectify what they did, in order to properly repair the vehicle the entire front assembly would have to be removed again which would only lead to the vehicle having to be taken back to Volkswagen for the sensors to be recalibrated. Insurance is covering all of the new expenses to have it properly repaired.

When all of this is said and done I will have been without my car for more than two months, roughly 10 weeks.

My question is would I have any standing to pursue legal action against the original body shop who caused so much damage to my vehicle?"
fc7gny,10,2020-03-02,2:47 A.M.,Another_pen,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fc7gny/247_am/,"I was in a familiar foggy forest. I had no clue where it was, but the woods were familiar. I walked around them as I realized that I knew them. Of course it was hard to tell, all the trees and terrain looked oddly similar. I wandered for some time, trying to recall anything. My mind was as foggy as the forest. As I walked the forest got stranger, strange calls came from the distance. A clock hung from every tree. All of them were dead, all the clocks had stopped. But when I looked at them I couldn't see what time they had stopped at. I heard a siren, and as I wondered what the hell was happening the fog was gone, as screams and flame scoured the earth.

I woke up, sweaty and clammy as always. For the last three months, without break I had the same dream. I always woke up at the same time as well. Always 2:47 A.M. without fail. I contemplated going back to sleep, but decided against it. I had a fuckton of homework to do, and I needed to clean my flat. I yawned, wondered why I hated myself and set about my self assigned tasks.At 7, I got in the shower and got myself ready for the day. I had to be at an interview at ten, but preparedness was a virtue. I picked out a fine suit and got in my car. My career as an investigative journalist hung on that interview. At 8 I got some coffee from my favorite breakfast joint. I saw a scruffy looking man with a cup sleeping out front of it as I was leaving. I put a twenty in his cup and was walking away as he awoke with a snort and said '2:47' I didn't make any correlation at the time. at 9:01 sharp I got to the head office of The New York times. I chatted with my fellow colleagues, out of the three interns who wanted my position everyone agreed it was gonna be me to get in. Not to be arrogant, but I felt like I deserved it. I was the hardest working, the most driven and always the first one there. I would make a damn fine investigative journalist. So I thought at least, it wasn't a very long discussion.

I had spent three fucking years working for nothing, so naturally I went out and got drunk. It took four different bars before I noticed the same beat up car following me. Maybe it was just that I was drunk. I park at the next bar at 2. I waited around. The beat up red ford rounded a corner. So I was just being drunk and paranoid. I felt stupid for thinking I was being followed, and decided the solution was more drink. I went into the bar, thankful that it was low down enough to serve a fucking drink, instead of some weak pisswater. I was into my fourth cup of whiskey on the rocks when I saw the homeless man from earlier drinking. I walked over to him and we made small talk. He was grateful for the charity that allotted him the drinks, I was just drinking to get drunk. After a while he looked down at his watch and said 'Well boy, it's been nice talking to you. But its time now, best of luck to you stranger.' With that he left through the front door. I looked down at my watch and saw that it was 2:45. Then I remembered what the hobo had said in his sleep. As I stumbled outside, I heard rumbling. At first I thought it was a building falling. But then I got an emergency alert on my phone. Missiles were headed straight for New York.

I ran inside at 2:47 P.M. The missiles haven't stopped falling. It's like rain, and it's only by luck that the bar hasn't been hit yet. It took a while before I remembered my dream. At 2:47, the time I woke up after a dream of death and fire, missiles hit the city I lived in. As I looked through the internet on my data, praying my phone doesn't die because the power is out I came to a worse conclusion. Something worse is going to happen at 2:47 A.M. It's 5 P.M. now, and the missiles and bombs haven't stopped. There is no escape."

This past week (Wednesday), I submitted my PRVI for an EY internship within their Risk Advisory Practice.

I understand this may make or break moving through the next round of interviews. Regardless how much networking I have done or how qualified I am.

I could have sworn and have accepted the *fact* that I completely bottled it to put it frank. 

The deadline was this past Thursday but due to exams I decided to submit mine a day earlier. 

On Friday, I was contacted by a Manager to come out with their team for lunch alongside a peer who also applied to the same position. 

Is there any chance the manager has been notified that I took my first interview and did well enough for further networking as they added that this could be an opportunity to get to know each other better &amp; see the rest of the team. 

Or they might be out of the loop and reached out before knowing how well I did in the first round interviews? 

Because they did mention that they could answer any questions pertaining to the “upcoming interviews” but didn’t clarify if it were for first round or second. 

Thanks for the help all!"

###FAQ

**Blanket statement** 

It goes without saying, this is uncharted territory for the vast majority of consulting firms.  With things changing day to day, the short answer is no one knows for sure what will happen.

**What will happen to consulting?**

With the economic slowdown, our clients' businesses are impacted and so our business is impacted.  While some industries may be doing relatively better than others, they will not be able to make up for industries that have been devastated, such as travel and leisure.  

The big open questions are whether or not we enter a recession and how long it will last.  Multiple different organizations, including consulting firms like [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/covid-19-implications-for-business), [Bain](https://www.bain.com/insights/tracking-the-global-impact-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-snap-chart/), and [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2020/March/COVID-19-Primer.pdf) have put out scenarios that posit recovery being anywhere from a quarter to over a year away.  That's a lot of uncertainty.

**What will happen to my job / offer?** 

Most likely you will hear from your firm about any impact on your job / offer before you read about it here.  Some firms have already begun communicating their intentions. 

Longer term, we can try to speculate based on what we've seen in the past.  In my opinion, the closest worst-case analog (from a business perspective) we can compare to is the Great Depression of 2008.  [See here for some perspectives on what happened to consulting jobs during that time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/fmpapf/covid19_impact_on_consulting/?)

**Should I reach out to HR / recruiting?**

For many firms, there is much still undecided.  Some because firms are still waiting for more information and some because they don't need to make a decision right this instant.  Furthermore, much leadership effort is currently focused on ensuring the safety of current staff and managing the business.

When more decisions are made and provided to HR / recruiting, they will communicate broadly.  There's little appetite for responding to every email like whack-a-mole.

fcd7kf,5,2020-03-02,Best courses for my goals?,lostaero,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/fcd7kf/best_courses_for_my_goals/,"**Quick background:** I am five years out of undergrad (aerospace engineering) and I work at NASA. I love the idea of working at NASA but so far it has not been what I had always hoped. My current title is ""Systems Engineer"" (not IT systems, aerospace systems) and I do not do anything that would fall under this title. I have been at this job a year. My career plan was to become an experienced systems engineer but so far that is not happening nor do I see it happening at this job any time soon. What I am doing does not match at all what the job description was. I have asked for more of what I want but it tends to go ignored. 

**What I actually do:** I am in more of a digital transformation role. I work to transform engineering processes to more modern techniques. For example, get a group to use databases vs use large excel documents. Establishing a computing cluster in AWS for engineering analysis. Things like that. I don't mind the work other than the fact that it threw a wrench in my career plans. At this point I feel it is too late to go back and start a different career here. I do not see any upward movement at this current job and in fact I do not see it being around for more than the next two years. I have a ton of free time and get bored. I have gotten some AWS and python experience from this position. 

**School background:** I am two courses into OMSCS. I have taken ML4T and currently in AI4R. I am taking a blend of graduate and undergraduate courses in order to prepare me for the more difficult courses in the program such as ML and GA. So far so good, I have a 4.0. I am on track to graduate in 2022. I am taking it easy with no more than one graduate course and one undergraduate course a semester. I know python pretty well and learned some Java last semester. Currently learning databases. I also know MATLAB. 

**Goals:**

* **Move to better location -** The thing is I hate where I live. There are not many other aerospace engineering roles in Texas and me and my family do not want to move states. We would be much happier in Austin or San Antonio. 
* **Money -** Probably an obvious goal but my wife has a very stressful job that can have long hours. She makes more than I do and I really want her to be able to get a job with less stress and less hours so that she can spend more time with my son. 
* **Career -** I feel like I am not building a career where I am currently. I feel like it is just a job. I want to get a job that I can build on.
* **Fulfilling Tasks -** I don't feel like what I do is really accomplishing anything. This is why I like the idea of software development. You work together with a team towards a finished project. 

**Possible Career Paths:**

* **Software Engineer at Aerospace Companies -** Probably my safest bet. I think going the ML/CV combo specialization route would be fine for this and this would be an easier transition. I could become a software engineer at Lockheed or Boeing. However my location goal is still limited. Would not require much additional effort, would likely need to learn C/C++. What courses would be best for this? I could start applying for these positions now and get experience. Could also use this experience to leap to big tech companies or startups I think. Thoughts? 
* **Software Engineer at Commercial Companies** \- I really like the idea of just a complete career change. Going to work at a FAANG, startup, or other tech company in Austin. What courses would prepare me for this? Is ML/CV a good starting point or would a computing systems specialization be better? I am also interested in graduate certificates or an additional masters. I know interviews can be tough. I plan on taking data structures, discrete math, undergrad algorithms, and computer systems courses along side my masters which I would hope could help me prepare for tough interviews. I plan to work on side projects and put together a portfolio. I am also working on AWS certifications currently. What technologies/languages should I spend the next 2-3 years working on if I want to go this route? I am even willing to get an internship or work at a risky startup once my degree is complete, even for a pay-cut. Is this at all feasible?
* **Data Scientist** \- I like the idea of being a data scientist. I took a data science bootcamp last year to get a taste of what it is like and enjoyed it. I think this would be a natural transition to me and I would enjoy it because it has a scientific analysis aspect that I like. I assume ML would be the best track as well as taking BD4H and DVA. I would probably get a graduate certificate from Harvard extension or Indiana university as well. My says what I do now is ""data science/data engineering"" so I could also put this as my title on my current resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is welcome. I am in no rush to achieve my goals and think I can do so within the next three years. Any coding bootcamps, graduate certificates, tech certifications, additional masters degrees, personal projects...I will do what it takes. Thanks for listening."

Hello, 

I am looking for guidance on how to tackle a project.

I explain the topic first and then where I am currently.

I apologize for the long explanation.

\---------------------------

I am currently doing an internship and I wanted to write a program to help me automatize one of my tasks and I thought you guys could maybe help me figure out a way to do this. Basically, every week I receive reports from another company that helps the firm I'm working for looking for prospect clients. The reports include a list of companies, divided by country, with a short summary about each one of them saying whether they are interested in certain products. My current task is to go through each report and find the companies that could be interested in our firm/ products and write them in an excel file with the following format:

Date | Country | Name | Interest | Text (Body)

Each field is a column in excel.

What I would like to do would be to write a program that loads the file into python from a folder containing the files in question, scans through the document looking for certain keywords. 

If it finds the keyword, it should then return the above information for the respective company in which text the key word was found. 

An example of this could be: 

Key Word = ‘banana’, ‘kiwis’

Text:

Date 02/28/2020

United States:

*Company X is looking to buy apples.*

*Company Y would like to buy bananas in large quantity over the next quarter.*

Germany:

Company VX is interested in acquiring kiwis; its budget is 100 euros.

Company CT is not interested in acquiring fruits at the moment. 

The program should find Company Y and VX as interested and add those companies in an excel (csv) file with the format described above.

Note: potentially I would like to be able to do this automatically for all the documents in the folder and in a simple way, so that even when I’ll be gone; the next intern could just do the entire process

By simply pressing a button.  

\---------------------------

So far I’ve been figuring out how to extract the text from the pdf using PyPDF2 and I’m currently reading as much as I can on Natural Language processing and Parsing to gain more knowledge but any recommendations would be highly appreciated. Thank you very much!

Originally I’d planned on trying to either become an academic scholar of religion or try to assist with nonprofits and government positions working with apocalyptic/militarist NRMs— but now that I’m the breadwinner of the family while my partner works towards getting their eventual PhD in psychology, I’m shifting paths because I won’t be able to travel or work towards further schooling until my partner’s career takes off (which probably won’t be for another 5+ years), which would be necessary for the positions I originally desired. 

I love Computer Science to my core and originally had planned on double-majoring in it (and the only reason I didn’t is because of an unfortunate incident where the computer science department hired a nightmarish temporary professor who failed almost everyone, myself included, out of the Introduction level courses and set us all back several semesters), so that’s why I’m trying to shifts gears towards it now. The problem is, I’m only really adept at the software and programming side of things— I only know Java, CSS, Swift and some of GSI and R in terms of desirable coding and specific program knowledge— and I have exactly zero experience in any internships or previous jobs that were related to the field. 

I’ve been told it’s not impossible to get a job in the computer science field with only a minor as long as I’m passionate and willing to put in the effort, but I have no idea how I’d even go about this. I don’t know where to look for job listings that fit the bill, much less what else I can do surrounding computer science in my spare time to put on my resume to prove my potential to potential employers, even with only just a minor in the subject. I’m utterly lost."

So essentially, my mental health has been seriously deteriorating over the past few months since the break-up and it seems impossible for my mind to move on. This has resulted in problems in my personal, work and sexual life. I have tried all widely available resources to deal with a break-up, but my issues seem to be more complicated than the most common issues described online.

**Most important details:**

**My age:** 21  
**Gender:** Male  
**Time of break-up:** May 2019 (9.5 months ago)  
**Reason for the breakup:** No longer wanting to feel like an accessory that can be shoved aside whenever convenient and no longer be the driving force of the relationship 100% of the time.  
**Goal:** I do not want to get back together with her, I am much happier without her, I just need to get her out of my head, mind and heart in order to keep moving in life.  


**Long version: (10 min read)**  
 Our relationship started as a long-distance relationship at the start of 2018 and it was working out rather well as we progressed through the so-called ""honeymoon phase"". I loved her very much and she loved me very much. She had come out of an abusive relationship a few months earlier and so I was ready to take things slowly to ensure that she would feel comfortable with the relationship.  
Throughout the 9 months that followed, there were mostly happy memories with the relationship building quite well, however, there were also moments of sadness and upset as she would; 

* Forget anniversaries (I was pretentious enough to celebrate, 1, 3 and 6 months of being together).
* Leave me hanging when we agreed to hang-out.
* Not be interested in anything I had to say.
* Not showing any interest when I would call her.

In September 2018, things started going downhill as I was feeling more and more alone, even though I was with her/in a long-distance call with her, nearly 24/7. I decided that I should break up with her even though I still loved her very much. Whilst attempting to do so, I felt so horrible and disgusted with myself that I started to believe that maybe we could still fix this relationship, so after many tears and her begging me not to break up with her, I decided to give it another go.

Fast forward another 4 months into the festive season. She started blanking me, 3 days straight right after Christmas, she broke her promise that she wouldn't get drunk and she didn't bother to call me during new years eve, even though we said we would (More explanation in the long version).

This was again, enough reason for me to break up with her. She was due to come over in the first week of 2019 and so I decided to break up with her afterwards. I never did because when she came over, she was a completely different person. Sweet, loving, caring, thoughtful, etc. Everything I was longing for, so I decided that I shouldn't break up with her.

After she returned back home, everything went well for around 3 months when she came over again for a full week. Things were good, however, she wasn't the same person as she was in January 2019, which confused me a lot. We put the week to a good close and everything seemed fine.

The weeks that followed were the most upsetting. She would blank me again constantly, but me being kind of numbed to this behaviour, I would just accept and move on, all the while getting more and more tired out of constantly having to put the effort into the relationship. She blanked me again for 3 days straight and so I decided to break up with her (Final time). I still loved her very much and during the breaking up process, I felt horrible, like I was genuinely the worst person in the world for putting her through the pain of this breakup (as she became hysterical for not wanting me to leave). Even whilst writing this, I feel so super guilty for putting her through that breakup.

After the breakup, I felt free, like I could be myself again. Other stuff happened in my life that I needed to urgently take care of, so for 2 months, I didn't talk about the breakup and pretended I was fine. After those 2 months, I held that facade up for another 4 months. In those 4 months, my best friend decided that his newfound friendship with my ex was more important than our friendship and so I felt betrayed.

I broke at the start of November 2019 and since then I have been talking to my family about what happened, which has helped a little bit, however, my ex is still on my mind on a daily basis, with small triggers and thoughts activating any memory that might be tied to the said trigger. Most of these memories tend to be of a sexual nature, thinking back to the great times we had (she was my first) and I seem to be unable to move on from that and from the relationship as a whole.

Life is going great now as I am finishing a successful internship in the games industry, graduating from university with an excellent grade and having a lot of jobs to pick from. But I do not feel great. I feel upset, frustrated and numb. Please help, how do I move on, how do I forget, how do I repair myself?

**Note:** I have left out a lot of detailed events that would add extra information, however, this post would turn into a 30-minute read, and I do not want to straight-up demand so much attention of anyone's time. However, if anyone does have questions and requires more detail, please feel free to ask in the comments below, I will answer every question."

I interviewed with a really nice company who I was ecstatic even invited me in. However, during the interview it became known to them that I was only on my first coop experience and not my second one, besides that I would say that the interview went great. Today I got a call from the lead recruiter that they were going to wait until the end of the week to get back to me as they have several other on site interviews of people who were on their second coop, not really a hopeful sign. 

Is there any steps I can take in the meantime? The only reason I was invited in it seems is because they thought my previous work experience was a coop (I was at a company for internships over two summers). I aced the technical interview (he said that I finished faster than any of the other candidates they had seen) and felt really good across the five interviews I did with each team lead.

Should I send a followup email? If I should, what should I include in it?

In short I interviewed for a full time Software Engineer 1 position there and was given a verbal offer for an internship instead with a high chance of turning it into a full time position. I accepted the offer  two days after and  they told me my written offer should be sent my way in the next couple weeks. I waited almost a month and a half until I recently got an email saying that the reason why i didn't get it was because I expressed hesitancy when offered the internship while the other candidates who were also offered the internship accepted the same day, they also told me I did really well at the interviews and if I am still interested there is another opportunity but it will be in a few months from now.

I replied back clarifying that the reason why it took me a couple days was because I wanted to talk this over with my fiancee and family before giving a definite answer and that I'm still very interested in working for them. They replied saying that they can provide me with an opportunity in the summer and will call me tomorrow to talk more.

This whole situation has been very frustrating but because I really want to stay in town with my partner I really want to work for this company and I also really like the product they are working on. 

Does anyone have any suggestions before my call with the Dev Manager on how to land this position without getting stranded again? How do I know if what they are telling me is bs? Any advice is appreciated! Thanks in advance"

I’m a 1st gen college student and I completely support myself working 2 jobs. I assumed it would take them a while to decide who they wanted as interns and I was so nervous in the interview (my first REAL interview) that I didn’t mention I’ve been applying to programs to improve my research and coding skills in different states with different universities this summer. These programs pay you and give you training on topics in my major, along with community service and research positions. 

Well, I got offered the internship position this summer! I’m very excited and if I’m around I want to work for them, however I’m not sure what to say as I haven’t heard back from these training programs if I’ve gotten in yet. I was supposed to hear back today if I got into the first round of interviews, but I haven’t. I’m not sure what to say to the company I want to intern for? I worry about telling them yes and then get offered to do a paid training program in another state. Of course, even if I get into these programs I will have to figure out if I would rather travel (all expenses paid by the program) or do the internship, but I am weighing the pros and cons right now. 

TLDR; got offered an internship with a company I love, but unsure if I will be out of state in a training program, what do I tell the company?"

Anyways, after doing some personal projects in Java over the winter, I decided to apply to a bunch of software developing internships for summer 2020. I lost count of how many I applied to, but it was a lot. 

My main question comes in here: I applied to an internship Jan 1st, and got an interview oppurtunity Jan 24th. The interview I think went pretty well. I dressed up nice, made a good personal impression, tripped up on one OOP question but was able to answer the other ones and get the main algorithm/most of the code down for the coding question. I reviewed my current resume and explained where I'm at in college to the interviewer. I thought it went well. At the interview he told me it would take abour 3-4 for a response. So I waited 4 weeks and sent a follow up email basically checking on the status and stating how I'm looking forward to hearing if I got selected or not (the interns are in a group of 5 at this place and work together, so it's not just 1 intern being selected). He answered the follow up email right away and said they were still interviewing candidates and he would get back to us soon. It has now been 6 weeks since the interview. Any advice on what to do next? I'm not counting myself out of this job but I'd be really disappointed if I don't get it. It is not a big company at all either."

I was initially a biology major at a university where they do not allow you to change your major to CS so Im continuing my cs education at a cc.

Because of my initial coursework being in Biology, I feel like Im behind where most other sophomores would be, so Im not sure what the required coursework is to have the base knowledge that could make me useful at an internship.

Calc 1:  C

Calc 2:  A

C++ I:  B+

C++2:  A

Discrete Math

Intro Data Structures and Algorithms

Here is the second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.

All the best,

I'm a 23 year old dude from Australia. For the past few months I've been struggling with career indecision. The one constant in my life has been music, I've written and recorded my own songs since I was 11 years old and I seem to have new song ideas almost everyday. I'm not in a position where music is paying the bills so I'm sort of floundering around deciding what the next best course of action is. 

Bit of background...  

To support my music habit I worked as a chef from age 19-22. The hours and conditions I worked in were honestly fucking appalling and in the end that career was actively bad for me and left me with little to no time or motivation to even create music or sleep for that matter. I took a month out after quitting my last full time chefing gig to get clear on what I wanted. I'd always been complimented on my writing and analytical skills and started looking into Copywriting. Lo and behold by some miracle I landed a content marketing internship focused on Copywriting with no degree or previous experience and after 3 months, the internship evolved into a fully fledged Copywriting job. 

&amp;#x200B;

The copywriting job is only a casual position though (3 days per week) at $26aud per hour it leaves me with just under $600pw after tax. When rent, bills and food are taken out, my wage is basically gone. I have looked around for some full time positions but honestly, looking at multiple job descriptions none of them really sound like things I would enjoy or even be able to feign an interest in doing. The nature of Copywriting, graphic design and creative office work seems really unstable from what I've gathered (at least in my country) if you're not particularly keen on 'schmoozing' or people pleasing, you're kind of screwed on where your next gig is gonna come from as most jobs I see posted are 6-12 month contract based, most with really shit pay and long commutes.  I'm naturally introverted which in an office environment is fine but not ideal, I like people, I just don't particularly care what they did on the weekend (unless we're close) or to see new baby pictures. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what to do,  having tried it now, the nature of office work + staring at a screen all day doesn't seem like a good fit which is weird to me because after working in hot and dirty kitchens for 4 years I thought a clean modern office environment would be exactly what I needed but it just doesn't 'feel' right. I don't think I've found 'it'. I actually think in spite of the conditions I was arguably happier as a chef purely because I was always busy and the co-workers I did get along with I'm still close with even to this day.  I've done a bunch of careers tests + 100's of hours of research over the past few months that honestly has only resulted in making me more miserable and afraid that I don't have a place in the work force where I can feel secure, situated and happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there's something better out there I could be happier doing that isn't Copywriting/office related, however it seems so stupid to throw away such a good opportunity (is it a good opportunity if it's barely making a living?). I just don't feel like I'm growing or advancing and that I'm missing out on a job or career that could be a much better fit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking into Horticulture courses as when my spare time isn't being spent on music, I'm outdoors, hiking trails and free climbing. Although the hourly rate is $1 less on average (gasp!) it seems like really secure work where you get to be hands on and outside which is really appealing to me. I think earning just over $800 a week for a 35 hour work week and making music on the side isn't such a bad deal. That's basically what I'm trying to find, a job that pays the bills that isn't actively bad for me or makes me depressed or anxious. I even theorise that if I do need to scratch my writing itch I could just start a blog or even finish one of the several half finished short story ideas I've got banked up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm bad at making these decisions, I always tend to fuck it up and I'm getting older and just want to feel like I've got my feet on the ground for once. I am entirely at a loss of what to do next and analysing it is only making me more anxious and depressed about it. This originally was meant to be concise and not a vent post but it turned into one and even if no one replies with advice I truely appreciate it if you even took the time to read one sentence of this, it does just feel good to get it all out.  


Thank you :)"

Or is it a more competitive time of year than it was 4 months ago?

I got hired as an intern at a start-up about a month after finishing a year long coding camp. It didn't go so hot. 3 hour round trip drive, did not fit in with the company culture, and 11-12 hours days because start-up. Two months in, I got the pink slip. Explanation was a combo of ""we don't have the funding"" and ""The team you were working with has to redo some portion of your code - you need more practice"". At least they took the open position down from their site. Admittedly my performance did me in, but I have a strong feeling the culture issue played just as big a part.

I'm currently a freshman pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.  I'm moving along in the pre-req chain and taking Circuits 1 &amp; Programming in the C language, though I'm wondering what I should be doing this summer.

I still want to be with my family, so I'm going to be in my home city over the summer.  Consequently, that narrows my options for jobs since my home city isn't the biggest for embedded systems development or computer architecture.  I was also planning on taking Physics 2 at home while I'm at it to, at the very least, earn some class credit.

I applied to an REU at a university nearby and I have a connection who's passing my resume around to some of his connections.  If neither of those succeed then I'm planning to apply to work in another undergrad research lab at the same university as the REU, but this one would be unpaid.  If none of that works, though, then I don't really know what I would besides just take the class, work a part/full time job, and try to do some personal projects and electrical projects for an engineering club.

I feel like I should be doing more since it seems like my friends mostly have solid plans because of their previous internships / connections from high school.  What should I be looking to do this summer?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

In high school I was known for sporting a myriad of different colors in my hair, but it was a smaller high school and most, if not all, of my teachers knew of my academic abilities before they saw that my hair was the color of cotton-candy and I know that I'm not afforded that privilege in college. First impressions, particularly looks, matter quite a bit and I already know that I'm being judged just for existing in general sans-surprising locks and I suppose I'm very scared of my peers underestimating me straight from the get go because of my hair. My grades aren't too shabby, and I like to think that I sound at least moderately competent when I talk to others, but I know there are a lot of stereotypes associated with dyed hair that I'll have to face regardless of how well I can explain a concept. I'd just like to know the degree to which that would extend. 

What I'm wondering boils down to two questions:

1. Has anyone else dyed their hair an unusual color in engineering school, though not necessarily the workforce, and what have your experiences been with it?

2. How badly would my chances of getting an internship be affected by dyed hair, with me already knowing that bright hair likely will not improve my chances?

Thank y'all in advance!"

Compared to other interns, I'm not the best, but I'm not the worst. I'm average. This was his opinion (which I asked for) during a review session.

For background, I'm an MIS student. I'm probably a better programmer than 90% of other MIS students, and my minor is in Computer Science. With that said, what my boss said is 100% true, this doesn't come natural to me, it takes me longer to work through a problem than say, a CS or a CE student. I don't have quite the exposure they've had, as the most advanced programming class I've taken is Data Structures &amp; Algorithms. But I enjoy what I do, and I always work through any problem to the best of my ability. I'm familiar with quite a few frameworks and languages, I've done front-end, back-end, and full stack. I've got a couple app dev internships under my belt, with cumulatively a year's worth of experience on top of my degree.

With that said, based on this assessment, how likely am I to succeed in a full time position as a junior app developer? Getting close to graduation and worrying about competing with ""superstars"" who could probably kick my butt in a technical interview."

I’ll be a Junior in college next year, and I need help deciding on my school and major.

Freshman year of college I attended UIUC and ended up loving Computer Science, but it was highly unlikely I could transfer into the program.

Sophomore year I transferred to UIC to pursue Computer Science, and I wanted to be near my family after developing mental and physical health issues.

Coming into Junior year, I’m mentally in a much better place, and I miss the more social environment I had at UIUC.  I’d be able to major in Statistics and easily complete a CS Minor.  I’ve planned out my graduation for both colleges, and I’d graduate in 3 more semesters from either.

This summer I’ll possibly be a Software Engineer Intern.  I have a 3.53 GPA.

Is there any light that could be shed on my future prospects as a Software Engineer if I decide to pursue Statistics at UIUC?  Does gaining an internship make me competitive for a career in Software Engineering even if I major in Statistics?

I’m a big self studier and have been practicing LeetCode and ProjectEuler (mostly for fun because I like math) for a few weeks now on a daily basis, and I’m gonna be going through Cracking the Coding Interview.

At the end of the day, I have confidence I could pass Software Engineering interviews l, but without a reference, would I be able to get them?

Honestly any tips or pointers on how to prepare myself for success would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for the feedback and have a good day"

It's a language I haven't used in a while that will be used during the internship, but like I don't know if I'm gonna get the internship. I don't think it's reasonable to force a candidate to use one language since this would add extra time to refresh on syntax and libraries, potentially just for that coding assessment. I feel like your problem solving skills should be much more important than being able to use a particular language."

Written By: The Sandman

“Ben, thank you so much for watching the kids this weekend. The kids love your stories and will probably beg to hear one of them before they go to bed.”

“Sounds good, I have a story that they’ll like. It is getting late so I can get them ready for bed now. If you ever need anything, you let me know. What are neighbors for anyway?”

“Sarah…Joey… head up to the guest bedroom.”

The kids hopped into bed, tucked themselves in and eagerly awaited…

“Let me tell you a story”

I believe I was around 24 at the time. I had just graduated college and I felt like my life was in some kind of time loop. I felt like I needed more but no matter how hard I tried to break the routine, everything in my life just remained the same. I was a straight “A” student and it came with ease, hell, I challenged many professors. Things naturally came easy to me. Information would flow into my head and seemed to stay there. 3.14159265358979…. I could remember the first thousand numbers of PI. Rounding Techniques for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms was my best dissertation and was up for an award. I’m not going to lie, my smart mouth got me in trouble quite frequently, but for the most part I was a solid kid.

“ We get it. You’re a genius. Can you please get to the good parts!”

“Okay, Okay”. 

I lived my life searching for more, you could say I needed to find myself. I wanted to find direction, more motivation, and more importantly…. the grander plan. I knew I was here to serve a better purpose, but daily routine and a mundane existence prevented me from finding what I was desperately looking for. 

\[Knock\]

\[Knock\]

\[Knock\]

Someone was knocking at the door. Beating kind of hard, which I wish they wouldn’t considering that the old door to this apartment has seen better days and could cave in at any moment. Of course, this guy looks like a Jehovah witness or someone trying to sell me something. 

“Sir before you think I’m a Jehovah witness or a salesman, I can assure you that I am neither”

Wow, I thought to myself. This guy is good. Its almost as if he was able to read my mind….or he has done this a thousand times.

“I wont waste much of your time. But would it be alright if I ask you a few questions?”

“Sure, why not” 

“Do you believe in God? Do you believe in places such as heaven or hell?”

“I don’t really follow religion”

“Sir, I’m sure you have heard that if you live by the Word of God, confess your sins and strive to be a good person, you will go to Heaven. What if I told you….what if I told you that way of thinking is actually false?”

Now, after this unknown guy had made that type of statement, I’m curious. I never really heard an Atheist come to your door to denounce the word of God and how you should NOT live by His word.

“We have an event that we hold every Thursday at 6pm. Would you be willing to accept my invitation?”

“How can you leave me with such a cliff hanger and very little information” I asked?

“I promise you; this event will be very informative. You seem to be a person that seeks greater knowledge and purpose. We will guide you in direction your heart and mind desires.”

He handed me a little written piece of paper with nothing but a time and address on it. Oddly, this guy seemed to know everything about me and what I was thinking. Was it the way I presented myself? Was it my polo shirt tucked neatly into my crisp clean wrinkle free pants? Was it my neatly groomed hair? Now this guy really has be questioning things and piqued my interest. I haven’t felt this intrigued for a while. And, I didn’t even get his name.

I had a couple of days to really think about this and if I even wanted to entertain this man who I knew nothing about. Heh, I was 24, just graduated college with no girlfriend and no kids. My parents were in another state, and I’m just sitting here by myself in this one bed room apartment. What else do I have going for me right now? Besides, I still haven’t heard anything about this intern position at my bank that I applied for 2 weeks ago and I was determined to escape the time loop of my routine.

“So you went to that place?” the kids asked 

“Well give me time, I’m getting there”

Thursday came and it was almost time for me to go to the event. I pulled out my trusty map and saw that it was literally out in the middle of nowhere about 20 miles from home. This felt like something straight out of an Orson Welles broadcast.

Driving down this long, old country road, seemed to take forever and felt eerie. As I pull up to the address he had given, I realized it lead me to a vacant field which contained several tables full of food and baskets. It was presented as a giant picnic. I got out and felt something odd. It wasn’t the fact that I saw around forty to fifty people there without a vehicle in sight. It was the cold air and I swear I could hear whispers through the trees. Almost as if they were chanting. The sunset made the sky appeared to be blood red. 

As I walked toward the tables, I saw the guy who gave me the card.

“Hey Ben! Over here”

Wait, I don’t remember telling this guy my name. What the –

“Have some food that we just harvested. Its fresh and I swear you’ll love it. After dinner, we are going to listen to the word from Willdir”

“Sounds good.” I politely said.

I sat down beside a woman and she preceded to tell me her name was Sherry. She handed me a plate full of food and a cup of tea to wash it down.

“This food is great isn’t it. This is our best harvest yet” she said.

“Who is Wilder” I asked her.

“It’s better for you to learn on your own, than for me to tell you. But I know you’ll love his word”

We all sat down in front of this giant fire pit, the largest I’d ever seen; the dancing flames were hypnotizing. I could not break my stare from the flame that was in front of me and I grew very dizzy all of a sudden.

\[Demonic Voice\] “Why do you live your life the same way every day? You hate the routine, you know there is more to life…but you sit idle, cowardly waiting as the days pass you by.” 

I shook my head violently and rubbed my ears to make sure I did not just hear a demon’s voice. Finally able to look beyond the flames, I realized the others are all looking to the same area, a dark spot in the woods. I watched a man emerge from an invisible doorway of darkness that the trees’ shadows and the moon light have worked together to create. His hair is grey but his body is fit, his wrinkles show his age but his movements are that of a young man. His presence commands attention and the others are hanging to his ever word. As he walks nearer and continues to speak, I feel shivers run down my spine. Though he is speaking to 40 people, I feel that his message is directed towards me. Just as the flames had held my attention, I can now only focus on this man. He too is hypnotizing and his words burn through my body.

“You feel out of place, you lack purpose in your life, like a match with no flame. You question daily what the purpose of your life is. Why do you walk God’s green earth? You grew up believing that if you live by the word of God, confess your sins and live to be a good person, you will go to Heaven. Have you bought in to this belief? Or are you just going through the motions? I’m going to tell you that confessing yours sins and asking for forgiveness is not enough. Being a good person is arbitrary. We are not here to simply exist and survive or just be good. We must rise above the limitations of being human. Cast away the burdens of humanity and become one with God. There are levels of transformation, levels of enlightenment and illumination, that need to be completed before one is ready to live in God’s kingdom. 

Watch the flame before you…we know that to create such a powerful flame we need many elements. Rocks beat together to create a spark that lit a small flame onto dry moss, carefully and patiently, we used that bundle of kindle to ignite the trunks and branches of trees that once were the vessels that carried life within their harden outer bark. I have been given the spark of knowledge, sent to spread a flame of enlightenment. Like the moss, I will breath energy into your vessels, you can rise to become more powerful than you could ever image. I can ignite your flame, give you all the answers you have ever sought. It will be your job to learn and develop yourself, transform your spirit and evolve. Once you have reached your peak enlightenment, your flame will dwindle, you will shed your current form, your vessel. And your soul, like the smoke from this flame, will rise to the heavens to take your rightful place with God.

Not all humans are capable of evolving passed this corrupt word, there will only be the ‘cleansed few’. The cleansed few will have no human limitation, no barriers preventing them from achieving the ultimate goal of shedding their vessel and to live with the higher power.”

Wilder grabbed me and told me to lay down on my back. Entranced by his words, I submitted, my body was to weak to disobey anyway. I laid there….shaking….violently. Almost is if my spirit was leaving my body. It felt like an “Out of body” experience or as if I was in a vivid dream. The energy that surged through my spirit form was breath taking. I had wings and was glowing bright as I ascended into the sky. I could still hear him giving us his word. Only this time, it was in a different language. A different dialect that I couldn’t understand. Was this the knowledge he was giving us? Was this it and I’m missing it? Why can’t I understand? Is  it because I am not evolved, as Wilder had stated? Whatever this feeling was, I felt holy. I felt godlike….

I wasn’t supposed to be here with these other humans that I interacted with on a daily basis. This was why I was put here on this earth, to learn and to become “evolved”, only to ascend into the heavens. 

I could see everyone’s auras. It was almost as if I had a second sight. This feeling didn’t last long. 

Everything turned black and I woke up early that morning with the biggest headache I had ever had. It felt like my brain expanded and it was trying to push its way out of my skull. I needed answers. What has my life been up until this point? I found Sherry laying under a tree and wanted to ask her for guidance. She again informed me that it was better for me to learn from Wilder. I suspect she was not enlightened enough yet to guide others. I had to wait another week for his word. But Sherry informed me that I was able to stay with them for as long as I needed. From that point on, every week I would listen to his word. I could slowly feel my mind expanding. My mind and spirit were evolving too much for this vessel to contain. I eventually cut ties with my family. I stopped paying rent and moved in this giant building with all of the other members. I stopped buying food and fed from the harvests, just as the others did. Its almost as if I had dropped off the face of the earth. I was away from the city. Away from all of the pollution of the industrial buildings. I was able to be in a place where I could clear my mind. I was able to clear my mind for the next 20 years to come. I shed my human burdens, I learned to live a celibate lifestyle, I cut off all of my hair to rid myself of vanity and felt nothing holding me to this world. I awaited the day for God to come and cleanse this world, he would send a spacecraft for the chosen few who were ready to shed their vessels. 

The moment we had all been waiting for, that “Sign”, came early on in the year during one of our gatherings.

We were all standing in front of the fire again just waiting on Willdir to give us his word. All of us were anxious. There was a very strong presence that everyone felt. A huge spike in essence. As he walked toward us there was a huge comet that soared high above us. He had a grin on his face and stretched out his arms.

“This is the moment we have all been waiting on. For years we have waited for this sign, and now it is upon us. There is a spacecraft following behind that comet. Close your eyes and if you can feel it, your journey will begin. Your journey will not begin unless you separate your mind and spirit from your vessel. Your vessel can NOT handle the next stage of evolution. To leave this earth…. through the course of your own decision, is not suicide. It is separating your mind from your vessel, your human form. God is reaching out to you to offer life. You must separate yourself from this vessel. You must shed your vessel. You must! We have prepared for this moment for years.

Willdir released everyone but brought me to the side and informed me that my mission was not coming to an end. My heart desired to leave my vessel like the others, but it was not yet my time.  My instructions were clear, I was chosen to take on the role of Willdir and I was honored to spread his word….They will come back for me when the time is right.  But first I was to go to an address that he had given me and watch for a sign.

I sat rocking in an old chair, quietly waiting, in the small home that I was sent to. It felt like I had been there for months however it was only a matter of days, before I received a letter. It was a hand written note that read “Our evolution is complete; we have left our vessels and entered the gateway to God’s kingdom”. Once I read those words, I knew I had to go back. 

It took me a full day to travel, I didn’t stop, I didn’t eat, I rushed to the only place I knew as home. But when I arrived, I couldn’t believe myself. A place that once thrived with life now felt…it felt empty. I could no longer sense the presence of anyone and their energy was gone. 

I hadn’t even stepped foot inside but as I walked closer, a powerful odor made my vessel throw up. I opened the door and immediately walked up stairs. I turned my head left, then turned my head right.

I saw impeccably made bunk beds with bodies…vessels in every bed. Each vessel lay on their backs, perfectly still with hands crossed over their chest and a silk shroud placed over their face. Beside them, were their empty tea cups and one spoon on a night stand. I yelled around the house to see if anyone…or anything… was still here. I heard nothing, the silence was deafening. I stood there in awe, thinking about what I had given up and the peace they received in evolution. I wanted to go crazy. I have given up everything I own and everything I had ever learned for this moment…this moment right here. I was ready to go too!….I was ready to leave my vessel and this cold corrupt world behind. 

In an instant, I heard something come from down the hall. As I walked, I glanced into each doorway, seeing nothing but vessels everywhere. A few vessels appeared to have been weak, dried vomit harden to their shrouds and ran down the side of the bed frames. I continued walking until I reached the last door at the end of the hallway, leading to the master suite. It was here that I heard a noise.  I lifted the shroud to Willdir’s vessel and put it on the night stand next to his tea. His cold lifeless vessel just laid there with his eyes closed. But I swear I felt a faint energy whisper to me. The words empowered me and gave me strength. I will carry on his word until the next sign tells me to ascend into the heavens with the others. Until that day comes……I’ll be here.

\*scared kid says\* “What did the whispers say???”

It’s getting late and it’s time to sleep; I’ll give you more words tomorrow, but for now, drink your tea and close your eyes……"

It is currently being lost.

My coworker who tested it said that I should handle that data on the server side, that I don't need to pass it around to the mobile app if it won't be needed there, just needs to be sent to the ERP when I save, in the app.

What exactly does this mean? How can I keep track of this data if I don't send it to the app, to then be sent to the ERP? I'm using some Web Services to get and send it to the ERP.  


EDIT: Thank you for your explanations. Although they did help, the concept I was missing is that I can fetch the fields I need from the database, instead of sending them to the app. So I just send what I need, and in my web services I map the attributes with the database fields.

  Looking for advice and to get this off my chest. I am a second bachelor student going for a MEC degree at SUNY Stony Brook, I am currently a 2nd semester freshman. Last semester I got a 2.5 (B- in freshman innovative design  and Calc I, C+ in Physics I which had a ridiculous professor), this semester does not seem to be going any better. One week ago I took the first midterm for Physics II and got a 60% when the avg was a 67 and the median was higher. I studied extremely hard for the test and believe I know more then the 60% grade. Then today I took my Linear Algebra Midterm and can feel that a bad grade is on the way, one question I know is wrong but I did not have the time to figure out was was going on, another question I answered but not the way it asked for. I did not study as hard for this test due to life/homework I needed to complete. 
 
This makes me very worried for two reasons. First, I need a 3.0 at least to get matriculated into a program, that means I need an A- in all of my classes this semester. Second I need a 3.0 to be considered for any big name engineering internship, which I already have the connections for. 

To make matters worse the last degree I graduated with a 2.67, I did not work nearly as hard as I am right now, but still getting this GPA and now working an immeasurable amount more and still not exceeding is making feel incapable/stupid. 

I feel like I have taken the steps I should have to get the higher grades, but am not seeing results. I'm having a hard time figuring out what I should do, I'm to stubborn to give up, but something needs to change. Any advice, I have been reading the text, redoing homeworks, practice exams and then redoing those. I know about professor Leonard and the others, I have a playlist saved that was shared on this subreddit but I dont have the time after going over my professors notes and homework. 

Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading 

TL;DR: second bachelor student graduated with bad GPA, getting a bad GPA as freshmen in MEC, trying to figure out what needs to be changed."

I  think it'd be really fun to try and make my own, but I don't know if I  want to invest the time if it won't mean much when applying to Java jobs  focused on the back-end or on desktop. I also don't care about working  for a FAANG  - I live in a tech hub so my options are pretty good but I  don't really care about name recognition. Thoughts?"

In high school they told me not to get a job because they wanted me to study hard and get into college and to not worry about money because they will pay for everything. When I started college they once again told me not to get a job because they wanted me to focus on my studies. 

I know I am very privileged to be able to have parents well off enough to pay for my college and life. I am very grateful that they are willing to do this. 

I've been studying really hard and this semester has been really hard on me mentally, I have a really big course load on top of my internship, volunteering, job shadowing, leadership positions, and research so my friend's parents invited me and some other friends to drive to their beach house at venice beach ca from where we live in Idaho for spring break. We have been planning this for months and I've been very excited but last night my parents texted me saying that I am no longer allowed to go to venice because they're worried I'll catch coronavirus and that if I do go they'll cut me off financially. 

I'm upset the trip is cancelled but I'm more upset my parents are threatening to cut me off financially? I hate that they can pull the money card whenever they want and I have to listen to them or else we'll just fight and I'll be cut off, especially when they've spent my whole life telling me to not save money or get a job because they didn't want me to worry about money. 

Am I wrong to be mad at them? My brother says that I don't listen to them and I'm stubborn and I should just suck it up. I know they're just concerned for my health but I'm still upset about the money part? And that they didn't just talk to me about it they just gave me an ultimatum. I just feel uncomfortable with how much power they have over my life?"

(Details of the situation below),aDudeUsingReddit,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fd14aq/applying_for_jobs_thoughts_on_kind_of_maybe_lying/,"I'm graduating college this semester as a computer science major and have been so far unsuccessful landing a job. I came across a position that I'm expecting will have tons of applicants. 

The first question is ""Do you have 2+ years of non-internship professional software development experience?"" with a drop box providing the options ""Yes"" or ""No"". Now, let me explain how this has brought up somewhat of a personal dilemma for myself.  

Last summer I got an internship in application development through a family friend high up in the company, so the office wasn't used to having interns around. It was actually kind of a nice thing because I really just got thrown right in there and had to figure out a lot of things on my own (taught myself languages, how to use their software, how the company actually works, etc.). I ended up working on some pretty tough projects and learned a lot about programming I was never taught in school. I have advanced coding skills when compared to most my peers, and feel like answering this question 100% truthfully will end up hurting my chances.

I'd imagine this question is to just filter out applicants without enough experience, but I have the required skills. So I guess I'm looking for some opinions on this. If anyone has HR experience that would be great. 

Basically, if I select ""Yes"" and they see from my resume I haven't had the 2+ years would that hurt my chances more than selecting ""No"" in the first place?"

fd3178,1,2020-03-03,I feel like an asshole,BrokenHeartKiller,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fd3178/i_feel_like_an_asshole/,"Okay so a few weeks ago me and a friend went to a training weekend thingy at the company I'm doing my internship at. Here I met a girl, let's call her P, that I kinda fell in love with her, I told her that I liked her and the reason she didnt think it would work is cause she lives 3 hours away from me. That sucked really bad cause I've had a crush or 2 before, but this felt different. It felt like I couldn't live without her, since I started missing her the second we went home. I genuinely think that if we were closer to each other we might've become a thing. 

So the reason I'm feeling like an asshole is the following. After she rejected me my heart broke into a million pieces, I didnt know what to do to get the feeling to stop. So I decided to distract myself, I met another girl (M) that I thought I had a crush on, I kinda liked her and stuff , but it didnt feel the same as with P. I was trying to get her attention and stuff till I realized that it wasn't working. I gave up at that moment.

A week ago a friend of my friend's gf (A) added me on snapchat. We started talking and she was really nice. She started making jokes about missing me in her bed and stuff. I ofcourse made them back. But I'm pretty sure she caught feelings for me and she wants to hang out and stuff and I said yes. The thing is tho, I've been thinking and I realized that I didnt really have a crush on M and that I dont really have the right feelings for A. Like I feel stuff with A but I'm still really not over P and I'm scared that I might hurt A's feelings. I'm scared that I'm just flirting now but that I won't be able to actually date her. After all the things she's said I'm scared that we'll go on a date, have sex and that I'll realise too late that I dont have feelings for her or something. 

Idk what to do, idk what to think, idek what I'm feeling anymore...

I dont want that to happen and we have been flirting too much for me to suddenly stop now, I'm scared that whatever I do next I'll hurt A and be seen as an asshole or a fuckboy. And I know that if I hurt her I'm an asshole.

What should I do?"

fd3rnx,29,2020-03-03,"Made a post about my college experience, but it ended up being about CS advice. Reflection on CS + AMA(?)",unflippedbit,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fd3rnx/made_a_post_about_my_college_experience_but_it/,"**TLDR at Bottom**
So I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fcl0a4/my_experience_at_a_top_college_ama_northwestern/) detailing my experience at a ""t10"" school and got a positive response, but within that I saw so many questions/PMs from graduating seniors wanting to go to into CS. Holy crap I thought the interest was already at a peak my year, but I see it's not dying down anytime soon (which is great!)
 I got like 30 PMs asking me to tutor them and like tell them secrets for big 4 internships. I don't think I can do those things, but I can definitely share my thoughts with you guys on CS. 

For those that didn't read the post, I'm a rising senior who did 2 internships so far at big 4 (saying that as a qualification for ppl who judge by credentials - which I was guilty of). I might be returning full-time, but might also add on Computer Engineering as a major, or graduate early, or a masters. Don't ask me mom and dad, I still don't know! 
The main questions I got is how to prep and how to get an internship, what to study, etc. However I think I can speak to CS much more than NU actually, so let me lay out some thoughts I'd tell myself (a high school senior who wanted to do anything possible to prep as much as possible) looking back, and also try to cover some recurring themes in the questions I saw that might allay your fears. 

First, note that you might think some of this doesn't make sense. Think of it as when you were a little kid and you couldn't have the fifth slice of pizza and you cried but your parents told you you'd understand. I know that's tough being in the same shoes before, but try. 

The best thing I could've done with my summer after hs sr yr was laid back and enjoyed. I went into CS111, the intro class at my school, with a bunch of practice in OOP and procedural languages, and even having published apps and whatnot. But oh my god that class was so confusing to me. A person I'd previously mentioned my accomplishments in CS to was breezing by and I was all like wtf for the first few weeks (this class was taught in Racket, which is developed by my school and a few others and I think yale/brown/neu also use it not sure tho). The reason I struggled so much is because I hadn't been learning computational thinking or how a computer really works, just how to arrange code to make something run. I didn't take AP CS in hs but took the test and did well, and that does seem like it tests a little bit but from what I remember the focus is really on semantics and memorization. 

That's another thing; **if you're memorizing anything in CS, you're not using your time correctly**. [This is my advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Forbus) and I'm pretty sure he doesn't know any language beyond lisp (or anything to do with practical stuff). When you study CS, you should be aiming to take away concepts, not remember how to declare something in a language or whatnot. My first job at big n I had literally never touched the language of use before in my life or seen something like it, but it doesn't matter because companies like big 4 know this and that's why they'll never test u on a language, rather concepts. I've never heard of a company that interviews and asks you to write in one particular language (might exist idk, not in SV). All of my interviews were on whiteboards with pseudocode. So when you take data structures (you might confuse yourself if you start studying now) really make sure you're absorbing what everything means, and why we want Hashmaps for certain cases versus an array etc. It is MOST easy to get into this mindset once you start seeing how cool thinking this way can be, like understanding why you'd never want an algorithm to run in O(2^n) or 4 nested for loops. Spoiler: you'll be computing for years.  Don't worry about grades, worry about understanding and applying. In college it is MUCH more fair to this and I've never had a prof expect us to memorize anything, only know concepts. We've had open book tests (that many people failed) because the tests are about conceptually getting what's going on, not regurgitating info. 

So if you wanna stop reading here, **my main takeaway is you'll be benefiting yourself by actually not doing work over the summer. By going into your curriculum with a fresh mindset, assuming a good curriculum it will be set up to give you the foundation you need and start understanding what you don't know. ** I haven't gotten more than a 3 week vacation since starting college and think I'm going to take a quarter off or at a local school because I really freaking need one. That's why I'm really emphasizing this. The internship I did as a rising senior didn't benefit me at all. 

For those who won't listen to the above, or want to work in the summer as a matter of not getting bored, I do have one recommendation. This is purely opinion, keep that in mind. Different ways work for different people. The book **Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond** by patel (think you can get a free pdf online) or something of the sort was used for CE my freshman year and I think that changed my whole understanding, because that book explains to you from the level of a transistor, up to assembly, and eventually as high as C how a computer works. And it starts from the very basics, hs seniors will be able to understand it without any CS background. They also use a simpler version of assembly, so don't be scared of it. I don't think reading that is something you could misunderstand or would harm you, but rather would maybe put you at an advantage because you have an idea of how a computer actually works, which is super important regardless of the language. 

This post also lays out the big differences between computer science and programming. College will be much more intellectually rigorous than your job, but also much clearer on what to do and expect. Software engineers have to make subjective calls and decisions, and aren't always gonna get everything right but it's about how productive you can be. 

Last thing: I know there's a huge hype around CS given the crazy salary stories. When people look at a site like Levels.fyi, they're looking at the cream of the crop. Most SWE's will make 60k out of college. MORE IMPORTANTLY, if you get into college and take a few classes and feel CS isn't for you, I'm not gonna say don't do it to be happy, but rather if you find yourself miserable in it your chances of doing well are much less than that of someone who can find passion in it. **And finding passion in it I believe is not something you have to be born with, but can learn**. I say this because there's a lot of misinformation on what programming is and being a genius and all that fuzz, but basically saying do your best to enjoy the learning of these concepts. They're really cool. **Try as much as you can to deconstruct any preexisting notions of CS you have (the negative ones like only geniuses can do it) and what it must be and give yourself the chance to start with a fresh, more mature mindset.** My gf thought she would never code in her life, that it wasn't possible for someone like her to learn. I said all this to her and guided her in her learning style and now I worry she's gonna be better than me soon enough (I kid)

 As nerdy as it is, I sometimes find myself mindmapping the shortest path to a place lol. Not the best example but you'll see CS teaches you a new way of thinking, not simply programming. It introduces you to a different logic.

 But I was always fascinated with computers so that's an advantage. Rethinking it, I think the book I stated is what really got me motivated, because you finally get to the bottom layer of the mystery of a computer. How configuring gates and wires in a certain way lets us have something as insane as an iPhone, or even how we can type and see a letter. It changes your perspective if you let it. 

Thanks for reading my spiel guys, enjoy your senior yrs. 
If anyone has questions, I'll answer anything (preferably not how to get job at X company tho, that's like asking someone at Stanford how to get in :( )


tldr: Let go of what you think CS/programming has to be, focus on realizing how in college with CS you're gonna be taught (from the basics with professors and TA's) in a way that's designed to guide you to really understand the concepts and breadth within CS. Enjoy your summer. Don't intern. If you like to work and learn for fun, read the book I recommended or work on a personal, meaningful project. *THAT* will be way more impressive to a big company."

*Press the red button to begin recording.*

A man with shaggy brown hair in a black t-shirt sat hesitantly in front of the camera. He had light brown eyes and unruly facial hair that tickled the lower half of his face. Dark circles sat gloomily under his eyes. 

“Okay. I’m John Miller, I’m a film student at UWM living in the third ward.”

He stops to rub his mouth as he nervously looks down to the right. He shakes his head ever so slightly and turns his head back at the camera.

“Listen, I-I don’t *want* to make a video like this. I’d love to have it any other way but the fuckin’ cops basically laughed at me and my roommates want to kick me out,” he waves his arms around frantically as he sleeps, a slight shake in his hands as they move. 

“I don’t have anywhere else to put this and I feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t get this out of my system. I’m so *fucking scared*,” John winced, his shoulders slumped. 

“I just need to know what’s happening to me,” he continues, his voice shrinking to a whisper.

His hand reached up and turned the camera off. 

The screen went black.

John let out an exasperated sigh and ran his hands through his hair. He was parked under the bridge outside his apartment, afraid to leave himself vulnerable and without a means of escape. John sank into the driver’s seat, feeling defeated and alone. 

*How do you tell someone you’ve been seeing things without sounding crazy?*

His phone, face down, in the passenger seat, began to ring and he jumped, hitting his head on the car-door window. 

John groaned, and reached over to flip the phone over. 

The screen was lit up with the name *Olivia* and a picture of a young woman with wavy brown hair and a goofy smile. She was looking past the camera, into the eyes of the photographer, with something you couldn’t explain. 

He tried to snap out of it as he answered the call.

“Hey...what’s up?” He awkwardly began. 

He heard Olivia clear her throat on the other end of the line. 

“Heyy John, um. How’s it goin?” 

He could hear the unnerve in her voice.

“Listen, I-” Olivia began.

John interrupted her, his hands flailing as he began to spit words out, “Look-- I’m sorry about last night. I don’t know what to do to fix it, but I feel horrible about it,” his voice shook. 

Silence. 

“I think I was really drunk last night… I just need to stop for a while, I’m just stressed about my thesis. I know the guys are pissed at me and I...” John rambled, his voice wandering off. 

“John…” Olivia murmured. “Do you remember what happened?”

“I-I think so…” John replied.

“You...You fell asleep the second you got home and we found you sobbing in your sleep. *What do you think happened?”* Olivia pressed, concern in her voice. 

In John’s mind, he visualized what he *thought* had happened. 

*John walked into the apartment, his hands shaking. He’d been avoiding the house since the night before, since he saw… it. He stepped into the kitchen and headed for the fridge, looking for a beer and a snack, when he felt a firm hand on his shoulder.* 

*John jumped and whirled around.* 

*Adrian stood in front of him, a friendly smile on his face. His long blonde locks were tucked behind his ears and he sported a long plaid button-up, loosely worn, with a t-shirt underneath.*

*“Ayee man, I haven’t seen you all day? What’s goin’ on?” He tucked his hands into his pockets and leaned up against the scratched up kitchen counter behind them.* 

*“Just uhh-- Just busy today,” John nodded, his lips pressed together.* 

*“Yeaaa I get it,” Adrian shrugged. “Listen, come smoke with us, Olivia got that internship! We gotta celebrate man.”*

*A shiver ran down John’s spine.* 

*His eyes darted to the floor and he stumbled on his words.* 

*“John are you alright?” Adrian questioned, his brows furrowing.* 

*“Yeah...I just gotta cool down.”*

*Adrian nodded, and beckoned him into the living room.* 

*John hesitantly followed, trudged into the room where Olivia, Ronny, and Greg sat cross-legged on the floor around a bong. They all waved enthusiastically, and Olivia jumped up to meet John in the doorway.* 

*Olivia grinned and hugged John.* 

*“Congrats, Olive,” John smiled, melancholy in his voice.* 

*“Thanks...Hey, what’s up?”*

*“Nah...Don’t worry about it. I’ll spark you,” he replied hesitantly.* 

*He looked behind her, to where the standing lamp next to the couch had...a black figure behind it.* 

*The black figure had returned.* 

*John backed up nervously, his breath tangling up in his throat.* 

*Olivia looked from him, to the lamp, to him, in confusion.* 

*“What are you...looking at?” she laughed.* 

*The figure reached out to reveal a pruny hand, and it moved the lampshade.* 

*John’s heart was racing and he couldn’t control it. Fight or flight, fight or flight.* 

*“I….gotta use the bathroom.” John spit.*

*He spun around and trudged to the bathroom, his heart climbing into his throat. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck-* 

*He made it down the hall and into the bathroom and shut the door behind him. He locked it and took a shuddery breath. He met his frantic eyes in the mirror, darting with uncertainty.*

*He took another deep breath. This shit. Isn’t. real.* 

*And with perfect timing, the pruny hand reached out from the closet visible in the mirror, clicking against the wallpaper.* 

*Out of instinct, John whipped his hand up and punched the mirror. It shattered all around him, but he could still hear the clicking.* 

“Hello? John-- you there? I noticed you’ve been stressed out, don’t worry about it.”

“I-I don’t know…” John’s voice trailed off.

“I just feel like a dick for not celebrating with you guys,” he continued. 

He stared at the floor, an odd feeling sinking to the bottom of his stomach. *What was real, what wasn’t?*

Olivia chuckled. 

“Did Adrian text you about it yesterday? Ugh, it was supposed to be a surprise. Look, don’t worry, okay? You can make it up to me,” Olivia laughed. 

“Alright, you got it, Olive,” he laughed nervously. “I gotta go, I’ll see you soon?”

“You bet,” she replied cheerily.

He hung up and looked up to his apartment building across from him. Was he really wiggin out? It felt too real, too *fucking* real. 

He rolled his eyes and sighed. 

John got out of the car and began to trudge to the building, attempting to relax his shoulders and clear his mind. 

And he almost did it, too. 

But for a moment, he could have fuckin’ sworn that that *person*, or *thing*, was sitting out front on the steps. Waiting for him, yearning."
fd447p,1,2020-03-03,Question about internships and knowledge requirements,ExtraTemp,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/fd447p/question_about_internships_and_knowledge/,"I really like programming in C++. I have written my own implementation of a thread pool, a .obj and .ply parsers using multiple threads and memory mapping, simple phong lighting renderer with camera in OpenGL and now I'm in a process of creating a custom set of generic containers for a Vulkan project that are (so far) standard-compliant, about 80% test-covered and use their own custom allocators.

My main concern is that despite knowing how the code for the above works and, to some degree, what it means for it to be testable, self-documenting and extensible, I would still not have been able to land an internship at any software company because I'm not a student and I don't have any diploma or prior experience behind my back either. 

Not to mention that there is no such thing as C++ internship in a 100 mile radius from where I live and I would probably have to try to look into C# offers to get anywhere at all. I'm not good at C# though.

So my questions are - what type of knowledge do I need to have before applying? Does it have to be language specific or do I just need to understand the general basics? And do my personal projects have any meaning whatsoever in the whole process?"

My plan is to have an internship in a company where there is already some experienced sysa or devops and learn from him but the last company that I was today they dont have experienced sysa or devops they only have a ""tech manager"" who is going to work with me, by giving tasks, directions etc. I am computer science student so I already have experience with coding and system administration but I want to learn more by doing things. The company that was today even that there is no experienced sysa the other things like working enviroment, people and projects look fine to me. I want to ask them if I start an internship at that company, to pay me subscription for some.online courses like linuxacademy or ccna. Can you suggest me more certification sites that will have full working enviroment with hands on labs, solutions... Also any advice on the path carrier are welcome. Thanks"
fd666n,0,2020-03-03,Ethically Reporting My GPA in the Best Possible Light?,Dotaproffessional,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fd666n/ethically_reporting_my_gpa_in_the_best_possible/,"I want to start including my gpa on my resume's. I'm about to graduate with a bachelor's in computer science. Although full time positions tend to ask your gpa less than internships, I'm actually not opposed to taking an internship after graduation since I never took one and am nervous about entering the workforce with zero experience. If i can find a full-time position from one of those big techy companies (you know, the kind that calls their facility a ""campus"") that does a ton of training in order to ""mold you"" to their liking, great, but I have a feeling they'll want to know my gpa, and not including it on my resume looks shady. 

However, I wasn't always a great student. I was going to another university for electrical engineering and it was clear it wasn't for me. So i transferred in with some awful grades. To top that off, my new school wouldn't let me transfer directly into cmpsc, so I had to transfer in as a humanities major and attempt to schedule computer classes without a computer advisor. I often was changing my schedule around as late as the second week of class, and it fucked my grades bad. Plus i wasn't a great student. After a semester of academic suspension, I came back invigorated. I turned my grades around and actually did pretty damn good. 

If I look back 2 years (including my current semester grades would make 2.5 years) I have a 3.03 gpa. That looks a lot better than my total career gpa of 2.17. 

But I want to be ethical without giving massive red flags. 

I can't exactly say ""gpa since entering the cmpsc major"" because technically I didn't enter until like a semester ago (2 semesters counting the current one) and that seems dishonest. I don't want to give an arbitrary ""2 and a half semesters"" because then it sounds like i'm trying to hide a bad semester (which technically I am). 

Any idea how i can phrase my gpa such that It looks as good as possible without doing anything ethically dubious?"

I have a few projects under my belt but they are unrelated and small (C# with NUnit testing, a Laravel tutorial I followed and hosted on Heroku). I am looking to do a deep-dive into one technology to gain true proficiency. 

In your opinion, what would you focus on to maximize immediate employability while balancing future career flexibility? Some examples I am considering: 

* Creating a web application using Node.js and React.
* Creating an application with C#, Rails, or Java.
* Creating a Python application.
* Altering focus and completing [Portswigger's web security academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) and targeting pen testing instead. (I *think* I want to do SWE, but who knows, maybe I could love it?)

My interests are diverse and I enjoy most any programming.

I lived in the UK for 8 years and then moved to the US and am currently in my second year of college majoring in Computer Science.

Why do the tech salaries suck so bad in the EU/UK? Why don’t the people get paid as much as they do in the US? Or even 80% of what people make on average here? What’s the issue that makes companies feel like they don’t need to pay the employees as high as they do in the USA?

What’s hilarious is I recently got an internship in a High COL and if I match my per annum pay, it’s around $55k which is about £43k in GBP and €49000 in euros. As an intern, I’m getting paid much more than the average graduate in UK/EU, and I get all the benefits that a full time employee would get. Why is this the case? Seeing these kind of salaries make me want to continue living in the US rather than coming back.

Please can someone in detailed explain why the pay is so bad and what one can perhaps do to atleast get paid 80-90% of what a person would get paid in the US?"

I am 27(F) still living with her parents finishing my Psychology degree (will be done next year where I would need to do an internship with another psychologist). I am currently working at a office job that makes me miserable and pays me minimum wage. I am lucky seeing as I only work from Monday to Thursday from 8 to 4 (with an hour lunch break), where a lot of my coworkers work the whole week until 5.

Here follows some of the problems of the job:

Paying minimum wage, while expecting maximum effort, with no prospects of promotion or increase of wages.

No benefits because we do not work 40 hours a week (going home early on Fridays).

Giving us less vacation days by forcing us to take them when the building is closed anyway in December.

Had no sanitary bins until today (03/03/2020).

Terrible management and cheap product because too stingy to use more money.

Bosses get enough money to send two children to university, while anyone else cannot live on their own and need to live with their parents.

I would like to quit my job seeing as I do not feel the mental strain it is placing on me is worth it. The work is boring and I am merely making other people very rich. However, seeing as I am still living with my parents their opinion is important seeing as I see them every day and it is never nice to live in a home where someone is disappointed in you. My mother is very much against the idea (keep in mind she is one of those people who works overtime with no compensation and is fine with it, where as I merely see a job as a way to not starve to death and would never do something like that without compensation. Finding another job will be very difficult seeing as I live in a country with a very high unemployment and I live in a small town that just does not have a lot of jobs. I believe that once I have my degree next year I should be able to get a job easier, and I cannot stay at my job anyway because I would not be able to take care of myself anyway, so finding another job is important.

I really want to quit the job and would like to ask your opinion on this matter."

[Possible trigger warning]
I believe I have tagged this post correctly, if not I will fix the issue accordingly.


Fyi, this will be a bit of a long post as it needs a bit of context and story.


Hello all,
F(20) here, and I am trying to figure out what I can do, if anything, for my situation.To start with, this occurred in between April and June of last year if I remember correctly.


I began work at this resort as a paid intern as this was the final thing I needed for me to graduate Culinary School. If it matters, I was still listed as a full time employee while there. 

This was the first time I had been completely alone as this job was a 4 hour drive from any family or friends. They supplies housing for the workers tho, which leads me to my first issue, living space.


LIVING SPACE


 While I had assumed I would be living IN the resort, I actually lived in a small sort of apartment building about a half mile away from work itself. I had no issue with this until I got inside this building. This place was dingy at best, practically a roach motel.Firstly, our shared kitchen was completely disgusting and seemed to not have been cleaned in literal years. And the rooms being smaller than an average hotel room as well. They were also shared, one twin bed on either side of the room, leaving about 3-4 feet in between for movement. We were( thankfully) given clean bed sheets and a couple pillows each month, but I honestly believe that those sheets could never protect me from the filth stained mattress I was designated. It had holes, burn marks, mystery stains, and who knows what else on it. It didnt help the the bedframe itself was so rusted I felt like it would break underneath my weight.


 I tried to stay optimistic, even if the lenolium  on the floor was peeling up, dead cockroaches and bugs all around my feet, and the immense smell of cigarette and pot smoke wafting throughout the entire building. That was until I got to the bathroom. 


This bathroom was meant to be shared with 4 people, me and the person in the room with me, and our neighbors next door. But lord was it a hazard, if I could post the pictures I took before leaving, I would. Mold everywhere(to this day I swear it was black mold) on the ceiling and around the shower, dipping ceilings from water damage, and rust on seemingly all appliances. 


Hell, one time when ""maintenance"" came to remove some flooring, they set it out by the dumpster and it was absolutely COATED  in black colored mold. I wish I could have gotten a picture of it. I believe this was one of the main causes for my asthma reappearing, but I will elaborate on that a bit later.


WORKING CONDITIONS


While I can say the kitchen's I worked in weren't the worst, they definitely weren't the best. Being the optimistic student I was, I hoped for the best. But later realized how much of a hell I put myself into. 


Being the student that i was, i was very well aware of food safety regulations. Especially because these were hammered into my head constantly and were fresh in my head right out of school. That said, I found numerous. Though most things appeared good to go; the more I worked there, the more I got to see. My biggest issue being, in the staff only areas, pipes were exposed from the ceiling, . Some less traveled areas, though still used for FOOD transportation, had INSULATION hanging from the god damn ceiling. This is something else I think contributed to my asthma coming back but I could never prove anything.


You would go into the freezers and they would be a disorganized mess of raw meat ontop of pre cooked foods and everything crammed wherever you could fit it. Though the fridges would look nice for the most part, if you looked you could find things labeled from weeks or even months ago, just sitting and rotting. It was disgusting to say the least.

 My most notable and probably the most cringeworthy thing was that when it rained, WATER WOULD DRIP FROM THE CEILING OF THE KITCHEN. Not joking here, I wish I was. I wish I could tell you the countless times I would have to trash food and other product because water would drip for the damn ceiling onto the food cart I had parked, or even the many times it would drip on me. One time the water got so bad that it short circuited half the lights in the kitchen itself. 

Not to mention how many times I slipped and almost fell in one of the numerous puddles of water around the kitchen, being in a rush and there being NO wet floor signs to speak of,  one time most notable was when I almost got sent to the hosptial for it. Hell, the worst puddle was right in front of the STAIRS leading to a lower floor. Most of the time the water would start dripping down the stairs themselves. 

Finally, we are able to get to the last thing on my list.


SUICUDE


To start with, not everything there was totally bad. I made some really amazing friends there that actually shared my concern. And when I actually had a day off from my 60-70 hour weeks( I maybe got a day of once a week if I was lucky), I would spend it with them because that's all i could do to keep even a little bit sane.


Ok, so I didnt have the best start in the kitchen. First 2 days I work 10-12 hours each. Everything was kinda dumped on me at once as some jobs do, which made my shitty bed and bathroom a god send at the end of the night. I slowly learned a little of how everything worked and did my best; though working in the food industry, doing your best doesnt mean much. I was constantly berated by people(not everyone was a dick though) as I was the only female in the main kitchen with around 25 ppl working there altogether( we were short staffed too).Yeah I wasnt the best at my job, but I tried and thankfully I have kinda thick skin. You kinda need it when you work in a kitchen. 


I didnt take anything to heart very much. Until i was told by my main chef that i should quit because i wasnt cut out for this. It hurt because i worked with this man regularly even though we didnt talk much. After that it was down hill. This is when I start to become extremely depressed.


I was given a position in the breakfast kitchen after that( I worked banquet originally and was serving upwards of 300-3000 people on any given day). It was a nice change of pace honestly. I got into a rhythm quite easily. My only damper was the people I worked eith during the breakfast shift, specifically the head chef.


 Let's get one thing clear though. And this is a fact, if you were do a drug test every single person working in any of the kitchens, I guarantee at least 90% would pop for some kind of drug. Many of them high or drunk during work. And the high at work was mainly the Breakfast staff. And all of them were Jamaican, first generation to America Jamaican at that. And I had a red dot on my head due to me being the only white person in that kitchen from 4am-2pm most days. Not to mention I am again, the only female(other than this one girl who was Indian and would occasionally come up to help cut fruit for breakfast).


Now with that out of the way, it safe to say I was targeted a lot more. Especially by the chef, who had a really thick Jamacian accent, and who was always high af at work. Those coupled together made it hard to understand him a lot of the time. So he would scream at me constantly. That or he would tell me one way to do something, and then come back later and push me out of the way because I ""did it wrong"" even though I had done it to a T. 


Well this all escalated to a point when I was slightly under the weather one day. I had been given instructions the day before from Chef about how to make a particular dish for a breakfast buffet, 70 individual parfait cups.I went so far as to take a picture of the meal and write down the exact way to do it so I wouldn't fuck up because he wasnt supposed to work that day. He said to do them when I was done with normal breakfast routine. Cool, did what I had to do and started on this stupid things. 


Next thing I know chef comes in and I'm confused, ask him why he was hear and he  proceeds to yell in my face that I fucked up because I hadn't done them in time. When he never gave me a specific time to complete these things. Ok, kinda pissed now. He starts going off to other Jamacian Colleges  in Jamacian Patios(common tounge in Jamacia) about me being a fucking idiot who he wants to strangle. Ok, fuck this guy. But I'm not confrontational, so whatever. I want to cry, but I dont and just focus on work. 


After this he proceeds to SHOVE me hard, 3 separate times while I'm working, 2 of those being when I was holding my knife. Smiling as he did it. The final straw was when he told me i had to stay at work until 330 pm for a monthly meeting of the kitchen staff. I told him no and an argument ensues to the point when I'm crying and screaming and tell him to shove it because he kept shoving me around and was done with his shit. He tells me to go home, I try to fight it but comply. I end up going to HR and reporting the incident because I didnt want to be fired. 


Next day roles around and i feel like shit. I really just wanted to die at this point. And i was called into Chef's office to speak to him. There he accuses me of drinking on the job and how SOMEONE said they smelled alcohol on my breathe. He said that must have been the reason I was acting ""strange"" yesterday.( I asked around to the people I worked with that day and no one said anything about seeing me like that or smelling alcohol.) And how he refrained from going to HR about it because he wanted to see me do better.( Yada yada)Anyways, long story short, I ended up telling him I wanted and planned to kill myself. He looked at me with sympathy and TOLD ME TO GO BACK TO WORK. That he would let someone know. Later I got a packet with the suicide hotline on it and a couple, ""how are you doing right nows?"".  The lady from Hr who delivered me the packet, went so far as to tell meprivately to, ""Not take anything Chef said personally, because that's just how he is!"". And that was that for my ""suicide prevention"". Great, nobody cares, is what I thought at the time.


I found out later that the woman for HR was MARRIED to the Chef. And that HR was corrupt as hell because numerous woman had tried to complain to HR about Chef and his harrassment. 


Anyways, 2 days later, I tried to end my own life in my dorm room while my roommate was working. I pussied out though and called myself in. Was put into in patient care after that. When I got out I wanted to file a police report against Chef but I couldn't do so without his last name? Which I couldn't get from anyone at the hotel because they either didnt know it or they refused to share ""person information"". I ended up also give a statement to the same HR woman, and when I asked for a copy of it, she refused me one due to company policy or something like that. So it went nowhere and I gave up.



But I finally have confidence to do this, if I still can that is. Or if I even could to begin with. I dont want more people to deal with the bs i went through, because I know hoe it feels. 

I know it's a lot to sort through but i wanted to be thorough with my story. Thank you for taking the time to do this and I hope someone can give me even a little bit of insight to what I should do now."

During that time I also did many internships and summer jobs in France and abroad, mostly in the **hospitality sector** (I love traveling so that's why I chose this field).

After graduation I went on my first real job hunt and in under 2 months I got a job offer at a niche hospitality group in Berlin as trade marketing coordinator. I moved there, slowly learned the job since the person I was replacing left before I arrived and my manager couldn't be with me 24/7. 4 months in, finally got the hang of it after doing crazy unpaid overtime, and found it boring. Also I was not in love with the city and couldn't picture myself living there long term. So I quit after 7 months.

Back in France, started looking for jobs again and found nothing because I needed more experience. Got a casual contract in retail for a month for a French luxury brand. Very nice environment and I've always been attracted to this sector (even thought of studying it but didn't get accepted in a program so I stayed in my uni).

Then back on the job hunt, after 2 months I got a casual contract as executive assistant in a small independant hotel. It was supposed to last 3 days, ended up lasting 10 months (*I was replacing someone on sick leave*). I was not passionate about it but it paid well so I stayed, negotiated a 4-day work week to keep looking on the side. I had about 2 interviews a month during this period - didn't got any offer. At the end my boss fired the person I was replacing because they leaked a confidential info. She offered me the job full-time but paid 40% less (because she'd make a ""mistake"" on my previous hourly rate). So I declined and my contract ended.

**So here am I now**, back to full time job searching and still getting nothing. It's been 2 months now (much more if you take into account that I was also searching *while* working-so basically since I graduated) and I feel demotivated.

During these 2 months I was able to get about 1 interview a week, even did a ""test"" day at a small company and still no one wants to hire me. Each time i get a no I try to know more about the reason, and almost everytime they are serving me classic BS like ""we ended up hiring internally"", ""we hired someone more experienced"" blah blah blah (or just never get back to me at all.......no comment).

I even went to see a sort of career counsellor, explained all of above to her, showed my resume, and she had no clue. I'm scared that since I only have short experiences, employers think I'm not gonna last long in their company as well. What do you think?

Any advice appreciated!! Many thanks and have a greta day y'all :)"

So I've been doubting my choice because I chose to do computer engineering. I should mention that I love programming (even though I'm really bad at it by now) and computers, but I'm very slow at math (something I'm taking care of with my uni's ed psych) and my parents are pushing me to finish uni, which probably will take me almost 9 years since engineering takes a lot of time to finish in my country. They say that I'm not smart enough to pursue anything ""that hard"", and that they'd rather be happier with me doing medicine. Problem is that I'm super delicate when it comes to blood (it really scares me, and gore is a no-no for me too) and I don't really like the scene because it's really sketchy in my city. I wouldn't really mind doing medicine, I would love to make my parents happy, and I'd also finish it at a shorter rate (it normally takes 6 years), but I don't think it feels right. they won't be able to support me financially for much longer, so they want me to get a job, but I won't be able to until I either finish uni or get to third year, so I can get an internship. I'm 19 by the way.

I've received around \~9 coding challenges, and 1 interview (after which they gave me a take home assignment and I got rejected after submitting it). The companies who gave me coding challenges either ghosted or rejected me (yes I did follow up with the ones that ghosted me). I still have \~2 coding challenges yet to complete and plan on doing so.

I am worried about not getting an internship this summer, otherwise finding a full time job next year will be impossible. Can anyone tell me what's wrong with my resume? I have prior internship experience at a small family friend's startup. I have side projects which aren't super impressive but good enough to showcase my skills. I have a leadership position at my school's CS club.

Any comments, suggestions or advice is appreciated.

I had a 9 month internship, and quite a bit of programming personal projects throughout college. My internship company opened up a full time position for me in a different department and I decided to take it since I was already in the system, and knew a lot of people who worked there. When I talked to my now manager, I told him that I don’t have a lot experience in what they were doing, but I would start off fresh and be ready to learn everything asked of me. He said it wasn’t a problem and it allows him to mold me into a good engineer. The team is a small team of engineers and contract but each person has decades of experience so I have plenty of people to learn from. I start working in January and for the first month I’m not being trained, my manager is busy and everyone is doing their own tasks. I’m told to watch videos and given busy work doing some research and translating documents into non technical language. The next month I’m given two coding tasks which I finish quickly and I’m told to look into some security stuff that we can implement for our platform. I do my best and create plans and diagrams for how to do it. Then today I’m told that the rest of the team already has the security plans I was working on planned out and almost ready to implement and I realized that everything I’ve been working on has useless to the team. The team is going to keep tackling on tougher problems and higher level issues and I try to help and ask for things to do but I’m not given anything useful.

I’m not sure whether to stay and hope that things get better and I can contribute to something, or if I should look for other jobs where I will be trained and mentored. I’d like some advice please."
fdhv4t,9,2020-03-04,Experience Questions,zachrocks2,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/fdhv4t/experience_questions/,So I recently got an interview for a programming internship. My major is Management Info Systems and I am just now about to be enrolling in some of my beginner programming courses. The situation I’m looking at is basically this: I am a sophomore here and really want an internship for the summer. I currently work in a retail technology job but outside of that I’ve always done tech related hobbies / researched and learned about many different areas of technology which has given me a very wide spectrum of knowledge on the area. I definitely consider myself more than capable of rapidly learning to code but I don’t exactly know how to communicate this to the interviewer. The job description does not ask for specific programming experience and was one of the main reasons I applied. After applying I received an email asking me to provide my programming experience since it works closely with PC-Based engineering tools. I am just looking for advice on if anyone thinks its more than possible to network the fact that I’ll be impactful on the company even though I do not have any real programming experience.

Now that I'm thinking of applying for internships and getting real-world experience, I've realized that my resume is sparse. I have never held any job before, have not done volunteer work related to IT, have no CS-related extracurriculars, and have done no projects outside of class. My only experience on my resume is volunteer work at a food bank and class projects.

My university has an internship program with various companies and organizations (MECOP) that I plan to apply to in Sophomore / Junior year.

What kinds opportunities should I take this summer (preferably in the form of a paid job) that would help prepare me and my resume to apply for internships in the future? Would a job at an IT helpdesk or in retail help me in any way?

In addition, would it be a good idea to showcase notable class projects on my resume, such as a Java simulation simulating Conway's Game of Life?"

I'm starting a new round of applications, and I'm trying to figure out whether I should be focusing on Junior or Mid level positions. I'm just gonna rapid fire my highlights:

I started learning programming 4 years ago (from zero). I took a boot camp for 6 months, spent about 6 months studying, 3 months internship, 6 months as a Web Dev Teacher's Assistant in a bootcamp, and 18 months as a (junior?) Web Developer. 

At my last job I was the primary full-stack Dev for 3 sites that went into production, and made significant contributions to about 5 (minor bug fixes for many more). I did a portion of our technical interviews for a better part of a year, and helped on-board 3 new hires as they acclimated to our tech stack. I've done a lot of QA, bug fixing, and translated many UI designs into HTML/CSS/JS using whatever framework was selected for that project (Gulp/Nunjucks, then later React/Mobx).

I'm only a couple weeks into my job search, but I just want to make sure that I'm not aiming too high by going for mostly mid-level positions. I'm pretty sure I would fumble a senior position as I'm not familiar enough with formal Comp Sci and the breadth of technologies that can be used when choosing a stack.

 I'm just trying to figure out what I should be applying for. Thoughts?"

However, I am not sure I am ready to career wise or social wise. My degree is basically UX. Some writing classes, coding, design,  research, communication,  etc. However, I currently have a minor in IT that I have not taken any classes for besides the old classes  I already had from my CS major. Companies seem really interested in that whenever I go to job fairs. I really want to minor or take some grad courses to get more of a handle on a ""specific"" field because my major is designed to be broad. The whole virus thing is really kind of ruining my plans because I was planning on doing an internship abroad.  I'll probably still look for the stragglers though. I just don't think it's wise to graduate unless I fully know my next steps as your first job can determine your starting salary for a number of years. However,  my mom told my sister about this, and within 15 mins my sister was calling me telling me to  graduate. ""If they offer you a degree, take it, you can do everything after you graduate."" Which is true, but as long as I don't meet the requirements for graduation,  I can add on a certificate or minor for basically free. Is this just nerves?

The bulk of my computational experience was through an industry internship where I worked with the R&amp;D team of a biotech company to research potential druggable targets for a particular disease of interest. While I didn't sign a NDA or anything of the sort, common sense tells me that I ought to not talk about the particulars of what I worked on, so I plan to not give the name of the disease or any other specific details of what we did. But this leaves me with the problem of not having enough information to present, especially because all of the data, code, and figures I generated are with the company, so I don't even have much to work with. I do have academic projects that I could safely talk about since the work has already been published, but since I did not use any bioinformatics in that project I think it'd be preferable to highlight the skills from my internship instead. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How did you go about presenting your work in a way that maintained discretion while illustrating your computational skills? Many thanks in advance!"

I’ve been here for almost a year and I think my lack of caring is starting to show, and will most likely get fired in the coming month.. not sure how I’ll handle that since it’s never happened to me, but I’m already fearing anxiety and depression coming back.

I applied to a graduate school last year but got rejected since (I guess) my GPA is so bad, even with good references and work experience. Maybe apply again this year? But even then I don’t even know what to study or do, I don’t really like anything. Just going through life with 0 meaning.

I am lost and not sure what to do.. any tips from anyone in a similar situation ?"

Last semester was the final straw and I dropped out of the civil engineering program I had been studying in. I don't really know what to do now with starting to get a job or figuring out a new career path.

It's been nearly 3 months and my parents are just desperate for me to find something and stick to it and go through, but I wouldn't be in this mess in the first place if I didnt convince myself I could do CE until I discovered I absolutely couldn't, and I'm afraid the same thing will happen with anything else I try. I think that's also why the career and aptitude testers scare me. What if the option I decide to pursue is wrong again?

It should be noted STEM has always been emphasized which is why things like ""oh but I'm really interested in video editing, and do it all the time"" were not legitimately considered, but now that I can I don't know if I should and where to start. How do I distinguish what I have as actual skills  and what should remain hobbies? For what it's worth, I feel I'm stronger on the creative side than I am STEM which has made college difficult thus far because, again, it's not something I've been encouraged to follow or give credence to. 

I keep bouncing around from all kinds of jobs and ideas I'd like to pursue and I'm the type of person who reads one of those ""17 underrated jobs"" posts and comes out conflicted with several ideas about jobs that ""I think I'd be fine working as a career.""

My goals in life are simple: work a job I don't hate, live comfortably and most importantly be able to live independently eventually (preferrably sooner ofc.)

I think I can safely say things that require sitting in front of a screen/in an office for long periods, and mulling over something repeatedly, like editing or coding, I could find myself doing if I just dont know which jobs this applies to aside from those.

As well as the only job I've really had so far was an intern at a park for psrks and rec, which I can say I did honestly enjoy and could reasonably do. (I just wish local positions were open right now or I'd be applying for that.)

*Tl;dr could really use some general advice, great links, anecdotes, or whatever, for figuring out what to do with my life and where to start. Or getting a job in general.*"

I am looking for a paid internship only, not full-time, and will be available to work from the start of May to the end of June.

I have four years of practical experience working on teams of 8-12 people on school projects, developing computer games from scratch in C++ or (for this year) in Unreal Engine 4. For most of those projects I've served as the technical director, coordinating the other CS students on the team.

As technical director I was helped other students plan, write, and test their code, while also contributing to the project myself. I also learned how to coordinate multiple software engineers to ensure that everyone knew what they were working on and how it would fit into the bigger picture.

For my own programming skills, most of my experience is in C/C++, but I have also done a few projects in C#, Python, and Java. I've also worked with the GLSL shader language and Json format for importing data from files. As a programmer I'm a generalist, having worked successfully as an AI programmer, graphics programmer, and gameplay programmer, as well as doing many smaller tasks as the need arose.

As for what I'm looking for, while most of my experience is with game development (for school projects), I'm really looking for work experience in general, so any Software Engineering position is attractive to me. Feel free to contact me via Reddit message or email if you have an offer or just further questions.

I am looking for what I should be doing on my own time to progress in the field. I have currently just been researching more about CS and getting a better understanding of the various fields. My next question is what should I be self-teaching, I currently only know a basic language called Scheme, I have very little experience using java. Is there a specific language I should focus on learning? At what point should I be confident in applying for internships (just planning on taking a summer course and working a normal summer job this year)?

I graduate in May so I want to wait just look for full-time job. 

This might technically be my second time backing out. 2 weeks ago, manager whom i will be interviewing with sent an email asking if i was available X day and time. I said yes.

I might be the only qualified candidate but I want to back out gracefully and not go into details, while also leaving the door open to future opportunities.

Should I say something along the lines “Thank you for your consideration, I will be withdrawing my application.“ or

 ”Thank you for the opportunity, but my situation has changed and I have decided to withdraw my application at this time” 

“I would like to withdraw my application due to time constraints. Thank you for the opportunity”?"

The degree is not as useless as it may sound (curriculum is very practical and some major employers like Apple/Amazon/various record labels are actually asking for Music Business degrees), but I have done no internships during college and haven’t made any meaningful relationships with any of my peers. Connections/experience are vital, and I have little to none of either. I would love to work in the Music Industry, but I don’t know if I would be very successful at it without good social skills and connections. I also would be confined to either LA or NY, both of which are incredibly expensive and would be fairly difficult to pay for with a Music Industry starting job.

I’m doing 2 minors in Web Development and Cybersecurity right now. I actually very much enjoy web development and could see myself doing it as either freelance/a contractor or at a company. However, I just don’t think my Web Dev minor would even get me a job doing Web Development. Even with a decent project portfolio, I feel like priority would almost always be given to CS majors (rightfully), which is why I want to switch.

I’ve considered just changing my major here to CS but none of the pre-reqs overlap, and I absolutely cannot afford my current school full-price. Since I’m going to be a Senior, I only have about 1.5-2 more years of federal/state grants, as well as my university’s financial aid. I think going to a CA State Uni would be much cheaper.

Basically, my questions are: Will getting a Computer Science degree from a CSU (like Dominguez Hills, Long Beach, etc.) look bad, or do potential employers mostly only care about projects and experience? Also, is it possible for me to still get web dev/programming jobs with my Music Industry degree if I can demonstrate competence through an extensive portfolio?

Kinda lost here, and kinda hating myself for making a dumb decision 😅"

Hi, I'm a second year software engineering student and I think I hate programming or at least I hate the way I see it right now. I am thinking about changing my major, but I wanted your advice first.

Originally I decided to go into software engineering because I was told I would have to do a lot of math. But right now I just feel like I'm learning over and over technologies that I never have time to master completely before moving on to the next one. Right now for school I have to do a lot of web programming and I hate it. Doing the structure of a project, understanding how all the components have to be linked together is hell for me. I spend a lot more time setting up my projects than actually working on them and it makes me sick. I don't have a problem with small projects, but when there are dozens of dependencies to take into account I can't keep up. I'm also very bad at understanding other people's code. 

On the other hand, I'm really good at coding problems of the kind we do for job interviews. I also loved my Algorithm and Discrete Mathematics courses, and I really liked the data science project I did for my Probability and Statistics course. In fact, I found an really nice internship for this summer in data science and I'm very excited about it. 

But other than that, I hate my day-to-day school life. I feel like a handicap for my project partners and I can't stand it anymore.  

I need to know if, on the job market, my day-to-day working life will be the same or if there are positions that suit better profiles like mine.

I know I'm a smart person, and I don't want to waste my talent in a field that doesn't suit me.

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

He doesn't even say ""i love you"" back and doesn't give me the reassurance that I've communicated with him that I need, like cuddling and maybe a good morning/good night text once in a while to show that he thinks about me.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

Please give me some advice. I don't want to spiral

Well, tomorrow is the first day where we’ll work again together. I was unable to attend the service, but others said it’s a nice gesture to send a card? Do I do this tomorrow? Do I give her a hug or something similar, or do I pretend to ignore it to avoid her from thinking about it?

I am currently enrolled in PhD program in computer engineering (top 12 public, 20 or so overall) and I am trying to transition from working in the O&amp;G industry (my bachelor's are in chemical engineering and physics from UT-Austin). Lately, I've have doubts about being able to get a job and position  as I wasn't able to get an internship for this summer even though right now I have a 4.0 from my first two classes I've taken so far.  I think I'm most worried about my age (30s), as I haven't worked in about 4 years, I ended up doing two other masters (in Petroleum Engineering and International Affairs, kinda useless in retrospect) before starting this program.

So I hope to get some perspective and maybe I am wondering if it is best to transition to one of the online masters CS programs for a career in cs, or my main interest computer architecture. And what are employer's looking for? contract experience? GPA? coding skills? research?

Is it still even possible to get an internship for the summer?"

My GPA is 2.70. The year and a half before i chose MechE, I was lost and to make things worse I was slacking off big time.  I went into college for a degree in social science (i.e. poli.sci., sociology) and did really bad. Then, I came to a realization that I always enjoyed creating, fixing, and building, so I switched to MechE. I struggled the first semester of MechE but on my second semester I took intro to CAD , joined ASME (participated in the SDC and helped design, manufacture and test our robot from scratch), and took a conventional machining workshop (that teaches you basic machining and gd&amp;t). I absolutely fell in love with the major and the possibilities of what I can do. This is all great, however, I got a big wake up call when I went to my school's job/internship fair and spoke to a bunch of companies about internships. They all liked that I'm doing all these cool things but they told me that the industry is very cut throat and that they couldn't even consider my application unless I was over a 3.0. Now me being in my 3rd year I have around 75 units under my belt and the only class I would be able to redo to replace a grade is Chem101. But even that only would bring my gpa to a 2.8. I noticed that doing good in the next year or so would help me go above a 3.0 (by the time I'm a junior in MechE) but by then I feel like it would be too late for my first internship. I feel like it would be better if I just leave the university and start fresh at a community college and really do good and possibly transfer out to a better school (i.e. Berkeley, UCLA) I know that I'm capable of doing great I've just never had a sense of direction of where to go. I asked one of my professors who has decades of diverse experience in the industry (from manufacturing to aerospace) and they said that if they were in my position they would restart if it was possible. I'm planning to talk to more professors and counselors about my plan of restarting college but I also wanted to see what other students (and hopefully some professionals in the industry) think about this plan. 
(I'm new to reddit and didn't know what sub to put it in so hopefully this was the right choice, but I'm always open to any recommendations/help for me to find the answer to my question!)

TL;DR 
Its my 3rd year in college and I really messed up my gpa before i went MechE (3 semesters in) and even though I'm active in clubs and orgs. companies weed out my application because of gpa. Since I'm still relatively fresh into the MechE major, my plan is to just leave college (in a properly manner) and restart my college career at a CC and transfer to a better school.

fdsxrh,52,2020-03-05,Need Advice : War of Independence against parents. Does it ever end ? How to make a peaceful settlement ?,AxeAxeAxe1,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fdsxrh/need_advice_war_of_independence_against_parents/,"I am a 25 year old socially awkward man and I think my parents are to blame for it.
I am gonna tell my story and some of the elements may relate to you but don't try to forcefully relate to everything as our mind is quite easily fooled to do so. Also i'm not trying to generalize Indian parents or have any beef against them as i have no authority to judge any parent (as  I've not been one yet and know nothing about  raising a kid). I simply just want to tell you my story and want some advice from any older people (25+) here and also i would like the younger ppl here just to read rather than giving any advice or any conclusion.

Till 18 (before going to college)

From school time my parents have restricted me and my siblings to go out of the house for any kind of activity be it leisure or work. They've tried to do as much they can for us themselves. This was ok and acceptable when we were young but with time as we grew older we thought that we will be taught these things (the why we thought so was because almost every friend around us could do certain things (like going out to buy stuff or hanging out with friends or going out of the house after dark, etc.) without having to rely on their parents, which is a slow start to an eventual low self esteem). The really annoying part is when they start blaming you for not being able to do basic things on your own.
I've not been able to talk properly to any girl during my school time because of lack of social skills which is something i would also blame our school systems too (Can't say this for every school but i've been to a good school in my area and the generally it'll be considered a punishment to sit with someone of the opposite sex, god knows why). The thing i don't understand is why most ppl consider being around and being attractive to the opposite sex is a luxury and will call you a crybaby if this aspect of your life hurts you and ask you to man up and have the guts to go and talk, made it like a contest or a battle to overcome. I would be lying to you if i say i don't have any sexual urges and ""am strictly in for the friendship"" but it is something i can't avoid and when you've not talked to a member of the opposite sex  (other than members of your own family) and with all the cancerous sex culture around men and women being thrown on your face through advertisements and movies without  any proper control i find it really hard not to have those urges. And on top of that parents, who would ask me to think of every girl as my sister and try to keep distance and not talk more than is necessary, which is ok if it's just said 1 or 2 times but when it's incepted in your head during your early years of childhood why wouldn't it stay (also stuff like this hurts a person who overthinks (overthinking developed due to social awkwardness but transports to every aspect of life. a cancer indeed) because of the incest nature of talking to a non family member of the opposite sex)

But everything will be okay because you are about to go to college now, become independent and have fun for these 4 to 5 years of your life, right? Wrong. It's basically your indian bar mitzvah. For now you and you alone shall be blamed for your mistakes even though they might be happening due to a behavior and shortcomings you developed because of a bad upbringing and being forced to do something you never really wanted to do in the first place. So much for Independence.

18-22 (The good days of anyone's life) Pseudo Independence

Not gonna deny college was super fun but not because it added anything new to it but because i was able to see how good it feels to be physically alone for the first time and how important friends are. (Still no girlfriend though) College isn't really fun if you don't know what career you want to go for, because if after 4 years you don't have a job or haven't any idea for what kind of job you want you are just fucked. I tried a lot of things in college and succeeded in doing one but my parents weren't happy with it, so i had to drop it and do something which satisfied them and also aligned partially with my goals but they again declined it because all they want is one thing, a three letter job (needless to say more). Apart from this i really thought i'll get the long awaiting independence to go out of the house now that i'm a college student and a legal adult but hell no. In 8 holidays (4 winter and 4 summer) i haven't been allowed to go out of the house unless it was for intern or for some work just like it was in school. I have not been allowed to go meet a friend ever. Not that i don't have any money or my expenditure is quite high, it's just some orthodox thinking. It just sucks being trapped in 4 walls. The psyche stays when you move out too. I've had trouble taking initiatives to go out of my room because it has been so well inculcated in my head. I feel scared sometimes to go out alone and without permission. I was fortunate to have friends with whom i spent most of my time with. Plus weed helped with making more new friends. And fuck you anyone weed didn't make you any friends, it was yourself, it really wasn't. No one would even talk to me before i started smoking. It really helps you get into some circles quite easily unless you;ve this amazing personality which is not so easy to come by when you've an upbringing which is well fit to make you socially awkward. Also weed and alcohol relaxes you and opens you up to speak your mind (i wish i can do that sober but i simply can't thanks parents for this wonderful disadvantage). Talking about women, nothing here again simply because women have a lot of choices compared to men and why wouldn't a woman chose someone who is charming + nice as compared to just nice. Being nice is not going to take you anywhere, it's a competition really if the sex ratio is this fucked up. Why would any girl who is maintaining herself well go for someone who is nice but is socially awkward when there are 10+ others who are more than what you are. and before any girl says stop generalizing us, i'd like to point out it'd be the same with men had they been in minority. It's a simple numbers game nothing crazy here. The only blame i have is on parents for not allowing me to develop. But this creates another big question wouldn't there always be someone above or below you and wouldn't you always be below  someone which might lead you to never be happy? i guess i just want to find an environment where i'm a little better or be able to develop myself to enter environment higher is social hierarchy and dominance.

22-25 (The real Independence)

Now that i've got a job, life should be fine i guess. I'll go out and no one is going to bother me for at least a year. I'll make new friends maybe a girlfriend. I'll try to be sober and look after my health. I'll learn a new skill. I'll meet so many people. I'll earn and spend money on things that i'd have to take permission before. I'd not have to take permission for anything. I'd be free. 
If only that actually happened. 
Even after wasting 4 years i managed to get a job and even with all the mental health issues i had i was able to forget it all and start afresh. I was genuinely happy for the first time in my life. But i think my parents couldn't see that. They forced me to go for this biggest scam in our country : Govt. Job is Power and with this power you can be anything; which should actually have been Knowledge is Power but who has time for knowledge right, Knowledge is for losers. Only the knowledge that gives power and uppar ka paisa is useful. I believed them and again like a fool kept aside my needs to fulfill their dreams disguised to me as my dreams. I eventually failed four times (once in college at 22, then at 23,24 and now at 25) because i didn't want this. Not that the exam is difficult (it's really not) but i just can;t  get myself to sit and study with all the mental pressure and no one to listen. This is the first time i'm using internet to vent. Last i did was in college but the concerned people were so quick to call me as just stresses without even giving a thought to anything that might have caused it to be this way. I'm stuck now. I am looking for jobs now but I've no self confidence left in me. Literally nothing. I was really good at interviews and talking to people (because of college) but being in 4 walls rarely going out and not having a single ounce of pleasure for the last 3 years i'm just frustrated now. I tried strangling myself to death but the defense mechanism kicks in and always stops me because i know of stories and people in my life who are still surviving even after suffering 50x more than me. I'm just scared i don't live a few more years just to be more miserable and frustrated. i don't know if i'll be able to make friends now and being able to have any intimate relationship feels like a nightmare. i'm losing my health every day. I don't know if i'm depressed but the symptoms all check out so maybe. I can't go to a therapist because my parents wouldn't understand it and might think some kind of spirit has taken over me. i think i'll be able to get a job in a few days what i'm scared of is what happens afterwards. My insecurities will still be there. Insecurities which would've been eradicated had i gone for that job but might never go now. also it gives me this weird kind of pain in my stomach just thinking about going back to square one, looking for the job that i rejected, it just hurts.

P.S. sorry for the grammatical errors and typos. i'm literally crying typing this. sorry. thanks for hearing me out.
P.P.S. i'd like to clarify that my parents are not monsters, they love me and have never abused me physically but they are just naive when it comes to parenting and really put no thought sometimes in the things they are saying to their children and how their actions have affected us. They just think that the job of a parent is to earn for their kids and keep feeding them and eventually they will get a job and help them when they get old. that's it. all with the hope to keep their kids as close as possible.

fdszxh,6,2020-03-05,What are some deeply fulfilling side hustles?,AfraidReality,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fdszxh/what_are_some_deeply_fulfilling_side_hustles/,"Hi friends,

I work as a longshoreman - for those that don't know, we load and unload commercial vessels like cargo ships, and here in the USA we are protected by among the best unions in the country. Good wages, great benefits, awesome flexibility. I started three years ago, and I love the job and plan to do it for the next 30 years until I hit full retirement age. My father was also a longshoreman, and he got my foot in the door before he retired - thanks dad!

OK so here's the weird part. Previous to this, I graduated with honors from a great university, interned on Wall Street, and pursued a career in finance that lasted just under a decade. I was a derivatives trader, earned my CFA, hopped jobs a couple times, and then started an investment company with some coworkers that failed in a hilarious and just barely profitable manner. The end result of it all for me was complete and total burnout, and lingering guilt for having participated so eagerly in a system that I have always had real misgivings about. Now my only involvement in anything financial is volunteering at my credit union, which takes like 3 hours a month.

Anyway, long story short, operating machinery is great and I love it, but I need some more mental stimulation. Also, I would like to maintain a few marketable skills, because if my union gets busted some time in the next three decades, I will need to make a living somehow. Finally, I want to make the world better - how could I make the biggest impact while maintaining a primary job? I care about the environment, unions, and other lefty stuff.

I have a fair amount of resources to dedicate to this side hustle. Lots of time - I could consistently put 20-30 hours a week into this project, but with a flexible schedule. My work depends on cargo traffic, so it comes and goes, often on weekends, sometimes at night. Let's say I could invest $100k on this before going into debt or touching retirement money, which I'd rather not.

Preliminary ideas:

* Law school? I think I'd love the brain workout. But it's probably not realistic to be a part-time attorney, could one ever make back the &gt;$100k price tag? It would be real tough to swing an internship or clerkship + my day job. But perhaps ultimately it could be a tool to be a more effective advocate for stuff I believe in?
* Because I know Reddit will say it - learn to code? This could maybe be fun and definitely be something I could learn for free on my own schedule - but what's the end goal? I have done a bunch of vba and a little python over the years, but never created anything I am really proud of let alone something that I could sell...
* My wife and I are building a house next year. I am very lightly considering acting as the GC for the project. I think it could be a fun challenge but also an enormous risk as my wife points out, lol. Best case scenario it would save us $50k, which would make this option the most immediately profitable use of my time.
* Local politics/organizing? I have volunteered for campaigns over the years, and enjoyed it. But I don't know how to make an income in this arena, at all.
* I could always just work as much as possible, stack some more cash, and wait for an opportunity or inspiration to strike. However, my heart wants to do something more immediately.

Anyway, I would love to hear your good ideas or any feedback at all. Much appreciated."

I am at a loss, and this is partially because of my add. 

But mostly. my life is not going the way I want it to go...   
There are a lot of events that have occured in the last 6 months that have wrecked me and I feel broken inside.

  
First off all about a year ago, as the stupid kid I was and still am, I decided to move in with my girlfriend at the age of 18.  


This seemed like a great idea at the time, because our relationship felt very strong and I also chose to persue my education further away from where I currently lived because I felt all the schools near me weren't a good fit.

I though ""Well, if i'm going to have to change schools. and I have to do it far away. It might aswell be near my girlfriend.""   
My then girfriends mother offerd to let me stay at their place, and being broke and desprerate, I gladly agreed.

Fast forward about a year, The relationship has turned sour, I have cut off a lot of ties with friends because my girlfriend was very clingy and manipulative (I was only to blind to see it) I was doing bad in school because of some mental problems and my constant worry that the relationship will fall apart. 

which would mean that 1. I have to move back in with my parents who live about an hour and a half away from my school. 2. I will lose the only person I can comfortably discuss my problems with 3. I will have to rebuild/pick up my old life again.  


So the breakup happend, and I moved back in with my parents.

This is where things start to finally become a little better again, but for this very reason the bad things that will come after hit almost twice as hard.

I reconnected with my friends, we started to go to a lot of parties/festivals and we started to hang out almost on a daily basis. This was great for my mental health and welbeing.

things were finally starting to look good for me again! but this would not last... why?

because my parents had decided. ""Hey, let's go buy a house 2 hours away from where all your friends currently live.""   


so that's what happend. I moved...again...

I went through: breakup and move, reconnecting with friends and improving mental health, to, move and lose close contant with friends.

this all happened in the span of about 6 months.

And that's what brings us to today!

  
I am currently doing an internship for school where there are no people my age.

then, I go home and play video games or watch tv by myself.

go to sleep. and repeat this process. Pretty much the only social contact I have is with my family, but even that is quite limited and is frankly not the same as contact with friends.  


I am very socially awkward and find it difficult to make new friends this is partially because of the fear of commitment I have developed because of me losing my girfriend and having to move my whole life around so much so quickly.  


So I ask for your help ADHD community, what should I do? I want to change my life around for the better but I dont know how.

This community is one of the few things that gives me a little bit of joy in my life atm. and I always enjoy reading people being kind to people here.

thanks for reading this long ass post and I hope you have a wonderfull day!"

My boss and i are pretty much the only 2 people in the company at the moment. My boss travels all around the country, so he is barely here (except for Friday every 2 weeks). Since about 9 or 10 months ago i started to notice myself slacking, feeling unmotivated and irritated with being alone. Wich slowly turned into feeling depressed asf while at work.

I had an intern to keep me company for about 6 months, but since he had to go back to school im all alone again for 8/9 hours a day. And im only getting less and less motivated everyday. Wich is really messing with my head. 
I don't want to slack and do nothing at work, i want to feel useful. But i just cannot seem to push myself to even get out of bed in time anymore.

I really don't know what to do about this feeling. Quitting ain't an option, since i am very dependant on this job. 

Does anyone have any past experience with this? Help or advice would be greatly appreciated."

fdz96c,14,2020-03-05,PLEASE HELP!,dontMindMyUsernameD,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/fdz96c/please_help/,"Hi! 

So on Feb 13 I did an interview (it was me and about 6 other managers over a video call), I then did another interview with the same company right after with one person (over video call as well).  Personally, I know the interview went really bad. I emailed them with a thank you note and the one that interviewed me 1on1, responded back really nicely but said I got rejected. 

On Feb 24, the manager I did a 1on1 interview with emailed me saying they actually want me to join their team. They really liked my passion. He told me that I will get a verbal offer that day. 

Later that day (Feb 24), the recruiter (someone that I connected with), called me with a verbal offer. It was a legit offer. It wasn’t just a “yeah yeah you got the job”. It was “your pay is XYZ, your manager is XYZ, your benefits are XYZ, your vacation days are XYZ, your location is XYZ., etc. Do you accept this verbal offer?” When I said yes she told me that she would send me a written offer in 2-3 days. 

Exactly one week later (March 2), I emailed my recruiter with a follow up email saying that I haven’t received a written offer yet. (Since she did say she’ll send it in 2-3 days). 

Today is March 5 (so the fourth business day) and I still have NOT received any information yet. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m kind of worried. 

Ps-this is a pretty big company. It’ll also be my first internship. 

EDIT: (March 13, 2020) I decided to email my potential manager instead of my recruiter, and he replied back very fast (6 mins)! He said that they still definitely want me on their team and that he’s sorry it’s taking so long. He said that because of the CoVID-19/Coronavirus, HR is working differently now since many people are “working from home”. He said he’ll definitely chase HR down on Monday and update me! 

EDIT2: (March 17, 2020) I GOT THE WRITTEN OFFER OMG YESSS!!

Tl;dr: I got a legit verbal offer but haven’t received written offer. I emailed them and got not response back. It’s a pretty big company."

There may be a few errors in this because I’ve typed it up on my phone, sorry in advance.

I’m looking for advice on my career, as I’ve recently graduated in May of 2019. I graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science. 

The way I got into technology is due to my high school which taught me the fundamentals of A+ and CCNA (I was never able to take the exam), which is how I got my internships. For A+ I was able to take apart computers and put them together, and for CCNA I mostly worked in Cisco Packet Tracer through NetAcad. My internships mostly revolved around Helpdesk, which is a total of about 8 months of experience since I only worked during the summer. 

I am currently a Junior IT Engineer, which mainly revolves around maintaining servers within our data center. The problem is I know I’ve done a huge jump between helpdesk and being on the server team. I would like to bridge the gap.

I feel I am lacking in other aspects since I wasn’t able to start from the beginning. I would like to become more well rounded and educate myself more on the server side. I would like to know what you all recommend for me to do in my free time to make up for it.

My second question is about networking (which this may be the wrong sub) I’ve been interested in getting my CCNA. I’m aware they are updating their exam but I keep getting told that software networking is the new big thing. How would I learn more about it to decide if that’s the route I would prefer?

My last question is if it’s worth it to get a Masters, and if I do which should I get? 

I know my post my seem all over the place but any help will be greatly appreciated :)"

I have a background in STEM, fucked that up and I realised I may not be smart for it. I've always been a creative individual having been involved in films, acting, production all that jazz.

Recently been focusing on trying to enter the media industry, but life,bills  and the struggle of living in London is slapping me and making me think that I might just be chasing a pipe dream, and I may be doing it just because ""it's cool"" and if extremely successful, I'll get the recognition and attention that I lacked when I was younger

I've been learning coding for some time, but only starting to take it a bit more seriously as a new years resolution. I dont have a computer science background, and I practice classes and tutorials maybe a couple of times a week but obviously its hard to get a job in this field without having anything amazing as a portfolio, and i'm worried that i am not simply good at it. although i am trying

So I am juggling two things at once

\- Starting a media internship in a few weeks time (excited, but not that excited)  
\-Learning code simultaneously in my spare time to hopefully get somewhere  
\- Finish my degree (i wont get anywhere with this)

How do i stay motivated on one path? i always constantly flip and choose. at one point last year I bought a camera, got really into photography and though I might become a freelance photographer. I have barely touched the camera since I bought it. 

*I have ADD and dyspraxia btw, so this might be the reason I act this way*"

I am looking for an internship right now and have thankfully received a few offers. Last week I received a verbal offer from Company A and a written Letter of Intent from Company B about hiring me. Both positions are 16 month (paid) internship terms. After talking with my Co-op Manager I decided to turn down Company A as Company B was more closely aligned with my career goals.

A week later to now, I haven't heard anything back from Company B, they're a large company so I imagine they have a long hiring process. I recently received another offer from Company C for a 4 month term in a position that interests me as well. They gave me a deadline for this Friday to accept. I think I still like Company B better as it is more aligned to my goals and I think I can get a return offer afterwards, however I haven't heard anything back and am kinda getting worried despite the Letter of Intent as I don't know any other details about the offer.

The 4 month term will allow me to do more Co-op terms in the future as it is shorter and explore more opportunities which is interesting to me.

At this point if I don't hear anything back by Friday I'm between turning down Company C and waiting for Company B or maybe accepting Company C and seeing what happens afterwards.

If anyone has and advice or thoughts it would be great to hear them."

Feeling knowledge is a mile wide but an inch deep.,cablequotes,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/fe0i8u/former_webhosting_guy_wanting_to_get_into_devops/,"HI folks. I have been doing data center technician work for several years and am looking to switch back to a Linux oriented job, more specifically devops. I originally was a network engineer for a major telecom after going through a ccna internship. I used that experience to get work at a small webhosting company several years ago and was trained to basically run it for the owner. It was a very simple and easy to manage and never got to expand knowledge past basic wp/ static site hosting (apache,bind9,postfix,etc..). After that I worked as a jr devops engineer for about two months before being fired for essentially not being able to keep up. I felt discouraged and went back to basically plugging stuff in for various datacenters for about 3 years. 

I am at a point where I recognize my lacking skills but have immense ability to improve. I am unemployed currently and would like to do something in the next 2 months to get me on track to have a solid career in devops/ system engineering. I have considered going back to school for CS but am not prepared to do 4-5 years while working fulltime.

 I am considering the LPIC path which I think I could at the very least knock out LPIC1 in the next 3 months. Then get a devops specific cert. 

Does this sound like a good plan? Can I land a job with an LPIC and limited experience from several years ago, within the year? Would it be better to just brush up on linux learn python and go straight for a devops cert?

TLDR; Can I get a job with one or two of these certs? Should I just go for a devops cert right away?

I am a student and currently having a 4-month internship and will probably have a second internship next fall. 

I didn’t provide a TD1 form when I started my current internship so I’m trying to do that right now and thinking of doing the following:

Let’s say the basic personal amount is $13000 and my tuition fees this year are $6000 and my salary with no taxes deducted (except CCP and EI) is $13000/internship and I’m not yet sure of the tuition carried forward from last year (should be around $11000). 

As I don’t really whether I’m getting a second internship or not, I thought I’d:
- check the “Total income less than claimed amount” box when filling out the TD1 form for my current internship ($13000&lt;$19000)
- if I get a second internship, in my new TD1, I will not check that box, but keep everything else the same, however, I’ll provide a T1213 form to benefit from the tuition fees carried forward from previous years (so shouldn’t pay taxes at all as well)

Is this the correct thing to do?

I'll be honest and say that I am very nervous about starting this new job. This is my first actual job within the IT field and I didn't have any kind of internships throughout my education. I feel like I have a pretty broad knowledge of a lot of different IT concepts, but on a very surface level. For example, I could give you the dictionary definition of DHCP or DNS or what the active directory is, but I feel like I don't have a lot of actual hands-on knowledge with these topics. I guess I just feel kind of in over my head at this point. 

At the same time I am extremely grateful and excited for this opportunity and excited to learn and develop my IT skills. So my question is if this is a normal feeling at this point in my career? I've been brushing up on different IT skills at home and trying to absorb as much knowledge on my own time as I can now that I'm finished up with school. If anybody has any wisdom or words of advice to share, it would be greatly appreciated."

I'm a a noob to computer science; switched to the major not too long ago and have honestly struggled through the classes but will manage to finish my degree soon.

In my experience, the way that they taught the classes and concepts were all in different coding languages- every semester we learned a new language, from C to C++ to OCaml to Java and so on. I feel like I was just trying to cram and keep up with classes, which caused me to lack the depth in each language since I was just trying to pass the classes (stacking like 4 CS classes each semester) so I could graduate on time. The lack of depth hits hard when I'm faced with simple tasks like creating a simple program to do \_\_\_ or coding challenges that are open ended.

All the projects that I've done is through my classes- no internship, no side projects- and the projects that I've done have mostly been really small ones with a lot of help and backbone code provided to the students. The projects also lacked application to the real world and were simply stuff that taught us like algorithms and operating system concepts.

I want to start doing side projects and honestly have no idea where to start! I only have experience with the basic computer science concepts and don't know much about JavaScript or web programming, which I wish my school offered as part of my track. The other part that is annoying is that my school taught the classes on their computers with all the proper libraries and tools installed. I want to be able to create my own project on my own device (Mac) and to be able to create a project that users can interact with and run, and don't even know where to begin.

Does anyone have tips for how to start a small project? What languages are useful for doing web programming? What are good places to host the project and be able to see the results?

Any tips would be great!! I'm a such a noob in this industry and I feel like I am lacking compared with everyone else."

However, I'm going into my last coop before graduation and if I do rearrange and take Twitch, I'll be skipping my last round of interviewing through my school's internal job board and the chance to interview for some really good companies (my school's job board basically guarantees a job match).

I'm working at a Big N this term and would like to shoot for the top of the top.

That said, how is Twitch to work for? How is the experience, opportunities and reputation etc.?

Their Glassdoor rating seems kind of low (3.4) and I've heard they've recently undergone a lot of restructuring due to employees leaving and rehiring, but I feel that I vibed pretty well with my interviewers.

I want to ensure that I have everything ready for when I start to search for a job during my senior year, and if not, at least I have a few more months to prepare. I feel like I have everything I ""should"" have before the senior year job hunt, but I'm afraid if I'm missing anything.

I've prepared a pretty good resume that has been reviewed a couple times by professors and career services. Currently I have the following:

1. 3.9X GPA (it might or might not take a slight hit for the upcoming semesters depending on how hard the classes are but I'll be absolutely sure not to let it dip below 3.7)
2. 2 years of research and laboratory experience, currently transitioning into independent study which is admittedly a bit scary
3. 3 clubs: Chem-E-Car, Engineers Without Borders which I held a leadership position in, and an eSports Club (yeah last one is weird but surprisingly interviewers always seem curious about it?)
4. Tech summer job teaching kids, and a similar tutoring volunteer program during the school year
5. And an upcoming internship for the summer in a small biotech company

An odd thing I recently heard from a classmate is that a 3.9+ GPA is a turnoff for engineering companies, and a few agreed with him; his reasoning was that at best it isn't worth it, and at worst it often meant the person was too focused on academics and would be arrogant, elitist type people. I'm not sure how much truth there is to their statement, but I really hope my grades are not indicative of my personality traits.

I suppose internships might be where I fall flat, but I wasn't lucky sophomore year. I'd feel bad if I got pretty good stuff but the only reason I get rejected from a job solely is because I didn't intern enough. This year I sent out 150 applications- 12 interviews and 2 offers so it worked out in the end. Some of those interviews were digital, some in-person, some prerecorded (ugh). A few second-rounds. Is there anything extra I should prepare for permanent-job-interviews, ie. if there's any difference between those an internship interviews?  Should I consider taking an extra semester just to have another summer for another internship?

Lastly, I want to make sure that my career is heading on the right track. I've been polishing up my LinkedIn account and connecting to HR people from career fairs. I've messaged some once or so every 2-3 months, enough to make them \*maybe\* remember me and not enough to annoy them. How should I utilize my LinkedIn most effectively when I'm not actively looking for a job, or in the timeframe right before job postings start popping up?

All in all, is there anything missing that I should definitely try and patch up, or other things I should add to strengthen my resume or skills before I dive into the job hunt?  


TLDR: Chemical engineering junior, wondering what things to check off the list before diving into the senior year job hunt. High GPA (heard from classmates that a ""too high"" GPA indicative of a snobby bookworm so I'm worried), research and clubs, a job, volunteering, one upcoming internship. Take an extra year for an extra internship? Any specific interview skills? How to use LinkedIn effectively right before I start looking for a job?"

- What should i be doing ? I used to like computer science when it was taught with lots of simplification and abstraction (in the school level). Now i know there are a 100+ research areas/work areas/branches in it, and i am an average in all of them.

I like most of them more or less, and won't mind giving away my years of life working/learning them. But for what and why?

-- Money? From what i know, Every tech profile turns into a decent salary after a certain time. This means i can ride any boat i want. So which one in particular?

-- Passion/interest? Now what exactly is this? As i said everything feels doable, given enough time to get a hang of it. Plus as an engineer, should we be flexible with all the technologies to create a useful product?

-- Fame? Its rare the developes, testers or other individuals in computer science ever gets a solo credit. Most of the time its either the ceos, the researchers or the company itself. So i guess getting a fame is equal to making your neighbors jealous by flaunting your cash for most people

-- Happy life? I think this point is affected by a lot of other factors. Would come back to this later.

Everyday in my feed, there are people showing 6, 7 sometimes even 8 figure salaries. Other people would get inspired with those, but i feel very weird about these.

I never see myself earning those, i don't know why. Why would someone give me those huge amounts? If anything , i would be just a part of a big team of people working together to make a product.
How do you find yourself deserving for that big ton money? At what point you hit that realisation? Here is a small story :

I did an Android dev course around 2.5 years ago. There was a guy there an year older than me. He was very bad in this, i tell you. Most of the time, i was explaining the concepts to him after class.so last year he graduated, and took a job, We both used to expect a decent salary amount, say x (with me having a little ego that i expect certainly more than him, say x+20% ), but he took a job for half that number , say x/2.

After 1 increment and 1 job shift in 1.5 years, he has now successfully achieved package greater than x. I on the other hand, being still at college and with a lot of (very discouraging )internship experiences now feel that i won't be getting even x/3 at my start no matter what.

- There is also this thing about people going into more of a management and other non tech roles once they start growing in this field. Why? What did they realized? I am sure not everyone of them would have hit this realization that tech is not what they want to do (which i can't understand why). Maybe its the money and/or happy life expectations?

i have started to feel dumb for not being able to think innovative new ideas and being an average mind . And about the happy life, so far its not much happiness for me, and am confused.

I am grateful about the usual things i have (healthy middle class parents, working body, roof , food,etc) , unhappy about the things i don't and see with others (more money, materialistic assets, confidence, siblings, social life, love life, etc) and that's it.

From what i understood of 21 years on this earth is that everyone is running to achieve that list of their desires and wants to move them from todo to done, like trello task. If you can't then keep fighting to achieve or grudgingly accept the fact that you couldn't and be happy about it.

So is that it? That's  happy life goals?"

I had internships beforehand (one being with my current employer) but now I feel like that was so long ago that the stuff I was working on doesn't have much application today.

I've kind of become a """"swiss army knife"" developer for our company and I feel like I have a lot of good things to talk about and a good breadth of experience but not sure how to build a resume for it all being at the same company/position.

&amp;#x200B;

**Major concern:** To put it plainly, I don't think our small team of developers follows best practices... or even good practices for some things. Me and one of the other guys have been making a push to become more professional as a group but I know that following ""best practices"" is an area I need to and want to growth in.  Because of this I feel unqualified for jobs at other companies and have talked myself out of looking for a job before. If you were searching for an employee, how much of a red flag is that and what suggestions would you have?

fe6zuy,2,2020-03-05,Why do job interviews make me feel bad about myself?,PlumPosie,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fe6zuy/why_do_job_interviews_make_me_feel_bad_about/,"I'm actively searching for a job after my past employer was unable to pay me on time. Since Jan. 6, I have applied to and interviewed for four roles in my preferred field. After two of the interviews, I have felt badly about myself and my achievements.

The first time was when the interviewer was unprepared to talk with me. He didn't have my resume, hadn't reviewed the job description and was in a rush to have me leave the office.  After the interview ended after 20 minutes, I left dejected and decided to withdraw from consideration.  I considered his lack of adequate prep a bridge too far in unprofessional behavior.

The second incident occurred this evening.  Late this afternoon, I met with a VP and a CEO to discuss a newly created role that covered responsibilities in three area.  I fully expected and planned for the interview to focus on my professional achievements in the past three years. Instead, I had to answer an array of questions pertaining to my college days. Then, I had to discuss every position I've had in my adult life, including a college-sponsored internship. 

Toward the end of the discussion, the CEO noted my frequent job changes, which are tied to economic issues in the industries. I explained this, and she seemed to understand. However, her comment made me feel bad, especially given that I'd addressed the issue in depth during a 40-minute phone screening two weeks earlier. 

Once I completed the four required skills test, I spoke candidly with the direct supervisor who led both the phone and in-person interviews. I asked her what skills I should develop, and she could not honestly answer me. She just noted that being at one thing was sufficient.

I weighed the pros and cons of the position and ultimately decided the clients, the commute and the weird obsession with the college-age version of me made the thought of working for these people unappealing.  Therefore, I withdrew my application in an email thanking them for their time. 

So, can you tell me what, if anything, I can do to have a better job interview experience? Is having weird interviews where you fail to connect with your interviewers just part of the journey? 

I would appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks!"

But there's another part of me saying that I should try to work for a start up (which is something I've never done) or something else to see what else is out there.

Personally, I don't feel like I'm as technically strong as my friends who are in these Big 5 companies.

I don't really know how to say this, but like if you refer CS majors as tech people, then I'm definitely not 'tech' at all. 
I mean I'm doing okay with my classes, maintaining a 4.0. I am doing an internship w/ big N this summer. But I really feel like I don't know anything about this major. 
I chose CS bc I was doing some competitive programming in high school, and I totally loved it. I still love it now. I could spend hours coding. But I'm not passionate about any other stuff in CS. 
While my friends are trying to fix and build their computer, I can't even tell which computer is good by looking at its RAM info and stuff. My friends are passionate abt making websites or going to hackathons, I just don't feel like I really want to do it although I know that its a must know in this major. 
I go to a liberal arts school, and I always find myself enjoy general education or math classes than my major class like computer architecture or oop. 
I feel like I got that internship bc I'm good at solving problems which was what they interviewed me. I got rejected at another small company when they asked me abt some definitions in oop and I totally forgot what they are. I feel like I'm pretty useless in this field if I only just keep doing competitive programming in C++. But I just don't like doing anything else in CS. Look at my friends, I feel like I don't deserve my offer. 
What should I do to make me more passionate abt this major?

TL, DR: the only thing in CS I ever want to do is solving problems."

Since December 2018, I’ve been in a limbo of uncertainty, doubt, self-consciousness, and a plethora more. I graduated with a Masters in Clinical Dietetics that December. I was an overworked mess. I went from working 10 hours a day at an internship I had to pay for (Fucking dietetics), 2 hours a day driving, 16 credits, conducting my own research, writing a thesis, etc. I was isolated, alone, depressed, stressed, and unsure of the future. I drowned out my next few weeks playing overwatch in my basement, decompressing, before starting to study for the Registered Dietitians exam.

In mid-January 2019, my cat, Macklin, developed idiopathic cystitis. It was midnight when I brought him to the emergency vet and forked $800 to unblock him via a urinary catheter. I was a scared and anxious mess crying about all of these overwhelming feelings piling up. I called my sister and just balled to her for 2 hours.

About 2 weeks later my boy had another incident where he had to stay at the hospital overnight, costing me $2,200. Within 3 weeks my entire post-grad savings were gone. Throughout this time I had been dealing with massive bouts of depression, unworthiness, unable and feelings of Imposter Syndrome. At the beginning of March 2019, I was fortunate enough to go stay in Florida with my brother, his fiancee, and my older sister for a weekend. This is where I started to tell my family about some of the troubles I’ve been experiencing.

When I came home from Florida, I moved in with my dad as he just had a major shoulder reconstruction and needed help around the house. A few days later I took my RD exam and…. failed. Over the course of the next few months, I continued to study, search and apply for jobs. Since I didn’t have money, I didn’t go out or have any sort of social life as I literally could not afford it. Any money I did have was spent on weed as I was self-medicating. I was on dating apps, hooking up with random women. I was drinking most nights out of the week thanks to an alcoholic father. Days turned into weeks, everything was a blur, I wasn’t sleeping, I was always alone, anxious, sad.

June 2019 rolled around and I was still jobless, yet actively applying (probably around 90 apps at this point), still studying, still scrounging along. Before I went to camp for a volunteering position I was helping for the American Diabetes Association, I took my second attempt at my exam and….failed, again. Camp was enjoyable but I was still overwhelmingly empty.

Towards the end of August 2019, Macklin had another episode and seemed to be doing better until a few days later when something was off. I brought him to the vet right as they opened as I literally could not afford to go to an emergency vet on Sunday. I went home and received a call from my Vet that he passed away as they were giving him an IV. 2.5 years old and he was gone. I broke down and a piece of me died that day. I never knew I could love something with all my being. I couldn’t help but blame myself for his death. The one thing I was supposed to protect and love. The one entity that understood and accepted me.

At this time, I was pretty fucked up with a pessimistic worldview, among so much more. I also just started therapy around this time after trying to get approved for the previous 6 months. I started working at a front desk job at a gym. A stray cat also found her way to my back door. She was 5-6 weeks old and had no kin around. Inside I knew I could let her stay outside. Yet I was battling with the very recent passing of Macklin. I distanced myself from this kitten as I was still blaming myself for him dying. I didn’t want another innocent life to die under my watch. I couldn’t live with myself.October and November felt like they blended together. I yeeted out of my gym job due to poor management, gross incompetence and negligence, and abusive working conditions. I was still studying and trying to apply for other jobs. I started going to therapy twice a week for 2-hour chunks. I was having so many problems with dating, trying to meet people, or even having a conversation with friends. I was experiencing a perfect storm of issues including body dysmorphia, BED (Binge Eating Disorder), severe depression and anxiety, a newly discovered ADHD diagnosis, childhood traumas, emotional isolation, shit fam, you name it.

My birthday is on Halloween and my pops didn’t say anything to me about it. Didn’t say anything to me on thanksgiving or Christmas either. After these past few months of living with him, I could tell things were getting “odd”. He was recovering well, but he was being distant, inconsistent, non-communicative, kinda like he was ghosting me. It happened before when he kicked me out a few years earlier. I knew something was coming, so I was just trying to pull my weight, keep my head low, and keep on trying to grind.

December was a hell of a month. On the 15th, I took my exam again, and guess what?! I failed….again. A few days before Christmas, my dad blew up on me. I was upstairs studying and I hear my dad downstairs screaming his ass off saying, “You’re one of those millennial leaches, who takes and takes and takes.”, “I don’t fucking want you here, get the fuck out”, blah, blah, blah. I even consulted my step-mom-to-be about it. Literally, while he was screaming at me, I had my phone out and she could hear everything. The worst part is she just justifies and enables his shitty actions. She’ll say things like, ‘you know he loves you”, “He’s just tired”, and other ways of saying it was my fault. So, I packed up my shit and left that night. I went and crashed at my mom's house since she lives in Florida most of the time. She’s also one of the most caring people alive. I’m still here in her house, trying to get out and make my own way.

Christmas Eve was the next time I saw him, because of family dinner. I didn’t say anything to him, but he walked over to me and kissed me on the head like it was an apology or some sort of kind act. My sister in law to be was sitting right next to me and was equally confused as she told me she and my brother saw him crying in his driveway earlier. After Christmas, I started getting return calls and interviews. I had 5 interviews over the phone, Skype, and in-person over the course of 2.5-3 months….for the same position. Spoiler alert: I just found out I didn’t get the job.

January was a big month for my dad. I drove him out to meet her at her place 2 hours away so we could pack up her Uhaul, my car, and her car. Drive back and unload it all into his place. Nothing was discussed about his episode. A week later I drove out to the same location to pick up their wedding cake. We had a blizzard that night. I counted 17 cars in the ditch. Two days later they got married…..for the second time. I was the only one of his kids (younger bro, older sis) to come to his wedding, held at his house. The whole fucking thing was uncomfortable.

While they were on their honeymoon, I went over to my dad’s to drop off the keys I had and he literally disabled the garages, barricaded and rope tied the already locked doors and so on. That was literally to keep me out. I have no idea what I did to warrant something so drastic on his part. So the petty part of me, the side that is learning how not to act, texted my stepmom that I was going to cancel the cell phone plan since I was no longer on the account, but it was still tied to my SS#. This prompted him to drunk call my stepdad and my brother. He told my stepdad that I was living in their house, something I had not yet told them out of fear. He told him that I am a dirty fuck up, blah blah blah. So I sent him a pretty straight forward text about asking him to contact me if he has anything he feels the need to say and he hasn’t responded. I haven’t talked with him since his wedding almost 2 months ago.

My therapist recommended I write a letter to my dad explaining all of the pain I’m feeling over the past 29 years. How he has made me feel in certain situations. I wrote 6 rough drafts before having the courage to put it in his mailbox. It was 7 pages long. I don’t know if he read it, and I don’t care honestly. It was more of a catharsis for me.

Last month I somehow adopted 2 sister kittens from the same people I got Macklin from. Now, I’m watching over 3 kittens! On Feb 25. I took the RD exam for the fourth time and….. I passed. :) My focus now has been primarily on job apps. I really don’t know what more I can do/should do. I have all these lists, idea’s and journals full of things, yet I can't will myself to even start sometimes.

Currently, It’s 5:12am. I don’t really sleep. Since last Thursday, I’ve been in a daze. I think seeing that email decoding that I wasn’t the chosen candidate sucked. Enough to where I went out and bought some weed and ate my life away. I haven’t worked out in months. Overall, things just seem so hopeless. I feel like I’m slipping and every time I reach out to help the hand is rescinded.

I don’t really know what I’m writing about anymore or what even I’m writing for. I just needed to vent.

This is my fourth semester at UNI and I have already **finished Data structures and Algorithms**. I do feel like I understand most of the data structures.

However, I am not able to do Leetcode questions or even the coding test which lead to interviews. This has led to multiple rejections.

**Last interview question That I couldn't answer -** Design a data structure that gets you the last inserted element or can remove the minimum element in constant time. How difficult is it? How long will it take you to do it?

**What do I do? How should I prepare? How to prepare if I have 4 months left until the next internship applications period?**

**EDIT** \- The Question was-  ""Say your data structure has the following data stored:

\[10, 3, 1, 6, 9\] (first -------&gt; Last)

then you should be able to remove out 9 (last) or 1 (min) in constant time. Say you remove  then you should be able to take 9(last) or 3 (now min) in constant time. Total time complexity has to be o(1) which includes insertions or any other adjustments. ""

**EDIT 2-  If everyone is saying it is impossible to do in o(1) , then maybe there must have been misunderstanding the problem on my part.** 

Thanks everyone for you suggestions.

Thanks"

 I had an amazing job at a library which I quit because I had too many things going on at the same time. I regret it so much.

The only person who called back was for an internship and not a job - which I'd be delighted to do of course, but it still doesn't solve my problem. Also some manager said they could hire me, but only in a month. It's never been hard for me to find a job before so I'm wondering what I'm doing ''wrong''.

fegy8a,109,2020-03-06,Advice on leaving PhD,Dear-Box,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/fegy8a/advice_on_leaving_phd/,"Hi all,

I'm coming here for advice about leaving my PhD in history. I've struggled a lot since the start and can't seem to feel good about any of my progress. This is year 3, I'm 30 years old and in a top ivy program. My workload has been significantly larger than most students in my program due to language requirements in addition to the regular courseload.

I thought things would be easier this year as I prepared for comps, but now that I am on the other side of exams I feel like I don't care as much anymore. I prepared for 4 enormous fields and feel like I didn't truly 'learn' anything because of the breakneck pace of preparation. 

Now I see friends failing on the job market, taking postdoc after postdoc, or visiting prof gigs and it is making me think I can't do this.

On top of that, I'm in a wonderful relationship that is now the most important thing in my life. I want to get married, but I am worried that the extreme precarity of PhD life will mean bouncing from temporary gig to temporary gig. I can't do that easily with a partner who also needs employment.

So now I am facing the possibility of defending my prospectus later this semester, taking the MA/MPhil, and looking for a job. But if I don't find something by the start of next academic year I have to take my grant money and go away for 9-12 months of research. I just can't see myself doing that anymore. I've spent so much time away from my partner for summer research and don't want to do that anymore.

Some of my colleagues and family/friends say ""you can't quit, you worked so hard....you are too driven for a normal job."" But I want a normal life, I want leisure time, a stable salary, time for personal growth. I dont see that happening as a precarious PhD. On top of that, because of the subject matter of my PhD, most people I ask career advice of say ""you should work for xyz US govt agency."" Well, If they had done this PhD work, they would likely have serious moral qualms with doing such agency work- not to mention the background checks for someone like me can take over a year.

I feel lost and burnt out right now. It seems that people outside of academia have a caricatured idea of my job skills and I just don't know how to market myself to the professional world. Someone told me I should try to get an internship this summer. That could be fruitful, but feel like I'm too old for that and need employment, not more unpaid experience.

I could use some serious help."

I applied to exactly 200 jobs, and was rejected and ghosted by 198. One of the remaining two ""set up"" a call interview, never called, and never responded to any emails I sent. My 200th application was the only call and interview I had, killed it and got the job. I started three days ago.

The entire process was demoralizing, applying to countless jobs every single day. I had no internship experience because the same thing happened during those applications throughout the years, never got any calls/emails back. I knew this process was going to be difficult, but I didn't think I would be rejected and ignored by so many companies. It got to the point that I was applying to jobs that would pay me significantly less (33.3% less) than the average starting pay in my area, and I was still getting rejected. I had no idea what to do. After seeking advice on reddit and applying constantly, I finally had one company call me back. This job is perfect for me location wise and I'm making the national average pay for the position, and everyone seems to be really helpful and willing to go out of their way to help a colleague.

The point of this is that everything happens for a reason. Keep applying, don't quit. Finding that first job is always the most difficult, but you can definitely do it. It's hard, it's challenging, it's mentally draining, but you can do it. If you were able to get through the rigorous engineering curriculum and deal with professors who don't know what they're doing or just don't care, then you can definitely do this.

I would like to get some advice on getting an entry job at Cybersecurity or how do I start building experience. I've been job hunting for almost a year but none of the jobs that I have applied have even called me for an interview, most jobs ask for 1-3 years of experience, some jobs ask for certifications, like CISM&amp;CISA (ISACA). 

I'm not sure how do I start getting experience, I certified myself in network+, sec+, ISO 27001 internal auditor thinking this could land me a job in an entry position, but experience seems to be a must in this field (which is understandable).

I've only seen once a job as an intern in Cybersecurity but I got denied since they were only looking for students. I think I should try and look for a job in another country, but since I'm not working I don't have a lot of funds to move countries.

I will thank you for any advice I could get."

fekelp,173,2020-03-06,Intern used Google-Fu! It was ineffective..,-King_Slacker,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/fekelp/intern_used_googlefu_it_was_ineffective/,"Hello again from a high school unpaid intern! Today I have a story in which I and $SIT (Student IT) have been losing our minds. 

At my high school, we repair the computers in the school itself. We'll order parts that we need, but we tend to have things we use often lying around. We can often get a computer in and out in a day. However, that doesn't mean that the computer in question isn't happy.

Over the school year, $SIT has gotten a few Chromebooks that he's had frustration trying to repair. The issue isn't necessarily hardware. It's software. 

There are times in which we need to replace a system board. For lack of a better comparison, it's like a Raspberry Pi. After replacement, we get the new board ready. This involves plugging in a shim and letting the software install. After that, there are some tests that are run before the Chromebook can be used again. The trouble comes from a certain test: HWID.

The HWID test stands for HardWare IDentification test. If something isn't happy, the HWID won't be generated and the test will fail. There is one dreaded error that has been giving $SIT a royal headache: the Assertion Error. Long story short, it's that something isn't being recognized. Determining what is what's been causing his suffering. 

I had the misfortune to run into one of these myself. Naturally, I attempted to re-run the test. It had worked on a previous error. Didn't work. $SIT noticed the specific error and gave a tired groan in response. He ran into the same error! He had tried a lot. Different board in the same computer? Same error. Same board in a different computer? No error. Having determined that the error is due to hardware, he replaced things that he thought to be likely. 

Something I should probably note: there is a log that shows while the various tests are run. Issue is, it's not detailed, and the Assertion Error doesn't give detail in that log either. Back to where we were:

He replaced the battery, power button board, the LCD, the wifi adapter, and a few other things. I had the ideas of the wifi antenna in the lid, or the keyboard/touchpad in the upper case. We were getting nowhere. After a few Google-Fu sessions, I was still getting nowhere. I showed $SIT a forum post from the dreaded L manufacturer's site, in which there were convoluted instructions at the bottom. Nope, he already tried that. I then tried the only other thing I could think of: Reddit.

I found an appropriate sub (r/chromeos) and made a post begging for help. After a few hours, a guy responded to my cries. All he needed was the logs. I didn't bother questioning it, I just saved the logs to a flash drive and sent him an email. He responded. He stated where the error likely is. I thanked him. 

Evidently, the saved logs have detail. Who'da thunk it? Having been blessed with new knowledge from the wonderful Redditor, I got to work.

The damned thing is fixed. He is truly a blessing. I cannot thank him enough for what he's done."
fekr8x,4,2020-03-06,I’m exhausted,Wilikus,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/fekr8x/im_exhausted/,"I just started as a new teacher in January only a month after I graduated from university. The middle school that I did my student teaching at called me right after I graduated to offer me a full time position and I couldn’t pass it up. I would be taking over for a 7th grade teacher who was promoted in the district so it seemed like a good situation to take over. 

It all started pretty well and the kids seemed to respond to the transition pretty well. Though as time has gone on, behavior issues have become increasingly worse overall and the students have become very disrespectful not only to me as a teacher but as a person. 

Everything I’ve tried so far to remedy this has just been met with more push back. I’ve been called fat to my face (I mean I’m a little chubby but come on), I asked a girl to sit down and she called me a disability slur, and today to top it off right as one of my students who I’ve never had an issue with was leaving for the weekend I said “have a great weekend” and as he left the room he said “bye! Don’t like you!”.
I know it probably boils down to classroom management. But it seems the tougher I try to get, the worse they respond, and if I’m too lenient they go wild and it’s out of control. I try being nice with them but they try to take advantage so I have to be careful.

I guess I didn’t think it would happen to me like this. I teach more or less the same as my internship, and back then I had a group of 8th graders that I got along with so well and genuinely loved teaching and rarely had issues. I don’t know what to do.

I’m a third year Industrial and Management Engineering student at RPI in Upstate NY, and was interested in potentially going into the data science/consulting industry. IE is a major that can put you in a wide variety of fields, but I was wondering how “viable” it is for an IE to go into data science? I am also going to do my Masters in Applied Math once I’m done with undergrad since it’ll only take a year and my school will allow me to keep my financial aid package during that extra year. Would you say Applied Math would be a good start to a data science career?

I have experience with Excel, Python, R, and MATLAB. I want to learn SQL and will be learning JMP this summer during an internship I have. I’m pretty bad at writing code from scratch as my first experience with coding didn’t come until my second semester of college. But I am decent at modifying code and understanding others code. How important would you say coding is in Data Science? 

My last part will be more about data science in general. Are there any skills/courses you think would be beneficial for me to take? I also really want to get into the airline/transportation industry, so would say that Data Science is common in those industries?

I feel isolated from society...This has been like that for the 6-7 months... This essentially has lead me to start smoking weed, because this is the only way i can enjoy myself. I also started visiting doctor and she told me to search for a psychologist, while she'll be looking for psychotherapist. She gave me sleeping pill prescriptions because i can't sleep at nights...

Long-story short I am finishing bachelors in a foreign country. I came here with a group of friends from my high-school and we built a strong network of friends from the same country and I did not lack any social life.

However, I transferred to another university. As a trasnfer student i had problem integrating to new university , since my class is pretty small. I also lost relationship with old international friends and kept connections only from friends from my network of friends from the same country... However, most of them quit studies, worked for a while and around a year ago one after another started leaving, few of them are still studying/found jobs.

Basically right now the only people i keep interactions with are 2 friends from my old network, 3-4 classfriends and work collegues. I myself have always been an outgoing active person who likes to socialize and this situation is a little depressing not having anyone to hangout with or to go to a  university parties.

On the other hand, i had much more time, learned new on-demand job skills which got me an internship and a study-related job and GPA is top 3-5% of populaiton. But social life is important for me, more than grades, work etc, because memories like that ar invaluable.

I can speak local language just a little bit, but from experience i know that even those that speak local language fluently, can't build relationship with locals. As a result, my target group are internationals (\~10% of population;15-20% of university), as we are the ones that are used to speaking / communicating in english only.

The problem is that i don't know how to build relationships with people. My whole life my friend circles back from when i was in high school were build through already existing relationships. And this is a very different situation, because i have a limited network, and those people also have a limited network.

Any advice on how can I build relationships with people being a foreigner in a foreign country where even fluently speaking people can't build relationship? I will need to stay here 2 more years due to masters"

I love working on cars, but feeling I should keep it as a hobby now. Currently I work at a Ford dealer roughly 7-5, and it is heaps better than the previous national chain that I used to work for (small bump in pay, more work, better benefits), but not by a great margin. I still made under $30k last year, and that is nowhere near enough for a house that I would eventually like to buy and no good margin for 401k investment. I'm hourly now in training at $15/hr and life is much better than being flat rate $18/hr. The only bad part is I have a max if one year on training, and really dreading the day that ends. On top of that, the usual physical and mental draining is just not worth the pay, but I love finding the (actual) problems on vehicles and repairing them.

The main problem I'm having is what can I apply myself to? Besides mechanical application and being a hands-on guy, I am pretty good with computers - never coded, but wouldn't mind learning. Also tinkered with blender a bit (kind of a fantasy of mine, love how 3D models are made). Kinda know welding and interested in it. Served in the Marines for 4 years. Also other minor stuff that may be irrelevant. I would not mind one bit using my GI bill for schooling, but the biggest question I have to myself is what I want to study - I do not want 5-figure school debt for something I no longer want to deal with (which is why I never went to UTI). On the note of coding and computers, I do have a fear that the growth is too huge and the applicants are too great (numerically and skills).

I was thinking about mechanical engineering, CNC work, coding, or something along that route. Automotive engineering would be interesting (maybe give Ford a working door latch lol), but no idea how to get into it without any manufacturers out in Arizona. I wish I could just intern for a few days to see how everything is done and move on if it's not my cup of tea, but I doubt that is an option for someone who isn't qualified or in schooling for the job yet.

I guess in summary, I'm just lost and swarmed by what jobs are available and what I am interested in. Should I talk to a career counselor? Maybe attend a job fair? I've been browsing indeed and a few other places just to scope it out, nothing has really stood out (then again, mostly call center or front desk jobs). I'm not in a rush, just trying to scope things out and plan ahead. Thanks in advance!"

I've (20F) been living with my toxic, emotionally abusive parents to offset the debt of university. I am a full-time commuter student, and I work anywhere from 25 to 28 hours a week. I've been paying off my student loans slowly since I started college. I started out with \~10k in federal loans, and I'm now down to \~5k. I was supposed to graduate in 2021, but I transferred after my freshman year and now won't be graduating until 2022 if I follow my current academic plan.

My mental health has been poor my entire life. As soon as I entered college, I sought treatment for my mental health. I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and atypical anorexia during my freshman year of college. However, I've never had a consistent therapist. My parents do not believe in mental health and obviously do not want me to seek professional help. According to them, I should simply get over all of the trauma that they put me through.

This past semester has been one of the most difficult semesters I've had since my freshman year. I have relapsed both with my eating disorder and a history of self-harm. I was going to kill myself last month (after years of various unsuccessful suicide attempts) until a friend of mine stepped in, and I will be staying with her out-of-state over the summer while working a paid internship (the internship is the only reason why my parents agreed to the whole thing).

After the summer is up, I can either return to living with my parents while I finish my degrees as planned, or I can finish my degree online either at my current university or by transferring to a university closer to where my friend lives. If I were to finish my degrees online, however, I run the risk of not being able to afford to do so (my federal aid runs out after six years; I'll need five total years to graduate just by living with my parents), and I run the risk of taking six or seven years to graduate with a bachelor's degree.

I am totally at a lost here. I'd love to continue my studies online, work an actual job full-time, and get out from under my parents and finally be my own, independent person. But everyone keeps saying that I should just stick it out for two more years and then run."

I recently took a coding test for an internship program, I was quickly put in check by the coding test. I am only about 50 hours into coding, but I had higher hopes for myself then how I performed. 

The questions that tripped me up were how to take input in the form of a Dict [] and create a JSON object out of it. I was allowed to read documentation during the test and found the JSON library with json.dumps, but couldn't figure out how to use it in the allotted time. =^(

In the spirit of improvement would you fine folks of r/learnpython be willing to show how you would create a JSON object with python, and outline some reasons as to why you would want to create a JSON object in the first place? I'm hoping to learn something new, but I also hope that there are a few on this sub who can come across the post and learn something new too. 

On the bright side, I solved FizzBuzz no problem. That problem gave me anxiety when I first started coding, and now I can solve it expertly. Little wins!

Thank you! =\^)"

I am a math major from 2010 who has been doing mostly math tutoring for the past 10 years and have decided I want to get into CS, which has always been a hobby of mine.  Unfortunately, I have no internships or experience at all.  Over the past 3 months, I've gone through the codecademy courses on Java and Python and then jumped right into the 2 most complicated projects I could think of.  I made a brute force tic-tac-toe AI in Python and then made an automatic schedule creator for employees in Java.  They are both entirely text-based, and if anyone needs to see them in order to direct their advice, they are on my github account that I can share with you (not sure if I should publicly share that here?)  Anyways, I've been receiving all kinds of mixed advice, and I have no idea what I should focus on next.  Here is my dilemma as best as I can put it:

\- One of my best friends, who was studying CS in college before but switched to IT, tells me that I am more than qualified to get a job.  He recommends that I create a website to host a portfolio, which I know absolutely nothing about.

\- The last time I posted on Reddit about this, I received a lot of feedback that I should start applying for jobs, and that was even before I learned Java and Python.  Mostly because of the math degree.

\- I \*did\* apply for what few jobs I could find (about 10 jobs in the DC area, which is where I would prefer to work).  I know that's a very small sample of jobs, but one of the employers reached out to me for a phone interview.  At the end of the conversation, he told me that I do not have enough experience, and that if I am serious about becoming a software developer, I should learn J2EE and AWS and become familiar with web development.  He also strongly recommended I consider going into machine learning instead.

\- YouTube is chocked full of people who try to give advice to new programmers and there is so much mixed information from them.  There are also mock interviews and recorded actual interviews, some of which seem absurdly easy to me, and some of which (like some of the Google interviews) seem like they cover things that I'm not even vaguely familiar with.

I have lots of options.  I could go to college and get either an undergrad CS degree or a grad degree.  I could keep applying for jobs.  I can self-study to become familiar with either machine learning (which I would eventually like to learn anyway) or to learn more languages or to learn GUIs or SQL etc etc.  I could improve my current programs to make them more appealing.  I would like to avoid front-end development and web development if at all possible.

Does anyone have advice about what I should do next?  Personal anecdotes are welcome."

I’ve been working for 2 years in my current company now, and I’m starting to look for a job elsewhere. Note that this is my first full time job since I graduated. (Computer Engineering)

Now thing is, my university projects and internships were not impressive, either because I couldn’t deliver the whole thing or because of external factors (absent supervisors and so on). 

So I wanted to know, how will that affect my performance in interviews? Is it common to get asked about your projects and internships that date back from university days? I’ve been performing quite well in my current role, but the thing is that I can’t talk a lot about design and architecture because the product is one big monolith, so I would have to resort for things from uni projects. 

I know some big companies like to dig into details in the behavioral part of their interviews and I don’t want to be the person who gives excuses as to why I didn’t go the extra mile or why I wasn’t able to deliver all that was required, in case I have to give examples from my university days and they decide to go into details about that project. 

I’m starting to feel stuck now because of this, and I’m not sure how I can fix this.

I’m looking specifically at U. Michigan, as it’s been my dream to go there ever since I read Michigan papers for my literature review in freshman year. My field is fluid mechanics and aerodynamics.

The main problem is that my GPA is pretty low for most programs. I had a rough first couple years but in my previous semester I bagged a 3.94, pulling myself up to a ~3.4 overall.

I do, however, have a published journal paper (first author) with another one to come hopefully, two international conference presentations (both first author), 1 award and 2 years of research experience so far. I am currently doing an internship as a research assistant in a defence lab, and I will be going abroad in my final year to do a sponsored research attachment for 6 months as well. I should not have problems getting 3 strong LORs, as I’ve been juggling a bunch of different research projects with 3 different advisors.

Summarily, by the time I finish undergrad, I should have 3.5 years of research experience with good results produced. I mostly do experimental work, but the overseas research attachment will be numerical/computational, so I would have had exposure to both sides of fluid mechanics. 

How are my chances like? If not Michigan, I’m also looking at UIUC and Purdue, as well as Caltech (reach school). 

Most important question: other than taking GREs (which I am going to do in the fall), what else can I do to give myself a better chance?

fezpzm,4,2020-03-07,My parents or my girlfriend,throwaway2468134,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fezpzm/my_parents_or_my_girlfriend/,"I’m sorry for how long this is! This is a throwaway account because I don’t want my girlfriend to see this, and none of the names used are accurate. This is mainly about me (21M), my girlfriend of 3.75 years(21F Jessie), and my wealthy parents (48m, 46f). Also, I’m going to mention political views in this post, but I don’t want any political comments in the comments. 

Growing up, I had ADHD and several speech impediments that made it difficult for me to do well in school and take part in social interactions. My sister (currently 23F), was always the popular kid in elementary-high school, and my parents loved her to death. My parents never gave me the attention that I needed inside/outside of school because I was too much work for them. I got the belt when I acted up (which happened frequently due to the ADHD), my sister always got the newest razor/sidekick phones and I wasn’t allowed to get a phone. However, I loved my family to death because I was didn’t really know how parents normally treated their kids. Since I didn’t have many friends, all I knew was my family and how they treated me. My parents pretty much stopped providing for me when I turned 16. They forced me to get a job one day after my 16th birthday, and I had to buy a car after riding my bike to work for a full year, and my parents never went grocery shopping for me or bought me clothes or anything like that. (I know many people have it much worse, but I think it’s important to include that part). 

Fast forward until after high school graduation. My only friend from high school had a graduation party at a restaurant and I sat across from the most gorgeous girl. Fantastic energy and personality, and I could swear it was love at first sight. I got really close to her during that summer (2016), and asked her to be my girlfriend. She is super important to me and has literally turned my life around because she was the first person to ever believe in me. My parents absolutely despise her (to this day) because she’s liberal and they are very far right, and she encouraged me to be liberal. She also taught me how poorly my parents have treated me my whole life, and encouraged me to distance myself from them (which improved my life so much more, and made them hate her more)

Prior to meeting Jessie, I wasn’t planning on going to college. She motivated me to go to community college and try and pursue something that I was interested in (my parents didn’t want me to go to college because they thought it was a waste of money because I wasn’t smart enough). In high school, I had a 2.5 GPA, but in my first year of college I had a 4.0. After that first year, my parents started to become more interested in me and would get very upset if I would visit my girlfriend instead of them. After that, I joined my girlfriend at the university that she went to and pursued a major in Economics (parents were way more against that due to cost of university). My first year in economics, I had a 3.5 GPA. Now all the sudden, my parents were in love with me and were super involved in my life. They started randomly buying me gifts, shipping me clothes and other items, a new laptop and TV, etc. These items meant nothing to me because I saw right through their BS. My dad even hugged me for the first time in 17 years, 5 months ago. My parents have started to do so much for me and have helped with rent, got me a new car, and have offered to fly me out to Hawaii as a graduation gift. It has felt completely amazing to be supported by my parents and to feel loved. 

Two years after going to the university, and 2 internships later, I am now in my last semester of college and I have a fantastic job offer with the government that is 5 hours away that my dads brother (45M) helped me get. Let’s call him John. He is the closest thing to a father figure that I have, he has done so much for me, and I love him dearly. However, my girlfriend suddenly decided that she didn’t want to move with me because she wanted to pursue her masters. As a result, I don’t want to take the offer because I want to stay near home where my girlfriend is. This makes my parents livid, and they keep attempting to guilt trip me. My dad says that he won’t speak to me ever again, and that I won’t receive any graduation gifts or wedding funds for when I marry my girlfriend. Last time I was home, he didn’t even look at me. My mom constantly reminds me that my Uncle John worked so hard to get me the job offer, and that I would make him very disappointed if I don’t take it. They also guilt trip me by threatening to take away the car and laptop that they bought me. 


So, do I take this job offer and make my parents happy and guarantee 6-figure success in my career, or do I stay home with the love of my life, while risking having struggles in finding a job and making a good career, but also losing my family for good."

I am a computer science student from an  Indian engineering college. Our college is not that we'll reputed, but I had to join because I didn't score well in JEE( National Entrance Exam) and I had to join here or else I had to drop a year which I didnt wanna do.

So in order to make my skillset stand out and to get a good job after graduation I decided to do internships. I did one earlier and it was a good experience where I worked under good software engineers and was also appreciated for the work that k contributed. But it was a non-paid internship. I decided to take it because I wanted to experience how stuff is done in a startup. 

After completion of the previous one, I took another internship which was paying me. It's a weird company where the person who is the head is an ex Amazon employee and he had developed a product but it didn't work out well. He now has a company which is jointly owned by a family member of his. And he is now building a product and I am the only person working on it which is weird to me. But I sidelined it due to the fact that I was being paid and I was able to do the work.

Now the work is getting overbearing for me, he expects me to deliver as quick as possible which I cannot do because I am in my 3rd year and companies are visiting our campus with job offerings. I have to prepare for that and as well as carry my studies together. But so far it has been a failed attempt.
 My grades are going down, I am feeling low and my employer is blaming me for the work that isn't done whereas I am contributing to the greatest extent and he also knows that I am not a professional who can deliver quickly, I have to figure out things and how to do them before I do them. 

So I wanted to know if I should quit ? Would it look bad on my CV that I worked for a short duration? Should I work harder considering that he is an ex Amazon person and has more knowledge about how much work should be done by an intern who is looking for a job in a big tech company..? Should I even work for a company which has no credibility whatsoever and the only difference that it has from other better companies is that it pays me? 
 
I'm so confused , any help will be appreciated

I truly don't know what to do at this point. Any advice would be appreciated. 

I'm a rising senior majoring in CS at an Ivy school. Having switched major from an unrelated field (medicine) in my junior year, I have ZERO professional coding experience and desperately need some, so I started a gig at one of my school's labs this spring. It's an unpaid ""data analyst"" role, with no real direction or guidance since the lab has 4 ppl, none of whom codes at all. I go to the lab once a week for a meeting, get assigned some tasks, go home and figure out how to do them, go to the lab to report progress at the end of the week, rinse and repeat. It's definitely not a real SWE internship, but I figured it's better than nothing. 

The problem is... I've been hitting a brick wall with one task they've given me (something related to microscopic image processing, if anyone's interested), and I've been struggling to survive my midterms. As a result, I've told the lab I can't make it to our weekly meeting TWICE, and that I haven't made much progress during this time. They haven't officially told me I'm fired, but simply stopped relying to my texts for scheduling the next meeting. In this case, I can only assume that I've essentially been let go. 

Now, I have no doubt that it was all my fault, but I have two questions regarding the next step. 

1. Should I keep contacting the lab begging for my ""job"" back? 

2. Should I leave this experience on my resume? If I don't I won't have any CS related experience on there, all while I'm still looking for a summer internship.

I struggle so much at English and can barely maintain an 83, my question really is how much this would affect my chance to get in?

Does it even matter that my English mark is so low as long as my overall is high enough?   
How do my chances to get into the programs I mentioned earlier look, considering my average and the AIF and that I did not make it into the first round of admission?  


Lastly, does me attending an academic private school with all U level courses change the chances or do admissions staff not care what school the applicants attended?

I am pursuing a Finance degree at a major U.S. institution, and am in my 8th of 10 semesters needed to graduate.

I’ve always struggled with organizing things, as is typical of Dyspraxia, but I’ll try to organize this.




Dyspraxia

You probably don’t know what this is. People should--there's not enough awareness out there for it. It’s literal hell to live through. You work 10 times harder than everyone and get nowhere compared to them. You’re constantly being pegged as lazy, when in fact you’re just exhausted from all the work you have to put into everything. Your future, by default, is not very bright because there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll never live on your own, or independently. Couple that with being a male, and things are so much more difficult. At least girls don’t have to worry as much about initiating things as often as guys do. And in fact, research has suggested that girls have it easier with this condition than males, and that is because it is easier for them to recruit their friends when they need help than it is for a guy. 

Couple that with the social awkwardness of Asperger’s syndrome, and life can be mighty difficult. In fact, the average lifespan reportedly for individuals such as myself with Asperger’s syndrome and a learning disability is only 39 (which I identify with in having Dyspraxia). I can see why--life is so fucking stressful--especially if you’re someone who is hellbent on achieving as much as you can in your lifetime like myself. You’re constantly making mistakes--nothing seems to come natural to you. Neurotypicals do not understand individuals with Asperger’s, nor do we understand them. Which makes it no wonder that individuals with Asperger’s Syndrome have been found to be 9 times more likely than the general population to commit suicide.

Right now, for the first time since I've been in college, I'm struggling with all 5 of my classes at once. They are all business courses, and my business school is prestigious to be quite blunt. One of the classes I’m in moves at a super-fast pace in class and I always have to go back through the lectures afterwards to understand shit-- another has exams or quizzes every single class which I hate, yet another contains extremely confusing material, while another requires me to constantly give presentations.

I failed my first 2 exams this semester. Going back to last semester, these represent the 3rd and 4th exam in a row I've failed. Last semester killed me though and I had 5 finals during finals week, and failed the two that I had on the same day, which I will excuse. Still, I am very demotivated when it comes to exams anymore.

In my time here at college, I have learned how to swim, how to ride a bike, a little bit of how to dance, and made some pretty good friends, which are all positive. But all of it was always so difficult.

I hate that I'm in a position right now where I have to cancel my spring break plans because there's an exam 2 days after spring break that I have to do well on, because I bombed the first one. I hate how there's a limit as far as the resources outside of professor's hours where I can get help in the classes I'm in. Further, I constantly fall behind readings because there's just so much in college. 

Further, the trickiness in obtaining help also applies to therapy, which it seems always hard to schedule right when I need it.


Distractions

I spend way too much time pursuing distractions, like playing Words With Friends or paying attention to my favorite baseball team in Spring Training not necessarily for the reward of how it makes me feel but rather to shelter myself from the pain of trying my hardest and then failing in my studies. So I’m constantly procrastinating.


Summer plans disrupted, just like Spring Break plans

I had planned to go on an internship with a company in an another state and city that really intrigued me. Unfortunately, though, the most important medication I am on is government-controlled, can only be given as a 30-day supply, and the pharmacies in the other state cannot guarantee they will fill the medication, with my only other option being pursuing the trouble of finding a psychiatrist down there to diagnose me. I had been accepted for this internship, and both the person who accepted me and myself was really looking forward to that opportunity. But now because of this I am not even guaranteed an internship. I’d have to interview again with this same company at my state’s location. I did not want to stay in my state.


Further, I hate being limited by my medication as to where and when I can travel. Fuck that. And I am someone who would never in a million years abuse pills. Why should I have to pay for that?

Dating

Separately, I hate how dating/getting anywhere with anyone is so complicated for me. I feel like I'll never be able to navigate a relationship--and that's painful. I hate how I always feel the urge to hide who I live with, because I don't feel comfortable telling people I live with my mom. I hate how it seems I never hear appreciation from other people, no matter what I do. 

Cooking

Don’t even get me started on trying to cook… it is so hard for me to coordinate that. It’s also not easy for me to coordinate plans, though that’s not as difficult as cooking. 

Feedback life gives me

I hate all the negative feedback I constantly receive when getting feedback on things from others. It's like no matter what I do, it's never enough. My high school was so easy in comparison to where I am now: I went to one catered for special needs kids. I suppose a positive is that I'm the only one from my graduating class that managed to make it to a major institution, like the one I'm going to, but man it's always been so difficult… 

View on life

I'm growing to hate life more and more by the day. So much effort needed for such little actual rewards. I feel like in order to live my best life I’d have to have a lot of money so that I have the financial resources to get whatever help I need whenever I need it. I’m not there yet."

Some of the students completely lack self awareness (they failed the semester exam but expect a recommendation).

I feel like it would be better if there were some kind of exchange.  I spend an hour writing a letter for some kids, then barely get a thank you afterwards.  Can I reasonably request that a student helps me in the classroom for an hour in exchange for the letter?  

Has anyone implemented something like this?  Should I just start saying no?  Does anyone just use a form letter?

Even the good internship had a lot of things that really sucked, like the weeks of not having anything to do, or not having anyone to go to lunch with, so I’m hoping I can help the intern have a better experience.

My ideas so far:

Invite intern to lunch occasionally.

Invite them to all my meetings so they at least have something to kill time if they end up not having stuff to do.

Give them stuff to work on if they’re getting bored. 

Show them all the cool stuff at our workplace.

Try to introduce them to young people that they can hang out with outside work.

For years I've had a wide variety of interests in tech and I've learned a little in multiple subfields through side projects, hackathons, and internships. I was thinking that'd it be cool if I could spend 1-2 (probably 2) years in multiple different positions, specifically Software Engineer (full-stack or backend), ML Engineer (ML + backend), Data Engineer, and Product Manager, before I focus on one (or two if related) of the roles for the remainder of my career.

Is this possible, and if so, how? Like should I try to move around within one big company, move between companies, join an early-stage startup, etc? Also, how would I pitch myself when trying to move to a different position? I understand that the safe path is to pick one position you like and increasingly specialize in it.

I'm about to rumble about the last two years of my life and what I have learned from that... :P

Two years ago, I started a internship focused in the infrastructure of servers, basically my job was to use kubernetes and docker to containerize webapplications and keep the services on, and in the event of some crash, automatically serve that app on another container maybe on another cluster or server...

Like everything in life, at start it was very hard, everything about this area were very new to me, so I had to study hard, and even failed some tests because I it was taking too much of my time, but after a while it got easier, I understood the fundamentals and was ready to take care of any task that would be given me with reasonably speed.

After some weeks passed we started to have a shortage of projects and my time started to be used to ... NOTHING, really if there is no work they would prefer to give me any meaningless shit to make that would never be used for nothing then let me go home or focus on other projects and let me grow as a student of CS.

Some weeks of this going on and I was really unhappy, feeling that what I was doing had no impact on the world and basically no one really would give a crap if it were done or not but the important thing there is, my time is being paid so I will have a supervisor kinda boss that would be checking if I'm filling my duty hours with ""something"". 

At that stage I realized that I would never be able to work to big enterprises, because most of them are like that, huge money makers with their core, start to growing and start to have meaningless sectors and impersonal relationships where when you ask for a promotion is to a comitee that never even heard about you before.

So I got together with a good friend of mine that had a similar view of the world, he wanted to build SaaS products and get rich with that, I got caught in the idea and thought that would be nice to work with him since he is a great coder, we started in March 2019(lasted until March 2020) building a CRM that we dropped when it was about 90% done because we realized that we had no money or a go to market strategy and would be dead on the water with no clients in a saturated market like that. We decided to start to work as a Software House, building software to other people, and again with bad decisions we basically started working for free for a guy from US that was paying with USD (considering 1USD = 4,63BRL) we thought maybe we could earn something there, but trying to build some social proof we settled for almost nothing and after a while we realized that we were working with really toxic people that made us feel even worse than when we worked in our old jobs (at least we were getting paid reasonably there)

After finishing that project I decided that I would want to do something that I love, and I love and always loved videogames, have been playing since I'm a kid, and I hope that know I do things properly and suceed at least a little, but I also realized that even though I'm a programmer and should be able to take advantage of the great social media and apps out there nowadays I preferred to stay behind the scene trying to build things and being unknown.

So I decided that along the way of my new journey, I'm going to keep a devlog where I will talk about what have been working and not working for me, and hopefully this can helps others on the same situation as me...

I'm pretty new to game dev so I'm learning the basics, but I already got something hehe:

This is my first reddit post so if the format isn't 100% I'm sorry :3

For a while, I've been working at a startup and managing everything related to data.  I began as their intern who didn't have extensive knowledge in CS. I had taken a OOP, Algorithms (a very bad one) and Database 1 class before the internship. I knew close to nothing about data engineering when I started and learned everything I know on the job (aka google &amp; reddit). Didn't have a lot of mentorship since the team was was super busy and small. Felt like I was a chicken with its head cut the whole time I worked there but grateful for the experience because I learned a lot FAST.

I'm currently on the job hunt and seem to be doing an OK since I have several onsite interviews coming up. I have about a week of preparation before they start and not sure what the experience is going to be like because I've never had a formal onsite interview before! These are what I believe are my current strengths and weaknesses:

*Weaknesses: big data pipelines, data modeling best practices and BI analytics and tools.*

*Strengths: SQL, Python, AWS S3 Redshift EC2, linux, OOP/algorithms, web crawlers and reg. sized pipelines*

Does anyone have suggestions on how to prepare based off the weaknesses I listed? Does anyone want to talk about their onsite interview experience? Does anyone have nice words of encouragement?

ff9iyi,0,2020-03-08,Am I on a good track?,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ff9iyi/am_i_on_a_good_track/,"I am in my freshman year of high school.  I am wondering if I am on a good track to attend a state school (I am in Cali, but I will not specify any further than that.)  I am hoping to become a doctor, and am aware that I will have to do undergrad and then go off to med school.  My primary goal is to work in the medical field - I am aware that my mind may change, but medicine is something that I am certain about.

In terms of demographic, I am an African American female.  I will be first generation if I am able to attend (we do not have any money saved up for college,) and my father served in the military before 9/11.  Will any of this help me with scholarships?

Here is a list of what I am doing this year, and what I intend on doing in the future:

9th grade (this year):

* Had 4.0 GPA first semester - still have a 4.0, and am working on maintaining it.  If it drops down to a 3.9 due to what will likely be a lower grade in Geometry, I will handle accordingly by taking AP courses in my later years (which I intend on doing anyhow.)  I am taking PE, a History-equivalent course, Geometry, Chemistry, Spanish 1, and an advanced English course.
* In terms of EC's, I am on the track team (though I am not the best at it, I am enjoying it and would like to improve my running,) in summer program Girls Inc. of the Island City, a member of Black Student Union (and have been encouraged by the teacher to run for a position next year,) in Book Club, and in UC Berkeley's Engineering Program for Teen Girls that runs until April.

10th grade:

* GPA is obviously unknown, but here are the classes I have signed up for: AP World History, Honors English, Algebra 2, Spanish 2, Computer Science (or Marketing - depends on which class is less full,) and Biology (I think that this will be my favorite class.)  I may end up taking zero period PE, but if I complete two more sports before senior year, I will not have to do so.  We are only able to take AP History in sophomore year.
* I intend on completing two more sports next year (cross country is a near definite,) partly for sake of having a great experience and keeping a good shape, but also for the sake of being able to waiver off a second year of PE.  
* I will maintain the clubs I have, and join my school's Health Center awareness club simply because I am interested and believe I would be a good fit for it (I am interested in matters of mental and physical health - I spend much time researching diseases and disorders,) alongside Robotics.  I may do Model UN (I will be attending a meeting later this month to learn more about it, and find out whether or not I am interested.)  
* I will take the PSAT next year.
*  I will also spend this summer studying for the SAT.
* The summer before 11th grade begins, I am to have an internship at a hospital through my summer program.  

11th grade:

* Here are the courses I am hoping to take as of junior year, unless I choose to do Genomics (in which case my schedule will look very different): AP English, AP History, Pre-Calculus, AP Biology, AP Computer Science, and Spanish 3. 
* I will have stopped sports at this point, and if I am still enjoying my EC's, I will continue with them.  I will hopefully have a position in Black Student Union, and I will most likely not join any more clubs, unless one in particular sparks my interest.  I will start volunteering more often, and focus my time on possibly holding a job, as I'd like to save up some money.
* I will take the SAT (or ACT) and hopefully score well?

12th grade:

* This will be my final year of high school.  Here are the courses planned: AP English, AP Student Government (seniors are required to take this,) AP Chemistry, an Art course (this is a graduation requirement,) and honestly who knows what else?

How is this sounding?"
ffa3pt,14,2020-03-08,Thinking about quitting... fair enough or overreacting?,TAwayKeyTransition4,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ffa3pt/thinking_about_quitting_fair_enough_or/," Hi everyone, first time posting here but a long time lurker on Reddit. I'm on my late twenties, I have a job which is my first one ever (if you don't count internships as real jobs), and I've been working there for over four years. During that time, on this job I've learnt so many things that really interest me, and met wonderful people that have become close friends of mine and almost like a second family, since I'm working far away from my home town.

The pay is quite good, it has allowed me to do some things that would have looked like an unaffordable dream a few years ago. I'm rather unlikely to get this deal somewhere else should I leave my job.

Even though I do like the activities that I do, I sometimes get tired of the same daily routine, especially because, given the job is on a industrial plant, where production is 24/7, you have to be constantly prioritising answering internal clients' requests, on a right-now fashion, but you also have a wide array of other not-so-urgent stuff to do. Both things, though important, are highly time-consuming and honestly, largely ignored by other departments. It's easy, then, to look the other side greener and get interested in other areas, from which I've been learning things about to a closer detail (they are somewhat related to the main activities of my current position) and showing interest whenever I'm asked about how I see myself in the future in the company, and so on.

But still, it's not enough, my current job easily consumes not only all my shift's time, but often even extra hours, especially since the department's organigram has been reduced on a practically one-person-a-year basis (on cost-saving grounds), since I've been working there, but the workload has not been reduced on the same proportion.

This puts me in the situation that other people can talk about my 'lack of interest' in other things, in developing myself, and so on. And it shows, because although I have been interviewed for other positions, for some of them I was not selected given other applicants had more relevant skills (such as being able to use specialised equipment, that I don't use in my current position, nor ever will). For others, later I learnt that the position was already decided for some crony, so the whole selection process was a mere charade. Apart from this, I'm generally well-deemed by the management team in yearly reviews.

So, recently, a colleague (let's call him A) was let go given recurring performance issues with them, affecting the rest of the team's work. But this colleague happened to be close friends with colleagues in other sub-areas of the same department (I will call them B and C), and they are really saddened and disagree strongly with that decision. Anyway, he's about to be replaced. Having a new element on the team to train is already challenging for an already reduced team, and then we were informed that colleague B is going to be ""temporarily-promoted"" to a higher position. I don't really know how temporary it really is, and what they want them to achieve with this test, but still, their job on the department will have to be executed by someone else. I have been allocating some of my little free time (or less saturated time) during the last several months to get trained for the position of colleague B, but, in a strange set of events, the higher bosses have decided that colleague C is going to cover colleague B's activities, I will cover colleague C's activities, and they are going to hire a new person (apart from the replacement for colleague A) to temporarily cover my activities. This new person is 'pledged' so to speak, to another area once the 'temporary' test for colleague B is over and everyone returns to their position.

This makes no sense as I currently see it, because I am more trained for colleague B's activities than colleague C, and I'm barely trained for colleage C's activities. They claim that they want to give ""people development"" opportunities for the higher number of people, so if I covered colleagues B's position, colleague C would be like, out of the equation. I do recognise that expanding my set of skills (lerning colleague C's job) can only help me, either inside or outside of this company, but given that the department is already going to be under additional stress, no one can understand why they decided to put us for this challenge in this very moment. They will make a new role, even temporarily both colleagues B and C will have to cover my job while I ""focus"" on training for my soon-to-be activities, and they are so grumpy about it. I write ""focus"" because I highly doubt I will be able just to forget about my current activities, it's just so much workload that just one colleague (let's call them colleague D), who will be alone training two new people is likely to have trouble doing it all alone.

My position, unlike theirs (B and C), is closely attached to an ongoing industrial process, you have little or no organisational freedom because you always have to be prioritising being there for the process over other things, so for example, on a regular day, they can finish their daily work on four hours, diluting it in the 8-hour shift, so they have so much free time for long breakfasts, coffee-breaks, and the general freedom of choosing when to do certain things. Colleague C will have little or no problem allocating time within their shift to learn about colleague B's job.

My position is way less indulgent, some times, you leave your work spot for some minutes and someone is already asking why you are not there, you have to deal with things such as clients making you work on some things (that take up to one hour to complete) 15 minutes before your theoretical shift end time (and they expect you to do it nevertheless), you have to work weekends, and such. It's no surprise they are grumpy, but of course with the higher bosses they say everything is OK, that we are a team and whatnot. It's me and my other colleague that will have to put up with the complaints and sarcastic comments.

We had a similar situation a few years ago, and I'm convinced that it cracked a rather friendly environment that used to exist until then, and turned it into a more toxic, they-versus-us, double-faced one. I dread living this thing again on its own, but now I happen to depend on them for my training, and given that colleague A was kind-of interested in colleague C's activities, I already feel them more grumpy about having to train me since their mate already was more trained.

Wow, this is such a text wall. Well, my point is, I'm so stressed right now over this situation, because if I don't deliver (i.e. being able to do colleague C's activities) within the planned time, I'm going to be seen as incompetent, but I don't feel we are in the same situation since my colleagues B and C have way more natural free time. If I quit, I feel that some HR people will say that I didn't stand up for challenges, but as I said, the department has been under a lot of 'challenges' while reducing the team size, and still delivering excellent results.

Additional to this, there are so many other expectations they have about you: attending meetings, taking part and leading proyects, showing yourself off and so on. All that's good, but how can you do it with a job like the one I have to do? And now this?

So, what would you people do? What do you think?

If you are still reading, thank you for your attention! :)

TL;DR: I'm suddenly expected to learn a new positiong in my job, having way less time to do it than my colleagues and facing a potentially hostile environment."

I might do a masters or something but who knows, I’m just really freaking lost about what I want to do in life now that I’m not on the grad school path and I was hoping to get some advice from my fellow bears. 

I’ve taken all the industry-relevant stats classes like 135, 140, 150, 151A, 154, 205, 248 etc and I’ve taken the relevant math classes like 110,104,170,202A etc. 
I did CS 61A, 61B, 170 too. 

 My GPA is pretty good and I love math so I would obviously like to do some quantitative. The only thing I can’t really see myself doing is software engineering; I did an SWE internship my freshman summer which I absolutely hated. 

So I guess my question is, what else can I do as a math and stats major coming from Berkeley? I thought data science seemed like a good fit but apparently I need a PhD to break into the field so now I have no clue.

I also had another side job and had IT night classes. I got the full-time job!!!! high pay with benefits :).  

I want to tell the people  who are questioning if they want to get into IT or don't feel prepared to work in IT. GO FOR IT! If you want to learn in a class atmosphere, look into your local community colleges that have a program in IT or you can go online on Udemy to get Mike Meyers, Dions: Network+,  A+, Security + video lectures. Interning will be a huge boost if you plan to apply at the same company you're interning or when you plan to go some where else. I say this because I felt that I wasn't going to make the cut when I applied to be an Intern, then I had a nervous feeling that I might not get the cut for the Full-time position that I applied for, guess what? I did it, and I know I am not the most smartest guy ever, but I know each and everyone of you can do it! Go for it!!!! :)

The recruiter told me to expect to discuss my coding experience, projects, and exposure to testing. Sometimes I feel like I'm a great programmer and sometimes I feel like I'm just a little baby that can only do ""Hello, World!"". I really really really want it but I'm nervous I don't know enough and haven't done enough. I just don't honestly know what the sum total of knowledge I should have at this point is.

Hi all, this is actually my first post on Reddit (and subsequently this community). I'm a second-year EE at a nice engineering college in Ohio. We have a 5-year program that requires us to do at least 3 semesters of internships / co-ops.
My first year as an EE wasn't too bad because it was almost entirely gen-eds, even though both my freshman semesters were 18 and 19 credit hours. I failed Calc 2 and took it again over the summer, which was a huge hit to my pride but I took it like a champ and was back on-track for my second year of EE. By the time I hit sophomore year, things got rough. I was taking Calc 3, Physics 2, and Circuits 1, which all on their own? Not terrible classes. Physics 2 was essentially the theory behind my circuits course, calc 3 was generally very simple to me, and circuits 1 was...a lot of work, but not super difficult to understand overall. Also took an honors colloquia and a history class, essentially two gen-eds on top of my real coursework. The problem was, each class demanded a lot of my time, and I also work at my campus's Student Union anywhere from 19 to 23 hours a week. But I got through that semester with C's in all of those classes. Classes I certainly could have at least a B+ in if I had time. A little frustrating, especially when it dipped my GPA below the minimum needed to retain my Honors scholarship, around $500 a semester. Come this semester, and I'm doing much better in my classes. Taking statics, circuits 2, differential equations, C programming, and my last history gen-ed. Problem this time is, I'm drained as hell constantly. I've lost 16 pounds this semester, I don't eat well, I don't sleep *great* (about 5 to 7 hours every night, so not the worst), and for the life of me I can never find time to just sit down and have fun with anything. Just work work work, study study study.

My question at the end of all this college student whining is, as an electrical engineer, how do you all find time to do things you enjoy, keep your sanity, etc? Do you have hobbies? Do you hang out with friends? Play video games, even if it's just a little bit? Fuck I miss video games. What tips or advice can you give?"

I sent my application in just for the hell of it and to be honest, I don't feel smart/accomplished enough to have someone even respond for an interview. And I don't mean it as a humble brag. Also, to those who have done the program, is it worth it to delay graduation to do the program? What would the work be like as a CS student? As someone more interested in software engineering, I never really seriously considered working at NASA so I don't know what to think.

I will try to make this post at least somewhat coherent but it will end up being word vomit. 

Background:

I'm currently about 8-9 months out of college in at a job as a ""Systems Engineer"" for a fairly large company somewhere in the Midwest. When I initially joined I did not know the exact team I would end up working for. However, most of the work in that role involved around system administration (or database administration) type work. I interviewed with a few teams and was placed based on where needs matched my skill sets (familiarity with SQL and understanding code...allegedly). 

I am extremely unhappy with my actual duties. My role is really just Helpdesk support (not that there's anything wrong with doing that ... it's just not what I signed up for). I help support a proprietary solution of ours (80%\~ of what I have learned is useless outside of our company). I received no training on this solution. I was just thrown in and told to ask for help from others on my team. I frequently work 10+ hour days to try to keep up with goals set by management. Every time I catch up they raise the bar again. I don't like working with our solution at all. It does not perform well, our support/troubleshooting tools are garbage, and there's too much customization between clients to be able to consistently know what I am doing. 

I'm at the point where I am thinking I want to move back to my hometown area (Eastern US large city) as I am feeling burnt out/depressed from work and I miss my friends and family. Moving back home would mean finding a new job (exciting but terrifying) but I feel like having a company I only worked at 8-9 months is going to look bad on my resumé and that I won't be an appealing candidate anywhere with the flood of college students applying. I worked at an internship previously for several years where I worked a lot with deploying out SQL Server, Windows Server, and writing some C# applications to test out automating some business processes but my skills feel a little rusty compared to the college kids with the knowledge fresh in their minds. 

TLDR/Present Day/Conclusion:

I have a strong interest in Database Development and Administration (specifically MSSQL). I am guessing that I should be looking at entry level analyst roles of some sort since I lack a lot of experience? Would certifications be worth pursing? I purchased a CBTNuggets subscription to try and study for some of the certifications. However, the courses I have been working on don't have as much ""hands on"" as I would like. Any suggestions or other resources I should be looking at? Should I be worried about my resumé showing I've only worked at my current job for \~9 months? Any advice that can be given from this word vomit of a post would be appreciated."

1. Work Experience
2. Personal Projects

I looked through other post and found many people in the comments have really great profiles but somehow didn't get into their schools (without leaving much explanation) so I wanted to get a better understanding of what my chances are.

I am currently finishing up my third year as an undergrad at a lower-ranked school in the US.

I am doing a double major in EE and CpE (electrical engineering and computer engineering) (our school has two majors for this) and a minor in CS. My cGPA is 3.73/4 but should be at 3.78-3.82 since I finished all the ""difficult"" classes and if everything works out perfectly.

I haven't taken the GRE yet, but am wondering how important this (to do well on) may be?

I have one research paper (lead) published under an undergrad conference over the past summer, and currently working on 2 for more prominent conferences. (1 lead and 1 second) All papers are regarding either deep learning or reinforcement learning. These are planned to be submitted by the end of this spring/summer. An important note is that the two research projects are not advised by a professor yet (a recurring issue for me)

I had a software engineering internship and a web dev position in the past, as well as being an undergraduate teaching assistant for CS course. Not sure how much this will help me.

Unfortunately, I haven't had the best luck with professors. I often get the sense that many of them don't like working with me and have refused to work on projects with me. I am not sure why, since I feel well qualified and skilled enough to at least help out. It probably going to be a struggle to find a professor that will write me a letter of recommendation at all tbh."

Even though everyone is friendly, they all have their own groups of ""friends"" and don't really interact with others other than the casual ""hi"" or ""good morning"". Since I recently joined, not knowing anybody at the firm and as an introvert, it's been hard to connect to people. I've been trying my best to try and create relationships by always being friendly, try and learn more about them, but it's been hard because I run out of things to talk about and it gets awkward sometimes. I've been trying hard to ""fake it till I make it"", but it drains a lot of energy from me as I am an introvert and I don't seem to be getting anywhere. The connections I have made have just been superficial and have only resulted in salutations and not real relationships. It's been hard going to work as you see everybody enjoying themselves, talking to one another and having a laugh, while I'm on the side not being included in the conversation.

Have any of you experienced the same situation, and if so what did you do to make the circumstances better? Has ""Faking it Till You Make it worked"" for you guys?"

I was thinking about taking [this](https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/) course at my current university in the spring semester post graduation whilst waiting for the start date at my new job. Would this course be enough to get into the program? It seems to be a great course, and only hear good things about it and the projects you complete over the length of the semester, but it doesn't seem to go over algorithms too much; mainly data-structures and OOP.

I make around 180k(Base + yearly bonus).  I live in a low-cost state. My rent for a single bedroom apartment that I don't share with anyone is 1300$. It takes me 20 minutes to drive to work and there is absolutely no traffic at all. I once saw a family of bears on my way to work. The company provides lunch, dinner, and breakfast. The benefits are great.

Now, the problem is that this is a very old private company, probably founded in the 70s. There is still a lot of Fortran 77 code laying around. This is my first job out of college and I am absolutely not learning anything. The whole tech stack is proprietary. From the libraries used to build the UIs to the service development framework to the databases that people use to the compilers etc., everything is proprietary. A lot of it is made open-sourced, but I am still learning something that no one outside of this company uses. I could switch teams to a big data/machine learning teams. But still, 50% of what I use every day is not widely used anywhere outside of this company.

Last year I spent 3 months grinding leet code for a Google onsite. I got an ""Average"" rating in two coding rounds(I solved the problems) and ""Lowest"" rating in the other two rounds(Basically I did not understand the problem in one round and in the other round I could not solve it). I am absolutely hell-bent on getting out of this company this year. I don't want to waste away my life being miserable at my job. I know for a fact that I am not happy here.

I am in contact with both a Facebook recruiter as well as a Google recruiter. I am giving myself roughly 8 months(My green card application is in the process). I have cracked two coding interviews in College, that's how I got my current job and an internship. So I definitely know I can do this. So my question is, what can I do to absolutely make sure I crack either of the two interviews(FB, Google) in the next 8 months."

It’s been 10 months and while I know it’s not supposed to be easy, with May graduation coming up I’m afraid more competition would only make it tougher to land a job. I don’t have internship experience because it required a 3.0 gpa in my area(mine’s at 2.72). My gpa is only at 2.72 because I hated math during hs. But I liked engineering so once I figured everything out, apprecited math a lot more my grades improved and you can see on my transcript that my last two semesters were full of A’s and B’s. I took electives that I thought would help build up my resume(like Finite Element Analysis and Pipeline Design) I had a resume writer in LinkedIn help out my resume too so it’s better than the first ones I’ve been sending out. I stated there that I know computer programs like MATLAB and AutoCAD. I worked as a Bellhop at a Casino/Hotel resort so I worked with different teams/staffs in our property and I got to improve my communication skills because I deal with guests on a daily basis.

I'm about to graduate this spring with a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering. I have a job lined up to be an ""intern"" (not really an internship but the job title is kind of specific to the firm and I'm not trying to give out too many details) at a law firm that specializes in patent law that I am looking forward to, but the location is kind of meh (Houston , TX). Unless I end up falling in love in Houston and my future job (I just might do so and lose this crazy idea, I don't know), it's kind of been a dream of mine to move to Spain. I've visited Spain before, and I fell in love with it. The food, the culture, the people, the weather, the land...it's all lovely. I know Spain has it's faults, like not a lot of jobs and low wages, but honestly if I could get a job that pays reasonably well and gives me a good work life balance, I'd be happy.

Why do I want to move out of the USA? I just don't really like it here. I'm not a big fan of American culture, politics (both sides), and I don't feel a tie to the land at all. I'd go into more detail but I feel like it's not super relevant for this sub. Maybe I'm just a moody young adult, but we all only live one life and I'm trying to live the happiest one I can live, and I think at the moment that might be in Spain. 

Now if you want to skip my spiel about my motivations, here are details about me: my Spanish is OK, I can definitely understand it and speak it at decent level but I am probably not at a level good enough to be considered fluent (e.g. I could probably translate like 80% of what I just typed). Job-wise, I have some pretty good skills (Python, C++, MATLAB, FORTRAN, engineering stuff in general), the only thing I'm worried about is that my future job is American-centric since it deals with American law, so I'm not sure how transferable my skills would be if I waited down the line. However, said future job will pay relatively well, so barring any extraordinary circumstances I think I could build up a nice amount of savings to help aid in this process. 

What would I like to do? A software engineering job would be nice (I've been told to avoid the outsourcing companies), or something law related as well , especially related to patent law (I feel like that'd be way harder to secure, though). Grad school could be another option too.

tl;dr if I wanted to move to Spain, how feasible would it be? Would it be advisable to not wait too long to move? As to exactly where in Spain, that'd probably depend on where I got a job offer; I probably wouldn't want to live in Catalunya (didn't like it when I went) but anywhere else is probably fine. 

Alright, I'm not sure what else to add, I read through the rules but if I missed anything please let me know. If you want me to go into more detail about something, just ask and I'll provide. Also, sorry if my text is kind of rambling, I'm kind of just typing whatever is coming to my mind right now."

Here is the third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

fft82v,1,2020-03-09,Lost in my own thoughts and How to tackle people’s negative opinions about me ? Need advice.,CuriousGoldsmith,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/fft82v/lost_in_my_own_thoughts_and_how_to_tackle_peoples/,"Hi Reddit,

I will try and keep this brief.Found this sub when I had no idea whom to ask for advice.

I am 31 year old currently studying in last year of my law school.

When I was 20,I moved to a different country to pursue a degree in Mechatronic Engineering in the process of new environment,new people and sudden change of moving out of my home town with no friends I spiralled down into severe depression and social anxiety.I failed at everything I did.I couldn’t pass in my studies and was kicked out of university.I only did job at convenience stores ,fast food etc and put in lot of hours to keep my mind straight.

But I kept going downwards with heavy drinking and gambling and at that time I had no one to support me or to talk to.Somehow I ended up in therapy and after a year of counselling and meds I moved on got better and I felt it was best to comeback to my hometown and start fresh.

I was 25 at that time,I came back and gave law entrance and started studying. I took it full time and did not work during the semesters and only during the vacation.

Now I have been progressing well as per my reasoning but the Family,Relatives,Cousins and known Acquaintances now but who were Good friends before I moved back.They have created this image and reputation about me in social circles where they project that I am not serious about my career,life and I am not doing enough to be successful.During my last semester I was pursuing an internship where a distant relative called my boss and asked him to tread carefully as I am not very serious in life and career.

As of now I have internship experiences in corporate law,civil law and criminal practice but I actually enjoy the criminal practice of court.I have often received advice from family that I should stick to corporate law and make it my life period and work tirelessly and be successful.(Relatives and Cousin’s are all very successful in their respective career and life choices) 

I seriously don’t know why but earning lot of money and being successful in career and financial standards is not something I crave for in life.I don’t know how to put this into writing but counselling people in need and helping them with legal issues or just being a bartender(it was my part time job earlier) makes me happy.Even though i want to work as a lawyer cause I love it.Being famous or earning a lot or getting to be a Partner at a law firm is not important to me I do not want only work to be my lifestyle if it makes any sense.
I have turned very content lately after my battle with failure in the past and only financial success is not happiness for me.

Would you say I am wrong in my thoughts? 
Whether the opinion of people about me is correct?
Do I need to be more serious in life?
or am I just anxious again?

So that’s why I need some advice on how to move forward from here and to be honest I do not want to fuck up again.So what’s the right thing to do?"

I am a current senior that was accepted to JHU ED for Applied Math :). I saw a similar post to this, and I thought it would be nice to give back to the community that helped me.




Freshman Year:




I really didn’t know A N Y T H I N G about the admissions process at this time, so I really didn’t do much other than take challenging courses and get involved in a few EC. This was also the year I had the most work (besides senior year), so I had to adapt in terms of workload during this.




Classes:




AP Physics 1 (Hard cuz it was first AP class) (5 on exam)

Honors Spanish 1 (VERY HARD, a perfect score was a 95, so it was tough to maintain an A in this class)

Honors Pre-Calc (Eh, kinda tough but not too bad)

Honors Bio (tough cuz there were a ton of tests)

Honors World History (Easy) (I elected not to take AP World as a freshman, though the option was available)

Honors English 1 (Teacher left halfway through year due to pregnancy, was eh difficulty)

PE (It’s PE)

Schedule Difficulty Relative to School: 8/10




Extracurriculars:




Science Olympiad (Got 7th place in regional competition)

I managed a YouTube channel for art that had around 20,000 subs at the time

Students Against Melanoma (SAM)




Leadership:




Managing the YT channel




Awards:




7th place in regional Science Olympiad Competition

2nd place in statewide engineering competition

Overall, didn’t do much freshman year other than meet people.




Summer after Freshman Year:




Literally 0. Not one single thing.

GPA/HPA/Rank At end of Freshman year:

My school weights 4.0 for Regular, 4.5 for Honors, and 6.0 for AP/IB/Dual Enrollment

4.0 UW 

Around 4.6-4.7 HPA

I think somewhere around 55/425 ish for rank?




Sophomore Year:




I stepped it up a LITTLE (but not much), though at the end of sophomore year I realized I needed to start thinking about college. Hence, I started being more involved in academics/EC at the end of Sophomore year, which set up my trajectory for further growth Junior year.




Schedule:




AP Calculus AB (In School) (Free Period basically)

AP Calculus BC (online during school year) (5, 5 AB Sub-Score) (Also very easy)

AP US Gov (3) (Medium)

AP CS A (3) (Medium)

AP Lang (3) (Teacher died 3 months into year, so like kinda sucked)

AP Physics 2 (2) (Teacher was first time Physics teacher, and she took leave midway through year for a miscarriage :(, so we missed out on a lot)

Honors Chemistry (Cake)

Honors Spanish 2 (Same teacher as spanish 1, not as bad this time around tho, still very tough)

Schedule Difficulty Relative to School: 9/10




Extracurriculars:




Sci Oly (Placed 5th in regionals this time)

YouTube Channel (Around 40k subs now)

Environmental Awareness Club

NHS (if this counts)

SAM

Tutoring as off-to-the-side income




Leadership:




YouTube Channel

Environmental Awareness Club (Webmaster)

Regional SAM coordinator




Awards:




Distinction AP Scholar

NHS

Same ones as 9th grade




Summer after Sophomore year:




I decided to actually do a little something at least, so I took Calc III through JHU CTY (Received an A)

Took real ACT first time cold (no studying, highly recommended to get a baseline score) and got a 33 (36 M, 31 S, 31 R, 34 W)

Took Math II Subject Test, got an 800


GPA/HPA/Rank at the end of Sophomore Year:




4.0 UW

5.05 ish HPA

4/415 ish rank

I think I was a little overwhelmed when upping to 5 AP from one. I’m not sure what happened with Physics 2 to this day, but more about that later. Overall, good progress, but more needed to be done.




Junior Year:




This is where most of the stuff happened. If you are a sophomore or below, do not stress if you don’t have a lot of stuff rn. I’d say 80% of my stuff happened here. For some reason, Junior year was my easiest.




Classes:




AP Physics C: Mech (5) (Eh Difficulty)

AP Physics C: E&amp;M (5) (Harder but not hard)

AP US History (5) (Easy)

AP Micro (5) (Easy)

AP Seminar (3) (Not bad)

AP Lit (3) (Not bad)

AP Macro (4) (Teacher bad so it was tough)

AP Physics 2 (Retook exam, received a 4) 

Holocaust History Honors (Basically Free Period)

Spanish 3 Honors (Dropped after first semester due to difficulty)

MATLAB (Teacher terrible so also difficult)

Dual Enroll Linear Algebra (200-level) (Very Easy)

Dual Enroll Discrete Math (200-level) (Hardish)

Dual Enroll (JHU CTY) Abstract Math (300-level) (Hard)

Schedule Difficulty Relative to School: 9/10


Extracurriculars:




YT Channel (Around 80k now)

Sci Oly (19th at regionals lol)

Created first public solution guide to every MIT Integration Bee Qualifier Test Ever

Fundraising Head for large event ($32k raised)

Honors Calculus TA

Engineering Club

(By far largest one) Founded an AP Self-study program to connect students with other students that have taken the class already to assist them in their learning.

I’m putting testing here, cuz I did the rest during Junior Year: I took the ACT in December 2018 and April 2019. For December, I received a 33 again (35 M, 35 W, 34 R, 29 S). I was two points away from a 35 Superscore, so I decided to do it one more time. I was banking on science to get me there, as at the time, I had 36 M, 35 W, 34 R, 31 S as my superscore. I was banking on 33 S to get me there. However, my heart dropped when I saw a 32 S, but then I looked up and saw 36 W, which saved me. My last test was 36 M, 36 W, 32 S, 28 R, also a 33 composite.

Additionally, I also took Physics Subject Test and got a 760.




Leadership:




Founder of Self-Study program

Fundraising Head

Integration Bee Website founder

YT Channel

Sci Oly Vice President 




Awards:




1st in nation for national math competition

Appearance at national comicon

Oberlin College Excellence in STEM award

National AP Scholar

Top 100 in International Math Competition

NHS




Summer After Junior Year:




I did substantial stuff this summer. First, I wrote a couple of drafts for Common App and JHU Supplement essay (I had decided I wanted to ED to JHU by now). Additionally, I took a dual enrollment class (Medical Terminology, 200-level, received an A), and I also was accepted for 2 week research program at JHU (Highly recommend, it was VERY fun).

Otherwise, I finalized my college list:

JHU (ED)

Georgia Tech (EA)

Univ of Miami (EA)

Rice

CMU

Florida Atlantic Univ

UF (Also applied for Honors)

UCF (Also applied for Honors)

Brown

I got supplements for 4 of the 9 done before school started, though lots of editing occurred. I also added some UK schools in the event I was rejected from JHU ED:

UCL

Kings

Edinburgh

Manchester




GPA/HPA/Rank after Junior year

4.0 UW

5.28 W

7/400 ish?

First Semester Senior Year:

I thought this year would be a breeze. That was far from the truth, as this has definitely been my hardest year yet. Workload is insane, and there’s so much to keep track of between college, school, work, senior events, extracurriculars, etc. hence, don’t go into this year under the illusion it is easy. It is not by ANY means.

Courses:

AP Biology (WTF VERY HARD AND SO SO MUCH WORK)

AP Research (More on this later, not bad)

AP Stats (Easy)

AP Environmental Science (Hard Class, easy AP exam)

Dual Enrollment Differential Equations (200-Level, eh difficulty, nothing too insane)

Dual Enrollment (JHU CTY) Complex Analysis (300-level, HOLY THIS CLASS IS HARD PLEASE END THE SUFFERING HERE)

Dual Enrollment British Literature 1 (200-level, ALSO WHAT THE HELL VERY HARD, THIS IS MY ONLY B OF HIGH SCHOOL)

Honors Music Technology 3 (For some reason hard)

Student Aide (It’s student aide)

Schedule Difficulty Relative to School: 9/10




Extracurriculars:




For my AP Research project, I am working at world-class laboratory with one of the most well-known researchers there, studying Genomics and Genetic Testing. Paper may be published within 12 months of this posting?

Otherwise, didn’t add anything new this year, just updates on previous ones.

YT Channel was at about 85k Subs when I submitted my first application (October). Has since hit 100k

The AP Self-Study program partnered with Microsoft, so one of the heads was sent to Microsoft to teach Microsoft employees how to teach AP CS Principles

Side Note: DO NOT START ANY NEW EC IN SENIOR YEAR UNLESS IT WILL BE VERY SUBSTANTIAL WITHIN 3 MONTHS. OTHERWISE, THESE WILL HOLD ALMOST NO VALUE.




Leadership:




Vice President of Engineering Club

Everything else same as Junior Year




Awards:




National Hispanic Recognition Program (1430 PSAT)

Another National Comicon Appearance

Same for everything else




GPA/HPA/Rank for Applying to College:

GPA: 4.0

HPA: 5.29

Rank: 8/398




GPA/HPA/Rank after first semester:

GPA: 3.97

HPA: 5.33

Rank: 14/398




College Decisions:




Here were the big time moments:

Florida Atlantic Univ: This was my extreme safety, so wasn’t surprised to be accepted. Accepted with $3,000 a year in aid, so wasn’t enticing.

UCF: Accepted, with Honors College, Full Ride, and $50k. This was one that was a VERY enticing offer in the event I was rejected from JHU. At the time, this was my second choice.

Univ of Miami: Accepted with likely letter beforehand, as well as qualified for their highest scholarship (Full ride, full room and board, fully paid for study abroad and research costs). This was even more enticing than UCF, so this now replaced UCF as my number 2.

JHU: The big day, December 13. I drove home from school at 95 mph, ran a stoplight (😳), and ran indoors to see my family all huddled around the computer, waiting for me to login to the portal and open the page. I entered it very slowly, with huge doubt I would be rejected. What I saw next was “Welcome to the Class of 2024!” It validated the last 3.5 years of work I put in, and I was on top of the moon, in disbelief. Unfortunately, I did not receive any aid. However, I am grateful and fortunate that my parents had the means and were willing to support most of the tuition costs (they would only do this to my ED school; otherwise, I would be on my own for payment). 

Georgia Tech: I emailed them to rescind my application shortly after the JHU acceptance, but they never replied, so I checked the portal out of curiosity and saw an acceptance. Also thrilling, though no aid. This would not have topped Miami for second spot.

UF: Rescinded

Brown: Rescinded

CMU: Rescinded

Rice: Rescinded

All the UK Schools: Never submitted, as I was accepted to JHU.

If I had to GUESS how the rest of my applications would have turned out, this is what I would predict:

UF: Accepted with Honors

Brown: Rejected

CMU: Waitlist or Reject

Rice: Accepted or Waitlist 

Kings College London: Accepted

Edinburgh: Rejected

UCL: Accepted

Manchester: Accepted




Second Semester Senior Year:




Same classes, whole new challenge: Senioritis with increasingly difficult classes. Most of my extracurriculars are finished besides the research, AP Study Program, and NHS. However, there is still much to be done in second semester:

1: Keep up with coursework (at least somewhat) - A good general rule to follow is that whatever letter grade you have in a class, don’t fall more than one letter below it.

2: Keep up important EC’s - Don’t drop everything, as that looks terrible 

3: Financial Aid - Have an important discussion with your parents about paying for college

4: (Most importantly) HAVE FUN! - You have less than 6 months until you graduate, and, for many people, this will be the last time you see each other for a while. Cherish the memories that you have while they last. You want to look back in 20 years and say “Damn, I remember him, he was one of my close friends back in high school,” as well as keep in touch with your friends and teachers.




Tips for underclassmen:




If you have made it this far, I’m impressed. Here are some tips that I think were great for me in High School:

1: If you haven’t read the above section, do that

2: For freshman year, the most important thing is meeting people. challenge yourself while not being too socially isolated. Most students are in a similar spot as you coming in.

3: Get involved with clubs you find interesting early! This gives you time to obtain leadership and truly explore interests.

4: Take challenging classes in your AREA OF INTEREST - A college does not necessarily care if you are a Physics Major but not do so hot in AP Art History. However, they will wuestion it if you had more opportunities available in your area of interest, but didn’t take them (Ex: If you were the same Physics Major, but took Honors instead of AP Physics)

5: Get some of your testing done in Sophomore year - Your workload is lighter as a sophomore, and this is a good time to get a good amount of SAT/ACT prep done. Junior year being easy for me was an anomaly; for many, it is a difficult year.

6: Pursue competitions and awards in subjects of interest - See Point 4 for similar justification 

7: Being a leader in a club that doesn’t do anything does NOT add to your application - If I asked you which applicant you would take between A and B, which would you choose? Presume both are applying as Math Majors.

Applicant A: Head of Economics club, Key Club, History Bowl, Science Club, and Dance Club, but has not won any awards in any, two of them faded out after 1 year, and there have been no accomplishments completed by any club.

Applicant B: Head of Math Society, the largest club on campus, and has led the club to multiple regional and state competition wins.

Applicant A, while impressive they hold that many offices, has not done anything of meaning; they haven’t caused a change. Meanwhile, Applicant B, while officer of only one club, has provided strong leadership and guidance to the club to make it meaningful and competitive. 99 times out of 100, the college will choose Applicant B.

8: AP/IB/Dual Enrollment is stressful, take a break - You need to provide for yourself first before school. Your health is irreparable.

9: Form connections in High School - Meeting professionals, doing internships, doing research, and holding a job are all great ways to do this. I would not have gotten some of the leadership positions (Science Olympiad, Engineering Club, and my Research position, to name a few) if I didn’t know people that could help me obtain that. In life, it is 80% who you know and 20% what you know.

10: DO NOT THINK ABOUT COLLEGE UNTIL SOPHOMORE YEAR (AT THE EARLIEST) - You need to ENJOY high school! Balance is extremely important, and there is no point in stressing about it as a freshman or below.

11: Doing stuff just for college apps is usually seen through - It is great you want to get involved, but it is usually quite obvious to admissions officers when an activity is done solely for college admissions. Honestly, I’m a culprit too; I did Engineering Club and the fundraising thing primarily out of college apps. However, if the majority of your application is like that, it will be seen through.

12: Consider Dual Enrollment - This offers a much wider variety of College-level classes. In total, I think I took 9 or 10 Dual enrollment throughout high school. This is a great way to show further interest in an area.

13: Write most of your essays in the summer before Senior year - This is VITAL. You should have drafts for most of your colleges done before senior year, as you will be swamped otherwise. I regret not getting more done. I finished all my essays (final copies) by the end of October (Including all the RD). I finalized my ED/EA by Mid-September.

14: Consider UK Schools - Their application process is extremely predictable and easy compared to the US. They primarily look at academic achievements and test scores, so if you are a strong academic with little to no extracurriculars, this may be the route for you.

15: Make a BALANCED college list, and do not apply to too many - I would say 8-10 is a good number of colleges to apply to. I would put 2-3 safeties, 3-4 matches, and 3-4 reaches. Additionally, this should go without saying, but NO SCHOOL THAT IS T20 SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A MATCH OR A SAFETY. The admissions process is so unpredictable that you can’t rely on that as a safety or match.




If you read all of this, I’m impressed! If you have any other questions for me, or if you want to PM me any personal stuff, feel free to do so :)!

Again, thank you to A2C in helping me the last year tidy up for college admissions."

I am a Software Engineer pretty early in my career, about a year and half of experience (two if you count internships). I have been with my current company for a year and although the work environment is good, I really have no interest in the work so I have begun to apply to jobs again. I'm noticing however that I'm having a lot of trouble with my current search vs last year. Last year I made it to multiple final rounds and had calls or interviews on a weekly basis without much trouble. This time around I can hardly get a phone screen let alone an actual interview. I would be willing to share my resume to anyone who wants to see it but in my opinion my resume is strong (certainly stronger than last year being that I have more experience). Do you guys have any idea what the issue might be or have any advice for me? 

Some background on me:


-based in NYC

-internship and first job with software company working with modern web stack (Django, React)

-currently with company working with embedded systems (legacy tech mostly C, I write some tools for the developers with Java, lots of manual and automated testing as well)

-looking for job similar to first one with modern tech, leaning a bit more towards Frontend work"

We are both in our mid twenties and have been friends since high school. Long story short, my friend decided to go to graduate school for the same field as me. I was supportive of his decision until recently when he went to my boss and asked for an internship to which he agreed. My boss told me that my friend said he wanted to become his ""right hand man"" and wanted to buy the business in later years.

I'm extremely upset with my friend because he never once asked me how I'd feel if he were to work at my place of employment. I also feel like he went behind my back to push his own interests trying to become my boss's ""right hand man."" I feel so betrayed by all of this.

I'm normally direct with people in my life when they upset me. I'm having difficulty approaching this eventual conversation because I'm so mad I want to rip his head off. I'm angry even as I type this. 

How should I approach this situation with my friend?"

Have decent grades and GPA (3.45). Strongest subjects were always math and analytical courses (as opposed to design courses). I did two internships one doing design and then one doing more analysis at respected consulting firms, working with data doing analysis/visualization. After my experiences in school and my internships I started becoming more interested with data science and analytics. My favorite classes were ones involving some sort of statistical analysis. Which is why I am trying to fully transition into an analytics position, not necessarily still within the civil/transportation world.

Since graduating I have focused on learning programming (python, SQL) and becoming comfortable with different analytics programs, ideas, and things I generally see in the job postings that interest me. At this point I've read so many ""How to get into data science/analysis?"" articles that I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what is needed. I am starting to feel comfortable with my abilities to do a more data analysis job (not science or heavy machine learning role). I can do most standard/basic data analysis tasks with python, SQL, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib (all the major ones), Tableau and spatial analysis with ArcGIS. I am feeling like I can do some entry level analytics work for the right company. Also, I feel like every role is different and especially for entry level I'll never be fully prepared for exactly what that company or teams needs but I do feel prepared to develop what is needed on my own.

So, my question is when do I start going for those data analysis jobs and what is the best practices? How much do I have to know or show I know to actually have a chance at the jobs I am interested in?

I have already been applying for things because why not but have not had much luck or call backs. I have been messing with re-tailoring my resume to fit the jobs I am applying for, since my professional experience isn't directly related. One thing is I don't feel good enough about my portfolio and don't have projects to show a potential employer. Is that necessary though? I know its probably helpful if I get to a point where they even look at my GitHub. My main concern is time/energy and where to best spend it. Applying for jobs does take some time and feels like such a waste when I do not hear anything back. 

Should I hold off on the job hunt until portfolio is more impressive and I have something to show? 

I'd also love to hear from other people about strategies on career changes or getting that first job. I am flexible about industry and location, mostly focused on the experience and what skills Ill get to develop. Once I get this ball rolling my hope is to start to look into masters programs that fit my career goals, but I'd like to have some experience before going to grad school.

Thank you in advance for your help/advice!"

I've lately started to feel big. I have gained weight and my current weight is 161lbs, but I want to be between 130-140lbs. Please don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no problem with being on the bigger side if you're healthy and you're happy. It's just that I feel unhappy with myself. I'm constantly putting myself down the second I eat something sweet (soda, candy, baked goods, stuff like that) or ""bad"" for you, which makes me scared that I'm starting to go down a road that's going to develop into something dangerous. I do work out. I go to the gym with my boyfriend at least once a week right now, soon it's gonna be more since my internship ends soon and I'll have more free time.

I guess the advice I need is, how do I lose weight in a safe way? I don't wanna starve myself or go on this huge diet, I just want to know small changes I can make that's easy and doesn't require a whole lifestyle change.

fg2wxf,2,2020-03-09,Applying to PhD programs with no research,lostkid900,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/fg2wxf/applying_to_phd_programs_with_no_research/,"So, I was a bit late getting started with research. Unfortunately I suffered a concussion early this semester and am recovering very slowly. It's at the point where I will likely not be returning this semester fully and certainly won't be returning to research. So, I'm probably going to have little to no research experience by application time this fall, and definitely not going to have something published. I was a Math and Computer Science double major, but I'm likely going to have to drop Math and just do Computer Science. I will be graduating with honors which requires some independent research, but it likely won't be finished by the time applications are due, certainly won't be published by then. I also was planning on preparing for GREs this semester, but haven't been able to do that either. The more I look around here the more it seems like there's little to no chance of getting into decent programs without research experience and now I feel pretty lost as what to do.


So, long story short, I'm trying to decide what caliber graduate schools I might be able to apply for a PhD in CS without (completed) research, or if I should try to find a master's program that will fund me (and if there's an easy way to find these) then transition to a PhD after, because I likely can't afford grad school without funding. My ultimate goal is to do research in industry for a while then possibly move into academia or vice versa. I'm just not sure what's the best way to get to my ultimate goal now. I'm open to programs in the USA or Canada


Stats about me:

* I attend a top 20 CS undergrad school

* GPA: 3.9/4.0

* Have 3 recommendations from professors in the area of research (or very similar field) I'm interested in

* 2 -3 Graduate Classes completed

* 2 prior Internships, 1 with relevant experience in the area of research I'm interested, but only applications not actual research. (not sure if this really matters)

I can provide more information if necessary.

fg36ia,7,2020-03-09,I was fired from my first post-grad job today unexpectedly and with little explanation. What are my next steps? What and how can I learn from this?,TheMatriarch,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fg36ia/i_was_fired_from_my_first_postgrad_job_today/,"Hi there. 

Today I was unexpectedly fired from my first job since graduating in May 2019 with a Bachelor’s from a state school. 

I’m not *too* bent up about it. Long story short— my boss was a living nightmare. He was verbally abusive and over-dramatic. Being the only person in my department (marketing), a ton of responsibility fell on my shoulders with very little training. I am 22 years old with your average intern experience. The young woman in my position before me was 27 years old with 2 years of prior experience and I took on her “managerial” role. 

Ultimately, in these past 6 months I worked as hard as I could to keep up. 45-50 hours a week, working weekends, etc. but fell short on some deadlines. I was never formally reprimanded for these incidents. Overall, I was producing good work and so many others seemed happy with my performance. 

Recently, I’ve been through hard times. In November my father had a bout with skin cancer. In January, my grandmother (who I was very close with) passed away somewhat unexpectedly. In February, my father found out he needed a triple bypass and that surgery was last week. I am 2 and a half hours away from my hometown working a full time job, so accessing them in these times of need was difficult, especially with a demanding job. Not that it’s an excuse, but I’ll agree my performance slipped in the past few months during my time away from the office and it was hard to catch up. This was never stated by my boss, but I felt it. 

I’m wondering what my next steps are. I do want to remain in marketing/communications, but I’m still chasing the political world (which is what my concentration was in for my mass comm degree). How can I re-direct the career I have already begun? 
How can I best move on from this? What should my next steps be? I have never been fired from any job much less unexpectedly without income.  How can I learn as much as possible from this experience, all things considered? How do I explain this to potential employers? 

(FYI, I was offered the option to write a formal letter of resignation instead of being terminated. I chose to resign, because it seemed better. I wonder if that was the right choice...)"

I just came back from my midterm and I could not solve a single question that required me to implement some code. I studied, but it was a serious wake up call that I was not putting in the effort to actually pursue a future career in CS.

Honestly I’m so lost on what to get started on, what to learn, and where to go from my current position. Besides CS 1 and CS 2, I have not taken the initiative to self teach any other languages, material, etc. I want to find something that interests me (or not i dont even care at this point) and learn it for myself so that I become more comfortable with coding. 
I admit I relied on google to help me with projects and because of that, I put myself on a downhill path. Right now I definitely feel like I’m convincing myself that I understand what’s going on in my class, but when it comes to assessments my true colors show. I’m trying to understand new material but I’m relying on school far too much.

Im a junior with no internships, no resume, and feel so lost on what to do. Ive browsed subreddits, youtube, etc for ideas on what to get started on but there are SO many “basic” concepts that I just dont know. I know this is a self loathing post but I really need advice on where and how to get started; I would really appreciate it."

If I didn't get an internship this summer, I was planning on learning Javascript and building a website to hopefully become more competitive next year.

Pay not likely enough to cover most of expenses. CS position so experience does have value. Is it worth going cash negative for an internship ever?

I'm scheduled for a phone interview for an internship position in my field. My major concern is that the position is part time and doesn't pay enough to even cover 90% of my expenses (approximately). I don't know the salary range but I'm fairly certain this place may be on the lower side for St Paul MN. 

Is it worth getting internship experience and coming out cash negative after it's all said and done? When I say negative, a conservative estimate is I'll end up losing $1k-2k depending on how much doesn't go according to plan. I can afford it, however I'd very much like NOT to.

Also, I'm 100% okay with not getting this position so I feel fine with asking wages at the end of the phone interview and the potential for remote work just as a general question. I don't care if that turns them off to me. I only think they contacted me simply because nobody wants to work for them haha (likely cause it's not prestigious, low wage, or nobody applied)."

3rd Year CS major at a good school for the major. Top 10-20 ish for CS?
3.0 GPA with a few clubs/projects but nothing crazy. 
Previous internship in a software role in a biotech lab

I applied for around 30 or so internships, had a few interviews (Microsoft, HP, etc). Flat denied for about half of them, haven't heard from most of the rest, but I'm pretty sure I'm in the 'good candidate' pile for 3-4 good ones still.

I just received a software eng. internship offer from a big biotech company (think Genentech or similar) that they said I have to accept in about two weeks. Pay is equivalent to about $32/hr with the housing stipends and everything.
If you're biotech or chem eng, it's supposed to be really hard to get an internship at this company, but I don't know how it ranks as a CS major. I'm also worried that I'll get a locked into biotech stuff if I do another internship in this field.
I think I'd rather work somewhere more well known for software. I'm 90% sure IBM will request an interview soon, and I talked to an apple rep at a career event who liked me. I feel ok about 2-3 others.
If I don't get another offer before the biotech offer expires, should I just take it? I need to have something this summer, but I'd be annoyed if I get an offer at IBM or whatever in a month and can't accept it.

Can anyone speak on how well regarded a biotech software internship like this is? Or just advice on whether I should take it or not? Have most positions at tech companies been filled already? Can I try to extend the deadline to accept the biotech offer or is that unprofessional?"

I have a lot of source materials that I've compiled over the last few months that I need to go through.

My intentions to release the report to the press would most likely have been overshadowed by coronavirus. In short, there's a lot more work I have to do and the timing isn't right.

If anyone has anything they want me to look into in regards to NJPIRG or information you think would be of high value to the report, please dm me.

All I can say right now is that I've found financial documents and a trail of controversy surrounding NJPIRG. The scope and nature of this report will NOT include their summer internships. I do not have enough credible information to write about that. More to come.

First I'll explain why I'm interested, give a little backstory as to my current circumstances and what I'd like for a job, and finally some concerns.

I have always been interested in technology, primarily speaking, computer hardware. CPU's, GPU's etc. have always captured my attention, and computer components are what had initially piqued my interest in computer hardware engineering as a career. While not exclusively computer components, I have always been much more interested in, what I suppose is component design, rather than any software design. (I work at Geek Squad and get excited when techs are backed up enough that I'm required to perform a repair lol)

Now this is not to say this is necessarily my dream career. I've taken a year off between high school and college, in order to secure a job, and explore what I enjoy (have always enjoyed music, etc). In complete honesty I'm still not 100% sure what I want. Of course I want to fill fulfilled in my career, but I also need to make a living. However, there are a few factors that have me leaning towards something in this or a related field. First, my girlfriend and I currently live in Arkansas, and desperately want to get away. She wants to pursue a career in film, and I want to support her in that. The issue being this would require a move to a metropolitan area, say somewhere in California. As it so happens, these (metropolitan areas) is where the vast majority of computer engineering jobs are located. This would also require a well paying, and mostly stable job, which if a job can be acquired in these areas, is often the case as far as my understanding goes. 

My primary concern are as follows. First, I understand that computer engineering is a large mixture of hardware and software development. This is where the line is blurred between me pursuing electrical engineering, vs. Computer engineering. Second, (especially being in Arkansas where there are few,if any internships) I'm a bit concerned about actually getting a job in the field out of school. Many Jobs are either for senior engineers, or require far more knowledge/experience than I will learn from say, the University of Arkansas.

I'm aware there's a lot going on in this post, but what are y'alls thoughts? Does it sound like Computer Engineering is something that might be a good fit for me? What are the chances of actually landing a job after school? Anything of not for someone in my situation? Thanks in advance."

* getting disproportionately angry when I violated her 10pm curfew
* non-stop nagging about how my work is ruining my health and that I should quit my job; getting panicky when I stay up late for work/ fall sick, both of which should not have triggered such ridiculous response. *Mom I'm just feverish, not dying.*
* keep giving me supplements/ herbal teas and lecturing the whole family day-in day-out on health facts and nutritional values
* telling me that she is worried when I drive back home from the train station too late, and if this happens again due to work, the whole family will wait for me at the station (I'm pretty sure one day if I were sexually assaulted, she would blame it on what I wear or the time I come home)

I keep thinking that it is because she has always hold tight to her identity as a wife and mom and she does not know how to let go when her kids are all grown-up. She has so much free time on her hands and suddenly her kids don't need her anymore and she doesn't have friends or hobbies.

It's futile to change her so what I have done is to limit talking time to her. It's sad when kids with controlling parents end up at the extremes, either suppressed/subdued or have anger management issues (I'm the latter). Maybe I'm overgeneralizing.

We are hosting a cousin who is doing a short term internship, and my mom's craziness has affected him as well. She never likes him because he isn't academically-inclined and he is overweight so she does things that hurt him. Yesterday, she reheated all our dishes because he ate without using serving spoons (he used his own spoon to take the dishes). The way she lectured him was unnecessarily mean. My cousin was hurt because he was treated like he was dirty and he left the house for a while. My mom became ""hurt"" by his actions (lol why) and wouldn't stop talking to me about it, wanting me to take her side but I refused to engage. I was like wtf mom, go fly a kite.

Sorry for such a long post. I know the only way is to leave my home. I am planning to further my studies or to look for a job abroad soon (cuz our country's economy is tanking lol). If you are dealing with parents like mine, please do share how you engage with them. I cannot envision a close relationship with her anymore because I hold different values from her. I don't want her to further complicate my life especially if I have my own family in the future, which I know she'd be delighted to interfere with.

From the age of 15 to 17, I worked as a junior office assistant, while finishing my studies at school. After that, I did some internships in college, and started working as a writer on a website. I managed to get enough money to buy a car (with some help from my father, who willingly gave me something like 35% of the price of the car), and I was able to maintain a considerably good life, without asking so much money from my parents. They paid for my college, but I never stopped working to pay for my things.

I finished college at 22, and never managed to work in my field.  After the internships, the work as a writer started to decline, and I found myself in a very delicate situation. I started to depend more on my parents, and Im no longer a teenager.  I tried to get a job, and I got absolutely nothing. So I decided to dedicate myself and study for the public service. I don't know how it works in the USA, but in my country to work for the government you have to take a test, a very difficult one, and if you do well, you are hired and you cannot be fired unless you do something serious.  They don't pay badly, and it's stable. 

I never thought I could do it, but I did. I passed the test and Im waiting to be called to start my new position. 

It is a high school position, lower than my level of study, but I am happy anyway. In the future, I can improve. The problem, however, is that I'm terrified of the change that will happen in my life. To work, I will move to a city located 85 miles from here.  Because of this, and the wage that isnt that great, my parents told me that they are willing to help me find a place to stay, and they even talked about helping me buy or rent a house.  Im happy to be close to achieving the dream of leaving my parents' house, but at the same time afraid of not being able to deny their help. I am not going to earn enough to buy a house alone, or even to keep a rent together with other expenses (like car, trips to my hometown, etc.).  Well, would you accept help? Am I being a spoiled kid if I accept this help, instead of reducing my bills as much as possible, accepting a ""reduction"" in my life quality and so on in order to permanently cut my financial relationship with my parents?"

**Me:**

Nationality: Canadian

University: Well known Canadian school

Year: Sophomore

GPA: 3.1/4.0

Started programming months (~8?) before University

&amp;#x200B;

**Internship Stats:**

Applied to \~150 American companies and \~100 Canadian companies. Didn't get any referrals.

Sankey Diagram: [https://imgur.com/V9tLxJl](https://imgur.com/V9tLxJl)

Applications: 255

Rejections: 101

Ghosted: 106

Responses: 48

Coding Challenges: 40

Automated Interviews: 4

Phone Interviews: 4

Technical Interviews (!Onsites): 16

Onsites: 9

Offers: 3 (Two startups, One Big-N)

Accepted: Big N

&amp;#x200B;

**What Worked:**

I'll outline some things that helped me:

\- Cold emails were really useful. I used Clearbit and [Huntr.io](https://Hunter.io) to find recruiters emails and would give them a brief summary about myself and why I'm a good fit for the company. The most important thing  here is that you want to show what you can do for the company, not what the company can do for you. Furthermore, I used Clearbit's email tracking to see if/when my emails were opened. I only did this to ensure Clearbit and [Huntr.io](https://Hunter.io) were giving me valid email addresses.

\- To find internships, I used: Google jobs, Indeed, Angellist, Linkedin, Glassdoor, [https://github.com/ChrisDryden/Canadian-Tech-Internships-Summer-2020](https://github.com/ChrisDryden/Canadian-Tech-Internships-Summer-2020), [https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships](https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships)

\- I used Angellist to find part-time, remote internships during the semester so I could have some more experience on my resume

\- Worked on cool projects

\- r/csMajors discord (Ty chupps)

&amp;#x200B;

**Resume:**

\- I'll make an anonymized resume if people want

\- Interviewers at the Big N company seemed to like my projects the most from my resume (this sentiment was true amongst \~50% of my interviewers

\- My GPA is quite low (3.1) but I left it on my resume for the hell of it. It's probably under a 3.0 now lmao

\- I've interned for a startup x2 remotely during the semester so that was the main experience on my resume. I included a student startup I worked for too but I doubt it bought me any votes

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview Prep:**

\- Self taught myself the data structures and algorithms that I didn't learn in first year

\- Leetcode stats: 46 Easy, 32 Medium, 2 Hard :)

\- I read a bit of EPI and CTCI to help me understand DS &amp; A better. Also practiced whiteboard interviews. Geeks4Geeks was probably my number one information source. I think next year I'm going to use things like [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) more

&amp;#x200B;

**Wrap-up:**

As a sophomore studying in Canada, who's Canadian, it's difficult to get internships in America. Even Canadian companies prefer juniors over you. Although, with a lot of work and some luck, getting an internship isn't too difficult. Don't give up either, I was so close to just doing summer school because I couldn't land an offer but decided to try for one more month (it worked!). Good luck if you're still looking!

- EDIT
Really sorry that a bunch of shit is omitted. I felt it gave away too much.

Too many. I am very lost in terms of how I want to apply my skills sustainably. If I am to be honest with myself, I got into computer science because it helps me to understand computer history and dissect/restore my favorite games, and because I genuinely love the complexity of the technology and how everything developed. I'm just not sure that I could have a sustainable career with this, but I have no industry experience and no idea what to expect.

My dream job would be to remaster and preserve video games. I have the art skills and experience with texture upscaling and 3D graphics, and I have the patience to dissect a game engine (maybe not on my own, but I'd love to work with people on it). I would love to reach the point where I can do this professionally, but I don't know what path to take to reach that point. Part of me feels like I'm wasting my time by obsessing over obsolete technology, but I genuinely feel that computer history needs to be archived and old computers need to be preserved. I feel apathetic about getting an internship at a big corporation. I kinda want to see the old mainframes that the IRS is running and maintain them (not that I want to work with the IRS, but I like the idea of like digital archeology).

My current plan is to find an internship/part time at some tech place, possibly to do with 3D art, and get my feet wet with an industry job before I take a big risk, but I feel like there might be a place that I would love working at and I'm just not looking hard enough. It seems like most of what I want to do is on a volunteer basis, but people are able to port games professionally, so there's gotta be something to that."

The company I got offered a job in also trains it's employees in different computer science streams, ranging from Data Science to MEAN stack development. Once my internship is complete, I get to choose whether I want to join as a minor developer or as an educator. 

The developer works on a part of a huge project and since I'm a fresher (I will graduate this May) they say I'll most likely get a maintenance or testing role.

The  educator gets to learn a lot, designs courses for the employees, trains them in their specific field and also have some specific projects like a chat bot and so on. 

I'm confused between the two. I like to teach but I also love to code. I'm not sure what role I should choose because if I ever need to switch, as an educator role, it'll be difficult to get into production while on the production line, I'm not sure if I'll get to work on a live project for at least six to eight months in the company. 

I'd really like some insight on this. I'd love to elaborate more if you guys want some more information."

I am a junior at a small state school and I have very little experience. The only CS experience I have is a club at my school which focuses mainly on programming mobile/web applications (we also teach other students and lead project development). I kind of procrastinated last year and didn’t apply on time, while I should have had some sort of internship over the summer I just worked a retail job for cash since It was too late. Something hit me during the summer, where I started to take things seriously and I began to focus on getting an internship. I have applied to 100+ internships over this semester since September and I have only had a couple interviews, nothing really came out of them. I tried my best by practicing everything I knew, polishing up my resume, building a react portfolio website, but nothing seemed to work. 

So I am currently in this situation, I have no work experience in computer science but I believe myself to be fairly knowledgeable with many languages and frameworks. I am about to become a senior and still didn’t get an internship and I do not know what to do. I practice leetcode, work on side projects in my spare time, and am a member at a local club which primarily codes. 

Do I just do what I did last semester in terms of applying and just keep working on my side projects? Btw I am still actively applying to internships but I think it is too late. Any tips or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t get into the program and I expect to wait for at least another 4-6 weeks about being admitted or not.

I’m constantly sad that I’m finishing my undergrad and there’s only a month left with all my friends. Many of them plan on living in the same city which makes me feel left out.

I have plans for most of the summer and they’re all based around me attending this graduate program. I don’t know what I would do in September if I didn’t get in. I have no clue. Finding a job in my field in September is difficult and it’s possible I could be out of work for 5 to 7 months.

fgdskt,0,2020-03-10,Problems with today's engineering school curriculum and my proposed solution (let's have a discussion!),comptonrj,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/fgdskt/problems_with_todays_engineering_school/,"Now that I am graduating in May, I wanted to throw this idea out here that's been brewing for the past couple years. This is just for the purposes of interesting discussion and sharing experiences, at this point I have no intention of attempting to implement this. As a mechanical engineer, it will be somewhat geared toward that, but I think its applicable to other engineering disciplines. Yes this is long, but I am really interested in people's thoughts, and if they have had similar ideas. 

It starts here: How many of you heard a professor, or industry person, or recent grad say something like, ""Even though I'm not using much of what I learned in school, that's OK because what engineering school actually does is teach you problem solving""

Now that sounds nice, but whenever I heard that I thought, ""Are you kidding me?"" So you are telling me all those countless hours grinding out rote math and physics practice problems, and studying for exams, and doing projects, really wasn't that important? If the goal was to learn generic ""problem solving"" then we might as well have done puzzles and played chess for 4 years. What was the point of that specific study of engineering topics? And it does seem based on what I have learned (including the job I will be starting in May), that many many engineers don't use much of the specific knowledge they learned in school. 

So this frustration led me to think of how this discrepancy between what engineering students learned and what they did in the field could be fixed. For engineers, this seems like a pretty inefficient education solution, right?

1.) As one of the older engineers said at my internship this past summer, ""They basically train you for grad school these days."" The first part of this proposal is to offer a grad school tract and an industry track. If students choose the grad school track, then the structure of everything would stay exactly the way it is. The ""industry tract"" is what I am interested in.

2.) The main purpose of this plan is making sure to teach students actual skills that will be useful in the workplace, not just knowledge. Though engineering is more practical than a business degree, you still don't come away with any specific skillsets, just a bunch of generic knowledge, most of which you forget anyway (except that 10% of super smart people out there). 

3.) So the big change is that every class would be totally project based. All learning of the concepts of the topic would be done through carefully designed projects. Why? Because this mirrors the workplace. Few, if any, engineers in industry will be doing practice problems and timed tests. Unfortunately this is the actual ""skill"" many students come out of school with. But I have never seen that on a job description. If the skill we want students to have is ""problem solving"" let's design a curriculum that actually reflects that goal. 

4.) Now because of this format, less material of a particular subject matter will be covered in a semester. Instead of getting through 7 chapters of the thermo book (and remembering none of it) maybe you would only get through 3-4. But who cares? If the goal of engineering school is problem solving then it doesn't really matter how much thermo material you walk away with (again most people forget 75% anyway in the current model). Plus only a small number of student will end up in an industry where its necessary. And its definitely true that learning through practice leads to greater retention than uncontextualized random information. So students are more likely to remember what they do cover. 

5.) Additionally, things like machine shop skills, 3D printing, and actually building stuff would be a required part of the curriculum/projects, etc. Not just extracurricular things. As a mech. Eng., how many companies have a I seen who want experience in machine shop? But I never had to do it, and I didn't realize until too late how important it was. 

6.) So, the projects would have to be carefully designed to force students to learn the req'd concepts in order to do well on the project. In my experience about 10% of the class actually pays attention in lecture. The rest are sleeping or on their phone. So let's eliminate lecture! If it doesn't work, throw it out. The professor might spend 1 or 2 intro lectures to introduce the topic, give relevant textbook chapters, and textbook problems. The rest of the class time would be workdays. The textbook problems would be given with solutions so students could reverse engineer what they specifically need for their design to work. Again, the point of engineering school isn't to become good at practice problems, but to problem solve and apply knowledge. 

7.) I have a previous degree in fine arts. One thing that I think would be very useful in the spirit of developing actual skills and not knowledge, would be to have fine arts style critiques of each project. The team would present the project, and then the class/professor would give feedback. How to improve design efficiency? Cost? Simplicity? Functionality? Aesthetic qualities?

8.) Overall, I think this structure better prepares students for industry. It recognizes some of the inefficienies and flaws with the current system and seeks to fix them. Yes, students will cover less material, but again, most students forget 75% of what they learned and this is expected even be employers. Through hands-on learning students will retain more of what they do learn. If an engineer needs to get more knowledge in thermo or materials science, they will get that on the job, as they do now. So I say let's stop wasting student's time and money, make employers happier, and use our engineering problem solving skills not just for our work, but for our education."
fgdxf3,226,2020-03-10,Unsure of how to flex now that classes will be online? Read here.,HarvardDating,Harvard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/fgdxf3/unsure_of_how_to_flex_now_that_classes_will_be/,"By now I'm sure you're all aware that classes after spring break will be held virtually. ""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies."

It was pretty hard getting this internship despite have many projects and having experience with a lot of technologies especially since my school doesn’t have an internship program until 3/4th year. It’s been 9 weeks and I have 7 weeks to go. It started off kind of slow because this company has a lot of private health data, but eventually I started coding and at first it was more interesting since it’s new stuff and I was getting familiar with everything. 

However it’s getting quite boring now and this is concerning me because I love coding and software development and my side projects are proof of that. For example, Last summer I developed a flutter mobile app that got 2000+ users and interviewed at y combinator for it. My point is I enjoy coding and I am great at it (not trying to sound cocky). Even right now I’m working on a side project after work with a few people but obviously don’t have as much time as I did in the summer. Also do not feel as motivated probably because it’s coding at work then coding right after.

I think the reason it’s getting boring is due to a few things. First, the companies entire system is pretty much just batch processing so essentially generating reports and processing files etc and then sending them to another application where healthcare providers can access them. So this clearly can get Boring quick since you’re doing the same thing without much creative thought, ie create the basic classes, interfaces, mappers, map the data from the db table, generate the report (May also include designing the report which I don’t like since it’s not even coding), release it and test etc. So my job is to basically refactor how this legacy application has been generating its reports from oracle reports to jasper. So there are many reports that need to be done, all pretty much the same processes. Now, because I love coding and problem solving sometimes I still enjoyed some aspects of this like even debugging I enjoyed it sometimes but when it gets to be the same shit with no creativity I am starting get bored. 

My main concern is are all software jobs like this? Is this why people tend to keep switching jobs? Am I experiencing this boredom because coding is starting to get boring to me or is this just the job? Also do I only enjoy coding new things for the first time? These are all concerns I’m getting and now I’m thinking should I even try and do another internship or will I get 
another job where I feel my skills are not utilized. 

FYI, even one of the senior devs was doing the same tasks. I was also considering maybe trying product management intern roles but at the same time I really think I enjoy coding when it’s not like this... any thoughts/suggestions?

Edit: I’ve been told most software jobs are maintenance and if so my experience seems like one that many developers experience? If this is the case working at a bigger tech company where new projects and features are developed or perhaps a custom software development company or a contracting position would be more enjoyable right? Or perhaps a startup which is higher stress and less stability which is why I think most of people at this company are all 35+ who seem to just be here for the chill factor since you can actually work from home up to 3 days a week and most people take advantage of that and relax."

However, I figured I might as well try. After I exhausted all the immediate and more relevant possible positions (Business analyst intern, IT intern, etc.), I started just throwing my resume to the wall to see what sticks, lol. I've applied to sales, marketing, and even media internships. These aren't necessarily the pathways I want to go with my degreee. However I just got an email from an HR person about a marketing intern position I recently applied to. I know interviews are far from guarantees, but if I was offered the internship, is it something that would even help me get a job I want in the future? I'm thinking of being a business analyst, Project manager, maybe even a software developer, etc."

So I was an intern for a big bank for a year and I was gonna return as FTE upon my graduation this summer.

But it happens that the CEO announced layoffs and cost-cutting strategies which ultimately lead to the hiring freeze within the institution. Now after knowing that I went to my manager to talk more about this and as a conclusion, it turns out that he couldn't do much and cannot certainly hire me back due to the hiring restrictions throughout.

I invested my time there expecting to return upon my graduation but now I can't just because of cost-cutting strategies. I have to look elsewhere finding a job and not going back to where I loved to work/ belonged to.

Now, I was thinking to email the CEO stating my situation about this matter and see if anything can be done. Is this a good idea to take this concern up to the CEO? If yes, what details should I include in the email? I read some articles on how to email the CEO, the first-line, subject line, and other things but your inputs would be valuable and helpful.

I'm an international student (study permit more than 6 months) in Montreal, Quebec. I recently got an offer for a paid internship for 4 months and my employer just sent me all the documents I have to fill, between them, a TD1 form, and a form for Revenue Quebec.

I have a couple of doubts regarding the TD1 form:

- there is a basic personal amount that can be claimed by  every resident of Canada. Is this like a tax credit and, being a temporal resident, can I claim (write in the form) this amount? 

- in page 2, there is a box to check if your total income is less than total claim amount. It says ""check this box if your total income for the year.. will be less than the total claim amount."". Does this mean the actual income that I'm going to receive, or the annual salary that is written in my offer (even though I'm only working 4 months). Should I check this box since my tuition that I'll pay this year plus the basic personal amount will be more than my income? Does this mean my employer will not deduct taxes from my salary?

Will I still pay taxes for Quebec?

Since I'm relatively new here I'd really appreciate any help."

I don't plan on asking her out until her Internship ends just incase she says no and don't have to deal with the awkwardness of seeing each other everyday but what i really wanted to know was, How do i become more charismatic and more outspoken around her because i'm an introvert and rather quiet around people until i get really comfortable with a person but usually through one on one communication or texting. This used to bother me but i learnt to accept that about myself.

Whenever she and i talk at lunch usually around some co-workers sometimes she'll make comments about me always being quiet all the time. I do try and talk more but then sometimes i come across as dry and low energy. For example other people jokingly ship us together but then she justs brushes it off (not in a rude way or i'm not interested vibes tho), when people do this i always think of flirting with the idea but i just can't come up with the words and just remain quiet and let her do the talking.

Since we rarely talk one on one and usually around other people i can't really get comfortable with her like that and the only time we see each other is around lunch. I would really like some advice on how to became a bit more charismatic and less quiet around her until i finally ask her out?"

Actually, I'm living with my best friend and his family, that is like a family for me and they treat me like family too.  


  
I'm at college and working as an intern (making about R$600 monthly + R$600 in benefits for transport and food). I'm safe where I'm living and although I try to pay my portion to them, his mother doesn't accept, so I spend it buying food for the house when she's not there, because I know how much one person more will cost her.  


The thing is, I know they would not kick me out and his mother is willing to let me in for a long period. But I don't want to feel like a parasite, and I'm already 19. I have my girlfriend, that is having family troubles too (his mother is a JUSTNOMIL, narcissistic and entitled person). She's 19 too and is working, she makes about R$1100 without benefits. She's thinking about moving out too.  


But Idk what to do. I know that I'll need to change my job to a full-time, but Idk if I can handle college at the same time (my classes are really heavy, I have a lot of homework always, I'm studying System Analysis and I want to become a developer). I'm thinking about saving a good amount and go rent a house with her, but I'm afraid that this could hurt our relationship, and that we're too young for this type of relationship responsibility. Like, maybe renting alone would be a better idea. We're only 5 months together, but our relationship is fucking great, we never had a discussion, every time we had a conflict we always discuss it calmly with each other, and always recognize our mistakes and apologize, and change things that can hurt each other.  


But like I said, I don't want to be a parasite on my best friends home, he and his mother are doing me a big favor, a giant favor, and I want to be independent. And she can't hold herself on her house anymore, her mother are just abusing. If there was a option that I could make her and her mother live in peace, I would, but I really think there's no way to do that.  


I would appreciate any advice on this matter. Be it emotional, financial, anything. I need to create a plan on what I'm going to do for the next months and I just don't know where I want to be in the near future."

fgl7l9,9,2020-03-10,Complimented someone who I barely know.,sinnidis_97,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/fgl7l9/complimented_someone_who_i_barely_know/,"A year ago, an intern joined joined my workplace for the summer ,fortunately or unfortunately there were no managers available to assist her during her internship, so I was assigned to supervise her.From my time that I have spent with her I could tell she was smart and had a can-do attitude. And I really respected her for that. Apart from her work ethic she is also very cute. She has this funny habit of of putting her her hair in her teeth if she makes a mistake, makes wide eyes whenever she doesent understand what I am explaining to her . We both have similar age, give or take 3 years
So anyway, I wanted to ask her out but since she is doing her internship here and I happen to supervise her I didn't want to make things awkward by asking her out and the next day while she is forced to interact with me. So I thought to myself that I would ask her the last day right before she leaves. Unfortunately she cane for a week, and stopped coming all of a sudden for unknown reason. 

A year had passed and she joins as an intern once again and this time as part of her college ciruculum probably (not exactly sure about that). 
And this time she was placed under a senior level manager. I sort of assumed that maybe the reason she left last time was because maybe she wasn't somehow comfortable with me , but to the best of my knowledge I was very proffesional. I barely talked to her about her life outside the office. 

Since I  never talked to her, I thought let's not ask her out. But instead just compliment her. 
I thought to myself ""She's not my subordinate anymore, we  never really see each other at the office right now anyway so what's the harm in just complimenting her. And if things get awkward she never really has to see me. Besides who knows, maybe she might like it"" . I have complimented women before this but never someone from workplace. And that was my first mistake. I thought the same rules somehow apply here as well.

Anyway I rehearsed the words inside my mind over and over again. She left the office and was outside. I approached her outside.

I asked he I she remembered me. And she said she did. I was sort of relieved

I asked her about her college and what she was working on. She went on to explain that.

It was now time for my confession
These were more or less the words that came out
""so, i had something to tell you""
Her face turns curious

""please don't take this the wrong way, we're all very proffesional here and I don't want you to get the wrong idea""
Her face turns into concerned look

""I just wanted to say you look beautiful and that I have had crush on you since day 1.""
I will never forget the look she had on her face for the rest of my life. She was embarrassed mixed with a sense of pity, like she would do anything, ANYTHING to try and get out of there.But I didn't stop there

"" if you ever want to hang out just meet me at xyz cubicle.""
and after looking at how her face changed I was shit scared and I added "" so yeah, please don't take this the wrong way. ""

These were more or less the same words that came out of my mouth .
She left there. And so did I. 

 I went home feeling guilty as fuck on how she might have felt. I mean imagine if you were a woman and you considered someone as your mentor, just to realise he secretly had a crush on you. What if he gave me attention only because I was a woman. 
 My mind was racing that entire night. 


Our next encounter at the office, I completely avoided  eye contact. I wanted to explain myself to her but I thought it would only make things worse. Case in point , that evening while I was working she dashed right past my cubicle while leaving for home. Now, I don't know the exact reason why she left that way,i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she had a train to catch .But I think she is most likely avoiding me.

Tl;Dr Met an intern who I barely knew at work place . Complimented her and made things awkward. 
 
I don't have any hopes on her. But did I make a mistake complimenting her ?

Me: I'm a software developer who has been trying to find a path to specialize but can't do one without wanting to try others.

I'm currently working for a consultancy agency and thanks to that I'm able to pay my monthly expenses but it's not like I'm earning much more than that. I have been assigned to a project where I was told I would be doing both, technical and functional tasks. However, truth be told, pretty much all I do is user manuals and some shitty documents no one ever reads to comply with a heavy methodology the client requires. Been here for some months and I've expressed my discomfort about the situation more than once just to get empty promises that things will change and get better. This project has been going on for more than seven years and it doesn't seem like it's going to end any time soon. It also doesn't appear like my employer has any intention of moving me to another kind of project.

I've been looking for job offers but even for junior positions I'm getting asked for x months of experience in particular technnologies that I don't really have and then I get rejected. I can't afford to work on an internship or something like that because I'm the only income at home. However, everyday I feel more insecure about my own programming abilities and this is making me feel trapped.

Should I start looking to start once again as a first job in another company?

Can you please give me some advice?

My current GPA is 2.58, and the tests aren't really helping. I calculated how much it would be if I were to get all A's in my remain subjects, it becomes 3.59.. and well, judging from my terrible academic performance, I don't think I can actually achieve that even with the vast amount of studying I do every day (because I still end up getting bad scores anyway) besides a 3.59 still looks like an incompetent GPA if compared to the other prospective applicants to a scholarship.

The reason why I'd need a scholarship is that I'll probably need something to aid my master's tuition outside of the country, as well as internships since I'll probably have to pay for them applying with such a GPA.

I know I am too obsessed with the whole GPA thing, but it's really the only escape from this country, especially that I'm in no position to afford anything even out of my parents' pockets.

I'm trying to join in some local competitions to make up for the GPA, but I really have no idea whether if that would make any difference.

Two years ago I had my ""dream internship"" in an area I loved and would knew when I left that I would seriously consider going back to work there full time when I graduated. About a month ago I put my feelers out to see if they were hiring. The hiring manager seemed to jump at the opportunity to hire a new graduate the firm was already familiar with and made me an offer within a week. This was all fantastic and everything I could have hoped for, but it all seemed to happen so quick that I don't feel like I gave all my options a shot. There's still part of me that wants to stay close to home, as this other job is on the other side of the country. I did some research in hindsight and found some firms I could also see myself being happy with closer to home, but I'm not sure it's worth risking the perfectly good opportunity currently in front of me, especially when there's no guarantee I'd even get a job with these any of these other firms anyway. With there being two years between now and the time I was last there, its hard to feel the excitement of it as prominently, but I'm not sure if that's necessarily an indicator that I don't want to be there anymore or just the matter of time itself, so I'm kind of having to trust a past version of myself in this decision as well. The unknowns of each situation make it hard to see things clearly. Has anyone been in a similar situation or could give me their thoughts?"

I’ve been working in IT generally for about 7 years, but never went to college. Went straight from high school to working at a local mom &amp; pop computer repair store. I did that for 3 1/2 years making at most $13.50 an hour. 

Flash forward several years, I went through a workforce program called YearUp, got a 6 month internship with a big company, and used connections I got from there afterwards to get my first big corporate job doing IT deskside support for another fortune 500 company, which has been awesome. I’m nearing my 2 year anniversary next month.

I got hired on making $23 an hour (hourly role), which was more than I ever hoped to make without college (Atlanta, GA for context), and have already gotten raised to making $24.80. Benefits and PTO system are great too! I even get to work around 45 hours a week, with time and a half overtime. My base salary is around 50K, but overtime puts me closer to 60K by the end of the year. 

I actually REALLY love my job, the people I work with, and feel as FAR as possible from being burnt out, and my manager loves my work. I even get to play video games at work during downtime or go on reddit if we don’t have any customers, which is awesome. 

I just worry about where to go next. It feels like no future job could compare to this, but my manager wants to see me grow into cybersecurity, management or something like that.

One of them is related to investments and trading. The other one is accounting related. Should I pursue these unpaid internships if I do not get a paid internship? Also how can I get hired after graduation without an internship experience. Should I give my CFA Level 1 in June 2021 or get a get a job first?

Seeing that I'm going to need to do personal projects and want to work an internship, I was thinking of taking a Skillshare Java course and buying a good Java book over the summer so I can learn over the summer. I'm trying my best in the class now, but between my other courses and my job, I have very little time to just sit down and problem solve, which at this point takes me a while. 

Did anyone else study programming over the summer? Do you think it helped you develop better programming skills?"

I joined my current company in November after graduating in May last year because of shitty US job market and me being an international student. Another classmate of mine, the said ""friend"", was unemployed till January of this year. So, even though I knew that he was not the best candidate for a role at my company, I pleaded with my boss to give him a chance. My boss decided to offer him an internship before converting it to a full-time job and my friend accepted it. All good!

He started the job in February 2nd week and from the moment he turned on his computer, he was lost like a teenage boy going down on a girl for the very first time. He screwed up the most basic of projects, couldn't answer simple conceptual questions and set back a project by weeks. I always tried to cover him saying he needs more time to learn, he will catch up etc. I even ended up doing a part of his project because he couldn't. Fortunately, he received a full time offer last week from another company and gave his resignation letter. He just had to serve the 2 weeks of mandatory notice period.

This is when the actual fuck up happened. This guy wanted to enjoy a break before beginning his new job, so did not want to serve the notice period. So yesterday (Monday) morning, without any rational thought, he told my boss that his friend in California was infected with coronavirus and the cops had called him to go for a test immediately as he was staying with that friend till last month and likely to have coronovirus. My boss, and everyone, justifiably, panicked and told him to leave immediately and let us know of the test results ASAP. That was the last we heard of him on that day. He ignored texts, emails, calls, any mode of communication like an ex girlfriend after a breakup. We called hospitals, police station, CDC, any remote source, to verify where he went, what tests are done, what are the results, but we got nothing.

Today (Tuesday) morning, my boss decided to pay him a visit as none of us had gotten over the panic he set in. I do not exactly know what went down there, but my boss came in an hour later telling that everything is okay, and gave me a disapproving look which I can only think it meant ""You made me hire this asshole"". After probing my boss for several minutes, we all got the idea that it was basically just a scam. My boss asked for his negative test results, he said the hospital didn't give him any record. Boss asked him how did the cops take him there, he told by Uber ffs! All afternoon, I have just avoided talking to my boss for long in case this conversation ever comes up. I kind of feel guilty for this whole debacle, but swear to god I did not have an idea that he would be this dumb!

Tl;dr - Pleaded with my boss to give a job to my incompetent friend, incompetence turned out to be the least of his worries. He quit within a month, said he is a presumed positive case for coronavirus just to avoid the notice period, which turned out to be a sham."

I'm a junior in high school, and for the past 2.5 years (9th-11th) I struggled with depression. My mental health really affected my academic motivation/drive so my overall gpa came out to a 2.9/3.0 unweighted. but a few months ago, I started going to weekly counseling, taking medication, and my mental health improved drastically. It was the 2nd quarter of my junior year, and at the time I was feeling much happier. Classes were really hard before, because I lacked the drive to study, complete hw, and pay attention, but during my second quarter I was able to work really hard, stay motivated, and received A's in all classes (3 of which were AP Lang, Ap Bio, and Ap Calc). I also constantly studied within a 3 week period for the SATs, and was able to receive a 1590. Receiving the 1590 put me in the 99th percentile, which motivated me and gave me more confidence that I would be able to get into some of my colleges of interest. At the same time, I still tend to think the worst of things and overthink these situations for many hours at a time. Although I know my SAT is very high, my GPA on the other-hand is quite low for the schools I am interested in. I am uncertain about all the colleges I want to go to, but I like business, and I would love to be able to go to a school like UCLA, Berkeley, UW Business, NYU, etc. For all of those schools, the GPA standards are very high, even if my SAT is high. I am uncertain whether I have chances to gain admission from any of them, but I might be wrong. I also found that if I am able to take subject tests and perform well on those, they will help me. Next year I am going to take 6 APS (cs, lit, gov, chem, calc bc, physics) and I am going to quit my jobs, and give it my all to receive a 3.7-3.8+ to help my chances for these types of colleges. I also have volunteered at various things such as mission trips, church events(every year since 7th grade), red cross lifeguard certified and CPR certified, I will also take a business internship this summer. From what I found from other people and online resources, is that the sat and gpa are the first steps to helping my process, and the essay and ec's are most important? I'm not sure if I will have enough ec's, so should I try to get more, and what ec's would carry the most weight? In the end, the most important question for me is: will I have the chances to get into these schools? My low GPA makes me feel that I will not be able to gain admission, but I really do not know much about these colleges and whats most important in this process. Many of my friends have told me that I will have no chance with a 3.0, which is one of the reasons I do not have much confidence(I sadly become really affected by my peers words and thoughts directed toward me). I would also like to know what type of things people should write to create the most impact for the essay? I heard I do not want to write about depression? Whatever advice you guys have, I would truly appreciate it, and if I have said anything wrong or harmful in any shape or form, tell me right away.

EDIT/ADDITIONAL COMMENT: as you know, im interested in business. so for the past 3-4 years, I’ve been reselling clothes and shoes constantly, and ive sold over $10,000+/around 14-15k, and im assuming this might help but let me know. it was just me buying for low and selling for a much higher rate after spending hours at a time to find a good deal to flip. so yea it came up to $10,000+ through individual sales. I don’t exactly have proof though since it’s been through texts and things like that(over the years), but I definitely have legitimate proof of at least $3000-$3500 in sales that are recorded online. any of this help too?"

I'm 24 and graduating from my masters program this spring. Two years ago I had my ""dream internship"" in an area I loved and would knew when I left that I would seriously consider going back to work there full time when I graduated. About a month ago I put my feelers out to see if they were hiring. The hiring manager seemed to jump at the opportunity to hire a new graduate the firm was already familiar with and made me an offer within a week. This was all fantastic and everything I could have hoped for, but it all seemed to happen so quick that I don't feel like I gave all my options a shot. There's still part of me that wants to stay close to home, as this other job is on the other side of the country. I did some research in hindsight and found some firms I could also see myself being happy with closer to home, but I'm not sure it's worth risking the perfectly good opportunity currently in front of me, especially when there's no guarantee I'd even get a job with these any of these other firms anyway. With there being two years between now and the time I was last there, its hard to feel the excitement of it as prominently, but I'm not sure if that's necessarily an indicator that I don't want to be there anymore or just the matter of time itself, so I'm kind of having to trust a past version of myself in this decision as well. The unknowns of each situation make it hard to see things clearly. Has anyone been in a similar situation or could give me their thoughts?"

Me: I'm a software developer who has been trying to find a path to specialize but can't do one without wanting to try others.

I'm currently working for a consultancy agency and thanks to that I'm able to pay my monthly expenses but it's not like I'm earning much more than that. I have been assigned to a project where I was told I would be doing both, technical and functional tasks. However, truth be told, pretty much all I do is user manuals and some shitty documents no one ever reads to comply with a heavy methodology the client requires. Been here for some months and I've expressed my discomfort about the situation more than once just to get empty promises that things will change and get better. This project has been going on for more than seven years and it doesn't seem like it's going to end any time soon. It also doesn't appear like my employer has any intention of moving me to another kind of project.

I've been looking for job offers but even for junior positions I'm getting asked for x months of experience in particular technnologies that I don't really have and then I get rejected. I can't afford to work on an internship or something like that because I'm the only income at home. However, everyday I feel more insecure about my own programming abilities and this is making me feel trapped.

Should I start looking to start once again as a first job in another company?

Can you please give me some advice?"

I’m an international student. I’m so international that when I tell people where I’m from I’m not even sure they know the country exists. Secondly, 99% of people confuse my nationality for something else, which is, well, inevitable and quite normal in my case. I realized it does bother me a little bit, but I try to be understanding. 

Also, I’m in Life Sci. I came to McGill knowing that my academic background is far from what most incoming students have. High school education in my country is kind of... shit. Before coming here, I knew I would struggle a lot, and I did, but I studied a lot and I pulled through U0 with a pretty high gpa, which made me kind of proud. Now, I’m about to finish U1, but I somehow ended up feeling like the most useless person on earth. I feel inferior to other students. I keep comparing myself to other first-years that got their lab positions and internships, that are so much smarter and more educated than me, and I’m starting to think that coming to a top Canadian university from a high school in a third world country was a mistake. I must’ve been delusional when I thought I could be on the same level with everyone (?)

My personality is not making things easier. I’ve always had a hard time making new connections, simply because I’m super shy and quiet, and my face is always either sad or is telling you to fuck off (according to what I hear from people I meet). I had zero friends during my first semester. Luckily, managed to find a few nice people here, and now I’m glad I have someone I can share my thoughts with. Yet, it still feels like nobody can really understand what I’m experiencing right now, and it’s really frustrating. 

And that’s just a small part of what’s been bothering me. I’ve never hated myself as much as I do now. My self-esteem is so low I don’t even know if I can ever get it back. I feel like I don’t belong here and I’m tired of being strong. I could continue ranting, but I don’t think anyone deserves to read through all of that lol.

So, I’m graduating in two months with a bachelors in HR and a psych minor. I don’t have a job lined up and I’m starting to feel the heat. I really want to hit the ground running with my career but I feel like I have no shot at landing anything competitive and I’m looking for anything to help me out. 

Here’s what I have that I can speak to: 1 HR internship, 5 years at chipotle (one spent as a manager during a time where we drastically improved operations), volunteer work, 3.8 GPA and me being a member of a couple different business school organizations. Which doesn’t sound too bad, until I remember that some of my peers have had multiple internships and hold leadership positions in multiple student organizations. By the time I started getting involved in school, it was too late for that. I feel like I can’t compete.

So what are some ways for me to help myself out? My resume is well-written and I’m good with cover letters. I feel like I just need more qualifications. I am currently studying for the SHRM-CP so there’s that. But what else?

fh0glj,0,2020-03-11,Should I work under the CEO or senior devs?,DarklightCompSci,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fh0glj/should_i_work_under_the_ceo_or_senior_devs/," 

I’m a fresh grad starting at a mid-size startup (150 people) I interned at previously as a full-time Junior dev this May. During my internship, I started with the core team but moved around every few weeks to try stuff out, and settled on a sub-team directly under the CEO for most of the term. 

The sub-team is very focused on business logic and is generally a higher pressure team than any of the other teams, and it’s quite isolated, as in the 1-2 other devs (including 1 remote senior who isn’t available much to answer questions or mentor) on the team only work on sub-team tasks and none of the other 15ish developers touch them.

The core team is more laid back and has a much larger group of talent, include several intermediate and senior devs who are excellent technical mentors.

I’m wondering which team I should try and be on when I start full time since it seems like I’ll be committing myself for at least the next few months.

Should I work on the core team, so that I can learn more about my platform and gain more technical knowledge from the senior devs, or work more independently and with the CEO/other product and business people? 

I feel like the work I’m doing on the sub-team is a more valuable skill set (app monetization) but I’m worried that without good technical mentors my code will become sloppier and I won’t develop as broad a range of technical skills.

I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts on this, or if they’ve been in the same situation."

It is a temporary tech position and I am super excited about working there. I am also looking for fall co-op positions right now so that I can be employed during the fall semester. I think because this is my first job outside of my freelance work, that it is important to put this Princeton position on my resume to better my chances as I apply to fall internships and co-ops. However, since the actual job experience doesnt start until June, when is it appropriate to put the Princeton job on my resume? Is there any way to state that I got hired by princeton on my resume without prematurely putting it down as actual work experience? Is it bad if i put it in the experience section?"

When I finished my studies and couldn't find a job in my area, I decided to enter in the world of IT as a functional tester. 

Demotivated for the job not being challenging enough, I invested some of my free time to learn how to be a frontend developer and after a while I got my first job as an intern. I  made my way through it, made myself betteras a programer, adapted myself to constant new frameworks and in technichal knowledge I was always one of the best in the teams I was. 

The problem is that, I never had a really good developer teaching me how to do stuff, or explaining me how and why stuff is done is a certain way in professional life, untill now everything I did was due to my own research and available time... however it seems this strategy only works in companies that operate in caves (Not disrespecting the companies I workied untill now, but thruth to be told I only worked in campanies that they barely know what to expect from a frontender... or what web development is in general).

My goal is to get to a AAA company, one of the top one, one company that excell in everything it does and doesn't neglect any aspect of what software development is... I'm tired of workarounds... 

The problem is that nowadays I'm applying to AAA companies... but I fail miserably in the interview phase... At the moment I'm just simply not good enough... I can take all the online courses in the world... but they seem only to cover only the concepts, in production more is demanded.

fh1xsw,3,2020-03-11,Questions about potential online degrees and career paths in Canada,Crato_the_Cynic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fh1xsw/questions_about_potential_online_degrees_and/,"So I was looking at getting into the field and would prefer to have some formal education but I believe the traditional 4 year degree is less than optimal for me. 

My questions are:

1) Would a 2 year technical diploma from a community college or vocational school (titled say ""programmer analyst"" or ""network administration"") make me eligible for entry level positions in the field? Even just something to get my foot in the door while I pursue further certification.

2) How do employers perceive an online degree (my preference being Athabasca at the moment), would I be on relatively equal footing with graduates from traditional universities of average reputation (AKA not Waterloo or something prestigious)  ?

3) I have an interest in software engineering, how feasible a path is that with an online degree in computer science? I see dedicated programs offered by engineering departments and wasn't sure if a bachelor of engineering was required for such a position. 

As it stands my plan would loosely be to get a two year diploma to get a job in industry and then complete an education at Athabasca, while developing an adequate portfolio and gaining experience of course. 

If anyone has another alternatives to a traditional 4 year program (streamlined, distance, coop, internship, ect.) I am very open to suggestions. 

Sorry if this has been asked before I did some searching and believed I was in the clear."

fh2yxr,0,2020-03-11,What would you do?,JagSmize,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fh2yxr/what_would_you_do/,"Here is the situation: 

I have moved on to the next round in interviews for a position I am very interested in. I’d say it’s my absolute top choice. 

I also have a coding challenge/assignment due very soon for an internship I am less excited about. 

Currently aside from possibly hearing back from 2 other companies, these are my only two prospects, unfortunately.

The coding assignment will definitely take up a decent portion of time, and although I understand the problem well I don’t think I’ll be able to implement something of quality by the due date. 

So my question is: what would you do? Would you just spend the time and do the best you can on the assignment? Or would you forfeit this potential opportunity to focus solely on preparing for the interview at your top top top pick? 

Ideally limiting your options is not a good move. But giving my all to my top pic is tempting. 

And so if I focus on the top pick and don’t get it, I definitely won’t get the other position, BUT, if I don’t get an internship I have a backup research position lined up. The research position would be cool but I would be disappointed that I did not get an internship.

I recently graduated with a degree in CS and am currently looking for enrollment. Based on my experience from past internships, I am interested and looking for data analytics and modeling roles, but many of those seem to be data scientist roles that require masters degrees or higher.

So instead I have been focusing on business analytics and business intelligence positions in my job search, (I’ve become more and more interested in the financial sector). However, I’m not sure that I’m properly qualified for these roles as the preference seems to be people with business related degrees and knowledge. 

Has anyone had any experience breaking into the positions I’m looking at as a CS major? And does anyone have any tips or advice on how I can make myself more attractive for these positions?

I'm a student who always dreamed to get into Google or, at least, one of the FAANGs. For this reason I got into a really technical project in the last 2 years. Initially I thought was a good project to learn a lot about large scale architectures and other interesting stuff for these companies, but now I'm really trying to bring it to the market (it took so long because I had to learn everything from scratch).

In November I had my first chance and I interviewed in Amazon for an internship position. Unfortunately it didn't end successfully.

I always apply for intern or graduate positions since I have a BS degree, but I never get called (except for that time).

Can you help me to get some feedback or at least understand if I am worth for these companies?

A couple weeks ago, after phone calls with HR and passing an online coding assessment, I finally got my first in-person interview. Unfortunately I didn't get the position, and I've now hit rock bottom. I really don't know what's left to do on my end. I sit on my computer applying for numerous positions everyday while my classmates with less course experience, lower GPAs and overall shit programming skills are getting killer internships after a 10 minute call with an HR rep explaining to them ""a time they had to overcome challenge."" I usually work a full 40 hour week over the summer (non-technical job) to save money for school. At this rate I'm going to have to consider not working over the summer at all and taking a full gap-year to boost my resume with some project. I may not be proficient in 10 different programming languages and all of the popular frameworks associated with them, but I have a good understanding of my coursework (and good grades to back that up) as well as a few other languages I've tinkered with in my free time. I really wish sometimes that an employer could understand how excited I am to get some real-life work experience as well as see how hard-working and motivated I am to learn new things. That is what an internship is designed for after all."
fh452o,15,2020-03-11,[Summary] Successful F1 student Internship Hunt Experience,collegthrowaway2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fh452o/summary_successful_f1_student_internship_hunt/,"Hi,

I'm an international student who recently was offered an internship at a company in NYC. I want to share my experience as an international student hunting for internship. It was certainly more difficult but definitely doable. So I want to share my experience.

My Diagram [here](https://imgur.com/a/XsLmlme)

**Stats:**

\- GPA: 3.8

\- Major: Computer Science, minor in Math

\- University: One of those in NYC but transferred from somewhere else after first year

\- Year: Sophomore

\- Started programming first year of college. didn't really know anything before then. Get a B+ in the intro java class.

**Internship Stats:**

\- Leetcode: 150 questions. Mostly from the Blind list of questions

\- Applied to 286 companies in the United States, ranging from small startups to big company. No referrals

**Interview Prep:**

I did Leetcode during the summer but not that seriously. I started preparing seriously during the Christmas break as I didn't go home to my country so I have lots of time. I did the Blind list of questions. If I couldn't figure it out, I look at the answers, save them and redo them 1 or 2 weeks after. I also write them down each time so I can understand them better. 

**Resume:**

Aware of my lack of skills, I jump in all kind of possible projects or ""job"". I write basic script for a news agency for free during freshman year, did an internship back home at a tech company unpaid, did volunteer research with professors. I try to do as much as I can. By doing so, I have been exposed to different technology and hence my resume is decent for a freshman. 

I also did lots of side projects with my friends. I often listed them on my resume.

**What worked:**

I take advantage of the school's career service. I went to Resume Review event from Microsoft, which lands me an on-campus interview two weeks later. I went to the career service to have my resume checked out the beginning of the year as well as attending other events offered. 

**Tips:**

Make connections. I don't mean make connection as in using someone else to leverage an opportunity. When I transferred university, I made sure I did my research and found the students who are very very smart. Then I reached out to them to ask advice. I also did a few projects with them. By doing so, talking to the smart ones, I learned a lot more and faster than on my own. Computer Science is an interesting field in a way that there are gatekeepers but there are also mentors, who are very willing to help. 

Mentally, due to my late start in CS, I set my goal such as this:

Freshman year: Internship at home or side project

Sophomore year: Getting to the final round interview

Junior year: An Internship. Doesn't matter where

Senior year: Full-time at big company or Grad program

By doing this, I prepare myself mentally and learn to accept if I didn't make it through these goals. 

**P.S:**

To my fellow F1-Visa students, don't get discouraged. Keep up with what you are doing. At some point, I was very sad and disappointing. I already accepted that I will do unpaid internship again this summer. But luckily, I got an offer. So I guess there are still hopes. Good luck."

fh4cvu,268,2020-03-11,"""Make it work in Word!!!""",Colorado_Expat,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/fh4cvu/make_it_work_in_word/,"Another facepalm memory from my stint doing IT for a large law firm...

It had been a quiet morning when I got a call from the head secretary of the main office; not bothering with niceties, as soon as I answered she launched into a rant about how ""Your network is corrupting my files, and I'm having to spend hours fixing them!!!  I want this fixed NOW!!!""

Knowing from prior experience that attempting to get any further useful information over the phone would be futile, I went to her office, where I was told that for the past few weeks, she'd been using an Excel spreadsheet to track the time of our new interns.  The problem she was having was that while everyone else could open it, work, and save without issue, every time she worked on it ""the network corrupts the file, and no one can open it any more!""

Since basic troubleshooting starts with reproducing the problem, I tried opening / working / saving her spreadsheet in multiple ways; in every case, Excel worked fine.  As she had vanished as soon as I sat down and started work, I waited until her return to tell her that I couldn't find any problems, and that it was all working as it should, demonstrating for her.  Her reply was ""Well, that's because you're not doing it right!!!""  I asked her to show me what she was doing - she brought up Word, selected &amp; opened the spreadsheet, and started in entering times...  Word was perfectly happy to open it as a table, letting her do whatever it was she wanted; when she was done, she saved the ""spreadsheet"" (now a Word document with tables) - in the process, she also *changed the file extension* from **.doc** to **.xls** (with the comment that she had to do this every time, and it was really inconvenient)!  Once she'd completed her demo, she triumphantly proclaimed ""See there!  When I save it, the network corrupts it, and no one else can work on it!""

(Now for some background - the previous month, we had offered Excel classes to all the clerical staff in that office, specifically inviting her - she declined, saying she was too busy and didn't have time to waste in class.)

I explained that there was nothing wrong with the network, nor with her computer - if she wanted to work on an Excel spreadsheet, she'd have to do it in Excel, not Word.  This did not go over well - her first response was ""Well, I don't even have Excel on this computer, so I have to use Word!""  (This not 5 minutes since I was working in Excel with her standing there watching me.)  When I pointed out the Excel icon on her desktop (right next to her Word icon), she objected that she didn't have the time to learn a new program, and wanted to keep using Word.  Upon hearing that wasn't possible, she demanded ""I don't want excuses, make it work in Word for me - I do everything in Word!!!""  I repeated that there was nothing I could do, and she'd have to take it up with Microsoft; this was not well received.  I then mentioned that we offered classes in Excel, and it could help her do her work more efficiently if she would avail herself of the training when it was offered.  Her reply was:

""I told you that I don't have time for your stupid, silly classes - I've lost too much time on this already!""

Privately conceding defeat I withdrew, saying ""There's nothing more I can do - if you want to use spreadsheets, you'll need to use Excel.""

(I heard later that she foisted the timekeeping duties onto another secretary, who'd let it slip that she knew Excel.)"

I have worked for this company for 4 years. 3 of which have been at this particular location. The turnover rate in the department is HIGH. We’ve lost 4 employees since December all because of said supervisor. Well I’m currently finishing up my degree which requires me to intern. I intern at this facility as well as work. Just in separate departments. Things have gotten really bad lately. The department is TOXIC the supervisor constantly talks bad about other employees behind their backs and is just difficult to work with in general. My close friend whom I got a job in our department is bi racial. Today during my internship i was called to HR where I was met by my boss to discuss a particular conversation she heard about through the “grapevine” between me and the friend at work. She reported me for this on 3/6 which happens to be the day I submitted my resignation due to gaining a better position with my degree. I feel she did this with malice towards me for leaving. My friend did not report it. While I am not saying the conversation wasn’t hurtful the friend and I had worked through it. Going back to HR at the facility is not an option due to it being small and that “grapevine”. Also the friend went to the supervisor a few months ago and told her that I had said something to upset her and she wanted to know how she should respond without being rude. The supervisor replied “I don’t want to get involved”. But of course when I put in my notice she wants to. Anyone from HR here? Please help. I’m concerned about my career/image. It’s not who I am.
fh971s,2,2020-03-11,Should I go to a technical college or a regular college,xzybi,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/fh971s/should_i_go_to_a_technical_college_or_a_regular/,"So I’ve been thinking of something for the past few weeks and I have come to the conclusion that, honestly I’m stuck in a rut about whether I want to go to a bachelor degree to get a software engineering or Mechatronics degree or whether I should go to a technical college with internship opportunities by a reputable company who will pay through my technical college, and offer me a job with a base salary of $57,000 or higher. 

On one hand, I have to go to either a in-state university that is frankly really hard to get into and has steep pricing for a software engineering or Mechatronics degree, but jobs, salaries, and opportunities are more accessible for me. 

On the other hand, I could have a lesser crushing student debt, get myself a good job with said reputable company, and work myself up to a higher level of salary reaching 150k (same as pretty much what I’d get as a mid-high level position if I had a bachelor degree). 

So far, I’ve been thinking of just trying to make sure my plans are put in place so that I earn around maybe $35,000 to $250,000 for both in Mechatronics and Software Engineering Degree, but on one hand I get myself a steady job with less crushing debt, however I have to stay with that company, or I can go to university and learn about more to get more opportunities which I don’t think will be open to me since many other people are going to apply for it. 

Honestly I’m just stuck in a rut, and with stories of people having student loans that cost as much as a house, and my parents trying to say that you have to have a college degree to succeed in getting a job (even though they start you out at entry level position making about $35,000 minimum). 

Really all I want to know, is it worth going to a technical college by a company who will pay for college, as long as I intern with them for 20 hours a week, and be offered a job at $57,000 minimum, even though my parents wouldn’t approve of it, or should I go to a in-state college that is extremely reputable, but be left in a unstable job search with student loans piling as much as a house, but still be applicable to more opportunities down the road ?"

That being said I want to optimize my chances of getting into good colleges and I am looking for advice. I am passionate about politics, law, and writing. 

Here are my academics: 

This year: all honor and AP Government (aiming for a 5 on the exam since it is my favorite subject)

Next year: All Honors, APUSH, AP Computer science, and AP Comparative Government. 

GPA unweighted: 3.93 (which is low for a freshman in my school ):   ) 

Here are my extra curriculars: 

- Debate: Ranked best freshman team at my school and I am on track to be captain. I am also on an outside of school debate team and me and my partner have started to win tournaments. I have been doing this since 7th grade. 

-I am a district intern for a delegate (I go to meetings, write memos, deal w paperwork) 

-Opinion writer of a county wide student newspaper (on track to be a section editor next year). 

-Vice President of my schools Democrats club 

-Co founded and President of a chapter of a county wide student immigration alliance and advocacy organization at my school (currently making their website right now!) 

-Biweekly newsletter writer for a local political advocacy group and I run their twitter 

-Member of a peer tutoring program at my school 

-Intern at a teen court/hear court cases and make decisions about fair punishments

So long story short, messed up big time in my jr year of college. Was in a really bad mental state and made a bad choice, got a theft conviction and was suspended for the rest of the semester. Got expelled the same night because one of the members on the disciplinary board thought I was lying about my situation. Also had a pretty abysmal 2.70 GPA.

Took classes at a local cc and got a 4.0 then went on a gap year because I was depressed as hell. Gonna enroll at a local state uni this fall to finish up in cs/econ.

Kinda confused about technicalities since my situation is pretty unconventional. Not sure on: how to quantify my GPA since this is gonna be my third school with different credit systems, what class yr I'm considered for internship purposes, and most importantly, what to do now to try to be more competitive for SWE at a normal tech company (non-startups, non-devshops).

I don't like that we had to move here because of my parents' new job.

My siblings and I grew up on a ranch and it had always been beautiful. My parents gave us a comfortable life, surrounded by nature and all we needed while they ran a veterinary hospital a half hour drive away.

Christmases were surreal there. The tourists that came to our ranch always celebrated it with us.

My grandma had made it a point to bring everyone together for daily dinners from Thanksgiving through Christmas, everyone loves her pasta and Turkey. I love her mashed potatoes, and it's been a while since we've had a good batch since she left us two years ago.

All things considering, 90 is a good age to go. At least she got to enjoy her final days on our ranch. Our parents made the decision to sell the ranch after the hospital they worked at expanded with a clinic nearer the city, so they have to help set it up and train the staff.

I had initially thought that seeing skyscrapers would bring a new excitement, though my reluctance to leave the ranch stems from parting with the horses and scenery.

If you have grown up being surrounded by nature all your life, seeing limited skies within a towering city changes your expectations and you are suddenly hit by a feeling of home sickness.

Though home is already where you are, with your family, wherever you may be.

My eldest sibling is my sister, both my brother and myself have a healthy amount of respect for her. Not because she scares us with her sense of discipline, but because she leads by example.

As the middle child, I am ten years younger than her and two years older than my brother. He is the youngest, and his friends sometimes tease him about having to grow up under the thumb of two older sisters.

I remember the first week we settled into our smaller house just about a half hour drive away from the city. My brother and I had difficulty adjusting to the house and sleeping, and our sister probably did as well, but she made it a point to wear us out with holiday movies before bedtime, whenever our parents had to be at the clinic setting up at night.

""I miss grandma,"" Noah said one night, eyes half closed from laying on the sofa, pulling a throw over him.

""I know, peanut, me too,"" Abigail replied, placing a hand on his forehead and rubbing his cheek with her thumb. ""We all do.""

He fell asleep without replying, and she started clearing the dinner dishes before carrying him to his room and tucking him in.

""You going to bed now Sky?"" She asked me, turning on his night light before switching off his bedroom lights.

""I guess."" I wasn't looking forward to school the next day.

""What's wrong?"" Abby sat me down on the sofa beside her and looked at me, concerned. ""Is it school?""

I didn't think I'd have any problems fitting in, I was pretty much an experienced wallpaper and both bullies and cliques left me alone, so I wasn't worried about that.

It was an uneasy feeling that I couldn't place, and I didn't want to worry her. It had been a long week, and we barely saw our parents since we moved in a little over a week ago.

I shook my head. ""Nothing's wrong, I'm just not tired yet. Can we watch another movie?""

Abby goes to sleep late, I can sometimes hear her talking with her boyfriend on the phone or voice chatting over a video game.

She nods and strokes my hair before letting me make my movie selection on Netflix.

""Again?"" She asked, cracking a half amused smile at me.

I went for Blacklist automatically, and had not realised it until I was scrolling through the episodes on Season 1. It was the third time I was re-watching the entire series, and I like the comfort that Raymond Reddington brings, in a weird way.

No one can hurt Elizabeth Keen if he watches over her, though the idea of being a part of both black and white worlds does not exactly thrill me. I imagine it has to be a difficult line for her to walk, especially in the later seasons.

Abby's phone rang as we were in the middle of an episode, it was our mom.

""Ok, I'll let them know,"" she says, before hanging up. She turns to me while opening a bag of chips. ""We have a community meeting tomorrow night after dinner.""

""Must we all go?"" I asked, still not used to the lifestyle of living in a gated community. It is an affluent neighbourhood, and everyone was either polite or cordial. Though each house has a large space from its neighbours, it is nothing compared to the ranch. Nothing compares to the space we had on the ranch.

""Apparently,"" she replied, looking at the time on her phone. ""Come on, let's get you to bed.""

It was almost 2AM, and our parents were not yet home. That night for the first time in a week though, I fell asleep once my head hit the pillows, all the way through daybreak.

I remember that week because Abby had to make dinner for us all week, and I only saw them twice during the day when they were asleep in their beds, possibly exhausted from their continuous late night work.

It is warmer out today. I decide to take up Abby's offer to go to the supermarket in the mall in the city and take a stroll around the metropolitan city. The people are different from who we were used to hosting at the ranch - more sophisticated and polished, but most noticeably, busy and fast paced, even when grocery shopping.

There is another week left to school, and I want to get a few items before starting.

I hope to be able to shake that feeling of discomfort before going into another new environment, because that last thing I want is for Abby to worry about me and Noah when school starts.

The next day our parents are home for dinner, to Noah's and my surprise. Abby is helping our mom with cooking in the kitchen, and Noah goes slouch potatoes with his PS4 Pro the entire afternoon.

I slouch beside him and doze off, waking up to the familiar smell of a mashed potatoes recipe we all love.

I hear our mom's laughter and see her holding a small dish of gravy over my nose.

""Gravy!"" I shriek, jumping up from the sofa. Noah continues playing his game while looking at the gravy dish.

""Come let's eat,"" our dad calls, hair wet from his shower. He pulls out a chair and looks at me staring at him. ""Come, Skylar.""

I surprise him with a hug and a kiss, and a guilty look crosses his face.

""I've missed you guys too,"" he says affectionately, hugging me back with a kiss. ""This is our way of saying sorry for being gone all week. Grandma's recipe.""

""The best!"" Noah announced, raising his spoon and digging straight into the huge bowl of mashed potatoes, manners absent.

Abby heaps a pile of it on his plate and pours steaming hot gravy over it, and smiles as he pushes aside his favourite pasta and goes straight for the perderders.

Midway through dinner, I ask if Noah and I absolutely must be present at the community meeting. I am hoping to skip it to play some Portal 2. The game is annoyingly difficult, but I get immersed in it for hours.

""Sorry pumpkin, we're all requested to be present. I think it's also like a welcome thing for our family,"" mom says. ""Other than this, community meetings are usually ad-hoc and for parents only.""

After dinner we pile into the buggy allocated for each household and head for the townhall by the clubhouse where the community meetings are held.

The chairman is a kind looking man in his 60s with a twinkle in his eyes.

He beckons us to join the other neighbours in the townhall as we park the buggy in our allocated lot, and I observe that there are no other children our age.

""This is more of a welcoming committee tonight, as well as a brief orientation to our community,"" the chairman, Mr. Lumos later explains, as our parents chat with him while we take our seats. ""Help yourselves to the refreshments by the stage, toilets are just outside to your left.""

There is a sense of warmth as we walk into the townhall and take our seats near the front of the hall.

I continue looking for other children but see none. Noah's fixated with his Nintendo Switch, until Abby gently takes it away and tucks his head under her elbow affectionately. He grumbles but contentedly leans against her, eyes flitting across the clubhouse.

""I'm bored,"" he whispers to Abby. ""I wanna go home.""

""I know, peanut, just hang in there for a while, we'll let the grown ups talk,"" she whispers back, rubbing his forehead.

He reminds me of a cat. They like to be rubbed above their noses and foreheads.

The adults have been talking for almost an hour, when Mr. Lumos turns his attention to our family.

He smiles and beckons for the Noah and myself to join Abby and our parents.

""These are the Colemans,"" Mr. Lumos introduces, ""they're the newest members of our community, with three children, Noah, Skylar and Abigail. This are their parents, Joseph and Lauren Coleman.""

The adults smile and nod at us. Noah is distracted, looking at the table of refreshments and turning to look up at Abby.

""Abigail has recently graduated from college before they moved here. Noah and Skylar will be attending Hillsborough Elementary and Middle schools respectively.""

I notice an uneasy silence fall across the townhall, but Mr. Lumos continues smiling and turns to introduce my parents.

""Joseph and Lauren Coleman are the head veterinarians of the new Saintsbury Animal Clinic that has just opened yesterday. Please remember to keep it professional and not bring your cats and dogs to their doorstep if you need help.""

The community members chuckle and nod warmly, though a few of them still look uneasy at the earlier mention of our schools.

I don't think anyone in our family has noticed it, especially not Noah, who is now looking at the refreshments again, distracted as usual.

Ten minutes after we take our seats again, Mr. Lumos wraps up the meeting with some re-caps on the monthly maintenance scheduled for the community's pools and a reminder to avoid using the water taps at home three days from now, for two hours during the maintenance.

He walks up to us to remind our parents to check their emails for the community's orientation and guidelines that will be sent to him tomorrow, before wishing us goodnight with that same twinkle in his kindly eyes.

The next day Abby leaves to meet with her boyfriend who has travelled into the city for a job interview as an intern with a local newspaper, so we spend the day with our parents who are resting from their long week.

After lunch I hear the printer in use by dad's desk, and I'm almost dozing off in front of the TV when he comes to sit beside me with a thin stack of paper in hand.

""Here you go, sweetheart,"" he says, handing me a copy while he starts reading on his.

""What are these for?"" I ask, puzzled.

""Your copy of the community guidelines and some helpful tips for your new school,"" he says, not looking up from his reading.

I sit up and start reading the two sheets of printouts.

Such allocations will be provisioned weekly until such time when the city resumes business as usual operations. Households are requested to refrain from panicking, hoarding and participating in unruly behaviour. Under such circumstances, our community will be locked down and the gates will no longer be accessible as we will be undergoing our Community Continuity Program and the safety of all community residents will be the priority.

10. A monthly exercise takes place where the floodlights in the four corners of our community outposts will be turned on unannounced ahead of time. The outposts were erected after a spate of attempted burglary and break-ins from people outside of the community. When the floodlights come on, every household is expected to turn off the master switch located beside your front door, within no more than 10 minutes.

This switch will shut down every internal electric light source including your garage's.

If no one is home during the exercise, an appointed adult will receive a text notification, and you will have the same duration for response time to remotely turn off your master switch at home using your mobile application (made available to you during your family's first orientation at our townhall meeting). The mobile application can be installed on up to two adults' phones and also allows for you to privately access the optional security video function. The service for installing the default security video camera costs a subsidised installation fee of $250 but it is not compulsory for installing. Third-party models are acceptable and chargeable at a non-subsidised installation fee of $600.

It is imperative that your mobile phones receive an audio and vibration alert for the notification to be promptly triggered on your phones for your action. Households that are facing technical difficulties in using the master switch should immediately trigger the emergency lights located on the top right corner of your front porch, which run using an independent power source. You can do so by pulling the cord underneath the transparent lift-flap above the master switch, or via your mobile application.

**Community Households - An Introduction to Your Neighbours**

1. Each household's mailbox will clearly show the house number uniformly on two sides, for convenience of postal services.
2. Every lane houses ten households, with five households on each side. There are twelve lanes in this community. You can refer to the appended map provided in the same email.
3. Households with young children under the age of 12 are located further away from the swimming pools for safety reasons, and nearer towards the central playing field where two playgrounds and the paintball arena are located.
4. Households 1 to 7, and 21 to 35 are in the medical and research fields. Household numbers 8 to 20 belong in the engineering field. Households 36 to 50 are in the transport field. Households 51 to 70 are in the education field. Households 71 to 90 are in the food resources field. Households 91 to 120 are families with retired military personnel.
5. There are three main care-giving branches in this community, containing 7 full-time staff in each branch. They rotate on a half-annual roster and live in the three buildings located beside the Townhall. They are our Security branch, Supplies Branch and Medical Emergency branch. You may approach them should you require assistance as they are operational 24/7.

**General Guidelines to Hillsborough Schools**

*These guidelines are not meant to replace the official student rules for each branch of the school. It is Parkview Valley's requirements for students to keep in line with both these general guidelines set by our community, and official school rules set by the schools.*

1. Punctuality - tardiness is generally frowned upon. Similar to how we expect the adults in each household to cultivate good practice in keeping with our community gates' operating hours, students are likewise expected to cultivate a good habit in punctuality. This also applies in reverse to not lingering on school premises after school hours, as staff like the librarians have to do their jobs in upkeep of the school
2. Respect for Authorities - it is important for students to understand that teachers are there to perform their duties in teaching us. While being popular or fitting in with the right cliques might seem necessary, it is more important that you do not participate in rude behaviour, or disobey authority by entering rooms that are out of bounds to students
3. Hygiene - when you come home from school, it is important to take a shower or at least wash your hands and feet, before going to your bed. Personal hygiene is important as it can help prevent the spread of germs and grime to your household, especially on days where PE or extracurricular activities involving physical activities take place
4. Hydration - always have a bottle with available drinking water throughout your day in school. A minimum of 500ml is recommended to stay adequately hydrated, especially on days where PE or extracurricular activities involving physical activities take place
5. Pets and Mobile Phones - An agreement with the school has been arrived at, where students are allowed to have their phones with them in case of emergencies. Students are expected to respect each class in session by switching off audio but leaving on the vibration function to respond to urgent calls. Parents will be tasked to set the Do Not Disturb function for all student phones otherwise, during school hours. Pets are not allowed to be brought into and out of the school. No dogs or cats found outside of our community may be brought into our community premise, to prevent the potential risk of disease outbreak.

*Please refer to the emergency numbers provided for each household in your emails. The numbers provided operate 24/7. Thank you and once again, on behalf of our community, a warm welcome to you and your family to Parkview Valley.*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm half dozing off by the time I struggle to finish reading the general rules and guidelines, but my curiosity stir me into re-reading the general guidelines for our schools.

Some other rules seem strange to me but by this time I'm bored and turn myself sideways after switching on Blacklist again, and use my dad's lap as a pillow.

""You'll grow fat some day,"" he chuckles at me, ""It's like you eat and sleep half the time.""

""Never,"" I retort confidently. ""I'll be fit and join the FBI someday, and outrun you.""

""Never,"" my dad laughs again, ""but I'll take that as a challenge. I'll wake you up for morning jogs when your school starts.""

""Uh, no thanks,"" I reply, ignoring him and turning my attention back to the TV. I know he's shaking his head at me.

Abby comes home just before dinner time with her boyfriend David. He always has a calm demeanour about him and I find him to be oddly compatible with Abby. I say oddly, because they're not opposites of each other, yet they're together.

Like Abby, he has almost no temper, and like Abby, he goes to Church every weekend whenever he can. The loudest thing about the both of them are their laughs, which they are most audibly generous with. I hope they get married, they'll have funny children that laugh as loudly as their parents.

We're heading out for dinner at a restaurant in the city, and David joins us as he will be staying the night in the guest room, before he continues on his long drive back home tomorrow.

As we're nearing the guardhouse, one of the security guards stop our dad's car and talks to him briefly through the window.

""Good evening Mr. Coleman,"" he greets politely with a nod. ""Gentle reminder to be home before 11pm as the gates close then.""

""Thanks John, we'll take note of that.""

The city is very big and new to us, and it's only our parents' second time into the city, what with their busy schedule setting up the new clinic during our first week in our new home.

The restaurant is crowded and we wait in line for our turn, and mom apologises to us after a few minutes in the queue, that they should have thought to make a reservation.

A staff from the restaurant walks over to us in the queue and greets us with a bright smile.

""Party of six?"" he asks, looking at us expectantly.

""Yes please,"" dad replies.

""You may follow me to your tables.""

We are the third in line and I observe there's another party of six in front of us, but instead of attending to them first, they got skipped.

Dad notices this too and raises the question, but he barely finishes asking when the family in front turns to smile at us and beckons for us to proceed.

""That's odd,"" David whispers to Abby under his breath, but smiles and nods in appreciation as we move past them. He nudges Noah and myself in front of him, following us in last.

""Maybe they're waiting for someone,"" Abby replies later as she takes her seat.

We place our orders shortly, and mom turns to David warmly.

""You must be excited about landing that internship,"" she says. ""When do you start?""

""In a month,"" David replies. ""I'm nervous but excited.""

""You're going to do well,"" dad says, handing him the bread basket. ""Might be a little challenging starting that engine after a year off, but I know you'll do well.""

""Thanks Mr. Coleman,"" David replies, appearing comforted by our dad's encouragement.

A waiter comes over to our table with some forms and pens, and hands them out to the adults.

""We appreciate if you could all fill in your particulars so we can include you in our mailing list for updates. Also your kids can enjoy special rates for their birthday parties that we also host.""

Mom studies the form. ""That's nice of your restaurant, let us get these back to you after dinner.""

I'm looking at the waiter and notice a nervous smile flick across his face.

""Well sure, m'am, as long as you remember,"" he says, putting some enthusiasm into his voice. ""You don't want to miss out on our privileges and events!""

He leaves as another waiter comes by with our orders.

Abby is on her phone making a reservation for seats at the mall's cinema, where we're planning to catch a movie after dinner.

It's just after 6.30pm as we're starting to eat, so we have about an hour before we have to make our way to the cinema.

Our parents are talking to David most of the time after our appetizers, and Noah start to fidget impatiently in his seat because it's taking a long time for our main courses to arrive.

He gets impatient for dessert most of the time anyway, and sometimes he refuses to eat anything but ice cream, unless Abby threatens to give him sweet corn for dessert, which he absolutely hates.

After a while mom notices the time and looks at her watch.

""Honey do you think they forgot about our orders?"" she asks dad, concerned. It's now almost 7pm and we have barely 30 minutes to finish our dinner with dessert, which is almost impossible for Noah to accomplish.

They get the attention of the waiter who came by with our forms earlier.

""Do you think you could help us check on our orders, Darren?"" dad asks apologetically. ""I understand your kitchen might be busy but we're running a little late for a movie.""

Darren nods. ""Certainly sir. May I please collect the forms now?""

Mom hands him two forms, filled out by herself and Abby.

Darren looks at them and glances back at her. ""How about the rest of your family?""

""The two kids don't need any updates,"" mom smiles, ""it's just mainly our eldest and myself that sees such events.""

""Such events,"" Darren echoes, strangely. ""Well what a shame, it would have been nice to be able to provide updates to them.""

David hands them his form. ""You can have Skylar's, there's an email address in there but she doesn't have a phone.""

""That will do just fine,"" Darren replies, brightening up like someone just turned on the lights in his attic. ""I'll see to your main courses right away.""

""What was that about?"" Abby turns to him, curious.

David shrugs. ""A white lie is still a lie, I know, but he was making me uncomfortable. It's like filling in those forms are a pre-requisite before we get our food.""

He turns to me. ""So the email address in there is yours, but there's no way you should be giving out your phone number to any stranger ok? Not even for restaurants or anywhere outside of school and home.""

By the time we finish our main course, it's almost 7.30pm, so we're thankful dessert is served immediately after our plates are cleared.

Darren personally serves us and beams as our parents compliment them on the food.

It's nearly 7.45pm when our dad asks for the bill, but there is no waiter in sight.

The restaurant is crowded, so he decides not to wait and makes his way to the cashier.

""Can we please settle for table 21?"" he asks, while I'm lingering by his side, eyeing the candy in the bowl on the counter.

The cashier appears confused. ""There's no table 21. Which table are you referring to sir?""

My dad looks equally confused and points out our table where the rest of our family is still seated with David.

""Oh that's table 18,"" the cashier says, preparing our bill.

""I must have made a mistake, we were seated between tables 20 and 22, so..."" our dad's voice trails off apologetically.

By the time we pay and exit the restaurant, it's almost 8pm, so we hurry upstairs to the cinema.

Abby and David goes ahead of us to collect the tickets and get Noah his popcorn, while the rest of us wait for them, tummies too full for any snacks.

We quickly take our seats and are surprised that the usual advertisements, let alone movie, hasn't started, seeing that it was due to start at 7.50pm.

The cinema is barely half full, but the smell of popcorn is tempting. I ask Abby for some money to buy some, and she goes with me.

As we're leaving the snack bar, I see the side of a familiar face but cannot place my finger on who it is.

The movie hasn't started when we're back at our seats, and by this time our parents are growing concerned about the curfew for the gates.

It's now pushing 8.30pm, and the advertisements briefly flicker, before an announcement for a technical difficulty flashes across the screen with an apology.

A brief announcement is made over the PA system, saying that the movie will be starting right after they resolve the issue.

There are groans from impatient movie goers, and just then the lights are dimmed and the movie starts.

The drive home will take a little over an hour if dad drives fast enough, but it's unlikely he'll do that, especially when we kids are in the car. It usually takes half that time to get to the city from our home, but the route back covers a slight detour and it takes more than that amount of time to go home.

Once the movie ends at 10pm, we quickly exit the cinema, with Noah sleeping over dad's shoulder as we hurry to the carpark.

""Do you have the number to the guardhouse?"" Dad asks mom as he's driving.

""I'm calling them now, sir,"" David replies, phone on his ear.

""Thanks, I hope we don't get pulled over for speeding,"" Dad replies, making a face at his own driving. That seems to crack mom up.

David gets through to the guardhouse and is requested turn on the speakers.

""Yes, Mr. Coleman?"" the same guard's voice came through. ""Sorry about that, we have to ensure the owners of the house are the ones calling us.""

""Prank called much?""

""Perhaps,"" the guard gently chuckles, ""are you near? What landmarks are you passing?""

""That small diner off the highway that no one ever seems to eat at?"" Dad replies, half amused.

""No, their pancakes aren't that fantastic,"" the guard chuckles again. ""Look, you're pretty near now, anywhere within the next ten minutes, you might make good time but whatever you do sir - ""

A brief pause.

""Yes?"" Dad asks.

""May the phone be passed to your wife sir? I assume your children are with you.""

It's an odd request but David turns off the speaker and passes his phone to mom.

She listens to what the guard has to say and nods.

""Yes we understand, thanks Rob,"" she acknowledges, before hanging up.

She doesn't say what she was told on the phone, except to pass the phone back to David.

Dad doesn't ask, either, as he starts focusing on driving faster.

As we start pulling into the street that leads to our gates, the sky darkens like it's appearing to rain.

Noah stirs as dad makes a turn towards our guardhouse, just as the time on the car's display shows 10:59PM.

The gates are half closed and waiting for our return.

""Welcome home, Colemans,"" Mr. Lumos appears at the guardhouse, eyes twinkly as usual. ""Hope you had a good evening in the city.""

Mom waves at him and we smile back, and I see his face turn serious as he turns away to face the closing gates, standing in the middle with his hands behind him.

I turn around in my seat and see rain clouds approaching our community, but what stands out the most is the same familiar face I thought I saw back at the cinema snack bar whom I couldn't identify earlier.

There, standing at the now-closed gates facing Mr. Lumos, is Darren from the restaurant, with a venomous look on his face."

Throwaway for obvious reasons. As the title suggests I was fortunate enough to land 2 internship/co-op offers and I'm conflicted about which one to take. I'm a CS student who graduates next year. The first offer is a co-op at Oracle and the second is an internship at a small AI startup. Initially I was all for taking the Oracle offer but now I'm not so sure. 

Oracle pros:

\- name recognition

\- 6-8 month co-op so I can learn more and contribute more

\- option to work on more cloud related tech (my interest)

\- really like the managers

&amp;#x200B;

Oracle cons:

\- aging tech/not innovating(?)

\- probably slower paced, may not learn as much

\- bureaucratic 

\- have heard their management is not up to par as other FAANG companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Startup pros:

\- learn a lot fast

\- wear multiple hats

\- better for career growth?

&amp;#x200B;

Startup cons:

\- focused on niche market

\- no public details available (their website just has a contact us form)  

\- 3-4 month internship so I would not be able to contribute as much (?)

&amp;#x200B;

  

I plan to apply to a bunch of places at graduation including FAANG. Which would be more beneficial for long term growth/prospects?

[Tech's response can be found here.](http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mar. 12, 2020—**A message to the Georgia Tech community:

As of earlier today, the guidance from the University System of Georgia (USG) is that “all 26 USG institutions will remain open for face-to-face education at this time.” The message sent to Presidents of all of the USG’s institutions is included below.

Because this guidance could change as the situation evolves in metro Atlanta and beyond, it is essential that we accelerate our preparation efforts to move all classes and parts of our research and administration to a distance format.

I have instructed Provost Bras to work with all academic units to provide whatever support is needed for faculty to move their classes to a distance format on short notice. I advise all faculty to take advantage of spring break next week to plan how to best move the remainder of their courses to a distance format. I encourage all faculty and academic units to find creative solutions to help students complete their courses and progress academically should we need to adopt a distance delivery format.

In addition, I have instructed Kelly Fox, executive vice president of Administration and Finance, to prepare the administration for the eventuality that we need to move major parts of the administration to telework.

I have instructed Chaouki Abdallah, EVP of Research, to work with researchers throughout the Institute and GTRI, to ensure that all research continuity plans are up-to-date.

While no decision has been made at this point, I advise all students heading out for spring break to also prepare for the possibility that instruction could move to distance learning.

Because of the new travel restrictions put in place by the federal government last night, I have instructed our Office of International Education to immediately recall all students abroad and provide whatever assistance we can to facilitate their return and academic progression. We have also made the decision to cancel all summer study abroad, GTL, international internships, exchange programs and Georgia Tech sponsored international curricular and co-curricular travel programs. The Office of International Education will follow up with program-specific details and additional guidance by March 23.

For up-to-date guidance on Georgia Tech’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, please visit http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus.

I want you to know that I am assessing the situation on an hourly basis with experts inside and outside the Institute and considering multiple scenarios within the guidance of the University System and health authorities. I appreciate the work of all the members of the special task force chaired by Senior Vice President and Chief of Staff Frank Neville as well as all the faculty and staff supporting them.

Please continue to take good care of yourselves and those around you. Practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly. [This video provides a good overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=KY7U32c6C70&amp;feature=emb_logo) of steps you can take toward illness prevention and the best ways to seek appropriate health care if needed.

More importantly, I thank every member of our community for doing your part in dealing with this health emergency. I have full confidence in the ability of the Georgia Tech community to navigate these uncharted territories.

**Subject line: Update from University System of Georgia, re: Coronavirus**

**Subject:** **COVID-19**

Dear Presidents,

The University System of Georgia is consulting constantly with the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Governor’s Coronavirus Task Force.  DPH has advised that the risk of contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Georgia remains low.

Therefore, all 26 USG institutions will remain open for face-to-face education at this time.

For those of you, or anyone on your campus who may be traveling, please make sure they remain in regular contact with your campus for operational updates. 

Many of you have asked, what can we do?   The most important responsibility we each have is to practice prevention.  Prevention is paramount.

Please urge your faculty, staff and students to take appropriate measures such as:

* Wash hands regularly.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
* Cover coughs and sneezes with tissues.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Be responsible and courteous to others and stay home if you are sick or experiencing symptoms.
* Respect personal space when greeting others and during conversations.
* Be mindful of those in high risk populations such as those with underlying health conditions and the elderly.
* Follow CDC and DPH guidance on personal and business travel to avoid increasing your risk and that of others.

We take very seriously the responsibility to make prudent choices for the well-being of the USG community.

The latest information is that (as of Thursday morning) there are 12 confirmed and 19 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Georgia. These numbers are likely to change.

For the latest updates, please monitor [DPH’s website](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.georgia.gov%2Fnovelcoronavirus&amp;data=02%7C01%7CTeresa.MacCartney%40usg.edu%7C66c485ff75a54aea0edd08d7c695ef1d%7C4711f877fb3a4f11aaab3c496800c23d%7C0%7C0%7C637196219567050726&amp;sdata=Q%2BcMbhLRbGCdMCq8qGljY1ek1MbRvKJ1SidoUZcHuTg%3D&amp;reserved=0).

Health officials advise that the incubation period of COVID-19 is 2-14 days, with an average period of 5 days. Symptoms include coughing, fever and shortness of breath.  Most people experience mild to moderate symptoms.

Guidance from DPH identifies those with the highest risk to contract COVID-19 are travelers to countries with widespread outbreaks, as well as those travelers’ close contacts.

fhklum,1,2020-03-12,What kind of internship should I choose for expanding my skillset?,berocko_bama,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fhklum/what_kind_of_internship_should_i_choose_for/,"I have a choice of two internships:

One in industry as an embedded software engineer intern; a great choice logistically because of proximity to where me &amp; my family live, so I save on rent and also have slightly higher pay by a few dollars an hour in a lower cost of living area.

One in a government job working on more web development-related work (e.g. React, Typescript) near the Bay Area, almost certainly more applicable to a larger number of jobs, would let me get my feet wet with web development (finally) after just doing Python, Java, C projects in university.

As far as I can tell, a significantly higher proportion of jobs are web-focused, so getting to learn JavaScript, frameworks, etc. by working with them all summer sounds like a significant advantage in terms of skill set: that makes me want to take the latter internship. Then again, the relative rarity of embedded work makes that seem more desirable too. I'm not sure that the first one will be as great of a learning experience, but since I haven't taken operating systems yet, perhaps the nature of the embedded role will lend itself to better understanding of OS?"

First of all, I don't write here a lot because I'm usually a lone wolf and like to learn things on my own,

That is a huge reason why I may not even accept some of the comments I will get because I am confident in my methods and timing.

Therefore do not try to persuade me to ""slow down"" or tell me I'm progressing ""too fast"" because I feel like I'm at the time where I should ""level up my game"" already even if it's not much, and I'd much rather make mistakes early and learn than make bad habits stick for a long time before I figure them out.  
**Background :**

With that out of the way, I am asking for advice about what step I should take next, I have been learning the basics of programming in C# using Channel 9 Tutorial by Bob Tabor, finished several Unity tutorials and a few more 20+ videos C# tutorials on Youtube by Brackeys, Unity, AngelSix and a few more which are of very high quality.

I feel that I have arrived to the place where I can start contributing to the programming community either by entering into an unpaid internship or a passion project (as those will tolerate mistakes I might make) while getting me closer to the enviorment of other programmers whom I can learn from and increase my learning speed, as I feel it coming to a pause soon.

**Actual Question here :**

I have gone over the FAQ of this SubReddit but have not found anything that satisifies me enough, So I thought I'd ask you What should I seek : Passion projects or Internships, and How to go about finding them(preferably online)

fhn9kg,25,2020-03-12,Coronavirus and the hustle mentality in college,beauxaly,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fhn9kg/coronavirus_and_the_hustle_mentality_in_college/,"With Coronavirus leading to precautionary measures in many countries, and consequently shutting down temporarily institutions like universities, I can't help but wonder what this (minor, given the circumstances and overall public health protection) societal and economic disruption signifies for our everyday lives.

As a senior undergrad working on many papers and ongoing personal and whatnot projects, I feel uncomfortable having my university shut down. For the most part of this academic year, I have been relentlesly chasing essays, papers, my thesis, classes, internships (to all of which I have been denied to), conferences, and had just a few days ago a really important symposium abroad postponed due to the virus outbreak.

Having disregarded my mental health and fatigue all these months, this situation must and has put some new perspective into my self-management. Getting caught up in your everyday struggles, deadlines, calls, personal and professional drama, one can overestimate their health and flow of schedule. The chase being cut off for two weeks is making me feel both like an addict, desperately looking for distractions and tasks to keep me ""busy"", and an idiot, for underestimating the limitations and sudden turn of events life gives, and for foolishly maintaining constantly a go go go attitude without giving myself, and my close circle of loved ones, breaks, and time to feel present.

It's not only about the cheezy ""not taking things for granted"". As a college student, this pandemic is to me both an alarming situation, and a personal wake up call for my hustle, go hard or go home mentality. Admittedly, it's actually really great to pursue your goals and stay focused on those, but being all that is harmful in the long run definitely to yourself, and for your friends and family as well, depending on how you behave during stressful periods (because truthfully I unleash the 'beast' in moments packed with chores and important work, stacked).

This is a good time to reflect on that, I think. To recollect thyself and re-evaluate how to approach the everyday struggles as a person involved in the academic sphere. 

Thank you for reading this!I'd love your feedback and input on these thoughts. I hope everyone is well, safe, healthy and protected. I am hoping for the best and for all this to run its course."
fhn9vl,7,2020-03-12,I feel like I wasted a prime portion of my life and its all my fault.,mjsprezza,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/fhn9vl/i_feel_like_i_wasted_a_prime_portion_of_my_life/,"I usually don't like to feel self-pity or throw pity parties, but I've been thinking a lot about this recently. This is also my first post on reddit, so forgive me if I'm putting this in the wrong section. I just saw this area and it talks about how you want to be a better person. I feel talking about this will help.

So I'm 28 years old, going to be 29 in a couple of months and I'm feeling this loss of youth hit very hard. I remember when I was 20, 21, 22 I had all of these dreams and visions of what I wanted to do when I got older. I would travel, I would move out of my mom's house, I would save up money for a bit and then move to another state, I would do all these things. The problem is, even though I had things in writing, those plans still were not clear. I just expected to land a job right after graduation and everything would be fine right away.

That didn't happen, I spent 18 months more or less unemployed. I had a job that paid $120 a week, definitely not enough to pay school loans, so I had to defer them. Then I got into a car accident in late 2013 that required several months to recover. The highlight of it all was going to London in June 2014 for my grandaunts' birthday. My mom paid for it and we spent a week there. It was a great time for sure, but I haven't had anything live up to that.

In late 2014, I was hired and got paid $350 a week as an intern. A couple months later, that didn't work, so I took another low paying job for $37,000. I didn't get pay raises and the company just shut down due to lack of profitability. I ended up freelancing for another 20 months. I thought it was a great experience though the clientele was inconsistent.

Now, I have a job I got hired for last year making $58,000 - finally some good money. But I'm in so much debt. I have to get rid of this stuff before I move out and living at home at this age is pathetic. I'm pretty much a hermit, all of my good friends live in other states now and we only see maybe once a year.

I see all my friends moving up with their lives, moving to different cities, traveling, getting into relationships, getting married, and I feel like I got left behind and missed out on a key growing experience in my life. The last time I had sex was 9 years ago in college and it was only twice. The other periods were spent in a sexless existence.

That time when you're supposed to learn good lessons, get the final ""growing pains"" out of your system and set yourself up well for your 30s. I feel trapped in this existential loss of youth knowing that the wonder in life is gone and its pretty much all my fault. I took those jobs. I didn't take risks. I didn't plan. I was too optimistic. I feel like I wasted this decade.

That's it."

How should I do it? I dont want to text because I’ve worked there two weekends(I offered 6 days but they demanded only weekends) so I feel like I’d be a dick by quitting so soon. However, as I posted here before I hate the job etc etc but luckily I also found an internship that wants me to come in that’s actually related to my career and not just a bussing job.

Btw sorry if I’ve posted here too much within such a short time. This job situation has been tricky, especially cuz my good friend got me the job and I don’t want him blamed for my dumbass mistakes. 

Should I text my manager for her email then send the resignation through that? Should I talk to the other manager who didn’t get me the job and isn’t in charge of scheduling but MAY be present Friday? I could even talk to the owner but he’s not known to be nice to ANYONE so he scares tf out of me lol"

fhq88j,3,2020-03-12,Work After Years of Nonemployment,05manuel44,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fhq88j/work_after_years_of_nonemployment/,"I am 28 years old, live with my parents, and have never had a full-time job. How I got to be where I am today is not super important since my situation is radically different from what it was three years ago, so I’ll keep it short. Basically back in in 12th grade, I caught a serious case of the flu and was diagnosed with CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) a year after that. The illness debilitated me to the point that I was unable to work or study for over half a decade and essentially lived as a shut-in in my parents’ house (I posted my story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/c0tc47/full_recovery_from_cfs/)).

Today I am 100% cured and see no chance of relapse whatsoever. And I have no other health condition so that nothing is holding me back. I got a bachelor’s degree in less than three years with a near-perfect GPA at my local university, which increased my confidence. I did well on the GRE and got some research experience with one of my professors. I also had the luck of getting paid to study with no loans taken out.

Right now I’m totally motivated to work and pursue a career in a field that I love, and I’ve made myself more organized and efficient. But, and it’s a big but, I’m in the unusual situation of being almost thirty and having little work experience. I’ve had only two part-time jobs over the last two years: first as a vendor and later as a math and SAT tutor – and each lasted less than one year. I don’t know anyone else who’s ever been in my position. And, so, I turn to you.

My three main concerns are:

1. Should I get a master’s degree now or work full-time for a couple of years first? I will soon start applying for full-time jobs anyways. But if I also apply for graduate school, I would only be able to work for around a year (depending on how fast I get a job). The argument that I’m making in my mind for the Master’s is that I should just get school done and over with now that I have my achievements fresh in my professor’s minds; otherwise I’d have to go into the work-environment and then back to school. I also have time to carefully plan what program I go into. The counterargument is that the clock is ticking.
2. How big of a factor is age in getting entry jobs and internships? And is there a difference between actual age and perceived age? I ask that cause I’m sometimes perceived younger than 28, which is an Asperger’s trait.
3. Given the importance of projecting a good image, and the commonplaceness of resume-inflation, what kind of a story could I tell an employer? I doubt they’d like to hear: “Well, erm: I just bummed around for a couple of years, perpetually staring at the ceiling.”"

Is it possible?",ancillarycafe,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/fhrb4g/looking_to_return_to_it_after_years_away_no/,"Hi - this is my first Reddit post, so apologies if I missed something in the rules or a best practice. 

I've worked in IT since the late 90s, starting as a sysadmin during the dot com bubble, then got very lucky after it burst and landed a CIO gig for a community college. Never completed a bachelor's degree, but had a lot of experience, and while working at the CC I got sent out for a ton of certs - CCSP, MCSE, MCSA, CCNA, ISSP, CEH, CompTIA, and a handful of programming certs. Got laid off after an administrative regime change during the recession, and never quite got a foothold back into a regular IT job since. Floated around for a bit after that - I worked for myself doing network consulting for a few years, and most recently worked for a friend for their design and IT consulting business, but it's been a real struggle and nothing ever quite flourished. During a break from the business, the owner let the URL lapse and now I can't even link to the old website for any kind of portfolio purposes. 

I've been doing other work to make ends meet for the last several years but want to get back into it if I can. I have a family to support and can't just stop working to go to school or full time training, even if I had the money to do that, which I don't. Loans to go back to school or for training are out of the question. I've considered something like one of those bootcamps that take a portion of your salary after you find a job, just to get some kind of recent certification on my resume. I think the content wouldn't be difficult, but the ones I've found that are online and have the income share agreements require full time immersion, which I cannot do since I have to work (currently split between construction and rideshare). Being busy with work and family, it's difficult to impossible to join local coding groups to network.

tl;dr 3 questions: 

1. How important is having a recent training or certification? (If important, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated)
2. Is my lack of bachelor's degree combined with (verifiable) employment gap and old certs too much of a barrier?
3. What kind of jobs can I apply for that would consider my lengthy experience combined with my lack of degree?  Everything I'm finding either requires a lot that I don't have, or seems to be an internship. 

I've been so disheartened and depressed about my string of bad luck since my layoff. I'd love to be able to give it a go once again and appreciate any advice anyone has. Thank you in advance."

I'm a cs minor student who's just about to finish up and graduate but I've been fairly unsuccessful in finding a job. I've tweaked my resume multiple times over and have added more relevant programming projects.

I also have a background in Stats so I was looking into analyst positions. I do want to have a job and career in something CS related. Stats has been a major bore. 

My question is what can I do with a limited professional experience but a decent programming background with projects. I figure that since I didn't do a PEY I'm unfit for anything for new grads so I've been looking at internships. Should I look into anything like Brainstation? Should I consider getting a double degree for a CS major?

Last year, I got an internship in a top company. At the end of the internship, I passed some interviews and got offered a permanent position inside the company which I accepted. 

The role is basically support/helpdesk but on a really ""deep"" level of the technology... I never really enjoyed working in helpdesk but decided to try my best anyway. (The hiring process was pretty tough and I felt so proud to get an offer that it didn't matter what the job was about -that was a mistake, I agree but as someone with almost no experience, I don't know what is my dream job yet.)

I was hired as a ""new graduate"" even though I still need to pass my end of study thesis (and I still need to put quite a lot of work into it).

It's been 6 months and I don't fit. The issues I need to troubleshoot are too hard, I don't have enough knowledge about the technology and there is way too much work to handle. I'm working overtime to catch up on the workload (unpaid)... The thing is that i still need to work on my thesis so I don't have enough time (nor motivation) to handle both the work for the thesis and to study the technology for my role, which I don't really enjoy. At this point, I'm too close to get my master's degree to give up on it, so this is my priority.

I'm thinking about looking for another job. An ""easier"" job. Just to keep active and earn a bit of money while working on my thesis (I plan to graduate in June). Would this be a carrer killer move?"

I am trying to find an internship, but I didn't have any during my Bachelors, so I have no experience. Apart from that, I feel like I'm dumb. I literally can't figure out interview questions. I recently had a coding round. It lasted 60 mins. I solved 3 out of 4, but they were easy. The 4th one required BFS, which I couldn't implement. Even when I start Leetcode, I take like 30 mins to solve the easy ones. Medium ones require approx 90 mins each. I can't even function with noise around. Like if my roommate is talking on the phone with someone, I can't focus on the code. I took CS because I thought I liked programming. I still kinda do, but seeing everyone else being successful in getting internships/ jobs, I'm depressed. I can't figure out if I'm too stupid for CS or everyone else is extraordinarily smart. It's not that I don't understand code, or remember the syntax, I just sometimes can't put my ideas into code. When I read a question and if I understand it, I try to write code using my train of thought. But if I'm distracted or something like that, I can't seem to come back to it and implement it. And then I feel awful about it and can't do anything else. Is this normal with other people in CS? Or do you think I'm in the wrong field? Many people told me to focus on Leetcode, but I can't even do that. To the people who do Leetcode, how do you guys come up with such solutions in just a matter of mins without looking at the solution? I feel like I'm cheating when I see the solution before solving it myself. But I can't even solve it myself. I'm just so confused. What should I do to improve my position?"

History about me: Degree in Computer Engineering. I did well in college, middle of the pack. I worked my ass off on projects and did ok on tests. I have a front-end summer internship and junior dev position from a big bank under my belt. It was a good experience and I didn't fall behind at all, despite working with a language I had to learn on the fly (im decent at reading/interpreting code and I had a good mentor at the job). My contract ended with my last position so I am back on the market and man it has been rough. 

Its only been 3 weeks but the longer I am out of the work, the more depressed I get. I have 0 confidence in my DS/A coding ability. As soon as I hear something about a technical portion in an interview, my heart drops. I'm great with concepts. I can explain data structures/search/sort algorithms, their Big O notation, ect. My pseudocode is solid (I would say). My problem is actually putting it to code. I absolutely suck. I like computers but do I like coding? Its okay. I don't hate it, and I don't love it. I would probably love if I was good/great at it so the fact that I absolutely suck at it and I don't hate it, is a positive to me but I'm starting to rethink if I have a future in this field. I don't have a lot of professional experience but from what I've done, these Leetcode challenges that every interview asks are nothing like the actual position yet every company asks to solve them. My last position I got at the big bank, it was interpersonal interviews. Just wanted to see if I was willing to learn and if I was a good fit. Nothing technical cause it was for a language I have never used, and I got the job. My interpersonal skills are very good but as soon as I get to technical portions of interviews...yea... I can explain what I want to do and how I would solve something... then it gets to the actual coding and I just suck. 

Now with this virus going around, every company is doing video interviews only, which is all code-based. So I can't even win people over with my pseudocode or interpersonal skills. Its just ""Can you code this LeetCode problem? great your hired. You can't solve it? Sorry maybe next time""

I know I will never work at a FAANG and I am fine with that but it seems like every company is just mimicking their interviewing style (especially now) and its to the point where I am questioning my future in this field. I'm just looking for something long-term where I can work my way up because I did not anticipate the interviewing process to be this dreadful/depressing. I spend my days applying for jobs, doing CS50 from Harvard (on problem set 3) and freecodecamp for front-end."

I was till recently confused on which role should I pursue but after some research I decided that I want to be a quant developer. However, I do not come from a typical math background. I'm a grad CS student at top 30 uni in USA. What are my chances that I'll land a quant role. Also I needed some tips on preparation  as I am unable to put a finger on what areas in maths I should cover. I'm in my second semester rn and gave a few interviews for quant intern role but could not make it, major roadblock being maths. Now I'm trying to prepare for full time roles, which I'll apply/interview for in Spring 21. I gather that I need to cover probability and stats, but I'm not really sure what other areas should I look into? Also does applying online helps or does this industry heavily rely on networking.

Whipping out the Gameboys after school to battle and trade, waiting for streetlights to light up my Gameboy color screen at night on the way home from grandmas, praying the red “charge” light would outlast my battle with Giovanni, etc. So it was much to my delight when Pokemon GO launched in 2016. Not only did it give me an excuse to get out of the house during those cool summer nights, but it also allowed for a fresh wave of nostalgia every time a Squirtle popped up on my screen. 

Which brings me to my next point. For those unfamiliar, one of the aspects of PoGo is the friend feature, and thanks to certain subreddits it allows you to add people from around the world. In doing this, you both send each other “gifts” that you’re given from visiting certain Pokestops. These “gifts” also serve as a bit of a postcard, showing the site, city, and state (for USA) that the gift comes from. 
This is where my nightmare started.

___

For my last semester of college I moved in with my parents for an internship back home. Between the demanding hours, pangs for freedom, and just general need for self-care, PoGo served as a nice distraction for the world around me. I try to get out and play whenever I can, usually one weeknight and one day on the weekend every week. While being fairly active within the local community here, I still occasionally post my trainer code on certain subreddits in order to add friends, because who doesn’t like free stuff, right? That’s where he came in. 

GlassPalazzo seemed like any other user that I normally added on this app, and when his gifts showed the postcard of a small village in Italy I didn’t think anything of it. But then I noticed something. As days turned into weeks I noticed he began to get...closer to me through the postcards on his gifts. First it was an airport in Milan, then it was one in Miami, and then from various cities closer to me as he seemed to navigate through the Midwest, until finally I received one just a half hour away from the park I frequently sent gifts from. 

Petrified of my newfound stalker I stopped sending gifts the second this travel pattern occurred to me. For a week or so I quit going out and playing entirely, all the while checking over my shoulder whenever I left my internship or the grocery store to go home. Before too long however, I couldn’t resist and started going out on weekends with other members of our local group. We were never a social group, mostly just small groups of us standing around and raiding certain areas in complete silence until we’d caught whatever Legendary we were all working toward. But still, I remained observant of the faces around me, still paranoid that one may be the one searching for me. Finally, things were normal again, GlassPalazzo seemingly shut down entirely and was no longer sending gifts. For a while I felt safe, and for a while I was right. 

Last week I was making my bi-weekly trip to the park when I noticed him. Not because I recognized him, but because wherever I went, he went. He was never looking at me or making eye contact, but he was also never more than 20 feet away. Even more off-putting was the frequent coughing bouts he’d engage in, not bothering to even cover his mouth or apologize. As night began to set over the park and our small group began our last raid, I scrolled through the names of those in the party, until finally I saw one that made my heart stop.

GlassPalazzo.

A cold beat of sweat rolled down my face as my heart kicked into overdrive and my knees began to feel weak. After taking a few seconds to collect myself, my mind went into survival mode, imploring me to get the hell away from where I was now. In an instant I turned and started walking, and a few seconds later I knew he was following. I didn’t dare look over my shoulder in fear of how close he could possibly be, and before long I was running. My athletic slides began to cut into my toes but I didn’t care, I only knew that I HAD to get away. “Just get in the car, just get in the car” was the only thing going through my head as it came into sight, yet with each step it began to seem farther and farther away. This mental marathon continued until finally I reached it, my body drenched in sweat and the sting from my toes indicating blood had already begun to drip out. I put my hand on the door handle as I took another heaving breath, but before I could pull I felt a sharp pain in the back of my head.

And then everything went black. 

I’m not sure how long I was out, but I was sure that waking up in a concrete room illuminated by a single lightbulb wasn’t a good sign. Bound to a wooden chair I began to wrestle free, the rope burning my wrists with my continued struggle until finally I gave up. For a while longer I sat there there in the silence, with only my staggered breathing and the occasional roar of frustration or squeal of panic filling the room. I assumed I’d die like this, a cold, cruel death of starvation and imprisonment.

 And when I heard the door in front of me open and slam shut, I wished it was..."
fi3tb1,1,2020-03-13,Leveraging internship offers,kab393,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/fi3tb1/leveraging_internship_offers/,"Hi guys, I could really use some advice with two internships I have my eye on.

I was interviewed for an internship at a law firm (undergrad) that pays very well and gives me relevant experience. They told me they were actually looking to hire someone ASAP rather than wait till May when I get out of school. They informed me that they'd keep in touch, but continue to look for other interns who could possibly start now. I followed up with them two weeks later, and just this week because my classes have all been moved online which gives me availability to work now possibly. They promptly responded saying they were putting off recruitment right now due to the Corona Virus outbreak, but they'd get back in touch with me once they figure out their logistics.

Now, I have an interview lined up for next week at a separate non-profit, yet they are offering hours downtown from 5:30-9:30pm in which I would have to bus 2 hours to and from if I took it. My mother is totally opposed to it being a young college student catching the bus late at night in the city.

Obviously, the internship at the law firm is much preferred and would be safer and easier logistically. Yet, that looks very iffy at the moment whether they actually will hire any interns. I don't know whether leveraging an offer from the other place will help my chances or not in the future when the law firm figures out their logistics. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just very desperate right now to find a good paying and relevant internship for the summer as I would really like to take a month off next summer (2021) to visit St. Petersburg on Study Abroad. This will likely be my only chance to get a summer internship before I graduate. I know it's possible for me to have an internship during the Fall/Spring in the upcoming school year, but I have no idea whether my schedule would allow for that at the moment. I also need to save as much money as possible now to help pay for my rent starting August by having a good paying job this summer. In the last 2 years, I have not been able to find any jobs paying more than $8.00 an hour unfortunately.

If anyone has advice for this situation, I would really appreciate it."

I'm super excited to get my first internship, and I'm looking at two offers. One is in embedded software and the other is a regular software engineering internship, and I'd like a second opinion because I don't know which to choose. They're both with smaller startup companies.

The company with the embedded software internship (I'll call them company A) has around 200 people and makes communication systems for various clients, some military and some not.

The company with the regular software internship (company B) has about 50 people in it's office and does works with media advertising (specifically TV).

They're both paying similarly ($20-$22/hr) and are both located in midtown Manhattan, NYC; although A is moving to a new office in West Chelsea, but that's not making a large impact in my decision because either way I can commute. I'm not sure which career path I'd like to take, and this internship would be my first dive into software development professionally. I like both disciplines equally in school, although I prefer higher-level programming just a bit more. I've also visited B before on a school visit and I like their vibe. Should I go for an internship in embedded development because it's less common than regular software, or go with the software internship at a company that I know better?"

- 22 years old
-about to graduate with a degree in Finance (used to be a double major with accounting, but quit the latter too easily) with now over a 3.6 GPA
-Did D1 athletics for a year and a half before getting injured
-worked as an assistant for a professor for a semester
-did an internship in supply chain management one summer


Even before everything started shutting down due to COVID 19, I still had a very difficult time finding job opportunities.  Most of not all my interviews were for financial advisor roles, which I did not want to do, for multiple reasons (being more introverted, mixing work and personal life by having to sell to friends and family, working on commissions, having to build a client base etc...).  

So I had focused on applying to more analytically focused jobs, such as financial, supply chain, or business analyst positions.  However a lot of companies wouldn’t even respond to my application. I got one phone call and not a single formal interview.  

So I figured that what I had going for me just wasn’t quite enough to get an entry level analyst position at a company and that I needed more.  And remember this was still while the economy was still doing at least okay.

Now that the economy is like going to tank I see no reason to not go get more education (unless I  miraculously get a job in the meantime).  To add to this, my one saving grace is that my family is willing to help me a lot financially regardless of my decision, so I’m not too concerned about the short term cost.

Right now I’m taking a data mining class as an elective and I’ve been doing very well at it. Despite the fact that it is somewhat difficult, I’ve found the material pretty interesting and I’ve been one of the top performers in the class and have a pretty comfortable A at the moment.  This is why I am highly considering trying to get a Masters degree in Business Analytics.  Along with that I’ve been told that this is highly in demand.

Right now my highest priority is guaranteeing myself a job in business (that’s not sales/marketing) as quickly as possible.  I’ve also thought about staying longer in school to go into accounting.  Although I’m leaning towards getting a masters in Business Analytics, I’m still not entirely sure though.

My two main criteria between choosing these two are ease of getting employed and time, with the former being more important that the latter.

What I mean by “ease of getting employed” is that ideally the fact that having a specific degree practically equates to getting employed.  In an at least decent economy, the demand for graduates with the degree ought to outweigh the supply.  Between Accounting and Business Analytics which one has a better ratio of supply of degree holders to degree holders demanded?

Time, the other criteria is pretty self explanatory.  I’ve done some research for this and most masters degrees for Business Analytics take 12-18 months to complete, whereas getting a degree in accounting would mean 15 more undergrad hours plus 30 graduate hours of schooling, which would take 18-24 months to complete.

So with all this in mind, what do you think is my best bet towards getting employed in business, between getting a masters in Business Analytics or getting a Masters in Accounting?"

Background:

Growing up, I was quite the loser lol. I did not have many friends and was sorta considered as an ""incompetent"" person. These negatives really motivated me and helped me figure what my goals where. I committed myself to pursuing a meaningful life and wanted to define myself as a person fully capable of making society a better place. Thus my journey began (very cliche, I know). 

I excelled throughout high school and got into a very good/competitive university in my state and decided to major in Computer Science, because, well, I was always somewhat tech-savvy and loved working with computer software. While I am a Computer Science major, I have always wanted to enter the field of medicine also, with Computer Science as a fall back in case life doesn't work out. 

Fast forward to my Junior year of college, I got so focused on my major that I ended up applying and getting a software engineering internship over this summer that is also offering a good full-time position for me after I graduate. I have a couple friends who got into the same program and we have planned out relocation housing and everything together. However, despite getting into the internship, I am not so sure if I will be fully happy in this career field. The field of medicine is very comfortable to me and is something I would pursue in a heartbeat due to my exposure and to doctors and other people in the realm of healthcare. With Computer Science, I have a secure future, whereas pursuing medicine isn't as certain. 

So here are my decisions: 

* **Choice one** : I have the possibility of starting my pre-med courses over the summer (has to be this summer due to complicated time and life issues) and still graduate with my Computer Science degree.

* **Choice two** : Pursue the internship and have my career be secured after college.

I’m one of two interns working on it and I can’t go to anybody for questions because nobody has any idea what they’re doing so when I run into errors i have to figure it out online and there’s very little information about kivy or the modules the app is using.

I’ve been learning a lot more from practicing Leetcode and school is about to start back up and I’m worried I’m going to get burnt out trying to balance school, work, and the internship especially when I feel as though I’m being exploited for “experience”.

I'm sorry if it's all too vague but I'm really under pressure to provide for my family.

**Some background**:

I was in the last semester of **computer networks** and dropped out of university because my anxiety evolved into a **depersonalization** issue. After almost two years outside the academic world, I landed a job as a programmer (given my previous experience as an intern developer).

Luckily I fell in love with programming when I got this internship to do a monkey job of scraping data manually and I automated it with some  Shell Script and a bit of PHP that I learned at the aforementioned course and for that, they gave an opportunity to write a python/Django app.

The internship was at the pro-rectory of the university that I drop out and only through a public tender I could be hired. None was available. So a professor told me about this job at a construction company... I applied and I started working in *a 4000+ employees company in my hometown in Brazil, and I've been working there for 7 months as a programmer (Ruby on Rails).*

My current job is good but I don't see a long term fit.

I'm not sure if is worth going back to a private college for another year or so to finish the computer networks course or paying for some CS courses on edX or doing some DEV boot camp."

I'm a high school senior and my school just closed. They will be closed for at least 4 weeks. I am very interested in cyber security and have been reading various books on linux, broader security concepts, and python for security. I've also been applying these skills through an old thinkpad I have loaded linux onto.

As a result of the district holding a policy of self-quarantining, I will have these 4 weeks or so to spend on whatever I want. Aside from the ~3-4 hours/day I will have to spend on online schooling, I now have an abundance of time that I would like to spend on furthering my cyber security skills.

Here are some thoughts. I would like to obtain a cyber security internship in the near future and am aware that experience is the most necessary qualification. I may even take a gap year should all things align. Since, however, I am relatively inexperienced I am planning on doing the following: taking some classes online (whatever courses you guys recommend), doing python projects, setting up a home lab, and doing CTFs.

My main request is for online classes. I figure that since I will have an ample amount of time I could get a lot/couple of them done, which would really boost my ""experience"" since I am not yet studying computer science in university. However, if you advise against this please tell me your reasoning. I am optimistic that I could take these classes and do all the aforementioned projects like CTFs that I stated earlier.

fidxia,2,2020-03-14,How to tell if I'm a viable candidate for a position? How do I find internships beyond the obvious candidates? How do I develop from an intermediate hobbyist developer to a career professional?,spugneemo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fidxia/how_to_tell_if_im_a_viable_candidate_for_a/,"I am seeking a position as a Full Stack Developer, and I have several questions about how I can make this come to pass.

Firstly, how do I know I'm qualified for a position, or, how do I know I'm a viable candidate for a position? In virtually every application I've looked at (many hundreds of them at this point), entry level positions will require several years experience in several technologies. I've heard through my meager network that these are meant to be qualifications for ideal candidates, and I should still apply to these positions even if I don't fully meet every criterion. To what extent is this true? Furthermore, it becomes more and more frustrating when each application has a completely new, unique set of technology requirements. While I understand that Full Stack development is a melding of many technologies, it seems that no matter how many new technologies I get under my belt, there is something new on top of everything else I am required to know. I'm afraid that I simply have far too much more to learn before I can reasonably start pursuing a career in any sort of development sphere. How can I tell if this is the case or not?

Secondly, in an attempt to address the experience issue alluded to above, I've been attempting to apply to internships. For context, I live in the greater Seattle area. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and more are all on my doorstep. And I've been rejected from all of them for several years now. In all honesty, in some cases it is for lack of trying; from what I've heard of the corporate culture of Amazon, it seems that I would not enjoy my time there. However in many cases, especially Microsoft and Google, I've made great efforts to get their attention, to no avail. And while I still desperately want to work for Google specifically, I am trying to be realistic about my chances and options, and am trying to branch out. However, my research thus far into other internships are universally dominated by the Big N companies. It seems that my only options for any sort of internship is through these companies, though I suspect this is not entirely true. How then do I go about finding internships elsewhere, when the market is so saturated by these organizations?

I'm not entirely sure if this is the appropriate venue for this question, but I may as well lay it down here if only for the career context of it. Thirdly, while I am enrolled in an education program, I am an impatient man. For myriad personal reasons, I need to push my career forward to any degree sooner rather than later. I don't expect to be senior developer next week, but I DO need to have any sort of foothold in the technology sector in the next several months. And while the logistical, bureaucratic side of things is a major hurdle in and of itself, I also desperately want to be better at these skills. Speaking specifically in terms of Full Stack, I have a basic working knowledge of HTML/CSS, Java, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, SQL, and DAO design. However, I feel that I'm stuck in the ""Don't know what you don't know"" phase of understanding; I can put together a basic workable website, but looking at the full documentation for Spring technologies, Apache server technologies, hell, even the example projects from my master's program in which I'm only supposed to tinker with a few classes, it seems that my full knowledge base is a drop in the bucket compared to the breadth of knowledge I'm supposed to have to fully leverage these technologies. Perhaps I'm simply overwhelmed by the sheer scope of function that these tools provide, and I'm not meant to fully understand every method, annotation, and tool to be successful in implementing them. Regardless, I want to push my knowledge and ability forward, to be an expert and professional in this field. I'm past the beginner stuff, past the beginner mentality. I can troubleshoot and Stack Exchange with the best of them, and build my own projects from the ground up. I feel like I've plateaued here, though. And because I'm constantly spinning my wheels at this level of expertise, I'm afraid I won't be able to progress beyond this entry point in my career.

Some background about me: I am currently enrolled in an online Masters of Science in Software Application Development course through Southern New Hampshire University. I'm about a year out from completion. My degree and career focus has evolved quite a bit throughout my academic career; I hold a Bachelors of Science in Physics, with a focus in education. I am currently a math and science tutor, with no prospects for career advancement. I started my degree program in Data Analytics, but transitioned to Application Development when I discovered that the specifics of that discipline didn't drive me the way that software design did. Throughout all of my academic and professional career, I'd programmed as a hobbyist. Python mostly, building math tools to coincide with my Physics work, or playing around with UI tools like Tkinter. Finally I realized that Software Development was ultimately what I wanted to pursue, and here we are.

Additionally, I feel that it is worth noting that I am on the recovery side of depression and acute anxiety disorder issues. I've recently started counseling and a medication regimen, which has helped bolster my confidence and general ability to work through difficult issues and disparaging thoughts; it is those changes that have motivated me to seek guidance from /r/cscareerquestions and to generally reinvigorate my push for a new career.

Thank you all for your time and consideration on my situation. I am hopeful that you all can give me some valuable guidance, and at least provide some perspective on my career path outside my assumptions and perceptions.

fiepsr,1,2020-03-14,I feel guilty every time my parents spend money on me.,NofapInPeace,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/fiepsr/i_feel_guilty_every_time_my_parents_spend_money/,"My parents bought some masks from my home country and shipped them to my current country because I’m studying abroad. Local masks are sold out and people sell it to rip others off. 

When my mom told me how much she spent on those shopping fees. I suddenly feel really guilty. Especially in my current situation, I’m a second degree student studying compsci in another country and I couldn’t find a summer internship myself. I already bombed two interviews and I feel like a dumb fuck.

I’m 25 years old and still single and still can’t even find a single fucking internship. I cost my parents 50k cad every year and I’m still useless. 

I feel miserable. Although I already did an internship and earned like 10k cad but I got it purely out of luck I think and I didn’t land it till the last moment before new semester started. 

I question my career after graduation. I doubt if I can find my SO. I doubt I would let my parents down. 
I know they love me and they felt so anxious when they heard I couldn’t find masks locally. I’m a grown ass man but I still need to be babysittered. I feel so shit about myself.

I cooked myself everyday to save money and I barely buy new clothes. My last new clothes was an HM shirt I bought last summer. 

My parents own a medium business in my home country, honestly they make good money in terms of their education level and our local economy. They both didn’t go to high school and never visited another country. My mother only visited out of province one time. I want to make them proud of me. I want to make money to compensate them after I graduate although they have their own pensions and insurance.

I don’t jus want to be a 25 year old single man who constantly cost them money and achieve nothing.
They ask me if I have found a gf every time we FaceTimed. I said I was busy. But I know I have zero self confidence and self esteem. I don’t know how to be loved and how to love others. I even resist intimate relationships when my parents want to be intimate with me like holding my hands.
I’m such an introvert kid with trauma. God. Im crying as I I’m tying these words. I live under so much pressure that I give to myself. I consider everything difficult and are such a timid child.

My mental health is so unhealthy and I try to please everyone I meet which is so unhealthy and pathetic. I want to change. I want to know how to not give a fuck. But it’s so hard. I’m sensitive, overly self conscious, and timid. I can’t even get rid of masturbation. I drained myself so that I won’t think about sex as I study. I seek companion inside porn. 

I want to become a better me. I want to live a happy life. I want to make my parents proud. I want to find a job. I want to find someone who I can trust and talk to."

I'm going to be graduating in June and I'm wondering if it's possible that companies will hire during this time even during the super specific situation going on that I can't mention.

I'm having a hard time finding places to apply (LinkedIn easy applies never get any responses) and I'll be digging my foot deeper and doing direct on website applies.

I'm worried that I might not find a job before graduation and I'll be stuck working at the internship I am at right now for 20ish an hour.

I have multiple projects including full-stack website deployed using k8s and an emulator project for the NES. I've had two internships totaling 2 years at local companies (none that you heard of).

Am I not competitive enough to get a job during this climate? I'm pretty worried about it.

I have an offer for a software engineering internship that will run from around June to August that I will be leaving my full time job for. I want to secure a full time SWE to transition to immediately after the internship finishes so I don't have to go multiple months without income.

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem**: When should I start applying? Will most companies be looking for immediate hires? I don't fall into the regular graduate-in-May or graduate-in-December pipeline for new grads. Should I just express this in my resume? There are also a few other concerns that make this a bit more confusing for me...

&amp;nbsp;

**Other considerations**:

* If I start applying now, I won't have the internship on my resume to attract interest from companies. I had a VERY hard time making it past the resume screen to even get this internship (500+ apps) and I think it would be a waste to not be applying with it on my resume in any form. I don't know if putting ""Software Engineer Intern -- Incoming"" on my resume would hold any weight since I haven't even done any real work yet. Worst case it is actually frowned upon.. I don't know.
* If I start applying after my internship, it might take me months to get an offer. I may have to go a few months without having anything. For me this is the exact situation I am trying to avoid.
* If i apply during my internship, I run into sort of a mix of the first two problems. I'm not sure I'll have done enough in the internship to have notable interest from companies, and I still might have to be unemployable for a few months after the internship. I also risk being short on time if I'm required to fly out for interviews and such. For my current job I had stockpiled a bunch of PTO so this wasn't a problem.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
fiugpk,0,2020-03-14,Working in Finance Industry - How do I switch from sales to analysis?,financerdancer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fiugpk/working_in_finance_industry_how_do_i_switch_from/,"I graduated college in 2018 with a 3.8 GPA, but my family was hit hard financially which meant I had to take the first job that I was offered. The job was in a sort of sketchy life insurance sales environment at a very reputable company (Prudential). The office I was apart of, for context, was third to last in the country and was definitely on a negative slope before eventually being consolidated to a place far from where I live. I considered myself very fortunate to leave, as I was able to get into an advisor development program for Merrill Lynch at Bank of America. However with the negativity and pressure to make the money to support myself and family at my last job and mounting pressure to meet unrealistic sales goals at my new job with Bank of America, I eventually had a mental breakdown and had to check myself into an in-patient program out of fear of hurting myself. 

The program helped immensely and allowed me to do some soul searching, however I left the program without a job, and a new understanding that I was no good at sales and really entered the  finance industry for my love of mathematics and numbers. I even began to remember the number of internships I had worked while still in high school that focused more on math, financial data, and reporting versus accruing assets and “hitting the phones”. 

After a couple of months of applying to jobs with 0 response (not even a rejection) and not hearing back from any of the employment agencies I sent my resume to, I realize my background after graduating college is mostly sales intensive, and this makes me uncompetitive with recent grads who were able to take analyst internships during college (I worked at Prudential, because I never heard back from any of the internships I had applied to). 

I’m at a bit of a loss now, because I feel like my only experience in the analysis realm of finance was during high school, years ago. I’m just wondering if there’s any entry level jobs I can apply to, so I can build more experience to finally reach my goal of being a financial analyst. 

I have a large amount of money saved from my days at Bank of America and my family is in a much more stable financial position, so I’m not as pressed for time as I was when I first graduated.

Any feedback or advice is greatly welcomed, especially from any industry professionals!

1. IT intern at HPE
2. Deep Learning Research Intern at xxx University (Top Private, not Ivy/CMU/Mit)

I'm not worried about the pay, and I don't know my team at HPE or of that sort, while I've met the professors and the PI and my mentor that I'd intern with at XXX, where I'd be working on training neural nets for deep learning projects although in a biology application

While research is appealing because I'm interested in deep learning, I know that an internship would be more appealing to future employers although I'm not sure how IT instead of SWE would affect that. I'm pretty happy going either way so it's been tough and my deadline for choosing is coming up soon.

fiz2gh,1,2020-03-15,Intern with a lot of struggles with Consul Connect,DistantTax,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/fiz2gh/intern_with_a_lot_of_struggles_with_consul_connect/,"Hi

For my BA I'm doing in an internship with another student, where we have to research Service Mesh in Kubernetes. But we're having a big struggle with consul connect.

We wanted to setup circuit breaking (a envoy proxy feature) while using bookinfo (the sample application from the Istio guys). Do you guys have any tips how to configure the envoy proxies?

Installing consul was easy but configuring the proxies are giving us a hard time because it's the first time for us. Or do you guys have some easy examples?

Hope you guys can help :)

Cheers!"
fj17ke,15,2020-03-15,How to network as a programmer?,zaris47,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/fj17ke/how_to_network_as_a_programmer/,"I'm a CS undergrad currently in my second year of college. Even though I'm not an expert I am something of an advanced beginner. Some of my buddies in class have already gotten internship or job offer or even as much as a mentor (for free). They all told me it's because they networked and when I asked how they said reddit or discord. I would really like some exposure and mentoring too I think we all can agree it's hard being a Ronin in this coding world. Something about me is I'm an introvert with shit social skill, not entirely antisocial by purpose but more so by circumstance. 

What I want to know is 'How' to network and where from? are there any particular Discord server or is it just because I suck at being a social human being? My main expectation from network would be some kind of mentorship or an internship/job opportunity. Thanks for your replies."
fj22pr,0,2020-03-15,Need some advice for my first data science internship,Technodickss,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fj22pr/need_some_advice_for_my_first_data_science/,"My first ever data science internship starts on may this year at a big company.

I'm a CS-freshman and I'm familiar with statistics and probability theory and I've taken calculus I and II.

I have my own data science project that I created with python. I have some experience with cleaning and munging one dataset from Kaggle. I'm only familiar with linear and logistic regression when it comes to machine learning.

I have no practical experience with SQL and I've never performed data scraping.

What are your advice on how to start preparing for my internship as data scientist trainee? Should I take some MOOC's or read some related books? If so, what are the most essential for this kind of a job?"

fj31k0,79,2020-03-15,Mythical MIT deferred acceptance + UF Full Ride: Asian Male STEM-ish(?),rk2602,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/fj31k0/mythical_mit_deferred_acceptance_uf_full_ride/,"**Schools (will edit as they come in):** 

* *California Institute of Technology*: EA (Rejected)
* *University of Chicago*: EA (Deferred, then Rejected)
* *University of Florida*: RD (**Accepted with Full-Ride Benacquisto Scholarship!**)
* *Georgia Institute of Technology*: EA (Accepted)
* *Massachusetts Institute of Technology*: EA (**Deferred, then Accepted!**)
* *University of Michigan*: EA (Accepted)
* *University of Pennsylvania*: RD (Still Waiting)

* *Princeton University*: RD (Still Waiting)
* *Purdue University*: EA (Accepted, w/ 10k Scholarship)
* *Swarthmore College*: RD (Still Waiting)
* *University of Virginia*: EA (Accepted)

**Demographics:** Decently well-off Asian Male, Public School in PA, no hooks. 

**Major**: It's really weird--I want to manage large ""systems"" (I get really excited at airports!), and different colleges have different majors for this, so depending on the school, I applied to: **Economics, Industrial Engineering, Systems Engineering, Financial Engineering, Applied Mathematics, and Business Analytics**.

**Academics:**

ACT:  35 (35E,36M,36R,34S)

SAT: 1520 (720R,800M)

SAT II: Double 8 hundos in Math 2 and Physics

Class rank: School doesn't rank

UW/W GPA: 4.0 UW (don't know weighted)

Coursework: Like 2/3 Honors, 1/3 AP, 1 or 2 post-APs. 

*AP scores*:

Computer Science A: 4 

Calculus BC: 5

Physics C Mechanics: 5

Economics: Microeconomics: 5

World History: 5

Physics C Electricity &amp; Magnetism: Haven't taken yet

Economics: Macroeconomics: Haven't taken yet

Computer Science Principles: Haven't taken yet

**Awards:**

* MIT Inspire Finalist
* Coolidge Senator (Top 100 out of \~3400 applicants)
* 4-Year Army ROTC Scholarship Winner
* 4-Year Air Force ROTC Scholarship Winner
* NMSQT Finalist
* AP Scholar w/ Distinction 

**Extracurriculars:**

Intern at Local Credit Union: Volunteered a whole lot, and served as Vice-Chair on their Youth Advisory Board (basically we talked about marketing strategies to students). Created an edition of the union's internal magazine (submitted). Also worked there last summer in their ""Corporate Responsibility"" Department.

Summer Intern for Quarknet @ UPenn: Worked on revamping and optimizing image generation on a Gaseous Ionization Particle Detector (don't worry, I had no idea what I was doing when I started). Wrote an abstract on our findings, also submitted to colleges.

Summer Volunteer at local summer camp: Basically just babysat a bunch of elementary school kids.

Stat Prob Club

Science Olympiad

Speech and Debate

Cross Country

Orchestra

**Recs and Essays:** I tried to make good relationships with my recommenders (Econ and Physics teachers, Quarknet supervisor, and guidance counselor), so maybe 7/10. For essays, I knew I had to break out of the Asian STEM stereotype, so I tried to make a lot of them incredibly quirky, while at the same time, incredibly focused on my passions (this is what I think got me my MIT acceptance). Juniors, start your essays NOW (you can literally write about anything for the common app), and continue writing furiously over the summer.

**Reflections:** Coming into the process, I wanted either: 1) a full ride anywhere (I HIGHLY recommend applying to UF if you're National Merit--you can go to one of the best public schools in the country for FREE), or 2) an acceptance to a place my Asian parents can flex to their friends on Whatsapp. Somehow, I got both (and I can't decide between the 2), despite being just your typical overachiever. Anyways, I think the secret to getting into the college of your dreams is: 1) pursue a lot of things when you're younger, and then focus on what you are most passionate about, and 2) write the most amazing, jaw-dropping essays you can.

Good luck to everyone else!"

fj5vwv,31,2020-03-15,CRC (and Flag) Closure Explanation from Task Force,WhoEvenAreYouMate,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/fj5vwv/crc_and_flag_closure_explanation_from_task_force/,"Please review this COVID-19 information update being provided in consultation with the Georgia Department of Public Health:

Georgia Tech has been notified of the following situations related to COVID-19 that we wanted to make you aware of out of an abundance of caution:    
•	A person who works in administration at the Campus Recreation Center (CRC) has had contact with a family member who has tested positive for COVID-19.  This staff member has not tested positive yet for COVID-19.   
•	An intern at the Georgia Tech Counseling Center has also recently had contact with a friend who tested positive for COVID-19.  Like the staff member in the CRC, this person has not tested positive yet for COVID-19.   

If you might have had contact with anyone who has not yet tested positive but who has had exposure, it’s important for you to understand guidance given from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says that individuals exposed to asymptomatic people with potential exposure (such as in a household) are not considered exposed. They do not recommend testing, symptom monitoring, or special management for these people.

The staff member at the CRC works in an office and does not generally have direct contact with visitors in the common areas at the facility. As an extra precaution, however, we are going to close the CRC from Sunday, March 15, until Tuesday morning, March 17, to complete a full, deep cleaning of the entire facility. 

We have also made the decision to do the same thing at the Charles A. Smithgall Student Service Building (the Flag Building) and the Student Center on our main campus. GT Counseling and CARE services will move to the second floor of Stamps Health Center during this time.

The overall risk of COVID-19 to students, faculty and staff at Georgia Tech is low. Health officials are taking precautionary measures to quickly identify cases of COVID-19 and take appropriate public health action to reduce its spread and protect the general public in identifying potential contacts. As a reminder, Georgia Tech has canceled all on-campus events until at least March 29.

For members of the Georgia Tech community, the best prevention measures for any respiratory virus, including COVID-19 are:     
•	Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.    
•	Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.    
•	Avoid close contact with people who are sick.    
•	Stay home when you are sick.    
•	Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.    
•	Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

While we understand the concerns and fear around COVID-19, it is extremely important to stay calm and maintain a close eye on your health and any symptoms that may arise. The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Most cases of COVID-19 are mild with symptoms similar to a cold.

In addition, if you have recently traveled to areas where there are ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 and develop fever with cough and shortness of breath within 14 days of your travel, or if you have had contact with someone who is suspected to have COVID-19, stay home and call your health care provider or local health department right away. Be sure to call before going to a doctor’s office, emergency room, or urgent care center and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

To reiterate, there are no identified cases of COVID-19 Georgia Tech at this time. We will provide updates as we learn more.

For accurate and reliable information about COVID-19 log on to https://dph.georgia.gov/novelcoronavirus or https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html."

fj69jk,2,2020-03-15,Your stats are almost never more important than your essays and an EC,ankosi15647,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/fj69jk/your_stats_are_almost_never_more_important_than/,"This subreddit has a culture of being over obsessed w/ super high stats in order to be considered for an Ivy or some other top school. I want to shed light into an alternative perspective

I am a likely student for Yale and Columbia as well as an Emory Scholar Finalist. This not only means that I got in but also that I am a favored/top applicant. 

Here’s my stats

*I did not send AP scores and I did not take or send Subject Tests*

*Intended major*: Astrophysics

*Demographics:*

AA female, public high school (one that is the best in it’s district and extremely competitive in terms of grades and class rank)

Upper-Class

*Stats:*

3.9 U/W 
4.3 W
(lowest regular grade in HS was a 90. Lowest AP grade in HS was a weighted 95/ unweighted 85 b/c we get plus 10 points on AP classes. yikes, right?)

34 ACT

14 APs

*Class Rank:*
U/W - 43 of 314
W - 30 of 314

*Awards:*

Nat’l Merit Scholar Finalist

States Semifinalist CX debate 

20th best CX debater (ranked by UMich)

That’s pretty much it, I have many more awards for individual different debate tournaments but there are too many of those and I didn’t mention any of them in my app.

*Extra-Curricular:*

CX Debate Captain/Varsity CX Debater

Guitarist

Photography

French Club 

President of my Jack and Jill of America Chapter

Hostess at restaurant

Lab Leader/Instructor at summer debate camp

NASA-REVEALS research intern

Volunteer w/ astronomy club of local tech university 

Habitat for Humanity volunteer

CX debate volunteer judge 




This is not a below-average app. However, these stats also aren’t the best ones that many ivies are seeing and I could be easily outdone/met by many other students. Plus, people on this subreddit’s chancemes often dwarf me on paper imo. The best thing I had going for me was my NASA internship and debate experience. 

Basically, I was in the ballpark for these ivies, but not hitting it out of the ballpark just based off of my stats.

So what do I think got me in? 

Essays and a focus on passion!

1. My essays were very very good. I did not realize this until post acceptances. But I spent an obsessive amount of time on them and was almost never commanded to revise them by any of the people who I had check them (my father who is an author, Lit teacher, college counselors, school’s writing center, etc..).

Your essays matter more than anything. An app with a ton of ECs and high stats is pretty much an eye roll if your essays are crap and uninteresting. 

2. Think of your app as a work of art. It’s works as one whole, not a bunch of haphazard and disjointed parts. You need to weave everything together, and create a *story* of who you are through each application. Make everything a narrative, and try to make as many connections as possible. Everything needs a hook, even short answers. Find a way to make everything reflect on who you are even it’s a short-answer that doesn’t seem it’s asking about you directly, *it is*

3. Don’t just flex how many ECs you have, it’s annoying. Just focus on one or two as a major focus. Don’t write all your essays on the same thing. It’s boring.

4. Show that you’re driven in terms of your major. When you do your interview, show that you know to some degree what you’re talking about when it comes to your major and what you might wanna do. 



I wouldn’t be where I am right now without my essays and the *way* that I presented my ECs. I want others to realize the same. Throw away your chance me and focus on how you’re going to present yourself.

These schools pick *people* not stats."

I am trying to maximise my starter salary in NL after I graduate next year (Feb 2021). It seems like most larger companies in NL cap junior Data Science/Engineer salaries at 3,000 gross monthly. With the exception of banks and FinTech companies at 3500. 

I would like to know if there are any graduate starters in NL who have negotiated higher salaries of 4,000+( gross monthly). Because I feel like most graduates are taken advantage of in NL in terms of salary pay."

fj7b38,2,2020-03-15,I want to completely change careers but I’m unsure - is it right for me? a what should I do? Is it too late for me?,WhatwouldRoseSay,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/fj7b38/i_want_to_completely_change_careers_but_im_unsure/,"Here’s the jist; I’ve been at three temporary positions for the past three years (and one seasonal job HR job at a post office and two tech/marketing start ups as their marketer) after graduating with a masters in policy studies, and two bachelors in science and communications

Ive been currently working in a third tech start-up for the past two months, putting in full-time hours but only being paid for less than half my hours.  After three years, I’ve become really fed up with marketing, tech culture, business culture, and the constantly unfulfilled promises I’ve had to endure. 

Initially I went into marketing cause everyone else said I would make enough money to support my family and do my personal art projects on the side. I’m not getting much time or money pursuing this path.

Also some really bad news struck a few days ago (right around the time the schools and workplaces started shutting down due to recent virus concerns). The start up I work at has lost all of its funding and no one is getting paid.  Some people at the company hope we can get more money but they can’t guarantee.  So basically, what was originally promised to be a paid contract with the possibility of  employment has now become a full-time volunteer position...

Since I’m not sitting on a large amount of cash to fall back on and I’ve grown to dislike tech/marketing, I’ve consider leaving right away.  I’ve been thinking that going into university teaching, civil services, government or even biology (like zookeeping or research) would give me an emotionally fulfilling and more stable employment, even if the pay is less and the hours are more.  

But what concerns me is that it’s too late to escape my situation and change careers; I’m 24, I graduated I’m 7 months out from colleges and already did three internships; most of the marketing jobs in my area are tech and start-ups (areas I don’t want to go in anymore), and I’m not sure if me and family can afford going back to school.  I look online and most people my age that are happy with what they do - and now they are focusing on other things like getting married, doing their own art projects, having kids, playing DND, planning vacations...

One family member says I should go ahead and leave my tech/marketing job and go ahead with another job (like government), while another family member says I should stay in my current job cause I’ve already invested three years in it.  Another says to stay at my current job since it still counts as employment (since I don’t think anyone is really hiring during this virus epidemic) and to reach out to previous workers and colleges (which I am doing). 

What do you think I should do? Is it too late for me to change careers?"

So I have an interview coming up for a Cybersecurity internship that requires a security clearance. 

My family is from Russia and came to the United States in 1997. I was born here in 1999 and I happen to have both a US citizenship and a Russian citizenship. I've been to Russia only once in my life and it was a very long time ago.

Will this ruin my chances of obtaining a security clearance and ultimately my chances getting this internship? I have no problem renouncing my Russian citizenship, like I said I have gone only once when I was very young."

Before I start, I want you to know that this is just a genuine problem that I am facing and looking to see whether anyone else has felt or is feeling the same. I am not here to shit talk about anyone and just want some feedback from those who have more experience than I do. Here's a little background, I am a senior computer science student expected to graduate this semester and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Over the past four years, I have spent many hours of my free time learning this craft and working on personal projects. I have designed and implemented scalable, performant and complicated software both in server side and client side. I have dug through many of the technologies and concepts as much as I could to gain a deeper understanding of what's going on rather than just using them. I have also learned a good amount of hardware development and used that to create hardware projects for which I won a couple of hackathons. Overall, I feel like I have a better skill set than the average CS graduate or at least from what I have seen. At this point, you might be thinking that I am just a douchebag trying to show off or something like that, but I promise you this is not my point. My point is that I have worked my ass off learning as much as I could and have turned this field into my hobby and view it as some sort of Art and that's where the problem is. From my past internship experiences, I have learned that a good amount of people in this field don't give a shit about what they do and are fine as long as they are getting their hours and getting paid for it. I have seen ""experienced"" developers write horrible code and students trying to cheat their way into the field. I have seen this lack of interest a lot and found it depressing to work in such environments where the passion that I have for my work is not being recognized or appreciated. And this is why I feel lost, I am afraid to lose my passion and burn out in an environment like the ones I described and I'm not sure what I should do?"

I'm currently a junior studying computer engineering at a well known state school. I had a rough start in the beginning of college but I am much happier now with my classes and genuinely enjoy my major.  My one goal for this year is to get an internship since I have never had one and this is the most crucial summer to get one. I am also doing a fifth year so I will have another summer to do another internship, but I would really like to begin experiencing the professional world.

Anyways, I started applying at the beginning of this semester (january) after I raised my gpa a good amount. I have been working super hard to get it where it needs to be but, I feel behind compared to my peers. I have applied to around 200 over the past few weeks. So far I have gotten 2 interviews (one reject and the other im still waiting on), and a few coding challenges. I'm beginning to panic because I still haven't secured anything and I'm fearing that companies will stop looking for interns because of the current viral disease that starts with a C, and I'm going to miss the internship train. I'm feeling insecure because a bunch of my CS friends already secured their internships last semester at big name companies. One of my good friends also got offered an internship at Booz Allen pretty recently. I know its not good to compare yourself to your peers but, I know I am a harder worker than she is. I know my work ethic, social skills, and programming skills are better than hers and I often help her with her work too. I don't mean to bash her at all and I am happy for her, but it makes me feel like something is wrong with me. She also had an internship last summer because her mom's friend let her join a team in their company. There was no interview or anything. My parents were first generation immigrants so I don't know anyone in this field or have connections like that. Am I not as desirable because I don't have any previous experience? My resume has mostly personal projects that I'm pretty proud of, but is there anything more I can do to show companies that I am worth something? I am just feeling defeated and disappointed that everyone around me has had an opportunity in the professional world and I am falling behind. If anyone has advice for me or has been in my position, please share! Thank you."
fjfrpm,0,2020-03-16,Locked into lease and hurting,Trutheresy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fjfrpm/locked_into_lease_and_hurting/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm in a serious bind. I recently got a new job, and the place I'm living at (in San Francisco) right now has a 1.5hr commute each way that's also quite costly each month in terms of transportation fees.

The lease I signed had a ""life changing event clause"" which included a new job, but when I accepted the new job, I didn't think to check the lease closely, and later on when I did I realized the new job location has to be over 50 miles away from home to qualify. (I'm at 30). So now, I'm stuck trying to find a replacement, but with the coronavirus shutting down travel from abroad, and the fact that it's not the summer season when internships start, I'm not getting any hits on my listing.

I'm definitely going to have to move because the commute is affecting my sleep time and therefore my work performance. Assuming a move out date of April 1st, what would you recommend to minimize paying double rent? Current lease expires Feb. 2021

Here's the current options I think I have, would appreciate comments if you see a different way out.

1. Continue looking for a replacement. Pay double rent until it happens.
2. Ask workplace to produce a letter from their head office address, saying I technically work for that address, putting me well over 50 miles away from home.
3. Defy the lease agreement's term saying no subleasing, and list the room on Airbnb or elsewhere to recoup a portion of my rent for the remainder of the lease term
4. (Really don't want to do this.) Not pay rent after moving out, notify landlord, and forfeit deposit, and risk being taken to small claims court for the remainder of the term since I'm technically still liable.

My husband and I have always dreamed about moving abroad, preferably to Ireland, so we wanted to post on here to hopefully get some questions answered.

My husband (34M &amp; Eastern European EU Citizen) works a stable Blue Collar job in the states, but it will most likely not pay well abroad. We will need to make plans to find him a job abroad. What jobs (besides tech) are high in demand in Ireland that he could potentially study or prepare himself to be competitive in, before we go abroad? Trades (if possible) would be preferable, as he does not want to return to school at the age of 34, but will if he absolutely has to.

I (27F) work in a help desk IT position while studying Computer Science, and would like to eventually obtain an internship or land my first software engineer job in Ireland, preferably in Galway. Is the tech scene also prominent outside of Dublin? Dublin rent prices seem ridiculous and Galway seems beautiful. 

How much in savings would you recommend?

Also, can we both live and work immediately in Ireland due to his EU citizenship? 

Has anyone ever made this move? In tips/advice? We have never lived outside of the US before, so we are excited, but definitely a bit nervous, which I think is natural. If you made this move, are you happy? 

Thanks so much in advance!"

fjh21o,1,2020-03-16,Senior year (F17),DarkLadySenpai,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/fjh21o/senior_year_f17/,"This is going to be a long one with backstory connecting to many other rants. Just to let y’all know before hand, I love myself, I am strong, and I will stay alive for as long as humanly possible for so many different reasons.

First things first; My senior year sucks ASS!
It’s almost over. It’s been such a long journey. I’ve despised almost every minute of it. After being essentially banished from my friend group in the 10th grade, I was reintegrated at the beginning of this school year. However, instead of being a part of the actual group with the inside jokes and the participation in our group specific d&amp;d campaigns, I was on the outskirts. The only time I really got to hang out with them was before school when we walk the halls for 20 minutes. As of recently, I’ve been inching my way back in. Only to be pushed back out because they are all criticizing me on every single choice I make in life. Normally I take it in stride as a joke, but this time they were all serious. Big blow to my mental health.
You should know that I’m the heart breaker of the group. There’s 8 of us from the OG group from 8th grade. 6 guys, 2 girls, I being one of the ladies. I have unintentionally broken the hearts of 4 of those guys. 3 of which dumped me, the other I mentally and emotionally tortured by not being able to decide if I actually liked him or not for an entire year. That was tough on both ends. We moved past it, but now shit is resurfacing and they’re getting really mean. I don’t have many other friends and I’m so close to each of them. If I left the group now, they’d take 80% of my soul with them. But the way they treat me and each other is horrible. No one should go through that.
*END OF ACT 1*

Now onto Act 2, family.

I have 3 siblings, 2 older, one younger. My oldest sibling is 24 and proudly non-binary. We all have so much love from them and they have so much from us.
My second oldest sibling is 23 and engaged to his fiancé, they’re getting married in a couple months, we all adore them and they’re the cutest couple ever. He is 6’9 and she’s about 5’6. Any picture of the two of them is the best thing on this earth due to the height difference and how much they love each other.
Finally, my younger brother. He is 16 and transgender. Born female, identifies as male, also gay with an adorable transgender boyfriend whom we all adore.
On my 6th birthday, we moved from Missouri where all my extended family lives, to a small town in Minnesota. 9 hour road trip, stuck in a car with my siblings and parents. We ate my birthday dinner at a Perkins, pretty good. This started the tradition of never being hone for my birthday. Each year, mostly by coincidence, we would never be home for my actual birthday. This has gone on for 11 years, almost 12 now. It’s definitely affected me, but I really don’t know how.
ANYWAYS, we lived in that small town for 7 years, moved twice. I went to 4 elementary schools, had to say goodbye to friends every year. I eventually got used to being the quiet new kid with no friends. During my 7th grade year, my dad got a new job in the cities and we moved again during the summer of my 8th grade year. He worked as a worship pastor, things were actually going really well. About 6 months into this, my father came out as gay. He had an affair and my parents separated for a couple months. My father was fired from the church and told he couldn’t pastor there because he’s gay. All of this struck my mother very hard and she was killing herself trying to stay strong for all of us. At this point, it was just my younger sister (at the time) and I in the house. A lot of things changed. After a few months of the separation, my dad decided to stay with my mom and make things work. This went on for about 3 years through my 9th grade year to my 11th grade year. But a week before Thanksgiving 2019, my mother found out my dad had another affair and snapped. She asked for a divorce and kicked him out. He left. For about 3 months. And then he came back. Because he couldn’t support himself on his low salary with all the bills and mortgage and rent. He moved back in, money was really tight for a couple more months, and my parents went on pretending like everything was fine and nothing had changed. Ever since he moved back in tensions around the house have been extremely high. I have been the stoic, strong child since we first moved. So that continued to be my role. I was absorbing all the stress and keeping things together. I was taking in a all the problems and stress around the house and bottling it up inside so no one else has to experience it. As long as my parents saw that my brother and I were okay, then they would be more okay. But I’m rightfully angry at my dad. I lost a lot of respect for him as a person when he cheated on my mother for a second time. I think it’s amazing that he knows who he is now and is confident in that person but he broke my mother and that’s not okay. He shouldn’t be allowed to live with us. He doesn’t deserve that. We love him, he should be who he sic but he’s living with us trying to be himself and he’s not being a father. We need to rely on him and we can’t. It’s insanely frustrating.

*END OF ACT 2*

Act 3, school

As I’ve mentioned, it’s my senior year of high school. I’m almost out. Let me tell you something about my school year: complete and utter train wreck. Our school has been undergoing construction since the end of my junior year. It was supposed to be done by second semester and now it’s going to be finished halfway into the next school year. This got rid of one of the large hallways, a lot of classrooms, and a whoooole bunch of parking spots. It was complete chaos everyday. You couldn’t get anywhere on time, people were being pushed into lockers to get out of the way and shit was just going down. It was bad.
My first semester I was a part of a work program where I got to leave half way through the school day to do a paid IT internship. However, due to my problems at home and my horrible stress, anxiety, and depression issues at the time, I couldn’t handle the job. So I quit. It was bad. I handled it poorly. My parents tried to force me to stay. But I had so many panic attacks every day in that internship that I just said “fuck it” and jumped ship. My parents were not pleased to say the least. They couldn’t understand why I was doing it and why I was throwing away this opportunity. They called me irresponsible and stupid and wrong and a liar, saying that my severe panic attacks and depression due to that job were not reason enough to quit, they were claiming that I was over exaggerating and making it all up just to get out of doing work. I can’t even get into that right now or else I’m going to seriously physically harm someone from the anger it brings me. Anyways, I ended my internship. And I had to fill my school day schedule with random bullshit classes. Mind you this is halfway through the semester already so I would only get a quarter credit for each class I transferred into. I was like okay, that’s fine, that gets me the credits I need to graduate and then I can hit that senior slide with 3 classes next semester and go home early. NOPE. I had to once again fill my schedule with classes that I don’t need to take. Useless classes that are supposed to be easy. They all suck. Horrible stuff. Just plain bad. That’s all I can say on that.
Next we have the corona virus. My school has been shut down and we are now doing online classes for the rest of the year or until we are told otherwise. I’m a music student. I’m in concert choir, I’m a leading soprano. We have a final concert to do in May. Special for seniors since it’s our final concert of the entire year, our last performance, where we are all honored with awards and plaques and good stuff like that. However due to the virus, it might be cancelled. And we can’t even practice our music even if it isn’t cancelled because we can’t practice over the internet. Not fucking possible for that to happen. My senior year, all the shit that’s been hyped up that I’ve been looking forward to for 3 years, all down the drain in one month. Poof. It’s gone.

Did you know that we might not even get to have a graduation event because of the virus? It might not happen. And no Prom, no anything. All gone. Just

Just gone.

Oh my god I have so much more I could talk about right now but I can’t, it’s 3 in the morning. I need to sleep, not rant."

We've seen a continued uptick of threads asking about coronavirus/COVID-19 and the related downturn of the economy. We'll be directing all the questions to this thread, and also trying to have answers to the most common ones right here.

The reason we're lumping a potential recession and COVID-19 is that the questions often boil down to the same or similar questions, e.g. What are the chances my internship gets cancelled?

This is the second iteration of the megathread, [see here](https://redd.it/fdazjd) for the previous one.

---

---

##### I have a job interview coming up, should I travel?

This is a personal decision between you and the company. Many companies are restricting travel for their employees, and working totally from home, so it's likely they'll be quite understanding if you elect to postpone the interview process.

At least asking if it's possible to postpone or do a video interview instead shouldn't hurt and if it does, consider if that's the type of company you'd want to be working for anyway.

---

##### Will COVID-19/a recession impact my upcoming job or interview, or cause internships to be cancelled?

This is 100% up to the company. Please reach out to them directly. Apart from that just know that it's outside your control, so try not to stress too much about it until you have some concrete news.

Also know that everyone else is in a similar position, so you won't be disadvantaged compared to your peers, and companies will be understanding once the situation is stable again.

It may be worthwhile making alternate plans if possible though.

See also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fbnf9q/coronavirus_internship_cancellations/), [this](https://redd.it/fixmhj), or [this](https://redd.it/fj1iid) previous threads that had some answers from people affected or with more information.

---

##### Will COVID-19 affect my upcoming business travel?

This is 100% up to the company/event. Please reach out to them directly. All of the FAANGs are **significantly** restricting their business travel though, as well as a significant number of countries restricting international travel. Please consult up to date information from the relevant parties before traveling.

If you're not comfortable travelling then you should communicate that with the relevant parties and we would expect they'll accomodate you.

---

##### Are companies going to have a hiring freeze?

Anyone speaking with any confidence on this is just guessing. Companies have hiring freezes for a variety of reasons, and they come and go. It's very possible they will to some extent, but that extent is impossible to know.

 I'm not an experienced developer.

fjj624,1,2020-03-16,Too much for one month,luckybrick,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/fjj624/too_much_for_one_month/,"Recently Corona hit the netherlands and slowly but surely the rules in the netherlands started getting stricter. Since yesterday all horeca and schools are closed, i am in the middle of my final exams and i am worried about how school will do this, i have weird finals and could do everything from home and internship, but my school tends to be stupid in these cases. On top of that people have started stressing and hoarding and there is an average of 10 people of the 50 person company i intern at.

My grandfather got sick as well, there is a high chance he will die this month. This sucks even more since my two grandmothers died in the last year as well, exactly half a year apart. it is another 3 days till my last grandmother has died three months ago. So yes, we had my last grandmothers funeral on the day of christmas eve, which ruined christmas last year. i really hope my grandfather lives and can get treatment, but he refused to stay in the hospital except for surgery.

The one and only good thing to come out from last year is me getting into dnd, and having two active groups. 

I know that other people even on here have it worse, but for me this is a new low."
fjk2nj,5,2020-03-16,Continuing to apply now or waiting until this virus thing cools off a bit?,Pdjdjd,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/fjk2nj/continuing_to_apply_now_or_waiting_until_this/,"Hey guys, I'm new to this sub, so my apologies if a similar question has already been asked.

I'm from the US but I'm studying for my Software Technology Master's in Germany. The start of my second of three semesters is getting postponed because of Coronavirus. I finally just got my  Aufenthaltstitel about a month ago, about 5 months after I got to Germany, and now I feel that applying for jobs right now just isn't worth it.

With so many people getting told to work from home and everyone being told to social distance themselves, I don't see why companies would be interviewing work students, interns, or new employees in general, it just seems like its not a good idea. 

I want to be applying because I desperately need to have enough money 7 months from now when my visa needs renewed, but on the other hand I don't want my applications to be looked over if companies don't get back to the hiring process for another month or two. I also would just be an entry level or junior level developer so I wouldn't feel incredibly comfortable working remote yet if that even were an option, but maybe if both myself and companies are starting to get desperate, I would give it a shot.

I'm just not sure what the best move is. If anyone, especially in Germany, can provide any insight on what your company might be doing about being short handed right now or stopping/carrying on with hiring processes, that would be great. I just want to get a feel of whether it is worth it or not to continue sending in applications right now.

Thanks for any help y'all!"
fjkg6r,0,2020-03-16,UChicago vs. Columbia vs. USC,GenerationLast,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/fjkg6r/uchicago_vs_columbia_vs_usc/,"Hello everyone, after being rejected by Oxford and MIT, I was offer admission to the three schools listed in the title. 

I am an international student (undergrad in International Relations) to pursue a Masters degree and my goal is to stay in the US and seek employment in data and tech oriented roles in economic/political consultancies or tech companies. I also have two years of FT work experience as an IT Analyst.  

1. UChicago: Masters in Computational Social Science (MACSS)
  + Pros: Scholarship covering half of the tuition
  + Pros: Very comprehensive curriculum for students who have no previous exposure to computer science
  + Pros: 2 year program with an almost guaranteed summer internship
  + Pros: Good reputation
   - Cons: Not sure about the industry placements, most alumni seem to be going for a PhD at top institutions
   - Cons: Bad weather (?)
   - Cons: Academically heavy courses and lots of reading &amp; writing (not much of a problem) 
 
2. Columbia: MA in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS)
  + Pros: Dream school / gut feel
  + Pros: Strongest reputation (perhaps?)
  + Pros: Arguably the best location for recruitment
   - Cons: Geared towards academics (maybe not as much as UChicago)
   - Cons: Shortest program (9 months with 4 month extension option) and costs the same as UChicago with financial assistance
   - Cons: Highest cost of living (although the others are also high) 

3. University of Southern California: MS in Business Analytics (MSBA)
  + Pros: Most exciting curriculum that is designed for industry placements
  + Pros: Best weather
  + Pros: Impressive career support, high number of alumni placed at my target companies
   - Cons: Worst reputation among the three (I don't know how employers would react) 
   - Cons: Costs slightly higher than the others

The first two options stand out in terms of general reputation but they seem to be more geared towards a PhD although they claim to be placing alumni in top private companies. 

All three options are STEM designated so I will have the chance to look for a job for 3 months and work for 3 years following graduation. 
Being able to find (at least an OK) job in the US is my top priority because I will finance part of my degree with loans. And it would be really difficult to pay for it earning the currency of my home country. I am not sure if the first two options will help me do that. 

I was also offered admission to the MIA program at Columbia SIPA and they offer a double degree combined with the QMSS. However, the cost of SIPA is the highest and it does not a have STEM designation (unless combined with the QMSS) so I reckon my chances of working in the US after I complete the program would be slim. 

To be honest I thought this part of admissions process would be more colorful but so far it has been even more stressful than applying and waiting for decisions. 

I would appreciate any help, thank you very much!"

fjlfll,1,2020-03-16,Ultrawide or 16:9 Monitor to Pair with a Vertical?,MuseCruise,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fjlfll/ultrawide_or_169_monitor_to_pair_with_a_vertical/,"I posted this on the wrong sub, I'm hoping you guys will be able to help me out!

Sorry if this question isn't allowed, but I have a dilemma. I've been coding for a couple of years at uni now and landed a summer internship - so I've decided I'll reward myself and get a new monitor with one of my paychecks. I'd want to use it for both programming and gaming, so I'll be looking at high refresh rate, but work comes first. I currently have a 1080p 16:9 monitor that I can put vertically, which I'll do for coding once I get a new monitor. I'm thinking of either going for a 34"" UW or 27"" 16:9 1440p, but other suggestions are welcome.

My question is, given that I will already have a vertical monitor, is an UW much better for productivity, or does it make little difference? If it's not that different I'd rather go for 16:9 as I can put the cost savings into other components. Thanks for the help!

&amp;#x200B;

Ultrawides I've been considering would be something like the AOC CU34G42X or Lenovo G34W (based on the same panel), which look great spec-wise but are kinda pricey (at the top end of my budget) and have reported issues with VRR."

__Braven:__

In America, we’ve promised that hard work and ambition will be met with equality of opportunity. The reality is that we have a quiet crisis on our hands. Despite 1.2 million low-income or first-generation students enrolling in college each year, only one in four will attain a strong first job or enroll in graduate school upon graduating.

In partnership with universities and employers, the Braven Accelerator empowers promising young people on their path to college graduation, meaningful careers, and lives of impact. Alongside educational institutions, Braven provides a scalable model to discover, develop, and connect extraordinary, diverse, and driven young people to high-quality skill building, opportunities, and networks. From the Accelerator will come a generation of leaders as diverse as our future demands.

To date, 69% of Braven’s Fellows have landed a strong job or quality outcome within 6 months of graduation, as compared with the average of 54% for all students nationally. Braven Fellows outpace their peers in internship attainment, non-cognitive skill growth, and college persistence. Braven currently operates in Newark, NJ, Chicago, IL, and San Jose, CA, and is launching in New York City. We aim to become the nation’s leading accelerator of diverse talent, putting 100,000 emerging leaders on the pathway to college completion and economic mobility. Our work is highly data-driven around the outcomes of college graduation; workforce readiness skills-based proficiency; employment in a high impact role within six months of graduation.

We believe Braven is a solution and we are on a mission to scale it, equalizing access to the American Dream.

__The Role:__

Braven is seeking a Manager of Software Engineering (Front-End) to join us in building online experiences, tools, and services to help diverse undergraduate students get strong first jobs after graduation. This role reports to the Chief Technology Officer. You will manage a team of software engineers focused on the user experience to have a real impact on students’ lives. We want students using our platform to feel empowered, connected, and engaged. To accomplish this, we aggressively prioritize which projects we work on, aiming to provide the most value in the simplest way possible. We constantly iterate to improve our services as we see what works and what doesn’t. We’re agile and we like to have fun!

You will play a crucial role in our mission: staying knowledgeable about relevant technologies, developing engineers on your team, helping peers grow through code reviews, identifying weak areas of our architecture and prioritizing accordingly, and leading the technical design of new systems. Braven is entering an exciting growth phase in which we need to balance agility to develop new features against discipline to ensure we use software engineering best practices. We have projects that span the spectrum of software engineering: feature development within existing products, prototypes for new product discovery, data warehousing/ETL systems, and learning devops technologies to help us deploy/test/troubleshoot faster.

To be successful at Braven, on the Tech Team, and in this role, you must demonstrate Braven’s core values, step forward as an engineering leader, be comfortable with ambiguity and constant evolution, and welcome constant feedback and learning. We are a team that likes each other both in and outside of work! Do you have a strong bias to action and enjoy making the complex simple all while driving and owning all aspects of your projects from conception to completion? Come join us in shaping the next generation of leaders!

Our client from the UK uploads his transaction data daily onto the Tableau server. We log in from our end and download the data for the last date and add it to our file and we then run our analysis. The client uploads data to a lot of different files on the server and we manually have to check each file and get the new updated data using ctrl+c and paste to our sheets on which then we run statistical models in R and Python.

The company wants to automate this process of logging in each time and checking all the files manually on the tableau server. 

I have no clue how to even approach this problem. Any suggestions?"

fjqibi,0,2020-03-16,How I got an internship as a freshman that is only familiar with Java and barely knows OOP,OmkingPlaya,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fjqibi/how_i_got_an_internship_as_a_freshman_that_is/,"I'm currently a freshman at an average college and I just accepted an internship at a fairly large company in the midwest. I'm not exactly a superstar freshman programmer and I guarantee that a lot of the people in my current CS classes are way more qualified than I am. 


Here are my qualifications:

1 Leetcode problem done (that took me 4 hours)

0 Personal projects

4 years of unrelated IT work (fixing and repairing PC's)

3.75 GPA


Here's exactly what I did to get the internship:

1. GO TO CAREER FAIRS. At the end of the day, almost nobody hires freshman as their first choice. Applying online will almost never work. For both of the companies I interviewed at, I had actually applied online a month beforehand and got no response. I talked to the recruiters at the career fair and I got an interview within two days. YMMV, but I think applying online is absolutely useless as an average freshman. 

2. At the career fairs, act like a normal person. For whatever reason, a lot of the CS majors I see at my school are the stereotypical anti-social student that doesn't look you in the eye and doesn't talk confidently. Don't get me wrong, I am super introverted usually and I like to do my own thing, but a career fair is no place to be shy. Walk in confidently, shake peoples hands (or maybe fist bump because of illness), look the recruiter in the eye, and try to act normal and make a connection with the recruiter. 

3. You need to have something to stand out from every other person at that career fair. For me, it was the past job experiences that I had over my four years of high school. For you, it could be your Github page or the projects you've done at school. Either way, if you dont stand out, there's a low chance that you get picked for an interview. 


4. Employers won't expect you to know everything. I barely got asked any technical questions at the interviews. They don't care about what you know as a freshman because they don't expect you to know everything. They are looking for someone with a huge desire to learn and grow as a developer. That being said, some companies WILL expect you to know something upto a certain point. Research the company and the role and find out what they are looking for.

5. Be willing to accept a lesser internship for a guaranteed better internship next summer. If you don't get the developer internship you've been chasing, companies might be willing to hire you for another role for that summer with the promise that you will be guaranteed a developer internship the next summer. For example, one of the internships I interviewed for wanted me for a debugging role. I would look over and test any code the developers wrote and let them know if anything was wrong with it (I would not get to write or edit any code). I was told that the next summer I would be guaranteed a developer internship if I wanted it. I interviewed with them as a safety net incase I didn't get into my first choice. 

In the end, I interviewed for two companies and was offered a position at both. I picked the programming internship over the debugging internship for obvious reasons. I both of the companies told me afterwards that my passion for CS and my desire to learn are the two main reasons that they chose me over other candidates. If you show a desire to be the best programmer you can, stand out from the rest of the crowd, and have a little bit of luck, then I think it is possible to get an internship as a mediocre CS student. 

Final note: internships aren't everything as a freshman. If you don't end up getting one, don't stress about it. Most people don't. Getting the experience of interviewing and talking to recruiters as a freshman will already put you miles ahead of most people. Let me know if anyone has any questions!"

I'm an incoming software engineer intern. I was given 2 choices but I'm not sure which team to go with. I will be the solely intern on the team

1, Data Science/Engineering team

Technology stack: Python, R, SQL

They are trying to make the move to AWS and Google Cloud. They are also looking to integrate Kafka and expand the application. The managers I talk to seems nice and supportive. They seems to be ready to mentor. 

2. Subscription/Backend team

Technology stack: Java 1.8, DropWizard. 

The manager I talk to doesn't have any plan for me yet but he is willing to mentor me regardless. So I'm supposed, from talking to him, that it will be more independent. I will have to work with the existing codebase and maybe add new feature to it. 

My goal out of the internship is definitely try to learn as much as I can and contribute as much as I can. I'm leaning toward the Data Science team right now. But I want to hear feedbacks. I also wasn't sure which questions to ask beforehand other than the basic one. So, if there any questions you guys think I should ask, please let me know in the cmts."

I (23M) who is currently living in southern Alabama, is having a hard time with life at the moment. I don’t know what to do and I would love some advice. To begin, I grew up poor, I mean very poor. Currently still living in poverty and life hasn’t been easy for me. I never was able to attend high school, but I did end up getting my GED plus Immediately after that I went to the community college that helped me. I have finished my associate’s degree with a 3.12 GPA. I work 2-3 jobs one of my jobs is DoorDash which helps when I need extra cash. One problem I have is my major, I majored in Information systems and I don’t like it. I don’t know exactly what I want to be. When I picked the major I tried to find something that paid enough for me to take care of my family. I started college in May of 2017 right before I turned 21. I didn’t have a job or an education and we were homeless staying with my mother’s abusive boyfriend, I hated my life. I damn near cried myself to sleep every night. So I studied, all my free time I bought ACT books and looked up college entry requirements and hit the books while stuck inside the house. I finished the GED book from front to back in 2 weeks and my ACT book in about a week and YouTube helped also. It took 30 days to get my GED they told me I was the fastest they’d witnessed so far. I want to get my bachelor's, but I find it hard to focus at the moment. I use my mother’s car and don’t have much to pay for school which I’m upset about and I can’t afford a loan with my current lifestyle. I finished community college on grants basically for free. I do think being poor influenced my decision on picking a tech major that I’m not good at to be honest.


My mom doesn’t have or want a job every time I mention a job to her, She gets angry and wants to end the conversation. My aunt who lives with us is 26 and she doesn’t have a diploma or a job and I’ve tried to help her get both. My managers told me they’d hire her, but every time I asked her to come work with me at my job, it’s been an “I’ll think about it”. My younger sister listened to me and she has her GED and a Job not the best job at a hotel but it’s employment. She’s intelligent and artsy. I mean, I have seen nothing like it before. She’s just wrapped up in a relationship with a man too old for her and doesn’t seem to want to go to college or do anything else besides’s live. Right now she’s only 21 but still, she can have so much more. My mom and stepdad have caused so much trauma my mom has left us many times in my life I’ve had to ride a bike through the rain to get to college 10 miles a day in the winter and summer times, which took me months to save for the bike. I’ve never blamed my parents for the bad life we’ve had I just felt like they did the best she could and I leave it at that, but they still do the same things. My brother and sisters dad raised me since I was a toddler, he’s a truck driver and we never really had a good relationship because he’s so in and out of our lives. We had to raise ourselves. I remember times with no power, heating water to bathe, stealing food as a kid I mean damn. I want to cry as I write this. Long story short life hasn’t been kind to me.


I have an internship at an engineering company doing technical support I hate every moment. They treat me like a poor black kid; they don’t give me any work, although I’ve asked and begged to help with anything I’m doing accounting spreadsheets and I hate it. I just love the office atmosphere. I work in the only high rise building in my city, which is a nice view of rural Alabama. Working around these successful people gives me a feeling of importance, something I’ve never had, and it feels nice for once. I just dislike how they respond to me, and the work is monotonous.


As far as my social life goes, I’ve never really had any friends. Besides all of this, I have a girlfriend, and they diagnosed me with HSV2. The only reason we’re still together is because of this disease, and I don’t want to be alone. I don’t blame her; I don’t think she knew she had it. I’ve always been lonely and felt unloved. We argue a lot because she cheated on me in our apartment in our bed with a girl. I felt bad for her because she was facing homelessness and my weak mind allowed me to look past the cheating and I stayed. She talked to multiple people including her ex-boyfriend while she was with me. I don’t think it will ever stop. I played a major role in all of this too I am not innocent by any means. fast forward to a little later we got evicted and I let her stay with me and my family. She has now left to join the military. We talk almost every time we can and she still tries to pursue building a life with me. I just don’t think she makes me happy I love her as a person but I’m not in love anymore and I don’t miss her. I’ll always be there for her, she’s been my only friend. We’ve slept in a car together, she cooked me meals late nights when I got off of work; I love her for that alone. I never had help before it just came with so much pain for me.


I am scared I’m working 80 hrs a week between two jobs, barely sleeping. Everyone in my life is putting weight on my shoulders, and I am overwhelmed. I can’t keep going like this. I just know it. What should I do? I want to take care of them, I just want to enjoy my life a little.


What do I need to do? how do I restart? I want to move away and never look back.


TLDR: I'm poor, my girlfriend cheats, college isn’t for me, and life is just hard."
fjrv8x,2,2020-03-16,Am I being too sensitive about being kinda-maybe-fired for a disability or not (outwardly) sensitive enough?,amandam34,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/fjrv8x/am_i_being_too_sensitive_about_being/,"(tl;dr at the bottom, it's a complicated situation and I'm wordy at the best of times)

Ay, so back in like October/November, I told my boss I was planning to return to university and would likely need to cut back on my hours come January for the spring semester. It was almost time to register for classes, so I asked if they wanted to try to work things out so I would stay on part-time (meaning less credit hours, more online, and as much around the 8-5 business day as possible) or not (would plan on full-time classes, take a bit more out in financial aid, and start looking for other work). They said they would work with me, I registered, gave them my new availability, and they agreed to it.

I also have seizures periodically, which cause me to miss a bit more work than your typical employee. I'd been working there for around 9 months at the time, they were aware of the seizures and their typical rate, I assumed they were fine with that and had taken it into consideration with my school schedule. I had been working on finding a medication that would lessen the frequency, but no luck at that point.

Friday before class, I get called to the office and told that they actually were going to have to let me go and couldn't work with the absences. I offered to back my classes down from what we'd agreed on and continue to work full-time with only 1-2 online classes and they said that wouldn't change anything. I was told that I was an excellent worker and I always had everything caught up by the end of any given week where I missed a day, but it ""put too much pressure on the rest of the staff"" while I was gone. They didn't want to part ways on bad terms and would give me a good reference later on, might need a part-time employee in a few months and would keep me in mind for it, and they'd like for me to stay on until they could get my replacement trained (about a month) if I was willing. I was also advised to sign up for whatever full-time classes I would want (if I still could, the Friday before the start of the semester) and they'd work around it until my last day. 

I was kind of in shock, but I agreed to stay on for another month part-time. I had kind of assumed that there were legal protections in place to prevent this sort of thing even though I live in a Right to Work state. I never really expected to get fired for this particular reason, though I always felt pretty terrible and guilty about the absences.

I was pretty upset, took a break to cry in the bathroom, and went back to work. Considered looking into whether or not I had a case for a lawsuit, but eventually decided not to. Largely because it was my best and oldest friend who got me the job there, became my supervisor, and had a hand in the decision. It made any response on my part feel really personal, where I wouldn't really have thought twice if it was just any other job. I didn't want it to affect our friendship -- I knew she kept her business and personal life very separate and that she generally tried to avoid showing any favoritism. 

She's the only friend I've had for so long and I don't know how I would function without her in my life. I decided to work the remaining month and move on, pursue my education and career, and maybe just have a conversation about it with her later once I'd had time to distance myself a bit.

A week or so goes by and a different employee put in her 2 weeks notice. My friend/supervisor asked if I would be okay taking on a couple extra tasks on a regular basis until they could get both my replacement and the other girl's replacement trained. Ok, whatever. It was kind of rough, but I got through those few weeks of extra work on top of classes. Then another employee put in her notice.

Then another... and another.

I was supposed to be done about halfway through February, but the constant short-staffing has meant that they need me as much as I'm willing/able to work for them -- even if it's only a few hours between classes. They're apparently considering keeping me on for a couple hours (like 2-5) at the end of the day just to help them keep up... indefinitely.

But, that's the thing. It's been convenient for me so far because I got to take the classes I wanted and make more progress towards my major while having them forced to accommodate my schedule. But they could just drop me at any time, because they haven't exactly retracted my termination. 

Between my tax return, my savings, and the bit of extra financial aid I got, I don't really need to continue to work. It's definitely good to make more money while I can, but I'm pretty much covered. And I'm thinking to try for an internship or something in the summer (when, if they don't let me go and I don't quit, they would likely expect and plan on me going to full-time hours or at least whatever hours they want). I arranged things so that I wasn't dependent on them. Though it's convenient for me, I continued to work as a favor for them, because I could see my coworkers and friends getting overwhelmed with the workload and I know it's not their fault. Nobody else in the office is aware that I was actually fired, my manager gave the impression with the announcement that I was backing down hours and leaving soon of my own accord because of school.

I know that I shouldn't feel ashamed for getting fired for something that's beyond my control, but the fact that it's been kept a bit of a secret makes me wonder sometimes if I should, despite myself.

I wonder if I read too much into my coworkers' behavior too -- that a couple people seem to resent me because I get this special schedule and can basically come and go as I please while they all work full time; that some are freaking out about the workload and ""so happy for you but please don't leave yet""; to my friend/supervisor who sometimes is very thankful that I've been willing to stay and help but sometimes acts as if she's doing me a favor by keeping me on and talking to the manager about continuing with the end-of-the-day hours.

The couple-hour bouts between classes were mostly fine, I'd get in, get the work done, and leave before the resentment would really start to get to me -- but now with this coronavirus and schools going to online classes, I was intending to keep the amount of hours about the same, but more clumped so I wouldn't have to make the usual multiple trips. I wanted to give an official last day sometime in April with a few weeks notice-- they still have two positions to fill so they'd still be screwed but I'm getting to the point where idgaf anymore. Now, I think the clumps might get to me sooner than that, especially if I'm not kept busy the entire time. Tomorrow, I'm scheduled the full 8-5 day and I can already feel the stress building. It's entirely possible that I would just burst into angry tears halfway through the day -- I nearly got to that point already about a week ago when I worked my longest usual shift of about 6 hours.

My family and friends say that I'm crazy for staying at all, and certainly for as long after that initial month as I have -- that it's more than anyone else would do or expect. Even my grandparents who always cautioned against rash actions at work and 'burning bridges' said that I should just walk out and tell them to screw themselves. Not in a scolding way, mind, they seem to see the fact that I didn't as strength of character or something. But I wonder if I am crazy for staying. If it's actually really pathetic, like I'm still trying to impress and please my employer like some sort of beaten dog.

When I'm at work, everything else stays at the door and I want to do whatever I can to help - I can't shut that off even though I've wanted to. I like my coworkers, I like my friend/supervisor and even my manager, who's as friendly as ever to me and acts as if nothing's changed. Sometimes, the work is immensely satisfying and I like being there. Sometimes I feel like they should be thankful I'm even there and I could walk out without any consequences at any time (quitting in response to being fired doesn't really count as quitting legally, although I wonder if this particular situation has ever come up before). Sometimes, I feel like I'm a worthless failure and they're taking pity on me, the useless freak who sometimes just starts twitching and groaning -- and leaving everyone else to pick up the slack.

Is it stupid to read so much into the situation and the things my coworkers do or don't say? Am I feeling hurt over something I shouldn't take personally or am I letting them walk all over me? Should I tell my coworkers that 'hey, actually I was fired over two months ago and I don't even know what I'm doing here lol'?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: 

I was fired for excessive absences due to seizures right before school started in January, stayed until my replacement was trained while attending full time classes, and was eventually kept on beyond that (another month? two? forever?) due to multiple employees quitting one after the other immediately after I was fired. My best friend who's also my supervisor who got me the job agreed with and contributed to my being fired. I stayed because the hours were convenient and extra money is good, but feel icky and uncertain about it so I'm trying to figure out how to manage the job, my friendship, and school without just snapping and walking out, leaving my coworkers and friends who had nothing to do with it to drown in their already doubled workload. 

Am I being too sensitive to be upset about it or not sensitive enough because I continue to stay?"

I accepted the offer from the first company a few days ago and am required to take a drug test by this Wednesday. I have taken two tests in the past few days that I got from CVS and passed both of them with a solid top line and a bit more faded bottom line. I just accepted the second offer as they needed my decision by today. I will also have to take a drug test for this one and my thought process was that I will have a few more days of detox if I somehow fail the first drug test. I’m worried because I smoked last Tuesday and before that usually smoke 2-3 times a week max. The internship that I really want is at the first company. If I pass the drug test for the first company and have to tell the second company after accepting their offer that I am no longer pursuing it, how will this look in the eye of the recruiter at the second company?

First time posting here! I’m having some difficulty deciding between two offers I recently received. 

The first is a full time offer to work as a materials engineer at Northrop Grumman in Palmdale,CA. The hours are Friday-Sunday 2nd shift. It’s a 3/10 so I work  30 hours a week but I’m salaried for 40 and I get Monday-Thursday off to do whatever I want. They offered me both a $10,000 sign on bonus and relocation. 

The other offer I got was for an internship at Amazon in Seattle as a materials/failure analysis engineer for the primeair department. This is just an internship and the manager told me that there is high chance they will open a full time position next year by summer or maybe early spring and if I do well in my internship that they would consider me for the role.

A little bit of my background. I am graduating this semester from my masters program in materials engineer here in Florida. For me to take the internship, I would have to delay my graduation to December. For the full time role, I just have to finish up my classes this semester. 

I’m confused on what to do as I know both companies are great and the work is be doing is similar since there both failure analysis roles but at Amazon I would have more say in the product than at NG. However, NG is giving me a really great opportunity both hours and salary wise as well and the Amazon internship doesn’t guarantee me a full time position after. It’ll give me a very strong foot in the door and open my career opportunity in both tech &amp; aerospace vs NG where I feel my future growth opportunities would be limited to just the defense/aerospace sector.

Also the corona virus could delay the internship possibly but not the full time offer. 


I would appreciate any insight Or advice anyone may have! Location isn’t as important to me as growth opportunities and securing a stable job in the future."

I've seen a lot of posts on feeling depressed/hopeless over having to be away from friends and indoors almost constantly. From when I was like 12-17 (up until I got my own, non-family job basically) my Dad worked (and still does) 3rd shift, which is like 12 A.M.-8 A.M. ish, every summer, meaning he slept during the day. Our house is in a cornfield in rural Ohio, meaning you don't leave if you can't drive, and my mom had her own work schedule during the day. That means, I was stuck inside my house, all day, everyday, every summer for 5 years in my teens up until I could drive (am 22 now, am old.) On top of this, I had to basically be completely silent.

#This is what I did to stay sane:
 
- Get dressed, take a nice shower, etc. Wearing pajamas all day sounds great, and it is, but after a while, you start to feel lazy and more shitty. Get dressed in clean clothes you're still comfortable in and take good showers. Like we're not going anywhere really, stand under that hot water for 10 minutes if you really want to. Buy new products that make you excited to actually shower, and buy new products for your routine when you get out (I am a woman but boys you should learn to stop being ashy. This is your time my hydrated kings!) 
Showering sounds basic, but when you do become depressed it can go on the back burner. Make it more interesting so you keep doing it. Even yesterday, I put on a full face of makeup (which I do everyday anyways) to attend Zoom University.
Also keep a decent sleep routine. When I was a teenager at home, it was okay for me to sleep at 4 A.M. and wake up at like noon. Now, it's just not sustainable and would def leave me feeling like ass.

- Not already learning a foreign language? Pick up Duolingo and learn something new.


- Get adult coloring books + colored pencils.


- Get on Pinterest (seriously) and find things to do that pique your interest. Like cooking? Find new recipes to try, especially ones that require only a few ingredients. Maybe find a new craft project to start. My latest project is finishing a patched denim jacket. Just a girl, her jacket, her iron on patches, and her hair straightener (BU housing don't read)


- Find workouts you can do from home. I literally lost so much weight and changed my body doing this. There's so many routines you can find and workout videos on youtube, just make sure they come from a reputable source. I recommend Blogilates on youtube, Casey Ho is super energetic and knowledgeable, and her videos are fun to do. If you want something less intensive, find some light yoga videos to do. Just anything to keep your body out of the same, hunched over position all day. 


- Now is the time to deep clean your room. Having a clean space will make you feel 10x better about being there all day. 


- Start a new book, maybe something you never had time for before. 


- Start a new game you didn't have time for, or finish one you haven't gotten to. I'm currently on my second playthrough of RDR2, on Chapter 6 which is super ironic rn because... if you know, you know. 


- Take a walk outside. The goal is social distancing, doesn't mean you can't go outside. There's still plenty of open enough space around here that you can take 20-30 minutes to take a walk. The fresh air will make you feel a lot better.


I specifically wanted to suggest things outside of class work, because having a good work-life balance is absolutely crucial here. I have a class and two internships I'm doing from home, if I sat in bed all day just alternating those things and doing nothing else, I would burnout super quickly, and I think most other people would too. Solid 👏 work 👏 life 👏 balance 👏."
fk6hll,2,2020-03-17,Resource for common business related DS problems?,jbuddy_13,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fk6hll/resource_for_common_business_related_ds_problems/,"Recently, I've had a string of interviews about what's the best model or method to answer a specific business problem. 

Last summer, when applying for internships, the bulk of the questions were about my model knowledge (what's the gradient for this?, what's the hyperparameter here do? What assumptions does this model make?) Perhaps these questions are only typical of intern level positions. I ended up getting an awesome internship related to NLP. And the mindset I walked away with was - know your models inside and out; that's what separates the good candidates from the bad. Now I'm thinking at the employee (not intern) level, it's assumed that you already know all this stuff and can further use them to a company's benefit. It sounds obvious in retrospect, but I'm still fumbling to find a winning study strategy from this point on.

However, now the questions are a bit more like:

""What's the probability that a customer will purchase this exact product last month given online transaction history?"" or ""model the impact of discount percentage on sales volume and recommend the optimal discount per product."" or ""predict customer churn given transaction history.""

I completely understand that these are the questions that data scientists are supposed to be answering in industry. But I feel like a fool; I spent all my time learning the ""ins and outs"" of various models and not nearly enough time orienting these models around common business problems. Actually, coming from a military background, I'm largely unfamiliar with the problems that businesses need to address, with the exception of logistics. 

Can anyone link some resources/tutorials? (ie this problem is typically handled by xyz preprocessing and feature engineering steps, these models are most often used, and the critical metrics are a,b,c)"

I really love how UCF has been sending out these emails saying ""CAPS is here if you need someone to talk to"" when in reality CAPS sucks. It's become really trendy these days to just pay lip service to caring about mental health but not actually doing anything to improve the facilities. I know a lot of people on here have said CAPS really helped them, but this has not been my experience, nor any of my friends'.

I had a friend attempt suicide on campus. Thankfully she didn't succeed, but instead of helping out, UCF only was interested in getting her to release them from any liability so they didn't get sued. Another friend was told by her counselor, ""you are a difficult person to work with."" As for me, my first counselor (an intern) misdiagnosed me with a serious condition (basically psychosis) after seeing me three times, and now it's in my file permanently. All my friends and subsequent counselors agreed that diagnosis was bogus. CAPS has given me so much pushback when I try to access my records.

My second counselor basically told me to do yoga and a face mask, to do self-care when I was so depressed I just wanted to kill myself. Then I got referred to the community counseling center on campus and switched counselors. This third one was okay, but she graduated and we only saw each other 3-4 times. My current one, I'm on my fourth one here, watched me recount the most traumatic experience of my life and I bawled my eyes out and she didn't so much as offer me a tissue or show any empathy while I was going through that.

I have no insurance so it's not like I can afford to go elsewhere. Now the whole situation is going to make my mental health worse because I go crazy and overthink when I'm at home with nothing else to do. I feel like I've done my part in seeking help and it still seems to get me nowhere. I feel like if UCF really cared about our mental health and not just our money that we bring in, they would have better trained counselors and better facilities for us. Unfortunately, I don't think that will happen."

One offer is for an internship that will most likely lead to FTE at a pretty good company. Note the ""most likely,"" it's not 100%. The other offer is for a FTE position, 100% guaranteed. I have the offer letter already. Now the FTE company is known for laying people off quite a lot, but mostly senior people who have been there for awhile, not really new hires. So I imagine I could work there for a year or two before facing any real troubles.

The internship at the first company will last over the summer before any offer is made, whereas the FTE position is at the start of summer. On the one hand, I'm faced with accepting a really good offer from a company that's known for its layoffs, and on the other, I could accept an internship at a better company that could possibly lead to FTE, but it's not guaranteed.

The main board they use is stm32 based (don't remember which MCU exactly), also I'm asked to be able to comunicate with a TouchGFX screen (STM32F746). So, does it make any sense that I go for the TI Tiva to learn the basics in my free time? I'm saying this because the best tutorials or courses I've seen (Jonathan Valvano's MOOCs and Quantum Leaps on Youtube) use this board. I imagine there will be some for the stm32 Discovery boards but I thought these were the best.

Probably the right call is to buy a stm32 board because that way I won't have to switch but I'm very new so I don't know if it would be a very different environment, could you guys help me out please? Thank you."

Once that happened, I ended the friendship but, unfortunately, I still have to live with her and she refuses to move out. I attend college full-time nearby and have an internship at the local animal shelter that I absolutely love, so me moving out isn’t a possibility.

Since her craziness began she’s opened up my mail, left passive-aggressive notes around the house, cyber bullied me and is always messing with my property. I keep my food locked up in the kitchen cabinets and today she took the cabinet doorknob completely off and took off my lock. She then hung the lock off of a magnet on the fridge to display it so I would clearly see.

How do I handle living with this crazy person? I swear, I don’t do anything to her or her property and belongings but because I ended the friendship months back, she’s constantly been trying to anger me. Our realtor company is useless and just gives me the run around. The only adult figure in her life is her grandma and she automatically sides with her. The girl has no job and only leaves the house to attend a community college, twice a week. 

I’ve contacted the police department and filed a report along with my other roommate, who has also been suffering the wrath of this awful girl. It’s currently documented in police records but the police can’t do anything until she physically harms us or we feel threatened for our lives. Once that happens, they can only tell her to find another place to sleep for the night. It’s a step but it’s not a long term solution to this problem. 

Please tell me how to deal with this psycho roommate of mine and how to handle her endless attempts to rile me up!! Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you:)"
fkcsmw,2,2020-03-17,Having trouble landing internships,Annual-Magician,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/fkcsmw/having_trouble_landing_internships/,"It all may be moot now with coronavirus, but even before this, I was having trouble landing internships. I'm trying to figure out what the issue is.

Some context (and things I want to get off my chest):

I'm a 3rd year EE/CE student. I was initially going for a second bachelors in EE, but after getting further in my program, I decided to switch to CE. From there I decided to switch from a second bachelor's degree to a Master's degree, and am entering the Master's program in the Fall. All of these decisions happened relatively recently, well after I applied to internships. In all of my engineering and math classes, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA, and have made good relationships with my professors. The school I go to is not very highly ranked though.

I don't think I'm one of those stereotypical grind every day to get a 4.0 students though. I've done several projects, and work with our engineering departments shop and prototyping area, and have tried to do research with one of my professors, help another professor in a different department develop online curriculum, and work with our school's aerospace club.

That said, I'm not as dedicated to these things as I could be. My research projects were all left unfinished and didn't end well. I got pretty far in the project I've worked on for the aerospace club, but it took me a very long time, and I didn't get it all the way finished. I've been having to put fewer and fewer hours into my curriculum development job as my classes are getting harder and I'm having to take more units. My projects for the prototyping area are pretty much blocked and I'm not making good progress on them. So I feel kind of like a failure on all of these fronts. It's possible I tried to do too much and didn't do well in anything except my classes. I feel like I definitely prioritize my classes over my extra-curriculars.

I have some friends who prioritize their club duties and research over classes. The result is usually that they do amazing things in their clubs, but are struggling to keep up in classes. A few of them can't even make it into the upper division engineering program, but they are lauded by the club advisors. I wish I could be like them since they seem like they have a lot of expertise in the areas I would like to be expert in, but I don't want my grades to drop or not do as well in my classes. I also want to graduate on time and not waste a lot of time and money retaking classes.

Of course these failures aren't something I'm explicitly mentioning in my applications, but I wonder if maybe the professors I'm working with who I ask for letters from are adding that in their letters of rec (though when we meet face to face they are always understanding and seem to like me).

But professors are always asking me to TA or tutor or grader for their classes because I'm usually one of the top students. I've been reluctant to do so because of all of the aforementioned things on my plate, but I've decided to help one professor TA for a class next quarter (which may be a bust due to COVID-19).

Also prior to going back to school for engineering, I had a previous career that I was pretty successful at (and even have special awards and certifications).

Another issue is that I'm somewhat picky about where I will apply to. In my physical area, there is a lot of one type of engineering which I'm not really interested in, so I tend to apply for places that are not in my area and are often in other states.

Does anyone have any tips for success or something I could do to not fail so hard at the internship game?"

I do like my sbux job, but only because I find it fun being a barista and I like a lot of my coworkers-- however, the store definitely doesn't treat us well. I have worked plenty of food service jobs before and this one is definitely on the lower end regarding how we are treated, given that it is a VERY busy location and we have little to no support-- we are the lowest level employees but we basically run the place. Given the current COVID-19 situation, I have been working from home for my internship, but sbux is still up and running with no end in sight. The store is always packed with people despite so many others practicing social distancing, and oftentimes I am the only one working a crazy busy shift. I have a tendency to be a bit of a germaphobe on most days - but now, due to the COVID-19 spread, I am actually scared. 

My next shift is this friday, and I have been crying at the idea of coming in. I am very lucky  that I really don't need this job - I graduated from college last year and have been living at home trying to save up money, so if I quit this job, it wouldn't impact me much. However, my internship is likely ending in May, and I was planning to continue working at sbux until I found a full-time job or started up school again, so if I quit, I'd need to find a new way to make money after my internship ends (I don't anticipate that finding another food service job will be hard, but it'd still suck to have to apply to a bunch of places). I also don't want to screw over my coworkers by quitting, but I am dreading going in. Other people have quit recently for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, and it puts extra pressure on the current workers. I am a very hard worker and am really good at my sbux job, so if I quit, they definitely wouldn't see it coming. I've also never really quit any job before, and I don't even know how I'd go about doing it.

Tldr: I want to quit a job I don't really need because I'm very scared of catching/spreading COVID-19, and it looks like nothing is going to change in the way of closing down, but I don't want to quit because I don't want to screw over my coworkers and be jobless come May (even though I will ultimately be fine if I am)."

Due to Covid-19, my university announced all in person classes will move online and most facilities(gyms, libraries, dorms, dining halls, rec center) will either be closed or have limited hours in the near future.

As an international student (on an F1-visa) I’m not allowed to work off campus unless it’s an internship or co-op relevant to my field of study (Computer Science)

I’m not entirely sure how my on campus job will be affected but at a minimum I’ll have lesser hours. Potentially no hours till end of semester. I'll have some extra time on my hand but I'll need to find another way to make rent now.

With that being said, here are some things I can do for you for a small fee:

* If you own a small business and need someone to help out with digital marketing. I can do SEO or manage your facebook/instagram/google ad campaign. I've done it for a university organisation before with some really positive results.
* If you need a personal/professional website I can get one up and running for you for cheap.
* One on one Computer science tutoring for beginners
* Coding assignments (OOP in Java, Algorithms and Data Structures, Discrete Math are classes I'm ok in)
* Math/Physics homework (1000-2000 level university classes/high school level)
* Write essays/papers/assignments

Anything else you think you need done, just ask. I'm open to all offers. If I can't do it I know a bunch of university students desperate to make money with all the time in the world on their hands.

If you have any other suggestions please feel free to comment down here. Thanks in advance. :)

I specialized in machine learning through undergrad, but sadly Im starting to realize that most ML jobs are not what I expected, and don't pay that much more compared to a job that I imagine is less work, like back-end (emphasis on imagine, don't mean to insult any back-end devs)

With the current pandemic, I figured right now would be a good time to take a step back and explore my options and learn about them before jobs start to become more available.

So basically my questions is, what kinds of dev positions are out there besides and what do they do / what kinds of technologies do they use?"

I'm afraid this list doesn't apply to seniors (for obvious reasons) but I hope to help all of you try-hards out there

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a list of activities you can do during break instead of sitting around waiting for school to start again:

\-Definitely study for standardized tests by doing reviews, practice tests, practice questions, reading harder literature/science magazines, use khan academy its literally so helpful (if you already got a satisfactory score and don't plan on taking these anymore, clearly don't worry about this point)

\-look for summer opporunities/internships/camps near you (or not near you depending on its prestige and subject) (these also may get cancelled due to corona but i seriously hope not). I was always really focused on classwork and sports that i never had enough time to consider other stuff that'll make me stand out and show my true passions. There are a bunch of opportunities that you may not have heard about but if you dig deep enough, theres always something. In fact, less known competitions will be easier to become a finalist in (and almost all competitions provide scholarships so even if it's not for name, you get money out of it). Some summer camps I found were Bank of America summit thing (for entrepreneurs), NSIL-Y (rly cool opporunity, i wish i didn't miss the app deadline this year), SPARC, Stanford math camp, and mit has a bunch of prestigious programs. If you didn't make the program this year or missed the deadline (like i did TT) then plan ahead and start building your profile 

\-learn something that you've always wanted to learn but never got the chance to ie. I always wanted to learn cp but didn't feel adaquete enough but I recently found an amazing online course

\-if you're taking ap classes, don't forget everything because collegeboard WILL make ap tests happen no matter what (u money sucking monopoly), keep doing assigned classwork or whatever routine your teachers had ingrained into you

\-practice 40 hours

\-plan out your high school career including where you plan to apply for summer camps, internships, research opporunities, community college classes, volunteer opportunities, sports

\-do indepth research about colleges you plan to apply to, it'll help when answering the ""why us?"" supplemental, also it could also help decide if you really want to go there or not, watch youtube videos on people that go to those schools and how life is like

\-watch crash course videos on classes you plan to take next year so you get an overview and so you won't be so overwhelmed next year

\-brainstorm to start a new club at your school, this is a great time to think of a club you can start for that leadership and initiative component of your application. Clearly, don't do it just to do it, do it in a subject you care about and thats important to you

\-start a fundraiser where you sell diy products and donate profits to help corona

\-or just cure corona tbh

Everything you do should be genuine because though colleges might not be able to see through your extensive list of ec's, you'll know intrinsically and it wont be as easy. Time you spend outside of school is equally important as you spend in it and everyone is given the same amount of time so use it well! Colleges can tell when you put in time where others didn't, and even if they can't tell it'll be apparent after college.

\*the reason I put so many words in the summer section is because its really a gold mine where you can do so many things without being weighed down by 10 hours of homework from your 12 APs and you should really plan it detailed so you have backup plans if something doesnt go right

Stay safe everyone :)"

I feel like I'm not learning much anymore than I would do somewhere else because most of my job consists on using the company's own framework; and I believe this will not be useful for me outside of here. I work as a full stack developer and even though we use AngularJS, Javascript, C# and SQL Server, I pretty much only ""really"" use Javascript (but most of the time is trying to make the framework work) and SQL Server, because everything related to AngularJS and most of C# is done by the framework and I have to copy-paste its methods. I have teammates who have some experience but they aren't great coders in my experience, the good ones are in other projects within the company (I talk about this further down)

I was ""holding"" on staying for a couple months here because I was planning to move to Europe this semester (I'm from South America), but because of the pandemic I won't be able to do it as soon as I wanted. I don't want to stay in this company for who knows how many months! I mean, I could hold a couple more months, but COVID could last for the rest of the year, considering I live in the southern hemisphere and *winter is coming*.

I am considering finding a new job with a tech stack I like (React/NodeJS) and work there **and learn new things -**rather than waste my time- for a few months until the pandemic is over (I guess it could take from 4 to like 10 months?). My concern is how my resume/CV would look like with my employment periods by having 1 year of internship + 1 full time month at a company, and then 4-10 months in another company with a different stack.

Another option would be asking my manager to change me to another project (which is developing the framework itself) where I would **actually** develop with ""native"" JavaScript and AngularJS and I would work with very skilled people. I was also told by a friend they are looking to migrate that project to Angular 9 ""soon"". The bad thing about this is that I don’t like Angular and I want to be a fullstack or backend developer and I would not be using backend. However I would learn much more JS than in my current project and that might be useful for landing a MERN or MEAN job.

**I am quite confused about this so ANY kind of opinion and advice is welcome as long as you've read everything &lt;3**

  
**Thank you very much**"

I just finished my Master's in EE (focused on machine learning for computing vision). Right now I have a public job unrelated to any of my areas of interest (but it pays more than any job in Brazil would pay me at this point in my career).

I want to change my focus to machine learning/ai again, in the long run, it will pay off for sure. Which ""path"" should I take, considering my current position? I've worked with IT before (web development), but not with AI/ML specifically.  I'm considered starting a Ph.D. or applying for jobs in the field (definitively willing to relocate to North America or Europe).

Any ideas or suggestions? Maybe which kind of jobs should I be looking for? I applied for both Google and Facebook research intern program, BC I felt it was almost the ideal job for me, but I certainly can't count on that.

Thanks!

My family was in a brutal car accident. My parents recently had my sister, she was about five months old. I was twenty, and had very little experience in the real world. I mean, I was in college with good grades , but I lacked the real ability to be a grown adult. I partied a fuck-ton. I did just about every drug a frat boy could use. Drank everything I got my hands on. Unfortunately or fortunately, however you view it, I did not sleep around with women at all. I was typical frat boy, but seeing my friends getting laid left and right had a toll and I drank and/or smoked because of it. But that was the least of my frustrations.

My father and I would always get into arguments about how my life was going. He knew of my drug use and obviously disapproved of it. My parents were wealthy and didn't want their money going into lines of coke. I understood that, but I rarely listened.

On December 24, I changed my life for the better for myself and my little sister. My parents, little sister, and I got into a devastating car wreck. The few times it snowed in the state of Georgia is when we decided to go out of state to southern Florida to meet family friends for Christmas. My father made the fatal decision to go in the early morning where it was still cold, wet, and foggy. He had woken me up and we had all gone into the car like any other time. I was in the back seat behind my mother who was in the passenger seat. My dad was driving and my little sister next to me in her booster seat. I had fallen asleep sometime after we left.

I had awoken to my dad swerving off the road and hit a tree off of a sharp curve on a back road he had taken. My mother wasn't wearing a seat belt for unknown reasons and she went flying through the windshield and hit her head on the tree we had just hit. Her skull was caved in and she had hit her head so hard her eyes popped out. Pieces of metal from the hood of the vehicle came flying through the windshield and had decapitated my father. His head rolled into the back of the car and I remember the emptiness in his eyes.

Apparently, my father drove on black ice, slid and collided with the tree. I had a few bruises and whiplash, My sister wasn't even harmed. Of course, after the funeral, my parents left me with their money in their will. The authorities didn't know of my drug use and I became legal guardian of my sister. I sold our house and bought a decent apartment. I soon stop using drugs and stopped drinking. I was never really addicted to them so it wasn't a big issue. My life was to protect my little sister from the horrors of the real world.

It was hard, at first. I finished college, went to police academy, and completed a 32-week internship. I had done something with my life and I had become Officer Jack Knudsen. My little sister, Hannah, who is seven now, was growing into a sassy and witty girl. I guess, I'm over protective, but who wouldn't be after the accident.

But enough of my backstory. I lived in my small town in southwest Georgia after my parents deaths. It's a nice little town. About two-thousand people. I was lucky to get a job because crime is low.

The mayor of our town, Thomas Carver, has been mayor for, shit, forever it seems. He's a charming christian man, mid-forties with wavy hair, and a light beard. Carver also likes to take trips to Israel every year. We don't really have elections because he usually run unopposed. Everyone loves him including me. He seems very fond of me, probably because of my story. He visits the station from time to time to talk to the Sheriff.

The Sheriff of our town is also like Carver. His name is Judas Ross. A mid-fifties, balding man with a bushy mustache. He's everyone's grandpa.

Even though crime is low we do have one particular person who does cause trouble or at least tries to. Mel Kostic was a skinny, ragged man. He has long brown hair with no facial hair and bright green eyes. I know this because citizens have described a man of his statue. Or they just outright say it was him. Kostic likes to look into people's windows, mostly their children's windows.

And now, a little girl, Martha Chambers, who is Hannah's age went missing. Seemly abducted from her room. I was the one who visited the Chambers' home. However, the windows were locked and the only thing that was opened was her closet door. Her parents are obviously devastated but both the mayor and the sheriff don't seem concerned. I mean I was the one who wrote the police report and of course, it reminded me of Hannah.

I asked the parents if they had seen anyone suspicious leading up to her seemingly abduction. They said no. I asked if Martha had mentioned anyone. They said that Martha had been having nightmares about a man with a head of a cow or bull.

""She called him *the One who takes children*."" the mother said.

""*The One who takes children*. You ever seen Mel Kostic around here, recently."" I asked.

""We saw him months before she had these nightmares and he was looking in our front window."" the father said.

I had gotten back to the police station and told the sheriff and like I said he didn't seem concern and told me he would ""Deal with it personally.""

While I was taken a statement, I got chills about *the One who takes children* and thinking who could that be. I know I'll be holding Hannah's hand a little bit tighter. I'm off duty as of now. I had just got a call just now. Another child went missing."

fkmh86,809,2020-03-18,"British Intelligence, Russian Blood, and American Steel",penguiatiator,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fkmh86/british_intelligence_russian_blood_and_american/,"When humanity was first discovered by the Confederation, it was through a tiny hunk of metal hurtling through a major hyperway, knocking a shipping cruiser off course and delaying the delivery of some fifteen hundred toaster ovens and two holodisks, as well as obliterating half of an asteroid belt. Amazingly, the tiny hunks of metal stayed in a cohesive enough mass that an intern at the Galaxy Transport Authority was able to reconstruct it with the molecular assembler. This was a major accomplishment, and the GTA was quite proud to announce the recovery of ""Voyager 1"". The intern remained unpaid. 

It was quite unusual for a new sapient species to be discovered before it had achieved hyperspace travel (in fact, this was a one in a billion occurence), as there were better things to do than scour every star system in the galaxy for life. However, humanity seemed to be unusual as a rule. They were a combative bunch; the planet they called home was filled with savage flora and fauna, and earthquakes and volcanic eruptions seemed normal to them. Their atmosphere contained significantly less oxygen than other worlds, yet they were one of the largest of the sapient species. Preliminary reports showed that they were excessively violent, and had only stopped major conflicts because the two superpowers were too busy aiming an astonishingly large amount of weapons at each other in a morbid game of chicken. They seemed to glorify war: their largest conflict was almost proudly referred to as won through ""British intelligence, Russian blood, and American steel"". How they had banded together to send the hopeful messages that were contained on ""Voyager 1"" was a great mystery to most experts.

That is, until the council decided to make first contact. Initially, relations were very amicable. The humans quickly organized a world government behind their already existing United Nations, and rapidly caught up in technology and science, applying what had taken other species centuries to discover in just a couple decades. They settled the planets in their star system, as was their right, and opened up very profitable trade with the rest of the planets. Human culture was fascinating, and as xenopologists pried deeper into their history, the more it became apparent that they were a very different species. One large line of questioning was that of their ""Second World War"". When a human historian was asked how they had done such terrible things to one another, he simply chuckled and replied ""British intelligence, Russian blood, and American steel"". This nonsensical answer quickly spread as a meme, and it was popular opinion that the humans were dumber than the Craitens. This was generally incorrect, as would be evidenced later.

After some time, the Queztalia decided that it was time to impose some power on the United Nations. As the most naturally aggressive sapients, the Queztalia were the final word on the military might of the Confederacy. Most battles were fought by trading blows until one side had lost 10-15% of their force, in which it was the obvious move to surrender, however the Queztalia would often wait until 20% of their forces had been incapacitated before doing so. This was unheard of, and the Queztalia had quickly become the largest power in the Confederacy, holding 50% of votes. They utilized these votes to embargo the humans, threatening to cut them out of the Confederacy unless they acquiesced to the demands of the Queztalia. Some of these demands included setting up a Queztalia base on each human world, and complete Queztalia control over Pluto. These were the same kind of restrictions imposed on the other sapient worlds, and it was assumed any newcomer would happily accept military protection for the cost of one or two planets.

The humans were anything but happy.

Angered, the human delegate went on a rampage about freedoms and rights, which was then arrogantly met with the Queztalia alluding to war. Hearing this, the human fell silent, in what was assumed to be chagrin. However, when he finally spoke, it was simply met with five words. ""Si vis pacem, para bellum."" This was seemed even more inane than ""British intelligence, Russian blood, and American steel"", as it wasn't even in a living language, and the video of the incident became another meme. Most believed that the human had lost his mind, and ""para bellum"" became one of the most quoted phrases of all time. The Queztalia laughed, and sent their indomitable fleet to Pluto.

Once they reached Pluto, they realized that the humans were, in fact, insane, but not in the way they had realized. Their fleet was met with a terrifying lesson in superior firepower, being not only outnumbered 3 to 1 but also outgunned by weapons never before seen in the galaxy. Their every move seemed to have been anticipated, and the humans seemed to have no concept of surrender. Cannons that tore the very fabric of spacetime sheared open battlecruisers, and ships that normally would retreat due to damage simply fought on, sometimes even sacrificing themselves. The Queztalia retreated to their main star systems, only to be followed by the humans. Energy blasts lit up the galaxy, and the blinding streak of a human ship's hypercannon became as frequent as the number of stars in the sky. The humans' military was larger than anything seen before, their tactics and espionage more advanced than the best Queztalia general's, and their willingness to fight outmatched their fear of death. They dominated all aspects of the battlefield, and invented other forms of fighting. Never before had sapients ever engaged in hand to hand combat, as it would have already been clear who was the victor at the point, but the humans routinely boarded enemy ships and routed the crew. Even when fighting over planets, rather than waiting for details to be hashed out over treaties, the humans simply took the planet. Once the dust had settled, the Queztalia were a one system civilization, with the rest of their population and territories simply folded into the United Nations.

Once peace was established, xenopologists decided to take a closer look at the human sayings that they had once considered insane. The Great War, as it was already being called, shed a chilling light on these phrases. ""Si vis pacem, para bellum"" meant ""if you desire peace, prepare for war"". It was not the insane ramblings of a broken man, but rather a cold-blooded warning of a civilization forged in the flames of battle. ""British intelligence, Russian blood, and American steel"" was not a ill-informed response to a philosophical query, but rather a bittersweet, biting remark as to how wars were truly waged, something that the Queztalia had gotten a taste of. These lessons had been expensive to learn, and no one -- no one, was going to forget them anytime soon."
fkp3aw,2,2020-03-18,Strategies to facilitate Learning,citrin40,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/fkp3aw/strategies_to_facilitate_learning/,"This question is somewhat directed to __Mid- and Senior Devs__. 

### Scenario:

You just finished College decently and have some experience in different things due to some internships. You know the basics here and there, but you are not in any field/topic and expert. You have worked with the following technologies and possess low to medium proficiency. 

* Git
* Terminal (Bash)
* PHP 
* JavaScript 
* HTML / CSS 
* MySQL

You can get a dynamic website up and running, you can be employed as a _junior dev_ in Frontend or Backend.

### Congratulations! You are hired!

Your new job required skills you already have, but plenty of other skills, that you don't have, and technologies that you never worked with or even heard of. Let me elaborate: 


__Front-End__

* VueJS (mostly)
* Some Angular legacy
* JS
* HTML/CSS
* TailwindCSS

__Back-End__ 

* PHP
* Perl 
* Nuxt.js 

The new technologies to learn are very interesting: 

* __GraphQL__ with __NestJS__ (also __TypeScript__, never worked with that) and also __Apollo__ is in there somehow
* __VueJS__ with __Nuxt.js__ 
* __MongoDB__ and __ElasticSearch__ 
* Various __Caching__ Methods

## The Question

How do you go about learning all that? 

Learning the basics in everything as quickly as possible and then go deeper when you are actually working with the technology? 

Or do you rather pick a logically connected part and go deep on it? e.g. Working with VueJS and NuxtJS and getting deep understanding of that, before learning more about the rest? In that case, how do you efficiently work with the technologies at the workplace? 

Help is greatly appreciated."
fkqtz8,2,2020-03-18,23 - recent swen/comp sci grad. Unsure where in IT I want to be.,chrisc10196,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/fkqtz8/23_recent_swencomp_sci_grad_unsure_where_in_it_i/,"My story:
- I Did a dev internship in a relatively small software shop. Spent 3 months on an intern project learning ruby on rails, some other stuff and to be honest, didn't enjoy it. It put me off doing development professionally. I don't think I ever got comfortable with the people and coding 40 hours a week was hard. Really hard. I would go home with headaches at the end of the day. Feeling like a robot. Major imposter syndrome. Pull reviews consistently being rejected didn't help with imposter/esteem issues. Really was not good for my mental health at all.

- I had done 3 years of Software Engineering up to that point. Got to my final year, had major breakdown and 'took a break'.

- tried a few things in my break. I've always wanted to create my own product or do my own thing. Found a niche in p2p lending and created a software service around it. That was awesome. Felt productive, felt like I was making little steps towards that bigger goal by finding that niche.

- decided to rethink my direction and go into an AI specialisation of comp sci cause I would only have to do 2 more papers to graduate and it seemed like a good idea at the time. Hip. Trendy.  Seemed like the jobs paid better than devs do.

- one month later I decided to attend a startup weekend and actually ended up coming second. That was really cool. Idea never ended up going anywhere but that was an awesome experience and met some great people.

- and then... I began to run out of money, I needed a job. all of the intern/grad programmes had closed applications because they either happen over the summer break, or the next year's graduate programme was too far away and I needed cash asap.

So I applied for a few jobs. Ranging from junior dev work, to change management, to AI work. 
And for some reason, I accidentally applied for a senior role in an Enterprise Monitoring position. Role included looking after Splunk, Truesight, Dynatrace and a few other things and managing these platforms for other colleagues to consume. They liked me and I ended up getting the job (granted not as a senior, but I must've impressed them in other ways).
Point being, the pay package was nice enough but I knew in the back of my mind that it wasn't my forever job. I needed the money.

Fast forward 8 months into the role, I dont hate it and I've been trying to understand why. Maybe it's because it's not code. I moved from code where every line and permutation and code path needed to be tested before it would be merged to prod. Or maybe it's because my new role is in infrastructure not dev. Mix of monitoring and sys admin stuff (as we manage our own platforms for the rest of the business to consume). It just feels more cruisy! I've learn a lot about different things and barely done much coding. But I still enjoy it. I learnt ansible for the first time the other day and it was a thrill getting it to work and do what I wanted. It was awesome. I still enjoy coding, but it feels like as more of a hobby that a job. But I don't know if it's feasible to want to start my own IT thing if really, I just enjoy doing coding as a hobby.

I've got a cash reserve and things are pretty good at the moment. There's things in the team I want to improve and to modernise, but I still have this feeling in the back of my mind that I feel like the longer I stay in this role, the less chance there will be for me to fulfil that idea of having my own product that I built or started because I'll lose more and more of my programming abilities and knowledge. Essentially, it feels like a waste of my degree and knowledge I learnt along the way.

Similarly, I switched tac to an AI specialisation and realised after a while, there wasn't much method to the madness. I grew to resent the search for the 'most accurate' model, and heard bad things about the industry. Hyperparameter tuning felt like more of a guessing trial and error game with no real technical skill involved. I'm sure statisticians will argue will me on that point entirely. but, as a junior, it for sure felt like that.

I suppose I'm not sure what to do. I have 1 more paper to do at university which I'm currently doing. I think it's wise that, because I'm working and doing uni at the same time, I should minimise my change until university is finished. Also due to the current economic climate, I don't feel it's wise to shift jobs in the next 3-6 months at least. My current employer is great. Whilst being a large organisation, it feels like they really care about the employees. We have great sick leave and annual leave policies. I feel like I have good job security even in this current economic downturn. I enjoy the company, I'm just not 100% sure this section of IT is for me and where to head.

I need to understand what it is that makes me want to run my own thing. What makes me not hate my current role (when I expected I would). Is it the infrastructure vs dev side of things? What it is about work that I enjoy and don't enjoy. I struggle to get this down in words.
I feel like once I have those answers, I'll be able to make a better decision about my future direction.

I know there was a lot here, but I feel like I had no one to talk to about this and it helps me to write my thoughts down.

Does anyone have any advice? Have you had to deal with something similar? What did you do? Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated.

And if you've gotten this far, I thank you massively for reading.

Cheers"

This is the last summer that I have before I graduate and I'm really scared and feeling hopeless. my major requires us to do a mandatory internship for credit during our last semester in college and we have to secure the internship on our own. im scared that I won't even find anything then since most internships require previous internships. if I can't find anything now, I probably won't find anything when I have to do that mandatory internship :(

it also sucks seeing people within your major already having like 3 internships and you're just here with nothing. I've been working in a family business for the past couple of years and I have like 3 months worth of retail experience. I have like 4 months worth of hospital volunteering experience but that got halted due to the coronavirus.

Some people have recommended doing personal projects instead of internships, but I'm not really sure what I could do/what a ""personal project"" could be. I'd also be interested in taking online CS courses but don't know which ones would be best for a high schooler.

I’m lucky enough to have had multiple internship offers (1 of which I’ve already signed a contract for). As a background, I’m an English Literature and Government double major in my junior year, and worked as an Advocacy Intern at an NGO in DC last summer. 

Career-wise, I’m looking at working in strategic/political communications and press (considering working and then going to grad school) but I’m also interested in getting into law if I get into a top 10. 

Option 1: The internship I’ve already accepted is at a PR firm and is paid for 6 weeks. Through networking I got another offer at a lobbying firm for 8 weeks (unclear if paid or not yet). The timing works out where I can do both internships this summer. 

Option 2: I was just offered an internship at DOJ doing press/speechwriting. This is unpaid and I wouldn’t be able to do either of the other internships. 

Is the DOJ one more prestigious? I’m interested and passionate about the work I’d be doing in all of them, and instinctually feel that getting paid and working in private sector might give me a leg-up for jobs next year. However, I feel like turning down a DOJ internship is short sighted. 

I have 24 hours to decide, and while I know no one can make the decision for me, I’d like to hear other opinions!"

My employer said if I go home they don't know if the internship would continue, which is absolutely reasonable. Nobody is really sure how this situation plays out. I can't afford to go home (back to Waterloo) with no job, no place to live, and such an uncertain future. I quit my part-time job to come here, and they're shut down now. I'm having really bad anxiety about this whole situation and I'm not sure what to do. But I'm afraid I'll get locked out of going home if this continues, or that my J-1 might get cancelled because of the government, and then I'm stuck here with no income. I don't want to go home because I love my job, and this opportunity is amazing, but I'm also terrified of what is to come.   


Can anyone offer any advice? Or is anyone in a similar/same situation?"

I applied to a few local, small-town internships for this summer (2020) to learn something new and maybe get paid.

I applied to a small marketing firm looking for accounting majors for their internship program. They said in an email they would continue to consider me for the internship upon review of my resume. Next, they said to move on to round 2 before the interviews, I had to complete an assignment in 1 week. The assignment is 3 parts:

1) write how in an advertisement, I would emphasize the product and service of a local construction co. (they assigned us a real co. with a website).

2) create a visual of the ad

3) create a mock FB page for the company to market the co's product/service.

I do not know how to do any of that right now. I would love to learn about it but I figured I could learn it in an internship program. I have been offered internships before but this is the first time I was given an actual TASK to be further considered for the internship position.

Is this normal? I'm thinking I am not a good fit for this position but if this is normal to be given tasks before given the position, I may humor it."

I had not coded until I got to college, I switched into CS (from math) after an intro programming class in the spring of my freshman year. Next year I'm going to start looking for internships and the year after that jobs, which both seem to come with lots of pressure and competition. In the fall I started to pick up iOS development which is something I really enjoy. iOS development is easily my favorite coding activity. I've also begun to look on Leetcode for interview prep, and I like that too (I use python). The problem is that I feel like I don't have enough time to distribute between all of those activities. 

As jobs start to get more relevant, what should I focus on? If I try really hard in school, I won't have enough time for apps/interview prep. If I spend all my time making apps, I won't have time for school. I'm not talented enough to breeze through the higher level CS courses without doing much studying and get a high grade. What should I spend my time doing? 

A couple of things to note - I don't go to a prestigious CS school, i don't have a particular interest in working somewhere like Facebook, Amazon, etc though I would take a position there if offered, and my current GPA is ~3.9."

Its already been very difficult to find a job even before COVID-19 started in the US and now its going to be ridiculous. What are others who are graduating doing?

I am even considering and trying to find out how to switch into PhD because of this. I absolutely don’t want to be doing nothing at home!

What are some options you all are looking into? 

It really has me worried, as unfortunately I have ZERO internship experience (never got into anything) so yea. My field is super competitive too. I know the statistical and statistical programming side of things well and can analyze data when its in a nice format but I know absolutely 0 about the software/CS/data science side. We never covered that aspect at all and my non-stat related programming general CS skills are weak. For example I know nothing about SQL/Linux/command line or scaling things up in hadoop or big data systems. 

I am rarely hearing back from online applications and have only gotten past a phone interview 1x and then got rejected. 

Because of this I am also thinking maybe of pursuing PhD but its so late now to send in applications. 

What are you all doing or would recommend? The recession aspect really has be concerned as it has been hard to land a Biostat job to begin with, and I don’t have the CS background needed for data science (which is more than just statistical programming). Now it’ll be even harder to get something."
fkw6vj,1,2020-03-18,Would it be prudent to delay entry into job market through getting more education?,LeMon_James6,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/fkw6vj/would_it_be_prudent_to_delay_entry_into_job/,"Some information about me:
- 22 years old
-about to graduate with a degree in Finance (used to be a double major with accounting, but quit the latter too easily) with now over a 3.6 GPA
-Did D1 athletics for a year and a half before getting injured
-worked as an assistant for a professor for a semester
-did an internship in supply chain management one summer


Even before everything started shutting down due to COVID 19, I still had a very difficult time finding job opportunities.  Most of not all my interviews were for financial advisor roles, which I did not want to do, for multiple reasons (being more introverted, mixing work and personal life by having to sell to friends and family, working on commissions, having to build a client base etc...).  

So I had focused on applying to more analytically focused jobs, such as financial, supply chain, or business analyst positions.  However a lot of companies wouldn’t even respond to my application. I got one phone call and not a single formal interview.  

So I figured that what I had going for me just wasn’t quite enough to get an entry level analyst position at a company and that I needed more.  And remember this was still while the economy was still doing at least okay.

Now that the economy is likely going to tank, it seems like getting more education/skills would be a good idea (unless I  miraculously get a job in the meantime).  However I have heard a lot of people say that getting a master’s degree before getting work experience is useless (idk how more education can harm you your candidacy). Also my one saving grace is that my family is willing to help me a lot financially regardless of my decision, so I’m not too concerned about the short term cost.

Right now I’m taking a data mining class as an elective and I’ve been doing very well at it. Despite the fact that it is somewhat difficult, I’ve found the material pretty interesting and I’ve been one of the top performers in the class and have a pretty comfortable A at the moment.  This is why I am highly considering trying to get a Masters degree in Business Analytics.  Along with that I’ve been told that this is highly in demand.

Right now my highest priority is guaranteeing myself a job in business (that’s not sales/marketing) as quickly as possible.  I’ve also thought about staying longer in school to go into accounting.  Although I’m leaning towards getting a masters in Business Analytics, I’m still not entirely sure though.

My two main criteria between choosing these two are ease of getting employed and time, with the former being more important that the latter.

What I mean by “ease of getting employed” is that ideally the fact that having a specific degree practically equates to getting employed.  In an at least decent economy, the demand for graduates with the degree ought to outweigh the supply.  Between Accounting and Business Analytics which one has a better ratio of supply of degree holders to degree holders demanded?

Time, the other criteria is pretty self explanatory.  I’ve done some research for this and most masters degrees for Business Analytics take 12-18 months to complete, whereas getting a degree in accounting would mean 15 more undergrad hours plus 30 graduate hours of schooling, which would take 18-24 months to complete.

So with all this in mind, what do you think is my best bet towards getting employed in business, between getting a masters in Business Analytics or getting a Masters in Accounting?  Or even trying something else that I haven’t considered?"

fkxu5l,1,2020-03-18,"For those who are worried about making student loan payments, the federal goverment has the Repayment Assistance Plaan for government student loans. I've utilized it before, it's helpful. Details inside.",kwirky88,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/fkxu5l/for_those_who_are_worried_about_making_student/,"Link: [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student-aid/grants-loans/repay/assistance/rap.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student-aid/grants-loans/repay/assistance/rap.html)

It's dependant on your income.  No income: no payments. Low income, low payments.  If your payment amount isn't high enough to cover all of the interest the government makes those interest payments for you so that while you're delaying the repayment of your balance you're at least not building up compounding interest.

The application process is slow and paperwork heavy, so slow that you're going to potentially fall behind on payments while they're processing, but they backdate things once the paperwork's processed and they remove any marks on your credit report after it's processed, if it came to that. I had to reapply every 6 months for 2.5 years (yay graduating class 2008 /s) until I was at an income level where I no longer needed the support.  The first year, while my income was very low, I didn't have to make payments at all.  As my income went up the payments went up but they were at manageable levels.

## Eligibility

You may qualify for repayment assistance if:

* you reside in Canada (or are on an international internship or are a reservist deployed abroad)
* at least six months have passed since you graduated or left school (your loans are in repayment)
* you are up-to-date on your loan payments

If you have a permanent disability, you may qualify for RAP-PD if:

* your permanent disability has been assessed and recognized by the Canada Student Loans Program; and
* you are eligible for the Repayment Assistance Plan.

## Income thresholds

If your family income falls below a certain amount per month, you may be eligible to make no payments on your student loans for a period of six months.

If you earn more than the income thresholds shown below, you may still be eligible for a reduced monthly payments through the Plan. Find out if you are eligible by using the [Repayment Assistance Estimator](http://tools.canlearn.ca/cslgs-scpse/cln-cln/rae-ear/rae-ear-1-eng.do).

**Monthly Gross Family Income Thresholds for Zero Payment under RAP by Family Size**

|Family Size|Income Threshold||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$2083||
|2|$3254||
|3|$4205||
|4|$4959||
|5+|$5652||

## Use the Repayment Assistance Estimator

Use the [Repayment Assistance Estimator](http://tools.canlearn.ca/cslgs-scpse/cln-cln/rae-ear/rae-ear-1-eng.do) to find out if you are eligible and get an estimate of what your expected monthly payment might be.

## Apply

To apply for repayment assistance:

* Apply online through your National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC) Online Services account (you must register for an online account first if you do not have one already);
* If you have loans from Prince Edward Island or Manitoba, you must apply directly to your province for repayment assistance for your provincial loan. Contact your [provincial student aid office](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/education/provincial-offices.html) to find out more.
* If you are applying for RAP-PD (RAP for borrowers with permanent disability and would like your [disability-related expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/canada-student-loans-grants/glossary.html#glossary_d) or [exceptional expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/canada-student-loans-grants/glossary.html#glossary_e) to be considered, you can complete and submit a [Disability Related Expense Form](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/student-aid/grants-loans/information/forms.html#h2.10) with your application.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for advice as a soon-to-be college grad (December 2020 graduation) because my plans got shook up massively.

Just today I got internship and full-time offers for Software Engineering positions, both within the last hour. The full-time one is a back-end API style job at a commercial bank (Silicon Valley Bank). The internship is working at a company that builds machines to make wafers for CPUs (Applied Materials). They said their positions range from ML to driver software and sensors/hardware. I've also never had an internship so this is big.

As for the pro/con/facts of each, the full-time job has a sign-on bonus \[get after 30 days, work for 1 year to keep\], benefits, and pays more per hour. The con is that I'd have to finish my last semester of school while working full time, and I'd be a full-time student, meaning \~80 hrs/week of work and school. The benefit of the internship is the flexibility to stop working during the school year if I wanted to (could stay working through the school year if they like me). However, I'd need to either interview more for other full-time positions or hope that the internship converts into full-time. The internship is at a bigger company (\~20k employees), the bank is rather small (\~2500).

As far as my interests go, I'm pretty indifferent as both sound pretty cool.

I'm honestly lost at what to do. It's great having options, but I need to make a decision. Super duper appreciate all the feedback!"

I've hit a really hard social wall recently. I've always been the type to keep a small but close friend group. I would not call myself introverted but I am extremely shy for a reason I will explain later. I need some advice to help me find a way to confront an issue that has shown up.

I am a college (male) student at a smaller private school. I am from northern redneck country and am not from a wealthy family, but I worked hard and got a lot of scholarship money. Already though, I am a bit distant from most people at the school (wealthy, daddy's money types). If it is relevant later, I do not have a very high image of myself but I guess I'm above average in looks and height. Not remotely the usual creepy white van stalker uncle type. I lived in the dorms, and found a really good group of friends pretty quick. For the entire first semester, everything was great socially. I did have a streak of bad luck which I did not make known, but my friends would always find out and support me. Since this is anonymous I will say that the ""bad luck"" was having consecutive funerals multiple times, my (only) school laptop being defective, my mom losing her job, and plenty of small instances. It was a tough semester but I got through it.

My school has the entire month of January as a break or optional classes. Most people take the break, including me. I am very prone to general winter depression, like most people who live as far north as me. I was looking forward to having that group of friends again.

When I got back, I was not treated the same. I'm still not sure what happened, but the group that I had planned on rooming with next year was avoiding me and locking doors to keep me out (even when I was not trying to enter their rooms), and I was being socially avoided for no reason I could find. Whenever I did have to interact with those guys, they would do things that they knew I hated, like bragging about how expensive their clothes were and how well off they were compared to my family. At this time, however, I met a girl who turned out to have a lot in common with me. I was happy because I just wanted someone to talk to after losing my only friend group, although she was extremely social with many friends. That didn't last long though, and we just went separate ways. We did have a class together still and it was awkward. 

Around that time, I started to realize that I was not looking at life the right way, so I used the opportunity of having a lot of alone time to think hard about how to improve myself. I will say that it worked a lot, with me having secured a very good internship and reconnecting with my parents after about 5 years of just coexisting with them. I also started noticing that the girl I was friends with was appearing everywhere I went. We would still talk occasionally but I stopped after she started harassing me for being depressed (which I did not feel depressed anymore). I knew then that I would have to put effort into avoiding her.

That did not work. I kept seeing her more and more, and I also started noticing some patterns. I would go around campus to places where I could be away, and she would somehow be there with a bunch of friends. After a while, her friends started redirecting me from common places like the campus lunchroom. I went to an off campus cafe one day, and not only did she bring every friend I knew she had, but when I walked to order they all saw me and started visibly panicking. I later learned that she had overheard me talking about going to the cafe and meeting some people there. She knew I would be there. Unfortunately for me, the other people I invited never showed up (while I waited for hours), and the girl did not want to leave either. After this, the act of avoiding her started costing me my sanity and eventually began impacting my grades. I only thought of it as a coincidence but became very self-conscious of how creepy I appeared to people.

I'm pretty sure that she has been reporting me to campus police and professors, along with every person she knows, for stalking. I have noticed that professors are treating me different, the police were always watching me, and at least one of her friends seems to always find me and then just walk away texting. 

I am an extremely (almost to my detriment) forgiving person, I always try to stay nice, and like I said earlier, I am way too shy. If it matters, the reason I am shy is that in high school I was not shy. I had ruined the entire upcoming four years in less than a month, with my at the time long metalhead hair and obvious drug user personality. I had rid myself of those qualities later in high school, but it ruined my reputation. I know that it is almost completely impossible to recover a ruined reputation. I can accept that I ruined my reputation in high school, but I promised myself that I would not repeat any mistakes in college. Instead, I may have been set up by someone I had once trusted, and the school has me on watch lists. People in all of my classes started avoiding me. I usually do not care for conspiracies, but trying to avoid the strange circumstances in my life has now led to me being completely socially expelled.

I just need some advice on whether I should talk to a counselor, school staff, someone who is not as good of friends with the girl, or just let it be. The problem is that with the whole virus shutdown, none of the professional resources are available. Although it may seem good that I don't have that class with her anymore, I have to see her every other day online (yes, we are forced to turn our cameras on), and everyone in the class has been treating me like a sex offender. It's making me feel hopeless that my reputation is ruined but this time it was not my  fault, and I am strongly considering transferring because I can't face the issue myself due to my shyness. It doesn't help that I have photographic memory and will never be able to forget this incident. It also doesn't help that I am sick (probably not Corona).

TL;DL: A former friend set me up and now I am seen as a stalker, where do I turn to fix the issue, or is my hopelessness justified?

If you have any questions about specific events I will try my best to keep everyone anonymous, but I can't really forget so... I can answer it probably. I also can write this 1200 word paper in 10 minutes, where is that talent when I actually need it?"

Hopefully someone knows our options or be able to point us in the right direction. 

My girlfriend is doing an internship at a big hotel branch in the center of London. Because of COVID-19, tourists obviously don't book rooms anymore in the hotel. And her school is afraid of a lockdown of the airspace soon, so they told her to quit the internship and go home.

But she still has 3 months of rent to pay, because she has a 6 month contract. Without the money she got from the internship, we're not goong to be able to pay this. The school told us they won't be able to help us financially.

So do you guys know our options? There are a lot of rooms available in London at the moment, because loads of international students go home. So nobody is interested in taking her room. The landlord told her she has to pay the three months. But what if we just don't?

fkzufy,1,2020-03-18,How to Enhance Career Growth?,jaketheskate,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/fkzufy/how_to_enhance_career_growth/,"Hi All, 

I received my first internship with data analytics evaluating fixed income securities for the summer and am really excited. My undergraduate degree was in Mathematical Finance, and it wasn’t until I finished my MBA where I used tools such as SQL and VBA. 

The internship I’ll currently be at deals a lot with SAS so I’ve been recommended by former professors to check out LinkedIn Learning to educate myself on the topic. Any other materials I should be looking at? 

Does anybody have any recommendations on how to advance career growth, and salary, in the long term in this field? Are there any specific languages I should be learning or is it better to apply for a graduate program in data analytics to get a more well rounded background? I’ve been looking around and there seem to be a lot that are interesting and have a circumference of specific studies. 

Is there a difference between a graduate program and certificate in terms of career growth? If it's more affordable to get a certificate and end up in the same place then that's clearly the better option. But if a Master's in Data Science or similar field is that step above then I may have to start applying.

Thanks in advance"
fl0a22,1,2020-03-18,I survived I guess,Ginger_Lupus,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fl0a22/i_survived_i_guess/,"# Trigger warning! Don't read if you are easily triggered by things such as depression and suicide

Idk I felt like talking about it to random people who don't know it yet. That way it gets out of my brain a little. And I have weird humor due to effects of the pills. So it ends up like a comedy book.

I posted here about my mental hospital thing being canceled which I waited 6 months for. I was so depressed. Everything these months became worse, my grandma died, and a lot of memories of the past kept haunting me. All that I had left to hope for was the mental hospital. But someone named Corona made the apointment \*poof\* dissapear.

I made plans to kms. I would climb out of my window, like a fancy wolf, bike to a bridge and jump of it.  Maybe selfharm on the way. A nice dramatic end with some depressed teenage music coming through my earbuds. I wonder if I would get electrocuted if I jump with my phone into water.

So in the evening, my gf (well we would be official couple if the next meet would be great) rather wanted to be friends. I don't blame her for anything, but it was too much. Like fate convinced me already, so why adding another thing to the list of pain? I laid down on my floor and listened to some meme music for hours, losing myself in the thoughts. Oh and the floor was dusty so when I finally ended up in bed with my dusty sweather, I had to clean the cheets &gt;:(

Today, I got up. I was doubting my plans but after I thought about everything and heared the music from the day before again in my earbuds, I was confident. I walked downstairs, said to my mom that \*anonymous\* broke up. My mom thought I said that I was invited in this person's house ('invitation' and 'break up' sounds a little familiar in Dutch) so she reacted a little angry cuz she thought I didn't think about the rules made due to Corona. Damn you, virus!!!

So angry I went away with my bike. 40 minutes of biking which probably 20 minutes of it is deleted out of my brain. I think I depersonalized again. At the canal I sat in some grass and called suicide prevention line (which is 1318 in Belgium) and I talked there for almost an hour. I hope it was a free line. She tried to convince me to go home or me to accept that she would call ambulance cuz she wasn't allowed to do it without  my permission. I said I was gonna call my psychologist. But after 7 times she messaged that she would call me around 6pm. I thought 'Okay I won't be there anymore, byeee'. I took some pills and went biking again. Becoming sicker and ending up on industrial area.

I dropped my thing I selfharmed with (im not naming it cuz maybe people use it then) but before I could find it, someone saw me there and whistled and pointed at the bicycle path. I was frustrated that I lost my one thing that gave me some peace. I think he was about to call the police so I flew away with full power, again alongside the canal.

Then 'fate' came around the corner and wanted to do something again. So all the bridges I biked to were so low that I wouldn't die if I jumped. I sat on a picknick table at the canal and all the misery was too much so I laid my head down on the table and try to sleep while listening to music and puke water with some pills in the grass. Two cycling tourists came by, and asked if I was okay. I didn't answer, I just wanted them to leave. Then one of them was questioning if I was dead and the other one replied that I probably did it for attention or that I'm causing drama. so when those a\*holes finally went away, I was more furious and lifting my head caused me to puke again.

I called Ambulance and I remember them telling where I was and waiting 15 minutes which felt like 4 minutes. (they had to find me at a road alongside the canal so it took them a while). I talked to the paramedics (idk if thats right translation) on the way to the hospital.

And yup, there I sat again, in the same room I was last year when I cutted my wrist while I was dissociated. Now in the chair next to the bed I laid in last time. I talked about everything. I was making a lot of jokes. But I remember only the intern laughing with the jokes. When they wanted to take some blood (which was between my ringfinger and pinky knuckle cuz my veins were hiding!!) she had to scan a code on the paper bracelet thingie on my wrist from the hospital, and it didnt recognise it the first time, so it took a lot of strength of me to not say that the device may detected my scars as a barcode.

Then I remember sitting there... Sitting... my but hurting of the SITTINGG... well sometimes someone came to ask me what happened, like no one comunicates in the hospital and they all need to hear it the first time from me.

I became back depressed and really suicidal and when someone came with some questions I reacted on almost every question something that has to do with suicide. Idk I wasn't threatening, but I knew they were gonna send me home and everything would be the same. And then after 6 hours and two stabwounds from those scary needles, I went home.

THE END. yes the end cuz Corona is everywhere so they couldn't keep me, couldn't send me anywhere. I rather just didn't call for help and succeed in dying. Nope now I sit here with my 'barcodes' on my arms and seeing double and having amnesia. It wasnt a toxic doze they said. The first thing I thought was ""I can't even measure the pills when I'm killing myself. Now I look like a sad teenager that think sh's dying after skipping a meal"".

For your info, I'm not a teenager. I'm 18 and have symptoms of being drunk due to pills.

The real end"

fl103u,20,2020-03-18,Finishing up penultimate year with no internships/work experience. Need some advice.,ToiletPaper3,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/fl103u/finishing_up_penultimate_year_with_no/,"Hey everyone, I’m current wrapping up my third year in a Canadian school with a double major in Econ/Math. Despite having a high GPA (3.83) and trying really hard throughout my second and third years, I’ve landed 0 internships. I really don’t know what I’ve done wrong but here we are lol. Regardless, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me moving forward. I was still hoping to try and land something, but with the coronavirus situation pummelling the economy, it’s becoming less and less likely. I’ll probably be graduating during the height of the recession as well about a year from now and I’m not sure what to do. Any ideas on productive ways I could spend the summer? Should I try to pick up some useful skills such as python and try my luck at landing a FT offer for after my fourth year, or should I do myself a favour and study for the LSAT and get into law school and leave finance behind? I’m not really sure because I would’ve really liked to break into finance and I’m hesitant to leave behind the field I want to be in, but it’s looking less and less likely as I approach the end of my degree. Thanks for any advice in advance!"
fl1at1,4,2020-03-18,Is it bad that I don't very many side projects?,clutch_mp098,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fl1at1/is_it_bad_that_i_dont_very_many_side_projects/,"A junior majoring in CS here.

I've always been a high performing student, with an almost straight A record but I've known for a long time that GPA doesn't really matter that much to companies as long as it's over a 3.0, but it still gives me personal fulfilment so I've kept at it.

One thing I am lacking in is a good portfolio of side projects. I have a bunch of different school projects but they're all really small. I have one good term project that turned out really well but it was a group project. 

I also had a prior internship which was very hands on and I felt like I did a lot there and will continue to do so this summer (so long as this COVD-19 pandemic doesn't ruin it). 

Am I in a bad position going into my senior year. Will this lack of side projects make it difficult to secure a job?"

fl2t86,76,2020-03-18,Cancelled internships,Goosecreekite,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fl2t86/cancelled_internships/,"Hello guys, 

I'm a UW alum and have been browsing around for quite some time now. With the ongoing pandemic, it is understandable many employers are cancelling upcoming intern season. I wanted to pitch in and hopefully provide some comfort/advice for those who need it. 

Firstly, I feel sorry for everyone affected. It sucks. While you have probably heard this a million times now, I would like to say that your health (and others' around you) is far more important. This virus is no joke, especially to those who are most vulnerable. You are still going to be graduating from a top tier university with a very bright future, regardless of your program or how many internships you have done. And remember, you are not the only ones suffering. Many people are going to lose their jobs and will be up at night thinking about how to help their families survive, especially those who cannot perform their duties remotely.  This is a global crisis, and we will overcome it. Everything will be back to normal real soon. Our daily activities will no longer be disrupted. Grabbing a tim's or BBT will no longer be a health risk. But we have to do our due diligence and be cautious. 

In terms of advice (this is mostly aimed at students interested/enrolled in software), those of you who were on course to do a SWE internship now have the option to work on side projects and enhance/hone your skills. The software engineering industry is very different from classroom settings, you will need to know how to solve problems efficiently and without someone holding your hand. No one is going to hire you to solve a problem they already know the answer to. Waterloo does a very good job equipping you with the resources to become a better problem solver and think more critically. However, you will need to go above and beyond the classroom spoon feeding approach to actually be resourceful. That is why side projects are so great. You learned what a stack and queue are in CS class? Great, now demonstrate you know how JavaScript event loop works under the hood. Maybe you have wanted to add some login/signup functionality to a side project you worked on some time ago? Great, time to dive a bit into backend development and learn about databases, API design and user authentication. If you need ideas for side projects or want to chat more about this, please free to message me. Always happy to help. To others who aren't in CS and are feeling lost, please do reach out -- I can do my best to help. 

All the best as we get through this together. Be safe and keep everyone around you safe."

fl726c,2,2020-03-19,"Upgrading Gaming PC in the next few months, need advice",CaptainJack1001,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fl726c/upgrading_gaming_pc_in_the_next_few_months_need/," Hey, r/pcmasterrace! I built my current gaming PC back during Summer 2017 on an undergrad internship budget. The PCPartPicker list is: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/k9DF6X](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/k9DF6X).

In December, I started having an issue where the PC would randomly shut down, and after extensive diagnosing and trying to find the problem, it went away on its own. It came back in mid-March, and I was so incredibly frustrated until I (am pretty sure) finally found the issue: the power switch on my NZXT Phantom 410 case is shorting or something and sending a button press to the mobo when no such press was happening. After disconnecting the switch the problem stopped again. Between this discovery and my newfound time to work (and resulting money from) my remote job with COVID-19 sending classes online, I think it is time to start looking at PC upgrades.

For starters, I was looking at the NZXT H710i and a pair of RGB AER 2 fans as a solution for a new case. It was highly rated in the most recent ""PCGamer Best Cases 2020"" article and looks much better than my current case with the full window and RGB support. Additionally, I was looking at a Western Digital Black SN750 1TB NVMe SSD to upgrade my current one for more space.

My main questions are:

1. Are these good choices for upgrading storage and the case? Is anything egregiously wrong with them or are there insanely better options at similar price points?
2. Do any of the other components of my build need to be upgraded? Are any of them way out of date? I use my PC to play Overwatch, Witcher 3, and am always open to playing new medium or high-intensity games. I also use my PC for my engineering coursework, so robust components that are able to handle high load are always a plus. *Slightly* interested in doing a bit of streaming at some point, but not a high priority. I am not trying to break the bank with upgrades, but with more time to work basically upgrading any part is on the table with the right justification."

I am currently a sophomore in college double majoring in finance and administration, I also work full time. I have maintained straight A’s (3.9) and am involved in four clubs. I have little to no experience in office work or really anything pertaining to finance (I work in a pharmacy). I have tried reaching out to a lot of companies, (calling same ones just about every two weeks) but I have been having trouble getting through.
My family has no connections that would help, and I have tried recruiting agencies but haven’t gotten anything yet. I really want to get some experience so that by the time I graduate I will already have my foot in the door. 

It would be really helpful to hear what you guys have done to get internships, and any tips would be greatly appreciated! Also could I get an internship with really no finance background (higher lvl courses)? Thanks so much.

I don't feel good about myself, I don't feel good about anything I do anymore. The things people say to me just feel like pressure on me to do what they want. I'm so tired. I just want to lie down on my bed and never get up again. I sleep for a good 8 hours a day, sometimes even more, but I still get through the day without any energy. I'm afraid that if I bring this up to my friends, they will think I'm doing it all for attention and hate me, so I turn to a community of people I have never met, and hope I don't get judged. 

It just doesn't feel like a good year for me. A group of ex-friends shoved e out of their group, coronavirus made me miss an opportunity for an oversea homestay programme, family pressure to pursue and keep up the family business, even though it's not what I want to do in life, academic failure, social issues in general.

I'm constantly surrounded by people who keep telling me to do this, do that, and my family has high expectations of me. Yet I'm a failure and I always feel alone.

I'm so tired. How should I pull myself out of this, any advice? I've got a student internship programme coming up soon, and I want to get out of this slump and do my best at that. Thanks."

For whatever reason I've got it into my head that without a coop in 2nd year itll be astronomically harder to get one after 3rd, and then that wont go well and I'll be screwed over when I graduate.

Theres also the issue of needing money for next year and a lack of a job kinda puts a wrench in that. Overall it's just stressful and making me feel like I'm screwed in my career a little bit."

For example, I have taken lots of systems classes in OMSCS and would really like my next job to involve HPC/ML but I have no HPC experience outside of the classes I have taken (but I do have ML experience). It seems like the easiest way to break into this field of HPC / distributed systems would be to start with any internship.

Do you guys think employers wouldn't consider us eligible for these student internships because OMSCS is generally not a full time programs?

First of all I hope that this question is asked in the right sub and in the right format.  
Little information about myself:   
I'm a cs student (third year), I work as an intern in a big company.  
As a result of the current outbreak I found myself in uncertain place, people are getting fired left and right and I assume that our department will be fired as well pretty soon.  
For the last year I have not worked on personal projects due to lack of time, pressure at work and my daughter being born.

The question here is: What to do if(after) I find myself without a job?   
I know that most of the companies halted all the recruitment processes.  
How to stay relevant to the industry and find a job soon after the outbreak is contained?

Another question: How to sharpen my programming skills while I'm not working? How to keep myself in mental shape?  
I apologies in advance as English is not my native language, and this post isn't self petty, it's more of a direction asking from you guys. Any help will be great.

Many thanks in advance!"

I haven't interviewed in three years except once a couple weeks ago for an internship at another company and I bombed it. It was just awful. My position does not require much skill upfront. I am a data center technician, its a rack and stack position. Most days I'm swapping out disks and servers. I am also in school studying Math/CS so I'm looking for internships for the summer. I've studied on and off for the CCNA but schoolwork is priority. Here are some of the points from the post: 

• Experience working in common development and scripting languages 

• An interest in security, threat detection, automation and monitoring

• Familiarity with networking equipment (firewalls, etc)

fleowd,1,2020-03-19,I need help with the student loan system,rparra2,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fleowd/i_need_help_with_the_student_loan_system/,"Hi, I'm sort of new to Reddit as an active participant so I'm sorry if this a bit wonky or the post isn't somewhere it's supposed to be. I was born and raised in the U.S, and therefore am a U.S citizen, though my parents are Mexican. When we moved back to Mexico a couple years ago, my father found a job as a professor at ""Tecnológico de Monterrey"" and I've already been accepted with a 90% scholarship, so I'm fortunate enough to have a fallback option in case everything goes wrong. Though ""Tec"" is a great university, they do not have the major I've been passionate about since I was in middle school: computer science, so I applied to a couple colleges in the U.S and was admitted at Penn State, albeit with no scholarship and I'll be charged out-of-state tuition. I applied for the FAFSA and have been given 11,000$ in aid for attendance. However, I still must pay 35,000$ somehow. Since my parents do not have that kind of money, my only option is taking out student loans. This is where the complication arises. I have no problem whatsoever with getting into debt because I'm sure I'll be able to pay it back. Added to that, I'll be working part time and will most likely land internships starting my first year since I already know how to code, so after the first year the economic burden will lessen. Yesterday I tried applying for students loans through Wells Fargo's online site. I played with the parameters and these are my findings:

1. I cannot take out student loans because I am still under 18 years of age (17)
2. My father cannot take out the student loans for me because he and I both are living in Mexico rn.
3. The only eligible person in my family is my sister whom is graduating from a UC school this semester and will be moving on to Cornell grad studies in August. But I highly doubt she would help me because we've always had a toxic relationship.

So what do I do? Do I have any other options? I'm really dead set on studying at computer science at Penn state and I feel so lost and hopeless. Any advice helps, thank you!"

flfisy,267,2020-03-19,8 things I wish I’d done before starting my MBA,redditposterunknown,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/flfisy/8_things_i_wish_id_done_before_starting_my_mba/,"Hey everyone, I was just talking with a friend who is heading off to business school this year. They had a bunch of questions and it was fun to share my experiences. We both got really excited about their next couple years.

It also got me a bit nostalgic. It’s an awesome couple of years. I’m pumped for all of you who have recently gotten in and decided to do an MBA (good luck to those still waiting!). One comment my friend made kind of stuck with me. Now that they’re in, they feel like they should be preparing, but aren’t really sure what to do. I know I felt the same way.

I spoke with a few old classmates and they agreed. One in particular got really excited about it. We started ripping off the things we wished we had known or done before school and ended up with a pretty solid list. I’m excited about it and wanted to share, so here it is.

Our thoughts about what to do once you’re into school and want to start preparing:

**First things first. Do you have enough money?**

No need to over-model this. Roughly sum assets and expected income. Be careful though - school-released “total cost of attendance” is very conservative. For example, many international trips cost &gt; $3k. A lot of MBAs take 2-3 per year plus many weekend trips. Depending on where you fall, consider a healthy buffer of 10-20%.

Also consider financing your MBA more than needed. Currently, post-school refinancing rates are as low as 2-3%. Many schools provide need-based aid based on assets not income. If you've saved, you might not get aid. All schools are different, but generally they include a % of your retirement funds (including 401k), home value, spousal income, and liquid savings. Speaking of spousal income, being married will likely lower your aid package. While single, you'll have fewer assets and less income during school. --&gt; More aid.

**Once you know if you have enough money, come up with a pre-school plan.**

There are 3 broad options: quit and travel / relax, work until school, or get a pre-school internship.

Quit and travel / relax -&gt; Most people encourage this. It’s nice, but can be boring if you don’t plan it right. Work until school -&gt; Some people end up regretting this one. They felt rushed, unprepared, and exhausted. That said, it’s not a choice for everyone. Pre-school internship -&gt; Our favorite (but a little tougher right now obviously). Find a cool company or role and ‘intern’ for them. It provides additional salary, the chance to test your fit in a new space, and is great for your resume.

**Research a few career paths you don't think you like or don't know much about.**

A ton of MBAs are seeking a career ""pivot"". A lot of those ""pivots"" are somewhat fake. For example, big tech, consulting, and finance - gross oversimplifications aside - really aren't that different. Distinctions exist, certainly, but we focus on them too much.

Take this time to look at your school's employment report and find the paths where n &lt; 10. For example, search funds and sales roles. Do some research, maybe have a coffee chat with someone. No need to over-do it, but challenge yourself to think outside the box. If you like the box, you can intentionally return to it confident it's the right choice for you, not just group think. And you might find an exciting new opportunity half your class isn't gunning for.

**Read! Run! Climb!**

Whatever your passion is, pick it back up. The next few years will be unique. As an adult (maybe?) with defined passions, it’s easy to find a group of like-minded individuals. Plus the school environment provides nearly unlimited resources. It's a special time.

For example, do you like sports? You'll once again have access to a gym and be able to regularly get 10 people to run up and down playing basketball. Like reading? Make a book club. Something else? You may have let these passions fade while pursuing work, but now it's time to lean back in.

**Set up a super-simple note-taking or journaling system.**

Be real with yourself. If you haven't kept notes in school before, don't aim for an encyclopedia. But you're about to drop some serious dough. You might as well solidify the knowledge.

For example: Write one thing down after every class session? Write a couple things after every quarter? Spend 30 minutes every month sharing key learnings with a friend? Write a blog? We don't care what, but do something. If you don't figure it out beforehand, it'll probably be at least four months before you do. No time for that once school starts.

**Pick 3 things you definitely \*don't\* want to do.**

All of our friends that loved and valued the MBA the most had 1 thing in common - they were very clear about what they were \*not\* interested in. We’re not saying that you should be closed off, but there are too many resources to be open to everything.

In our opinion, the best ""no""s are to ongoing, long-term activities. Success in business school is often obtained by saying no. It frees up time, keeps you healthy, and forces focus. The list can and will change, so don't stress this. It's just a good exercise.

**Pick 3 things you definitely \*want\* to do.**

At least at first, we recommend focusing on short-term commitments. Unless you're really all-in on something, know that you'll start school wide-eyed and bushy-tailed. If you commit to something long-term, you'll probably be more Voldemort than Bambi by the time you're delivering that work.

Start a business? Explore a new career? Start a charity? Lead a club? Your wish list will inevitably change during the first few weeks. Once it reaches stasis, then commit. I know what you're thinking. No. Don't worry. There's plenty of leadership roles. You won't miss out. Some clubs even have five co-presidents. It’s a bit silly.

**Do \*not\* spend time on math or accounting or other business-prep.**

We’ll keep this one short because it’s opinionated and maybe less widely applicable. I distinctly remember freaking out about my math skills and basic accounting knowledge. That was dumb and I recommend avoiding that.

That’s what school is for. You’ll be shocked how quickly you will pick up these core skills. Even if you don’t, your peers will be incredibly helpful. Overall, it’s an opportunity cost thing - any of the other things on this list will serve you better than “practicing your excel skills.”

**Lastly, some caveats / context.**

We went to Stanford and Kellogg. We both came from consulting. We left our jobs before starting school \~1-3 months early (one to travel and one to do an internship). Afterwards, one of us returned to consulting and the other started their own company. We were both really happy with our experience, but also had a few regrets or things we wish we had done. This list is a combination of things we are happy we did and wish we had done more of. It’s definitely just our opinion, so happy to discuss in the comments."

I tried dialing it down to intern positions so I can get some experience but just about all of the intern IT job postings require you to be enrolled in college.

I have an extraordinarily high rate of internship rejections. 100% unless it's in person (in which I've had a 100% success rate). Befuddled, I later found out that people were never getting passed my resume. In fact, many didn't even look at it. Not a single recruiter or hiring manager had seen my projects, articles, github profile, etc.  
When talking to people in person, it's usually obvious that I know what I'm talking about, but I can't seem to get past the resume stage with anything online. I've had my resume vetted many times before, so I can't find a problem with it.  


Regardless, it feels like hackerrank challenges would be the right way to go. I can complete a 1h30m challenge in 30m. This hopefully gets my foot in the door enough for an interview (maybe). The problem is that I only come across these hackerrank job postings once in a while. 

Is there any good way to filter out ones that don't provide a hackerrank challenge of some sort, so that I can limit my applications to jobs that I know I'll even have a chance of getting?"

flkw69,4,2020-03-19,Need help - New grad almost no interviews,Heronic_Birdwatcher,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/flkw69/need_help_new_grad_almost_no_interviews/,"I’ve reached a point where I’m very disheartened and confused about my job search. I’ve applied to 100 positions but only had 3 interviews (from prior connections) that resulted in stating they wanted someone to start immediately.

I will be graduating in May with a business undergrad degree from a top 20 US business school with a 3.5+ GPA. I’ve had 4 internships, two of which were at top tech companies and two others at high growth startups. I have decent leadership, several merit scholarships, and won case competitions. I thought there might have been problems with my resume, but I’ve had it looked over by two tech recruiters, my previous boss, and a university counselor and they couldn’t find anything wrong with it/ all seemed to be impressed. Yet I can’t get interviews, even where I’ve contacted recruiters over LinkedIn directly, met the company at networking events, or had a referral. 

People I ask for advice sometimes say you have great experience you’ll do fine and that’s really not helpful because I’m not doing fine in my job search. I’m tailoring my cover letter to each job and am a US citizen. What else am I not doing?

At this point I’m at my wits end. I don’t want to be making the same mistakes over and over again. Does anyone have advice on getting the interview? Also now that most new grad programs are closed what can I even apply to if I’m interested in tech."
flln6i,7,2020-03-19,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (3/16/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/flln6i/weekly_job_qa_thread_3162020/,"Hi all,

Here is the fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?  

   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

So far I've been fortunate enough to have good friends and counselors to give me advice but I feel like I don't have a clear picture of how future things will work out and I would really like some advice,,,




I'm currently a community college student and I will be transferring to a four year this fall. My short term goal is to get a summer internship for 2021 at a mid-large sized company (ideally FAANG) so that after I graduate in Spring 2022 I will be able to more easily get a full time job, possibly at the same company. I will almost certainly (well over 95%) want to settle in Los Angeles because my family is here, and if that means taking a lower salary then it is acceptable for me. 




My first issue is that I have no idea what disciple to actually go into in CS. I like programming because I like problem solving and figuring out new interesting solutions. I genuinely like doing computer science homework most of the time. There are so many different areas in CS that it makes my head spin when I think about them. So this brings me to my first question, ***when, if at all, should I pick a specific area in CS to dive deeper in?*** Any suggestions on how to actually make the decision or resources to read up on would be appreciated!


So far I have exposed myself to software development (desktop) and web development (frontend and backend). I liked software development, and web development was okay. Not that great, but I wouldn’t mind doing it. Just okay. Machine learning looks cool but honestly daunting and I haven’t looked into it.






My second concern is achieving my short term goal. Due to being in CC, and due to my own ignorance, for summer 2020 I was only able to get a single coding challenge (which I flopped), even though I applied to well over 60 places. Keep in mind I *had* experience and multiple projects at this time, and still nothing. For summer 2021, I will be in a better position because I will be in a four year and actually be eligible (almost every internship I applied to specifically stated they only wanted 4 year students, including the one that sent me a coding challenge). I do however have a serious concern; I have *three* research experiences and only one “industry”, which technically can be seen as research too if you really want to dig into it. All of them were software development and only are “research” in name, but still, I can see recruiters have issue with it. This brings me to my second question, ***will having so many research experiences negatively impact my competitiveness for industry? If yes, how can I combat this?*** As a side note, my upcoming summer 2020 internship is also an REU at Carnegie Mellon.



My third issue is that I have no clue how to use my time. I always get advice to “work on projects” but this loops back to my first problem of not really knowing what I’m doing in the first place. Without a set goal and time I’m pretty unproductive and can’t really focus on anything. There’s a whole bunch of projects that I can work on but there is so many that they all feel daunting. I’ve done three minor projects, one of which I left half-done and the other was more hardware than software. I really like hardware stuff too, so there’s that wrinkle of occasionally wanting to jump ship to computer engineering. ***Advice on how to spend the next 6 months to be ready for internship application season would be greatly appreciated.***




tl;dr pls help 



real tl;dr I would like advice on how to increase the chances of achieving my short term of goal of getting an industry internship at FAANG/ mid-large company, how to achieve my longterm goal of getting fulltime job and how to pick specific field in CS to specialize in.

My goal is to make my foundations stronger get back into the industry. I never got into research and also my undergrad didn't have a strong CS program so that didn't help.

I am so confused and desperately looking for all college websites for funding and programs. I would really appreciate your help.

I’ve had the desire to create since childhood. The first job I wanted to have as a child was a fashion designer and if you were to tell seven-year-old (my name) that she wouldn’t grow up to be the next Karl Lagerfeld, she’d be absolutely crushed. Anytime we’d visit Wal-Mart, I would beg my parents for things like acrylic paint, sewing patterns and anything else I thought would help me be the fashion designer I knew I was meant to be. My room quickly became a large collage of all of my “creations”. It was stained with the odd color scheme of purple and green from the acrylic paints I successfully begged for and I couldn’t be happier. I even customized my own jeans with those same paints, beaded fringe and just about anything else that was small enough to be sewn on. I envisioned what my runway shows would look like and even the names of each collection I would release. But what I didn’t envision was how my desire to create would completely change throughout my life.

I like to think that the communication profession chose me. Somehow throughout middle school and high school, I was often put in a position of planning and organizing events in the clubs I took part in. I learned at a young age that planning and successfully pulling off an event is an art form of its own. It wasn’t until college that I felt a deep sense of belonging in this field. Throughout my undergraduate career, I had the privilege of working with many non-profit organizations and small businesses. My desire to create then started to shift. I was given the opportunity to combine different art forms with public relations and marketing techniques that somehow came naturally to me. I was intrigued and suddenly knew what I wanted for myself professionally. 
In the future, I see myself owning an integrated marketing agency that will be able to aid in the development of small businesses and non-profit organizations. I believe that taking the time to develop and invest in them is an investment in our communities. Not only are they the driving force of the small cities and towns that they reside in but, they’re the backbone of America. Charity starts at home and with this agency, I have the potential to create more jobs and put money back into my little hometown of (my hometown). However, in order to help others, I must first help myself. I still have growing to do as a professional and I know Suffolk University has all the tools I need to help me accomplish that. 
 
Suffolk University’s campus is in the midst of Boston’s vast media market. Getting accepted into this program will give me unique opportunities that could potentially advance my career. If admitted, I plan to take the time to seriously develop myself as a professional. Apart from the bustling campus and thriving student life, Suffolk University’s Madrid campus and promising internship program are what really drew me in. I’ve always regretted not taking the opportunity to study abroad during my undergraduate career and since then I vowed to myself to take the opportunity if it presents itself again. 

I believe I will leave Suffolk University one step closer to the woman I aspire to be. Earning this degree will diversify my education, give me specialized knowledge in the field of communication and help me advance in my career.  I am choosing to apply to Suffolk University because I realized that there couldn’t be a better communication program or university for me elsewhere. I worked very hard obtaining my bachelor’s degree at (my undergrad university) and I’ve made a commitment to myself and my family to bring the same work ethic to Suffolk University."

I am asking this because while doing my own research, I've heard many different opinions including macOS is great for development because it is Linux without the hassle, Linux is the best because of its freedom and the fact that many companies are using it now or that the OS doesn't matter. So I am just a little confused.

.

My Background: High school senior going to Uni for CS. I've used Windows 10 my whole life and as for CS knowledge, I am intermediate with Java (obviously I have much to learn) and use Eclipse and IntelliJ. I tried running Linux as dual-boot earlier this year (Manjaro) for about 2 weeks before uninstalling because of how often it broke. I then heard Arch would be ""better"" so I spent some time trying to install it before accidentally wiping my boot partition. I fixed it and stuck with Windows for awhile but am considering Ubuntu since its stable and easy to use. 

.

So I'd like to hear your opinions on the operating system that you guys are using, the pros and cons of using other systems or just any thoughts you have on this. My main concern is making myself more marketable (some intern listings I've looked at ask for experience in bash and Linux environments) so is it ""worth"" the effort learning Linux? If you are currently working in any CS-related field, I'd love to hear literally ANY insights you have."

The uni classes isn't even a great excuse because most people find a way to get gigs on the side, or at least study productive stuff on the free time to have an easier job of being able to produce value when the time to find a job arrives. Even after graduating I'm sure I won't have the necessary drive to job hunt effectively, or to get my shit together to be presentable at interviews, etc. I spend the day engaging in instant gratification tasks and its incredibily difficult to break free from this loop, the ""I will get to it later"" thought runs constant even while I'm obsessing with it.

While I'm very grateful to have an offer amongst the uncertainty, this opportunity isnt my dream choice. 

Namely, I come from a supply chain/ops background. I wanted to at least try marketing and I feel that even if I dont do my internship in ops, I wouldnt be locked out of of sc/ops if I were to not like marketing. OTOH, if I were to do an ops internship, I feel like I'd be pigeonholing myself. So while there are plenty of positives with the ops offer, my concern is that I'm essentially shutting myself out of other potential FT opportunities. 

I interviewed with a tech company before the whole corona shit and the only update was that I am still in the running as they still review candidates. 

So, my choices are either ask for an extension for the ops opportunity or ask the tech company if they can expedite the process. 

I asked the CMC for their thoughts and their answer was that they would play it safe (and not even signal any disinterest by asking for am extension) and take the ops offer because of the uncertainty. While I agree and am sorta risk averse, there is something to be said about the CMC (and the program as a whole) just playing it safe for their self-interest.

TL;DR - wanna try marketing but dont wanna risk the ops offer I have amidst all the bs going on.

Since  he moved back to BC last year, he's been having a hard time finding a  job in BC (and I'm assuming that he's stopped because of COVID-19). From  what my dad told me, he mentioned that he can't find a job related to  IT/computer science due to the ""Canadian experience"" even though he had  jobs done in BC while studying in BCIT. He did an intern gig at one  point. From what I can surmise, he'll likely move back to Manila and be  an entrepreneur here instead. Helps that he and I (unofficially) have  dual nationalities.

And I have to  admit that it'll likely affect me too (I had my BA in Poli Sci awarded  in '18) since I have no working experience in BC (or anywhere else in  Canada), even though my friend recommended I work for the government in  intelligence/law enforcement or I find work with a think tank/university  somewhere else  (Not sure where in Canada) while I wait to see if if my  application to Singapore is considered since I'm also living in Manila."

I'm a 20 year old Dutch IT student (bachelor degree), currently in my second year. Next year I can choose between a few things that I want to do in school. My dream would be to go to America, but I know that in total it would cost me around 10k to go to a university in America for one semester.  That's a lot of money for me.

Now, I was thinking: is it possible, as a student from the EU, to become a (paid) intern at a company in America? My school does allow that, but I'm not sure if US companies are looking for those kind of interns. I already work as a junior software engineer at a big company here alongside my study and my grades are pretty good. 

Do you know if what I'm looking for is possible and how hard it is to find a company like this? Maybe you even know a company who would like to do something like this? Thanks already!"

flwpdg,3,2020-03-20,Web dev or Python?,falloutofthecreed,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/flwpdg/web_dev_or_python/,"Vague title, I know. But before I get to the ""real"" question, some backstory. I hold a BS in Electrical Engineering and a BS in Computer Science and Engineering, but basically all of my experience between full time jobs since graduation in May 2018 and internships during school have bee EE based and not CS. I want to get into a CS job, some sort of software development but can't decide which route to go since I haven't been exposed to very much. 

I started learning web dev (HTML, CSS, and a little JS) but stopped because I didn't think I could make it as a web developer because I'm not creative visually. I can barely match my clothes on a daily basis let alone visually design a website. 

I've also started learning Python a few times but I get nervous following that because it seems like it's all just ML and I have no confidence in myself to be smart enough for that. 

So I guess there are two questions buried here:
1. Do I have to be artistic to get into front end Web Development? (Based on already learning HTML and CSS, I figure I could eventually go full stack)

2. Current affairs aside, do I have a better chance pursuing a web developer position or a Python position of some kind? If Python, what are some things I should be looking for?

I appreciate any kind of response. I'm not in a super techy area of the US, much more of a manufacturing place."

I was lucky enough to land one last summer at a medical tech company, which ended up being sub-par. I learned a lot, but it was a new program and fairly unorganized. 

I got an email from the HR rep inviting me back for this summer, and I am not sure if that's the best thing to do. Medical software is just not really the industry I want to go into, and I don't know if having two summers at the same place is appealing to recruiters. Also, my resume is a little lacking right now in terms of side projects, so I could use the summer to work on that.

Ultimately, with all the internship programs getting cancelled, I doubt I will be able to find another opportunity. Should I take the second summer at this company, or work on building a better project portfolio?"

More free time than ever stuck at home with nothing but your computer.

2. Programming skills in conjunction with other engineering disciplines is hugely valuable and desirable for companies and will likely improve your resume. Sure some of your clubs and extracurriculars are postponed for now, why not dive into something new and useful?

3. (Perhaps most relevant now) As the virus and length of quarantine develops, work policies will likely change so that more can be done at home. Remote learning and remote working. What's a better way to adapt to these changes than by learning to code or getting in touch with relevant software techniques? (Doesn't have to be hard coding, could be some other software relevant to your major.)

Find something that you like that can intersect with coding, anything, it doesn't matter. Now is the perfect time to convince yourself that learning a programming language is useful. I'm EE and my first project was to turn Van Gogh paintings into pixelated versions of themselves with different color schemes in Java: [Imgur Gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/ChwcAAl)

I used this project to land myself a research position last summer at my school in an AI and BME lab and spent the summer continuing to learn how to code. (image processing techniques, albeit not the most useful for industry) Nevertheless it is now a key experience on my otherwise lackluster resume and is probably why I even got an internship for this summer. I had never taken a college programming course before and if I could do it, so can you.

flym8l,680,2020-03-20,We just compiled a huge list of learning resources for digital marketing. We thought this sub would appreciate it!,DrJigsaw,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/flym8l/we_just_compiled_a_huge_list_of_learning/,"Hey guys! With the whole self-isolation thing going on, it’s an awesome time to learn a new skill (or ten). I've been hoarding some of the best guides / resources on digital marketing for the past \~5 years or so, and recently decided to transform it into a guide.

To make it an awesome read, I also created learning paths for most of the digital marketing channels. So, it's not like, ""go read 4835 articles,"" but more like, ""Read A, then B, then C,"" and so on.

Enjoy!

# Before we start talking about specific channels, though, let's discuss HOW you can learn digital marketing best.

 First things first - you need to decide which channel to start with.

If you have a knack for writing, we’d recommend going with **Content Marketing** or **Copywriting**. On the other hand, if you’re more analytics-oriented, go for **Search Ads** or **PPC**.

As a given, you DON’T have to learn all the channels. You can just pick one that you like, and specialize in it!

Once you’ve decided on which channel to roll with, you should also establish a learning methodology.

As with most things in life, reading on digital marketing won’t take you far. You need to also put everything into practice.

We usually recommend going with one of these 4 options: 

1. **Create a test learning environment**. Basically, you create a website for a basic product or service (heck, even a blog would do!), and start applying whatever you learned about digital marketing to get leads and customers. Even if you have ZERO budget, this can be an interesting learning experience. And yes - it’s possible to start w/ a zero budget. 
2. **Get an internship**. This can be a bit painful if you’re in the middle of your current career, but hey, swallow the pride. If you do your best, you’ll be doing some real work 6 months after the internship.
3. **Offer a local business to help them with marketing for free**. Find a business you think you can help in your area and reach out to them! 
4. [**Create an affiliate blog**](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/affiliate-marketing-blogs/299053/). Pick a niche, create an affiliate blog, and start pumping out some content. This is mainly relevant if you want to learn SEO or content marketing.

And here’s what you ***SHOULD NOT DO***:

&gt;*Read a guide or two, buy a course, whip out your own website, repurpose the course and start pretending to be a marketing expert to potential clients.* 

There’ are way too many people doing this as-is. Please stop! You’re setting yourself up for failure. 

You’d be surprised how many people we see on Facebook Ads groups asking, *“hey guys, I closed my first client, now how the heck do I deliver on my promises?”*

...Now that we got that out of the way, let’s get to learning some digital marketing!

# How to learn content marketing 

Most traditional advertising channels are focused on directly selling a  product. If you turn on the TV, you’ll see a TON of ads for this product, or that product or service.

Content marketing is a form of indirect advertisement.

The idea here is, instead of directly pitching your product to your target audience, you create content (article, video, infographic, etc.) around the problem your product solves, and pitch that instead.

To make this a LOT clearer, here’s a practical example.

Let’s say you’re a marketing agency that specializes in helping SaaS companies with their digital marketing (meta, right?).

Instead of directly running ads yelling “We help SaaS companies!” you create a mega-guide on the topic and advertise that.

...Which is what we did.

We created a mega-guide to [SaaS marketing](https://apollodigital.io/blog/saas-marketing) and promoted the hell out of it all over the web. This netted us around \~10,000+ traffic and 15+ leads in the first week, and we STILL get traffic to the piece, 2 months later.

We even posted it on this sub and got around 600 upboats.

Sweet, right? 

Now, you’re probably wondering, is this option better than just running ads to your service / product?

Yes, yes it is. Here’s why:

1. **It’s free (ish).** The only resources it took was our time to write the post, edit it, and promote it. Ads, on the other hand, can be super expensive.

**It builds your brand authority.** Who’d you trust with your marketing? A random guy that popped up on your Facebook newsfeed, or the guys that wrote the most comprehensive guide to SaaS marketing you’ve ever read? Exactly! 

If you want to learn how to do content marketing, here's what we recommend:   


1. **First, learn the basics.** You can find a ton of online courses or articles on this. Here are some of our favorites:
   1. [HubSpot’s Academy content marketing course](https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-marketing)
   2. Neil Patel’s guide to [content marketing basics](https://neilpatel.com/what-is-content-marketing/)

   2. How [Mint grew to 1.5 million users](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-mint-grew/) (a big chunk of the credit goes to content marketing) 

### Learn SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is another super popular digital marketing channel.

In a nutshell, SEO is the act of optimizing your web pages and content for Google so that your website pops up when people look up certain terms.

For example, let’s say you’re a project management software. Would it benefit you if you popped up #1 when people Google for your keyword?

Yes, yes it would. You’d be getting **highly qualified** leads for your software every day, for free, with ZERO ad spend.

Cool, right?

Here’s what an SEO specialist does on a daily basis:

* **Content Creation** \- Create SEO content (or work with freelance writers)
* **On-page SEO** \- Make sure that all content on the blog is optimized for Google and interlinked to each other 
* **Technical SEO** \- Make sure that the web dev team is following SEO best practices when working on the website
* **SEO Strategy** \- Doing keyword research and finding new web pages and content to create
* **Link-building** \- Conducting link-building (or supervising outreach specialists).

flzyew,0,2020-03-20,Really bad harassment under manager,NotForYou313,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/flzyew/really_bad_harassment_under_manager/,"**I don’t know where else to post this. I feel this is a serious human resource issue but all teammates are scared to say something out of fear of retaliation. There is some major bullying and harassment going on under my manager.**

The profession is information technology. She is very very good at the technical side, but she is a horrible manager and she harasses and bullies.

Last year she took over our team. We have three teams in one. My coworker at the time went to our director (who prior to her becoming our manager, he was our manager) about her as a manager. Well the director and her are close and he co-signs for her. Our director told our manager that the employee complained about her. From that point on she didn’t like him and it showed, but also she had it out for him because of this. She ended up putting him on a performance improvement plan and fired him although he completed his assigned tasks. When he got fired he had submitted an email to HR about her. They tried to investigate but he never responded and they swept it under the rug.

Since then she had another employee on a different team, but on our bigger team that she tried to also put on a performance improvement plan. That guy put in his two weeks and must have hated it so much he actually tried to bounce out before his two weeks were finished.

A third person was hired. He just quit last week and gave the reasoning that his wife works out of state and it was too much. Come to find out, his wife doesn’t work out if state. He just couldn’t stand her and she kepts giving him things that he wasn't hired for.

She just hired a new guy, he is on his 90 days and I don’t think he is going to last. She ripped him apart in a meeting over his excel format. Not even that he had all of his servers listed. He did the homework to identify the list of servers, but his format. That guy told the other guy who quit Friday he couldn’t cope.

These are just the employees that have quit. She can’t retain talent, and she can’t find it either because her expectations are off the charts. She is very good at what she does on the technical side and she thinks everyone else needs to be at that level. She gives us tasks and tells us that we can't ask anyone for help. Now, this is IT and things are usually done with collaborations.

We had an intern and we hired her in full time. My manager really bullies her behind closed doors. They speak the same language and she will stand in her cube bullying her in another language. She has told her that if it was up to her, that she wouldn't have hired her and that she is replaceable. Also harasses her by telling her she has all these other resumes of people who want the job.

Now that is a lie! she is having a really hard time finding talent and i feel it's because her expectations are off the charts. Just for my team alone it took us a year to fill a position.

There are more employees that feel this way but we can’t go to our director. She tells us not to talk to him. Plus, he would just side with her anyway. We feel we can't turn to HR out of fear that someones name will be linked to the complaint and it will be found out. What we are looking for is for HR to do a probe and ask the employees because i know we will all spill the beans.

So far we are dealing with 3-4 employee turnover in the last year between putting in two weeks, being put on a performance improvement plan or being attempted to be put on a plan and the employee quit. We also have the teams that have remained who are being bullied and harassed. She is trying to take those applications from the ones who have left and shove them to her other teams because she can't retain talent. Unless this is brought up to HR and they do a little digging to see the numbers then they won't know the depth of what is going on.

Any and all help is appreciated. The goal is to prompt some sort of probe anonymously. The employee handbook has who to contact but we fear retaliation because it will be found out who it was if an employee name is attached to it."

fm2kzs,68,2020-03-20,My summer 2020 internship will be cancelled if they aren't able to work from offices by June. Do I stand any chance convincing them I could still work remotely? They are a smaller company,SadSummerInter,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/fm2kzs/my_summer_2020_internship_will_be_cancelled_if/,"Hi,  


I had the internship of my dreams locked up and was very excited. The internship was at a video game studio that I love and it sounded awesome.   


I got an email a few days ago from them telling me that they would cancel the internship if they weren't able to work from their office by June. I'm very disappointed and because it sounded like a great place to work and I'm sure I would have learned a lot. I tried looking at internships recently posted, and they all seem like the leftover that students didn't want.   


I know I'm not the only person in this situation and that many more will start getting similar emails, but I simply cannot imagine not having a good internship this summer. I don't want to fall back to the very few internships left, and most of them are probably considering canceling the internships.  


I am not ready to give up on my original internship just yet. Things are not looking like people are going to be working at offices by June. I heard that many bigger company are switching to remote internships. Is there any chance I could convince them if they decide to cancel the internship that I could work from home? During my last internship, I did about 40% of my work from home. The only reason I could see why they would decline would be due to security issues, that they don't feel comfortable with an intern having access to game files and gameplay of unannounced games and whatnot.  


I'd really like to know if you guys think I should try convincing them to at least try a remote approach if they do decide to cancel and if so, how I could accomplish that. Keep in mind that this is a smaller AAA game studio and that I'm the only intern, so they don't have the same defined processes for interns as bigger places."

Along with that, I was also admitted to Cal Poly SLO as a statistics major (intending to pursue the cross-disciplinary program with the data science minor) and UC Riverside for Computer Science. My dream is to become a data scientist for the NBA in the sports analytics field.

I have seen various posts on Reddit that show that you can either major in statistics or computer science for a career in data science but I'm not sure which one to choose. I know that computer science has a lot more opportunities for jobs and internships but I am hearing mixed reviews about the quality of education regarding CS at Davis and Riverside (most were from the subreddits). I also know that Cal Poly SLO has a great stats department but I am scared that I have would have fewer internships and job opportunities since stats and data science are only a subsection of CS. So my questions are:

* What is your honest opinion about the quality of education regarding CS at UC Davis?
* Is it possible to switch to the CS major in the College of L&amp;S (don't want to take EE courses and want to minor in statistics)?
* Does UC Davis CS prepare you for internship and job opportunities?
* Are UC Davis CS students able to get good internship and job opportunities?
* Is it better to major in CS or stats for a career in data science?
* In your opinion, what would your decision be with the schools that I have laid out?

I want to get as much information as possible before I make a decision. Thank you all for your time!"

I currently have no plans for doing masters or doing another internship this summer. I do expect to graduate with decent gpa. I was able to get an internship last summer and had experience with Eagle CAD for PCB design as well as basic programming with hardware + design on gpio pins. .

My fear is that I will end up doing programming, but I'm very open to other fields of EE. 

My favorite classes include linear signal and processing and  Digital Signal Processing. I am taking courses like EM fields and plan on taking a intro to CAD course.

I literally have no clue on what to expect when it comes to finding a job after graduation. I live near PA,NJ,NY area as well. I am also a girl if that makes any difference. This unknown is kinda giving me anxiety and I would like some people to give me their experience after graduation.

Thanks so much and hope everyone stays safe!"

It’s a new SOP as of last week and counterintuitive as fuck, but put dailies under “D” and they’ll ride your ass so hard you might as well come into work with a saddle. They also have to be submitted to be in by 2pm ‘cause the New York office needs them by end of day- ”

“Brah-”

“Seriously dude, knock it off with that. Do you even listen? All day with you new guys - brah, brah, brah!” I threw up my hands, then planted them with exerted calm on the conference table before continuing:

“Like I was saying: New York’s three hours ahead – remember hours? Eh bud?” I needled, snapping my fingers in front of Brian’s slacking eye sockets. “So all you have to do is print out two copies, hope that fucking Andy has remembered to email them first…”

“What’s this about fucking Andy?” He swaggered around the corner, hands in pocket: the Cheshire cat of shit-eating grins and inopportune appearances. “S’what your mom did last night bro…sorry she wasn’t there to help you change outta your jammies this morning. Too busy enjoying the breakfast sausage.” Andy motioned to what can most aptly be described as his junk.

“But hey! No disrespect; didn’t mean to tread on your sister’s hand-me-down coattails there. Whatcha got – another corporate collective zombie to train? ” Andy stuck out the pulpy starfish he calls a hand towards Brian. “Don’t worry amigo - I won’t bite! Unless you bite first, you feel? HA! Got a name there sport?”

“Br-”

“Oh my god, who’s this little guy? Aw, they muzzled him up like a bad puppy!”

Mandy’s head poked out from her office. Any backyard anthropologist will notice the intimate correlation between Andy’s trolling and Mandy wanting a piece of his dick. He tolerates it, largely because I think he likes the idea of screaming the closest thing to his own name in bed. Frankly, neither one of them are well-stocked enough in the intelligence department to consider much beyond the details of their own existence; guess that’s why Brian didn’t bat an eyelash. He just pawed at the air and moaned, “….BRAINS.”

You know, typical zombie.

They called it “From Here to Fra’ternity”, but history has since rebranded the event “BRAHPOCALYPSE”: a convention of thirty-six nationally-recognized fraternities (including Pi-Pi, which all members pronounced as “ Pee-pee”) for a total of two hundred and forty-one local chapters, constituting a membership of nearly ten thousand stalwart bros.

It only took one.

Blaine Bartley of SUNY Oneonta – grad. 2021, BS in Global Finance – visited the Florida Keys on spring break with his Wolf Pack, where they charged a speed boat rental to the credit card of one Mr. Benjamin Bartley (of Bartley, Bartley, Haversham &amp; Roche). It was there, near an offshore archipelago, that Blaine’s left foot was compromised by what we now know to be a zombified coral polyp. The polyp had no vertebrae, or the ability to move beyond a six-inch radius - but to Blaine’s credit, he was pretty drunk at the time.

The notorious bite occurred four days before “From Here to Fra’ternity” was scheduled to unfold and set Blaine on a path that, over the course of several days, would change his life - hell, all of our lives - forever.

When the authorities were called to the Connecticut Convention Center the Tuesday following “Fraternity”’s anticipated end, they found the main conference hall in utter destruction. Stuffed to the ceiling was a seething mass of ashen-faced humanity; bros facedown in keg buckets, bros staggering about with lilted gaits, all missing elements of clothing, speech perfectly indecipherable. At first, it was unclear whether or not anything unusual had happened. It was only when local police found a pledge who had been locked in a steamer trunk two days earlier that the world gain testimony to the events which took place that fateful April.

\*

\*

\*

As the immediate shock and confusion began to settle, Kevin Resnick's (Beta Theta Pi) father first took up the baton of matriculating the Living Dead back into society. According to Russell Resnick, no son of his was going to be euthanized just to appease some liberal media hoax or “the greater good”. A week later, he received a call from Jim Whitman (R-Oklahoma), a congressman with a lone zombie scion (Peter Whitman, USC class of 2023) and a “pro-Life” bill that mandated government-subsidized muzzles and job placement programs for all the boys affected by “our nation’s greatest tragedy.”

Soon Wall Street, GM, Facebook, Google and many others nobly stepped up to the plate, adopting Undead (and unsalaried) workers into the fold. And to their credit, the herds of Theta Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa, Pi Beta Phi, et al. performed with aplomb in their new positions, all proving at least as proficient as their predecessors where filing, photocopying, paper shredding, and managing multi-million dollar national corporations were concerned. Perhaps it was their initial disinterest in anything cranial that kept them from feasting on their coworkers and clients; perhaps it was an innate chivalric regard for mankind.

In fact, the hordes of Reanimates seemed positively…well, animated when they received their per diem: a bucket of brains slid into the holding cubicle each morning by HR. The general public remained in the dark, as industry titans shook one another's hands in determination that the average American would never understand how a company - much less a swathe of tent-pole corporations - could survive with such consistent brain drain. Really it was best that there be nobody to ask questions.

And so the unspoken rule became: don't ask questions...and don't get attached to the interns."

I wanted to brag a bit and to ask for a little advice. I had 2 interviews for a machine learning internship position, and they went really well. It seems they were impressed with me. They said the interview went well, and they are still in the early stages of the hiring process. They even said they will update me weekly on their process, and asked to keep them posted about my other interviews and not to accept any offers before connecting with them. So I suppose that’s a good sign. 

I told them I was just waiting to hear from one other company after an interview and an assessment, and no other interviews. I haven’t really been applying to other jobs for the last couple weeks, just was focused on preparing for the interviews with this one company. But I was wondering, maybe I should keep applying and keep getting interviews, so I can create a sense of urgency for them. They have over 500 applicants for that position so it’s not all set in stone. 

What do you guys think I can do at this point? I really wanna get the position."

I only have one school left, Northwestern, my third top, and it's not looking very likely. I've been feeling kind of down, as I go to a prestigious school with an very high amount of T20 acceptances, and as a result I've been feeling kind of inadequate. I did get into Northeastern though, and while I'm extremely grateful and this is by no means a knock against the school, it wasn't my top choice in terms of location, social scene, and campus fit. I'd hate to admit this but if I'm being completely honest I was also silently hoping for a more prestigious acceptance so I could impress my friends and family. It is admittedly shallow, but some validation would have been nice.

However, despite this, I've been trying to stave of depression by looking to the future and getting excited about what will probably turn out to be the school I'm end up attending. I already know quite a bit about the educational and internship opportunities (the main reason I applied), but am not confident that I would enjoy my time on campus. I'm more into small, tight-knit campuses. Any words of assurance would be appreciated."

I would prefer this role over the other ones due to knowing I will be doing more software development.

With the recent uncertainty of whether internships will continue or not and based off of this subreddit's general consensus that it is better to accept offers and renege later when getting better offers, I am not sure what I should do.

Should I just accept all offers just in case some may become cancelled? Or should I renege now due to the better offer I received?

Due to the offer from DOE I decided to withdraw from the smaller internship as I did not want to waste the company or my own time since I had recieved a offer that fit my career goals a little better.

Would it be appropriate to call the smaller company to see if the position has been filled and to see if I could be put back in the running for the position?
How could I go about making it seem like I'm not just going back to them because I have nowhere else to go? This was a position that I was really excited about and is in a field that I am very passionate about and I dont want them to feel like I am just looking for a place to work.

fm9izw,4,2020-03-21,Profile Review - Another Deferred,CreepyPrice5,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/fm9izw/profile_review_another_deferred/,"Hi everyone, junior in college looking at deferred programs and trying to figure out if I should even apply or just wait four years and apply then.

**Details**

Low-income white male majoring in Information Systems, minoring in Business Analytics at a T5 public school known for STEM (probably not very hard to guess lol). Small-time internship doing IT stuff my first summer, SWE internship at a big bank last summer, data analytics internship at a F500 tech company this summer.

ECs - have held three separate jobs the entirety of my college career after my first semester in order to pay for school. My tuition is fully covered, but housing/fees is still a ton of money. My parents do what they can, but most of it falls on me.

Student ambassador for a certain department of the school. Plan events for admitted/current students, four total throughout the year that each have 5,000+ guests - I won't expand on it here, but I have a fairly significant role and this takes up a large chunk of my time, so I talk about it a lot in interviews.

Volunteer serving as a mentor to freshman/new transfer students in a mandatory class that they’re required to take, also an ambassador for this program - write the curriculum, interview/train new students that want to be a mentor, etc. This is a bit of a smaller role, but still provides leadership and mentoring experience.

Also involved in two clubs but no leadership roles.

**Stats**

760 GMAT (Q48/V47)

3.82 GPA currently, going to try my damndest to keep it above a 3.8 as that seems to be a median for most schools that report deferred statistics.

**MBA Info**

Aiming for Yale Silver Scholars, Sloan, Booth, possibly Columbia or Stern. Don’t think I have any shot at Wharton/GSB/2+2 and not too interested in Darden.

Interested in moving into corporate sustainability/social impact and marrying that with analytics. I want to be able to make an impact on a business’ ability to do good while also proving with sufficient data that this is the direction companies are starting to head in order to attract a large, untapped market consisting mostly of Gen Z. Currently, my undergraduate degree gives me the analytics portion, but an MBA would give me the ability to actually understand and prove how that would impact different areas of a business. By having the reassurance that I’ll go to business school to learn those skills, I can jump into that field from the beginning versus going into tech for the money and then possibly never having the chance to pivot over. Coming from a low-income background, I think it's super important for this to happen, and hopefully my passion can come across in essays.

**Concerns**

School isn’t T1 material - not an Ivy/MIT/Stanford/etc., which is where the majority of the given spots seem to come from. Also, low Q compared to most applicants from these schools.

Degree is technically given from the business school, I know most deferred programs prefer STEM majors. Plus, ECs/internships aren’t great, which they need to be for these programs, and they don’t have a ton to do with my intended career path.

Not sure if my “why MBA” answer will be taken well at all. AdComs want a very compelling reason to do deferred over simply waiting a few years, and I’m not sure if they’ll see my answer as that, even if I think it is. Also, does it even make enough sense as an answer?

Thanks so much for reading. I’m basically wondering if it’s even worth the application fees/time spent writing essays, or if I’m simply not competitive enough and I should just wait a few years. I think I’ll be relying a ton on my GMAT and then I’ll have to hope they see my degree as STEM and not business. Honesty either way is much appreciated, and I’m sorry for the long post!"

I need help deciding between them. I am from California so I will have to pay in-state for UCLA. But, cost aside, where should I go? I am considering the following factors: internship opportunities, CS curriculum(very theoretical or practical/hands-on?), research opportunities, how feasible it is to double major(math), social life, and campus. I also definitely care about the weather(can't help- addicted to SoCal weather). I like UIUC but its weather is harshly cold and its location is very remote. So, it's mostly between Georgia Tech and UCLA. I know that finding research and internships at Georgia Tech is very easy and accessible. I don't know about UCLA tho. How easy is it finding internships in my freshman year at UCLA?

I don't care much about the rankings since all of them are pretty similar. I love Georgia Tech's CS Threads option. On the other hand, I love UCLA's campus and LA, in general(I don't wanna leave LA). I am interested in knowing more specific differences between them. If you can share your experience with either of them, it would be great.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!"

I am a master's student, graduating in May and I need to find a job asap so that I don't lose my Visa status.

My core interests are Full-Stack development, Data Science and Machine Learning. I have 2 internship experiences, but never worked for a company full-time before.

I'm worried that companies are going to stop hiring and I'd have to leave the United States with student loans that I won't be able to pay back on time earning in my own country.

I've been interviewing with a lot of companies and getting to the last rounds, only to have some tiny thing go wrong and losing the opportunity.

Please advise and if possible, tell me which companies are still planning to hire new grads, and if possible please refer me so that I have a chance to get an interview!

P.S. If you have any other advice of any kind: any technology I should learn or anything, please tell me!

Thank you! Hope everyone stays safe!


Edit: To the people making general statements, I know all that. IF YOU KNOW something more concrete, post here. IF your company is hiring, send me a DM or something and I'll apply."
fmcpav,28,2020-03-21,[O Levels] My Higher Chinese Journey,BlazingNewTrails,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fmcpav/o_levels_my_higher_chinese_journey/,"I'm posting this to encourage people who are having problems with Chinese/Higher Chinese. I encountered many obstacles as a private candidate, but managed to pull it through.

21 September 2018 was the day I said in impulse that I want to take A level Chinese after seeing my GPA drop from 3.46 to 3.32, because I really want to study linguistics in NTU (the 10th percentile GPA for linguistics was 3.53 at that time). I remember one of my friends (treat him as friend A, one of the 3 friends who helped me for HCL) helped me to check my results and said it was ""good"". After seeing it myself I concluded that it was really bad. By September 2018, I kinda lost interest in my polytechnic course. At that time, I was very dejected. I had 2 choices for Chinese if I really wanted to choose the linguistics path, A Level Chinese or O Level Higher Chinese. I chose O Level Higher Chinese, and bought the TYS. After looking at 2017's paper and realising how bad I was in Chinese, I decided to take a step back and buy Sec 1 HCL books to increase my vocabulary. I gradually bought sec 2 and 3 ones to get used to 病句改正. I started doing comprehension exercises in November 2018 with secondary 2B 习题精编. I worked very hard to increase my vocabulary and get used to 病句改正, as well as paper 2 formats. 

On 7 November 2018, I emailed NTU and asked if A Level Chinese/O Level HCL is required for polytechnic students to apply for linguistics. The next day, they replied that those are not necessary for application. I had studied for about a month, and was definitely not willing to let my efforts go to waste. Hence I decided to take Higher Chinese as a means of opening more routes. From then on, I became more serious about taking Higher Chinese and made some arrangements to study during weekends. My purpose of taking Higher Chinese gradually changed.

In late November 2018, I remember I stopped studying for JLPT N2 (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) since late September 2018 as I was too fixated on Chinese (wanting to study linguistics was probably one of the reasons I worked very hard in Chinese). I knew I needed to get back to Japanese as JLPT was drawing nearer, or else I won't do well (it happened lol, I screwed up on the reading portion).. there was a period of time in November 2018 when I was very stressed (needed to balance Japanese and Chinese, and had internship). I remember friend A told me that I needed to choose between Chinese and Japanese. JLPT was drawing nearer, and I cannot give up on it. I have studied for the N2 since December 2017 and I cannot just give up like that, as it would mean I will let my Japanese friends who helped me for N2 and N3 down. That was also a period of crossroads. After taking JLPT N2, I felt really regretful as I messed up. I decided to retake N2 someday, but for now I just want to focus on Chinese. Some time after JLPT, I helped a friend with English-Japanese translation for his immersion trip. While doing the translation, I was really touched as I managed to convey the messages of the exchange students to the homestay families in Japan. I then realised that translation is really the bridge between 2 cultures, and we are the bridge between 2 countries/cultures. I encountered several problems while translating as Japanese has a lot of 惯用语 but lesser words than English. English-Japanese translation is really challenging. I got some help from my Japanese friend while translating. From then on, I really want to be a translator, to bridge the gap between 2 cultures.

From mid-December 2018 to January 2019, I returned to studying Chinese, improving my vocabulary with secondary 3-4 语文应用 books, while doing a lot of practice (especially reading). I had 3 plans in mind at that time.

1) Take Higher Chinese in 2019
2) Take Higher Chinese in 2020 (more time to prepare)
3) Take Higher Chinese in 2019 (as experience) and 2020

I supposed taking Higher Chinese in 2019 was dangerous as I had no prior experience and I never studied it in secondary school. I got B3 for normal O Level Chinese (merit in oral) in 2014, making the climb steeper. Hence, I decided to take in 2019 to experience, and go all in in 2020. However, friend A told me not to do that, and advised me to just do my best in 2019. 

I met someone online (treat him as friend B, one of the 3 friends who helped me for HCL) in late January 2019. When he knew that I was planning to take Higher Chinese, he gave me a lot of tips and encouraged me to keep going.

February 2019 was the month which I sprained and fractured my left foot. I remember having to report to work with my swollen foot. That was the main reason I was downgraded from PES B1 to C9, and my enlistment was delayed (I was supposed to enlist on 11 May 2019 as I did not pass IPPT in school). That kinda gave me more time to study, especially oral (oral is in July, if I enlisted in May I would need to take leave to go for the exam in July. Missing a session in BMT also makes it hard to catch up). The fracture was somewhat a blessing in disguise. 

By February 2019, I was chatting frequently with friend B. He helped to check my language, and also taught me a lot of things. He gave me a lot of advice in HCL, and was willing to mentor me for HCL. He is one of the people I look up to. 

I bought summary writing books in February 2019 and started learning the format of summary writing. My internship also ended in mid-February 2019. February was a time of foundation strengthening and vocabulary building. 

In March 2019, I focused a lot on vocabulary. I also started writing articles on Chinese Wikipedia to improve my standard of writing. It gave me more exposure to writing and improved my writing ability. I supposed that will be helpful for my composition. Throughout March 2019, friend B helped me a lot in HCL. He also encouraged me to persevere on for HCL.

As time passed by, my purpose of taking Higher Chinese changed. I decided to HCL as I wanted to make up for my bad Chinese results in secondary school, at the same time giving me more opportunities for translation. I could also fulfill translation course requirements as I fell short of the requirements (translation became one of my university choices, other than linguistics). Chinese slowly became an interest, rather than a language.

April 2019 was the start of private O Level applications. At that time, I wasn't sure if I really should apply for Higher Chinese. Hence I started a thread on Reddit and asked for advice. Many people gave me advice about Higher Chinese, and one of them PM'ed me on Reddit. They said that they are also interested in translation. They took Higher Chinese in 2018. They (treat them as friend C, one of the 3 friends who helped me for HCL) gave me a lot of advice for HCL and shared their experiences as a candidate last year. I decided to apply for Higher Chinese in 2019. I still remembered friend A's advice, go all in in 2019, don't hesitate. At that time, I was kinda afraid that I will do poorly for HCL, so I wanted to take it as an experience. However, I thought to myself that since I'm already intending to take it in 2019, I ought to give in my 100%, and not just take it as an experience. Friend C also advised me to do my best and not think about retaking in 2020. I decided to go all in in 2019, and not think about retaking in 2020.

I bought a textbook for secondary 1-3 students in Malaysia in mid-April and found it really useful. I learnt many vocabulary pairs and 成语, at the same time improving my overall ability.

In late April 2019, I started learning more about 修辞手法 (with the Malaysian textbook), 论证方法 and 说明方法. Friend C helped me to adapt to the HCL syllabus. There was a period of time when I was fearful of the syllabus as I had no prior experience and a lot of things were new to me. My language ability was also not that good, hence I was afraid that I will do poorly for the exam. I still had 6-7 months to study for the exam. Since I submitted the application, I ought to do well. 

Friend B and C motivated me to continue to persevere on for HCL, they really helped and encouraged me a lot especially when I was discouraged. April and May 2019 were still a time of vocabulary building, I was still afraid to touch comprehension and composition as I was afraid I will not do well. According to my original plan, I was supposed to start comprehension in March 2019, but I was afraid to do so. I should have started comprehension earlier. I should stop being afraid of making mistakes. If I start comprehension late, it will slow down my progress. In May 2019, I started writing long essays and showed friend B and C. They gave me advice on how to improve my essays.

I focused more on comprehension and summary writing in June 2019, at the same time writing compositions. I mainly focused on 材料读后感, as I had little confidence in 记叙文 and 议论文. I used to write a lot of narrative essays in secondary school, but never wrote 材料读后感 (not even 1!) at all. Narrative essays used to be my forte in secondary school, but I don't think I can think of good plots now. I knew that I was taking some risk when I chose to focus on 材料读后感. Thankfully, friend C gave me plenty of study resources,including a 材料读后感 book. I read through the writing guides and sample essays to get used to the format. I wrote several 材料读后感 and showed friend B. He gave me some advice on improving the content and language. Anyway, I had trouble with time management as I exceeded the time limit every time I wrote essays (sometimes 2 hours). I still have 实用文 to complete in the 2 hours. If I fail to manage my time well and increase my writing speed, I will not do well for paper 1. I knew I still have a lot to improve, I was a bit discouraged when I saw my progress. I received my enlistment letter in June 2019 and it states that I was slated to enlist in August 2019. Seeing how little time I had left, I knew I had to be mentally prepared for more obstacles and challenges. By the way, I was still practising comprehension with secondary 2 assessment books, and friend C told me to buy secondary 4 ones instead. But I knew I was not ready for that. After completing secondary 2B 习题精编, I proceeded with secondary 3A 习题精编 (I bought this book a while ago). I was rather surprised when I saw the jump in difficulty from 2B to 3A. 

I started to practise paper 2 in July 2019. When I did my first paper 2, I ran out of time. I left summary writing blank, failing the paper in the end. I felt a bit discouraged, but I was determined to carry on. I then tried another paper 2. This one was slightly better than the previous one, I could complete the paper, but it was very rushed. Time management was not done very well, but I could see some improvement. I realised that time management is crucial, hence I made it a point to improve on time management. I practised another paper 2, and this time felt much better than the previous two. I still had a lot to improve, but I was relieved when I saw some improvement. 

I also practised some oral (口头报告/会话), as oral was in July 2019. This syllabus is totally new to me, as it was 看图说话 when I was in secondary school. I heard that oral was added into the HCL syllabus in 2016. Thankfully, friend C helped me to familiarise with the new syllabus and practised oral with me. If not I would be completely lost.

I remember some time before oral exam, I contemplated if I should look for my primary school Chinese tuition teacher. I knew that I should not always rely on my friends, as they are very busy. I have not met my tuition teacher for years, so I was not sure if that is appropriate. After some consideration, I decided to seek advice (and ask for tuition if possible) from my previous tuition teacher (have to admit that I did not like Chinese tuition homework when I was a primary school kid, 习字 and 听写 are what I hated in the past, but as I grew up I began to appreciate her efforts). She asked me why I decided to take Higher Chinese, so I explained to her my reasons. I also mentioned that I have been preparing for some time. I mentioned that I will be enlisting in August 2019, to which she asked how do I come for tuition when I'm in NS. I showed her the essays and paper 2 which I had done. I told her that I encountered problems during the preparation. She gave me a lot of advice for paper 1 and 2. For composition, read extensively to gain more knowledge. Her advice revolved around reading and exposure. Exposure myself to more sectors/areas so that I have more ideas for composition. Also, ensure that my 论据 is sufficient and avoid factual errors. She mentioned that teachers have many scripts to mark, hence they will not have time to look into details. The teachers look for the quality in content and language. As for comprehension, learn how model answers in top school papers are written (the format, way of expressing etc) and adjust my way of expressing accordingly. She said that if I master the way of answering the questions, my answers will be more complete. I followed her advice and found it beneficial. She affirmed my ability and told me that I will be fine for Higher Chinese without tuition. She told me to write another essay and show her, but I got a bit lazy and I was too fixated with a Chinese debate show which my friend recommended. Spent my free time watching the debate show instead aww. I felt a bit bad that I spent more time watching shows than practising composition.

On the actual oral exam day, I was rather nervous, partially because I was the only private candidate. I did not have a good sleep the previous night. The inviligator asked me if I wanted to go first, but I chose not to as I wanted more time to prepare. He told me that I would be the last to go if I let other students go first. I was fine with that, as I could take my time to prepare. I looked through the 成语, 谚语 and 格言 in my Malaysian book, and the 材料读后感 book which my friend gave me, and thought of what to use during the exam. A lot of thoughts went through my mind when I was in the waiting room. What if I don't do well? Will it affect my paper 1 and 2? I knew that my paper 1 and 2 were not good. When it was my time to go, I took a deep breath. I remember expecting the topic to be fake news or digital defence, but when I saw the topic (你认为我们应该保留乌敏岛的自然风貌吗), I was a bit surprised. I was not very confident about this topic, partially because I haven't been to Pulau Ubin for a long time. The last time I went to Pulau Ubin was a NPCC camp in secondary school. Hence, I am not very familiar with the oral topic. Nevertheless, I decided to make do with what I had, taking notes while watching the video. 10 minutes of preparation was up, and it was my time to go. 口头报告 was still okay, but when I was about to conclude my report, the teacher stopped me, saying that 2 minutes is up. Conversation started, but it did not go well. I was very nervous, as such I stuttered a lot. I also paused for a while trying to collect my thoughts. I remember one of the questions the teacher asked: How should we protect the 野生动物 in Pulau Ubin? I gave a pretty nonsensical answer (build a farm) as I was very nervous and my mind was blank at that time. After that, the teacher asked me if I had anything else to elaborate. I thought this was the time to 力挽狂澜 (turn the tables) and summarised my previous points while adding some new content. I told my friends my experience after the exam, and said that I screwed up. I was kinda disappointed after the exam. Friend C told me to turn the disappointment into motivation and strength, and to improve on my writing ability to do well for the remaining papers.

By August 2019, I was a bit behind plan. While I had exposure to 材料读后感 and paper 2, I still needed to learn the formats of 实用文. 博客 and 论坛 were new to me, so I decided to buy a book for that. My 材料读后感 was not great, as I exceeded the time limit for my essays. Paper 2 was still okay.

In August 2019, I practised comprehension, 概述 and 评述 with the Malaysian book I bought in April. I made it a goal to complete those exercises before enlistment. I knew that I won't have a lot of time to study once I enlist. 4 days before enlistment, I went to Popular and bought a guide book for 实用文. I brought it with me during enlistment, hoping for some study time in BMT. My bunk environment was not really productive for studying (PES C BMT military training phase is at Kranji Camp), as there are only two tables. Hence, I decided to just read my 实用文 guide and more editorials online. Thankfully, I had quite a lot of free time during the military training phase of BMT. Hence I could do some summary writing practice. There were certainly many distractions in BMT. There were times I felt too tired to study, and I should bond more with my bunkmates too. I was posted to AFTC (Air Force Training Command) for my vocational training phase of BMT. I did not have a lot of free time in AFTC, as compared to Kranji Camp. Even so, I tried to study whenever I could at night. Thankfully, my bunk at AFTC has tables, so I could study at night. I did summary writing exercises from a summary writing book and comprehension exercises from secondary 4A 习题精编 whenever I could (I did not finish 3A, decided to jump to 4A so that I will be more prepared for the real exam). I also revised during weekends. I managed to complete the 4A book just before the vocational training phase of BMT ended). I decided to buy sec 4B 习题精编 for extra practice (asked Friend A and B for advice before buying, they said that extra practice is good too, only did one exercise though aww). Then came POP and bloc leave in October 2019. I knew that time was running out (the real exam is on 6 November). When bloc leave started, I only had 2.5 weeks left.

I went to Melaka when bloc leave started and hanged out with my BMT mates the day after I returned from Melaka. I did not really revise much on those days. On 24 October 2019 (Thursday), I decided to write a 材料读后感 as I had not written any for about 3 months. I was rather discouraged after writing it as I exceeded the time limit again... It was about 8.20pm when I finished the essay, I decided to cycle to look for my primary school Chinese tuition teacher. I actually still remembered the deal from 3 months ago. But when I reached the place, I realised that she had left. I showed friend A and C the essay which I had written, and asked them for their opinion. Friend C said that my content was okay, but there were structural errors. Friend A told me to read the essay again, and try to see if I made any grammatical error. I was kinda dejected that I was still making such errors at this point of time. I only had 1.5 weeks left, and I could not afford such errors at this point of time. Seeing how underprepared I was, I thought to myself, what if I don't do well this year, would I need to retake... I had some fear in my heart too. I wrote another essay and showed friend C, and they commented that it was better than the previous one in terms of structure.

About a week before the exam, I fell very sick (down with flu, sore throat and cough). I continued to practise 实用文 despite the fact that I was sick, as that is one thing which I had neglected (despite reading guide books and knowing the format). Despite being sick, I went back to camp. But I was not able to study Chinese as I was lethargic and feeling very unwell. I decided to sleep at 8.30pm, hoping to recover soon so that I can study. The flu lasted for a few days. I mostly recovered when I returned home on the weekend. But there was little time left. 4 days left before the actual exam... When I returned to camp on the Monday (4 November), I practised a paper 2, as a confidence bolster before the real exam. I have not done any timed paper 2 for a while now, so I decided to do one. I knew that there was nothing much I can do now, as there were only 2 days left. The paper went okay, I managed to complete the paper on time. On the day before the exam, there was a social cohesion with my vocational mates. I remember playing bowling, and seeing how I started with 8, 9 and strike but ended with 5 and 6, I was afraid that my paper the next day will go the same way. My vocation course coordinator allowed me to go home after the cohesion and take half day leave the next day. I went home and did my final preparation (looked through 修辞手法, 论证方法, 说明方法, 描写方法 and 实用文 format again). I did not want to go intense, so I watched a Chinese show before revising the essentials. I slept around 10+ and woke up around 6.15am the next day. 

It is finally the day of the exam. The fated 6 November has come. I walked to the exam site and just used my phone before the exam. I did not want to give myself too much stress. I remember telling my friends that I was quite nervous. Then paper 1 started. I started with the 论坛/博客 question, I remember it was about water conservation. While writing the situational writing, my mind blanked out. I could not think of how to continue my essay. Seeing that I was 30 minutes into the paper, I was kinda worried. I took a deep breath and continued writing. When I was 35 minutes in, I realised that I better start writing my comprehension as I may run out of time. I ended my situational writing hurriedly and abruptly (it was not very good). I jumped to composition 40 minutes into the paper. Realising that I only had 1 hour and 20 minutes left, I thought to myself, I better write quickly. As I was writing my essay, I realised that time was running out. Hence I wrote as fast as I could. When I reached the conclusion, I only had 3 minutes left. I rushed to write my conclusion (even made a mistake at the conclusion, wrote 综 as 绘 as I was in a rush). Time was up, and I did not have time to read my essay. Fingers crossed, hoping that the essay will be fine. I managed to complete both essays just on time, but did not have time to read through them. Hence I was kinda worried. I decided to just move on, as paper 2 is equally important. Paper 2 started, it was pretty okay at the beginning. Cloze passage and sentence correction felt okay, I then proceeded with the first comprehension passage. But because I was kinda afraid that I made errors in cloze passage and sentence correction, I went to look at it again. I started doing the second comprehension passage about 35 minutes into the paper (about 70 minutes left). The second comprehension passage took me some time. When I saw that I was running out of time, I left the last question of the second passage incomplete, hoping to come back later when I finish the third passage and summary writing. The third passage felt rushed (had about 25-30 minutes left). I completed the first four questions in the third passage hurriedly, and jumped to summary writing. When I reached summary writing, I only had 5 minutes left. I picked out the key points and wrote my summary hurriedly. Did not know if I exceeded 80 words, but I knew I had enough. Did not have time to indicate the number of words (while I was counting the invigilator said time's up).. Managed to complete the paper (with the exception of the incomplete question and failure to indicate the number of words for summary writing). Both paper 1 and 2 felt rushed, I completed both papers just on time. Did not know how I did for paper 1, as it felt very rushed. As for paper 2, when I knew I got full marks for cloze passage and the three comprehension MCQ questions, I felt relieved that I secured 16 marks in paper 2. But comprehension was not that great. When I calculated my total score, I predicted that I would get around B3/B4 for the entire exam. My initial target was A2, hence I was not sure if I could hit the target. I knew the paper was over, and my preparation journey has ended. I encountered many obstacles, but was glad that it is over. I decided to move on and wait for the results.

Overall, the vocabulary building throughout the preparation helped a lot in cloze passage and composition. I remember getting 2/5 for my first Higher Chinese cloze passage. I knew that I had to work hard on vocabulary if I wanted to do well. My language foundation was not good, I kinda 得过且过 and neglected Chinese in secondary school. I knew it was never too late to improve, I am glad that I made the impulsive decision back in September 2018. I could improve on my Chinese for translation. Throughout the preparation, I did extensive reading and built my vocabulary base. I somewhat relied on general knowledge for content, but I also relied on practice to get used to the format. There were certainly flaws in my strategy too. I did not practise enough composition, and this explains why my composition was really rushed. Comprehension was still okay, I got plenty of practice from various books (secondary 2B/3A/4A 习题精编 and the Malaysian book). If I could reconstruct my strategy, I would have done more vocabulary application, by writing more essays so that I use and apply what I have learnt. I could also have reviewed my composition and read more sample essays/editorials to see what I lack. I should also practise more timed paper 1 and 2, so that the real exam would not be so rushed. It is good to review what I have done correctly and wrongly, and improve from here. The exam preparation journey has ended, but the language learning journey has not. I know I have a lot to improve, so I will continue to work hard from here. It has been a tough journey. I am grateful to my friends who supported and helped me throughout the journey. 

Fast forward to results day, I was very worried and nervous. I was not sure what my preparation and hard work will lead to. When I opened the website and checked my results, it showed... A2!!! With a merit in oral. I was overjoyed and relieved that my hard work paid off! It was really a miracle, I did not expect it all. It was certainly not just my hard work, my friends who helped me deserve the biggest credit. My primary school Chinese tuition teacher has some credit for this too. I knew very well that I would not have done it without their help and support. This is only the beginning, I will work hard to improve my Chinese ability.

I hope that this post will encourage and motivate you to strive for the better. If you encounter obstacles, know that there are people in front of you who have encountered and overcome obstacles. If the people in front of you could do it, I believe you can do it too! We are waiting for you at the finish line!

TLDR: I am a private candidate who took Higher Chinese in 2019. I made an impulsive decision to take Higher Chinese for NTU linguistics in September 2018 when I saw my GPA drop from 3.46 to 3.32. However, the purpose of taking the exam changed over time and I began to develop an interest in Chinese. I encountered many obstacles during the preparation, but managed to pull it through in the end. The biggest credit goes to the 3 friends who helped me."

You've heard about [Nonna Federov](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/exek28/audio_logs/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), her rampage, her bloodlust and how she became the serial killer that she's known as today. Hopefully you haven't met with her yet in her angry state or anybody else, commit that to memory and don't lose hope.

Nothing major has happened since the first audio log apart from Aleksi claiming that he was growing scales or something like that. Knowing Aleksi to be a chronic drunk we all laughed, yet I couldn't shake off a feeling of dread that he was telling the truth so I sent him off to be examined a day ago and now I'm just waiting for both the report and Aleksi to come back...

A bit about Aleksi in case if he does turn out to be a lizard man like Mark Zuckerberg and escapes, I'd prefer to help in any way I see fit to ensure hell doesn't break loose and people don't get hurt.

He doesn't look too strong, don't let that fool you as he can easily knock a 200 pound guy like me over. He looks like any typical Russian man and has a horrible scar across his cheek from when he angered Federov by scamming her out of one of her knives and she in turn slashed him with the same knife. He gets along with mostly everybody except Digger and Fernando, he and Federov have a rocky friendship that consistsof one scamming the other while the other hurts the scammer. It works good enough I guess.

""Tell me the story again, Rodney!"" He'd say to me after I had finished telling him stories about what I had survived through, he was captivated in the same manner that a small child would be when recieving a new toy. Guess it can't be helped since he's somewhat autistic from what I've heard, or was it trauma or even brain damage? For the life of me I can't remember and that specific piece of information was unintentionally destroyed when the intern spilled his coffee on the paper.

One day I decided to ask him about his life after me and a few of my co-workers shared stories and memories of the good times and bad. He became unexpectedly violent and tried to stab me, thank God that I was strong enough to restrain him and the fact that Fernando was carrying sedatives to somebody at the time that we both were unscathed. It was there that I decided to research into detail about his past since his papers were quite vague.

His full name is Aleksi Romanov, born to a single mother, his father ditched on the mother during pregnancy and due to the bills and things that needed to be paid off, Aleksi lived the life of poverty. God bless his poor mother's soul as she worked day and night to provide for her only son and still had her money taken from her by the government and robbers, her son one day was found beaten senseless in an alleyway, and later her arm was taken off by somebody's stupid dog.

Now remember how Federov was a murderer? Aleksi might as well be one because his specialty is scamming people out of all their money or in some cases, their free will. Taking all their money to the point where they became homeless, insane, suicidal, or a combination of the three due to suspected mind control, it's not this pussy ass MK Ultra shit either from what I've seen and heard, it's more like some telepathic connection that he uses.

Banned from all the casinos in the United States and not willing to step foot in one again, he started gambling with people from a very young age as a way to help his mother pay for basic provisions since she couldn't work as well due to the dog incident
After he got tired of that he moved on to doing those stupid ""Win a free PS4 just complete this survey!"" scams that pop up on the internet, going from cheap thrills to stealing credit card information in under three years.

Not that bad, right? He started to mind control people somehow after his scam job was overturned by who knows what. Or at least that's what I was told, apparently he hypnotized (can you call it that? Is this the right term??) his victims to hand over all their cash, cards, and assets to him. Those same victims were usually found dead months later with the four survivors suffering serious trauma and injuries. Hell, I had a hard time getting the only one capable of talking to actually talk, two of them are vegetables, and the third right now has been in a coma for about ten months with no sign of returning.

I don't know what to believe anymore after my search, everything seems strange, the mind control, the scamming, the suicides. Even his official papers seem off now that I'm looking at them closely after this, way too many gaps, not even the most mysterious person here has this many gaps. HR must've decided to accept him by just sticking a thermometer in his mouth and seeing if he has an average body temperature, or maybe he mind controlled his way in here too. And of course they stuck him with me. Not that It's bad, he's certainly better than the previous guy and he's way more predictable than Fernando.

I find it hard to believe that a happy-go-lucky guy such as Aleksi Romanov did all that damage but I'm not ignoring such blatant evidence, especially after the sudden attack he pulled off against me. If you are to attack Aleksi, use a gun, the longer the range the better. Don't even think about doing hand to hand combat with him, espicially while he's drunk. Don't think about playing any games with him either as that's how I suspect he gets a hold of his victims, kind of like that one guy from My Hero Academia, by asking questions. I survived but only through sheer luck and sedatives so I'll place those along with everything you need to defend yourself against everybody in the same crate the tapes are going in.

Good luck and God bless. End tape."

2. What are the research opportunities like for CE majors? I've heard from people that if you have an interest in what a professor is researching, to simply approach them and inquire about taking part in research. At the moment, I'm not sure what area of CE I'm interested in in, but I definitely want to do research of some kind. Do most CE freshmen do research or is it done in later years?
3. How are the courses? I understand that CE is a balance between EE and CS and mainly teaches computer hardware. Can someone offer more detail on this and what the courses mainly cover?
4. How difficult are the courses in general? I'm prepared to work for it but I'm wondering what to expect.

One is a Software Developer for a small company that happens to provide software for an auto manufacturer and the other two are not true software developer roles but more so of sysadmin (Making scripts for RHEL servers and maintenance) at a large defense company and shipping . I am currently in a situation where I have accepted the two offers, however, I have recently received an offer for the software developer internship role and have until next week to accept. I would prefer this role over the other ones due to knowing I will be doing more software development.

With the recent uncertainty of whether internships will continue or not and based off of this subreddit's general consensus that it is better to accept offers and renege later when getting better offers, I am not sure what I should do.

Another thing I would like to mention is that both the sysadmin positions are from big names in defense and shipping services. The software developer role is at a small company with not much recognition.

Would the name recognition matter if I am aiming for perhaps Big N for future internships? Or would having an actual software developer role at the smaller company give me greater benefit due to experiencing actual software development in contrast to sysadmin?

Should I just accept all offers just in case some may become cancelled? Or should I renege now due to the better offer I received?

**essays:** 6-8/10 (i think i'm a pretty strong writer but i don't have a ""story"" or anything to write about that actually matters so)

\~ what i'm looking for \~

**location**: very urban or suburban and near a large city/metropolitan hub (for reference, i adored columbia's location right in the middle of nyc, georgetown's surrounding city and proximity to dc, and stanford's location in palo alto and bay area). so either in the middle of a big city or located in a mid-size city in or near an urban hub. i don't intend to apply to any rural schools. edit: i'd prefer northeast/new england, mid atlantic, or west coast, but feel free to suggest others!

**campus:** self-contained self-contained self-contained! i didn't vibe with gwu and upenn blending into their cities and i loved columbia's self-contained/distinct campus. i also want a larger campus that's very much a ""traditional college campus"", if that makes sense?

**size:** mid-size to large? so i'm veering away from LACs bc of their small size. but really if it's a smaller school that feels large that's okay too. i really don't care abt lecture vs seminar classes, anything works

**intended major:** i kinda want to go into astrophysics, physics, and/or math - i'd want schools that are really strong in those fields and potentially ones w/ interesting majors that combine those? but i also want to minor in english or creative writing, so i really want a robust humanities program.

**social life:** i want there to . be a social life? like i'm fine w/ the ""fun goes to die"" environment of uchicago but i really want there to be an engaged student body w/ various clubs and maybeee some hype over sports games and stuff? like this isn't as major as the other stuff but i want it to be rly easy to meet new people bc honestly the main thing i'm looking forward to in college is making new friends and having fun, even amidst a stressful/pressurized environment (which i don't mind). also i know i go to a catholic school rn but i really don't want to go to a religious college.

**career stuff:** this ties in to an urban environment, but i want there to be a lot of scope for internships. AND UNDERGRAD RESEARCH! that's a big one, i want a school where a lot of undergrads can do research w/ professors.

**school's i'm currently considering:** columbia (lmfao), brown (lmfao), uc berkeley (in-state but lmfao), ucla (in-state but lmfao), carnegie mellon, umich, johns hopkins, usc, uchicago, wash u in st louis, uwash, univ of rochester,  maybe tufts, various other uc's of course (probably uscd and a few more)

as you can tell, all of those schools are HUGE reaches esp considering my shitty extracurriculars so i'd rly appreciate more realistic/match/safety schools. thank you so much!!"

fmpapf,246,2020-03-21,COVID-19 impact on consulting,QiuYiDio,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/fmpapf/covid19_impact_on_consulting/,"[Click here to return to the /r/consulting Coronavirus megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/fccbr3/coronavirus_megathread/)

-----------

My personal reflections 

*(Updated: 3/21/2020)*

We are in unprecedented territory for many consulting firms and our clients.  What happens when an otherwise normal business world comes to a sudden, screeching halt within 2 weeks?

There is no crystal ball for how the economy will fare, other than to say there will be significant challenges.  Multiple different organizations, including consulting firms like [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/covid-19-implications-for-business), [Bain](https://www.bain.com/insights/tracking-the-global-impact-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-snap-chart/), and [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2020/March/COVID-19-Primer.pdf) have put out scenarios that posit recovery being anywhere from a quarter to over a year away.  That's a lot of uncertainty.

A lot of the concern posted here, and rightly so, has been on what will happen to us.  I think the closest analog for a worst case scenario (from a business standpoint) is the Great Recession of 2008.  Based on conversations with leaders at my firm as well as peers at other major firms, there is a wide range of belief in whether or not 2008 will repeat itself.  Given this uncertainty, most firms have not yet taken drastic measures.  

That said, I am positive all major consulting firms are planning and bracing for a notable contraction in overall business.  While some industries may still be faring okay or potentially recover more quickly, it is highly unlikely they will make up for the full sectors that have been devastated.  How far we’ve come since just a few weeks ago. 

With that preamble, and another emphasis on today’s ongoing uncertainty, here's what I recall from 2008 in management consulting...

**New offerees**

During the near-immediate response to the Great Recession, firms basically took three approaches:

a) Honor offers, but provide stipends for deferrals for 6-12 months

b) Honor offers, and help place in secondments

c) Rescind offers

Most large management consulting firms took approach a), understanding that there would be natural attrition over the x months.  I saw primarily MBB firms also offer b).  I saw c) happen with some Big4s who had (at the time) very small management consulting practices, as well as with boutiques, particularly those who were heavily tied to financial services. 

Today, at my firm, there has been zero consideration of rescinding offers.  There had been some speculation on offering deferrals, but the broad sense is that it is too early to make such a decision.  From what I've been hearing at other firms, this seems to be a consistent trend.  Multiple firms have already sent out communications indicating they are honoring offers. 

Unfortunately it does sound like some smaller boutiques, particularly those who are overexposed to affected industries and lack the cash reserves of larger firms, have had to defer or rescind offers.  

**Internships**

During the Great Recession, internships for large consultancies were honored across the board.  Interns are cheap, they're temporary, and you absolutely need to maintain the near- and long-term talent pipeline for when things start to rebound.  You can plug interns onto any ongoing team without much problem anyway.  There was more variation with smaller firms, once again, particularly those who focused on financial services.

Today, at my firm, we're thinking about contingencies to ensure good internship experience (e.g., creating a fun remote working environment, alternatives to a summer retreat).  But never once has the topic of cancellation been mentioned, nor would I expect it to.  

As above, multiple firms have already sent out communications indicating they are honoring offers.  Unfortunately, as above, some smaller firms have had to take more drastic measures.

**Prospective candidates**

During the Great Recession, hiring continued for most major firms but was, as expected, more pinched and focused.  After all, we all continued to see demand - we were not nearly as hard hit as banks and we needed to maintain the talent pipeline.  For my firm, the total impact was most obvious on the class immediately following the crisis (Co2009), improved for the class after that (Co2010), and returned to normal after that (Co2011).  It's important to note there was school by school differences.  For my firm, we overindexed on the top schools and tried to maintain strong classes from them; however, semi-targets and experienced channels disproportionately bore the brunt of the reduction in need.  For schools where we may have otherwise hired 2-3 people in a good year, we just didn't see the ROI in dedicating meaningful recruiting resources.

Today, given the uncertainty, it's hard to say how recruiting will be in the fall.  After all, it's asking the question of ""what will staffing needs be like in Summer / Fall 2021?""  That's over a year away - there's just too much unknown and we also don't need to make any decisions right now.  So we largely haven't.

This should be obvious, but *right this moment* is not the time to apply to consulting firms at the entry level. Before the world was aware of how disruptive the virus would be, consulting firms had largely already finished giving out full-time offers to both former summer interns and new candidates.  They planned for a BAU world or perhaps a slight dip.  Absolutely no one planned for the situation we are in now.  As a result, the firms will all have much larger incoming classes than what will be needed in the months ahead.  There will almost certainly be very low need for more entry level staff.

That said, there are opportunities for those who have meaningful experience and can contribute to advising senior clients through COVID-19 - this may include areas like crisis management, epidemiology, and organization transformation, among others.

**Existing staff**

During the Great Recession, I had less visibility into what other firms did on this topic (my insights above came from being heavily involved in recruiting).  But observations from my firm at that time period include:

a) More focus on knowledge development and research as client work dwindled

b) Zero to marginal compensation increases

c) Raising of the bar on up-or-out, with disproportionate impact on Senior Manager and Partner levels (as opposed to junior staff and Senior Partners)

d) Very strong push to consider education leave and secondments

I will note that there is little incentive for the 'slash-and-burn' approach that other industries may take in time of recession.  Consulting firms are only worth as much as the talent they have.  As such, there are many business reasons to keep talent even during a downturn. That includes:

- The economy has and always will bounce back - you need to have talent ready to capitalize when it does
- Developing people is very expensive - if you let them go, it will take substantial time to rebuild from recruiting to training to experience
- How we treat our people is critical to our future business - an unhappy alumnus isn’t going to buy work after all, and they're often the lifeblood of future work
- Our brand is critical to attracting talent - no one wants to be known as the firm that just slashes and burns at the first sign of uncertainty
- Most of us are private, so there's no Street pressure

fmq18m,6,2020-03-21,Help! I can’t decide where to go,Children-Taste-Good,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fmq18m/help_i_cant_decide_where_to_go/,"I’m in the fortunate position of being able to decide between two great options, but am in need of A2C’s help. 

First of all, my intention is to go into the engineering field.

Second of all, I’m choosing between Virginia Tech engineering and William and Mary (I would get a degree in physics, possibly double majoring with math, and then go to grad school for an engineering degree).

Virginia Tech

Pros
Amazing engineering program (ranked 13th in the nation for undergrad engineering)
A lot of investment into engineering (I think it’s ~$250m a year, but don’t quote me on that)
Students love it (I swear it’s like a cult)
A lot of options that come from a large student body (meaning that finding my own niche is likely)
Great career fair and connections to help find an employer or internships
Strong alumni network
Beautiful campus
Hecka good dining
Cheapest option so far (not by much)

Cons
Could be too big
Campus culture (just from what I’ve seen and heard, although I haven’t been able to visit because of Corona)
Don’t know many people going there, and the people I do know that are going or have gone don’t seem to be the type of people I would be close friends with

William and Mary 

Pros
Love the architecture and campus
When I visited I loved the vibe and people
Could definitely see myself there
Tight-knit community
I love the size (they also have excellent resources for a smaller school)
The physics department is underrated and the school is giving it a lot more resources now (a student also said that it’s much easier to get research opportunities in physics, even as a freshman)
They have a degree called engineering physics and design, which would make it easier to get into a grad school and better prepare me for engineering (also there are benefits to having more of a physics background)
They give a lot of room to explore academics and interests
Love the town
I like some of the people I know that are going
They have a nice farmers market
I just have a general feeling that I’d fit in better there and have a better college experience

Cons
Possibly more expensive (I don’t know what aid I’ll be offered yet)
Some of the people I know that are going aren’t the type of people I would get along with very well (granted, they make a small part of the incoming class, but based on the amount of people I know going, it’s a little worrying)
(Possibly?) Not enough diversity in the student body (in terms of ideas brought into the school, which I admittedly am in the majority, but part of the point of college is to gain perspective and have your ideals challenged)
Their food and dorms are known to be mediocre, which I admittedly don’t care about as much

So I obviously have put more thought into W&amp;M, seeing that I visited it and absolutely loved it. I haven’t visited VT because their accepted students day was cancelled from Corona. Also, going into engineering from physics DOES happen (which is more likely at W&amp;M because they have an engineering physics and design degree, and having a physics background gives a different pool of knowledge that can be helpful), and I already intend to go to grad school, so it doesn’t matter as much if I start in engineering, although VT could give me more options. The difference in cost is also not a make-or-break situation. Both are affordable. It’s just another part of my decision.

TL;DR - need help deciding between Virginia Tech and William and Mary. I would do engineering at VT and engineering physics and design (with a possible double major in something like math) at W&amp;M. I would go on to grad school for engineering from both.

Thanks for any input and stay safe!"

During summer, I worked with a great team of developers where code quality was highly valued and had the chance to go through the biblical book *Clean Code*. I learned many Agile principles which have affected the way I code immensely. I have also managed to get very good at googling and debugging code so that fixing my work takes much less time than usual. Right now, however, I want to go from being good at coding to being great at it. I define a great software engineer as someone who could easily become the CTO of a newly-founded company where he/she could build a product from scratch which does not fall apart as it grows, is as efficient as it could get, can be modified very easily, and legible as a poem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently enrolled in a very challenging DS/Algos class and will take another challenging Systems/Machine Organization class next semester. These should teach me some important skills I think. I won't be doing software engineering internship next summer (Deep Learning research which is less coding more theory) but want to use my free time to improve somehow. So, what are the things that I need to learn to go from being a good SE to a great one (e.g. some book, learn functional programming, leetcode, etc.)"

1. There's a state of emergency in 10 states in the us(NY, Cali, Florida, Massachusetts) basically all my admits.

2. Harvard, MIT, Amherst College et al have asked their students to not return after spring break and opt for online classes.

3. Our admissions might be deferred to spring in the WORST case but that's not ideal since spring cycles are not conducive to internships.

4. If our admits are deferred till next fall, basically we waste a year and no one's getting younger. 

5. Even if we somehow land there this fall, there's the possibility of a global economic meltdown which basically means struggle at getting internships.

6. Visa slots (for India atleast) are closed until October as of now and we ideally need to attend visa interviews by June to attend Fall 2020. So how is this going to work out for us?

fmudky,7,2020-03-22,2nd year CS University transfer with no internship lined up. How do I become competitive for 3rd year internships?,JerryWestJr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fmudky/2nd_year_cs_university_transfer_with_no/,"Hey guys, 

For some context, I studied Chemical Engineering at my local community college for two years before transferring to UVA's engineering school. I decided to switch right after transferring even though it would take an extra 1-2 semesters to graduate. It was a huge transition as I had relatively no programming experience, yet the university decided to take my trivial ""programming for engineers"" as transfer credit. I was tossed into the 2nd semester Java Software Development class where everyone already had at least a semester of programming experience. On top of the harder schedule, I suffered from an onset of severe insomnia for most of the semester. I compensated gruelingly by studying 10 hours+ a day. Unfortunately, I didn't fully recover until a month ago. I completely missed out on the opportunity to pursue extracurriculars, personal projects, and internships. I've been applying to internships for a couple weeks now and I haven't had much luck. I've heard a lot that it isn't the end of the world not having a 2nd year internship, however I'm worried that it'll make me a far less competitive applicant for when I apply for 3rd year internships. After this semester I'll only have 24 credits of university coursework, and I'm worried that if I don't take summer classes then 3rd year internships will be hesitant in considering me as a viable candidate. 

 My current resume is pretty much as follows:

\- 3.9 Univ gpa, 4.0 cc gpa

\- Relevant courses: Data Structures and Program Representation, Software Development Methods

\- Class projects in C++, Java, and Python

Here are my questions:

1) How do I become a much more competitive applicant for 3rd year internships over the summer? 

2) I have two alternative summer plans: (i) Take Algorithms and Web Application Development at my University and pursue personal projects. (ii) If I get an internship, I'll pursue the internship instead even though this means I'll only have 24 credits going into my fall semester

3) Should I mention that I'm a CC transfer and/or university credit amount on my resume? I've been getting a lot of mixed answers about this.

4) Are there specific skills, classes, languages, and/or projects that will make me stand out really well as an applicant?

5) Is pursuing a research position a sufficient alternative to an internship as far as experience? 

6) In the case where I'm not able to find an internship for this summer, what are the best alternatives for my situation? 

Thanks in advance!"
fmufe5,0,2020-03-22,How do I leverage my other engineering degree?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fmufe5/how_do_i_leverage_my_other_engineering_degree/,"Going to graduate in December as a Material Science Engineer with co-op, research and the whole 9 yards. 

But my friends in cs have been telling me I’d be a great computer science major because I helped them out a couple times with some of their projects. I have skills from just working on python and Matlab for data analysis stuff. My field seems to be more and more into simulations. 

It got me thinking and I looked at the salary differences between my major and that and it seems like I could be making 20-30k more and if I’m going to code. Why not go all the way?

So how should I go about this? 

I thought about data analytics but I basically make the same and I already know a lot from just working on python projects so I thought go all in with software dev. 

Google said the quickest is to go learn front end and react native. 

I have a MacBook and this one video on YouTube said swift is good. 


What would be the best pivot? I feel like going into mobile development would be a random twist and would just confuse recruiters. 


I graduate in December and have a manufacturing internship so this would be learning on the side. 

The current situation of the world just gave me a lot of free time."
fmun05,2,2020-03-22,Is it worth it to even try for a tough school? [Discussion],Nerd1a4i,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fmun05/is_it_worth_it_to_even_try_for_a_tough_school/,"Hear me out.

I feel like I'm a decent student - I have one B so far in Physics C last semester, and I'm hauling my grades up for this semester (cough Physics C cough) but I think I can achieve all A's this semester, and I've had all A's prior to this year. I took 2 AP's last year, and I'm taking 6 this year. I've done an internship in engineering. Entered a science fair, results come Tuesday. I feel like I have good EC's, etc, etc. I get my SAT results in a week-ish, but I do feel like I did fairly well. Yada yada, this isn't a chance me, hopefully you understand my situation.

But here's the thing: when I look at colleges I might apply to next year, I don't know if it's even worth it to put myself through all that stress for a school that'll just plunge me into debt. (I will likely qualify for little to no financial aid, my parents will be contributing some but not significantly, and I have received no scholarship money so far - not for lack of trying.) Sure, Stanford seems like it'd be amazing, but Iowa State has a good engineering program, is in a location I'd like going to college at, and has such a high acceptance rate I see no way that I'd get rejected (if I get rejected there, then I have a whole other set of problems). Plus, it has a cheaper level of tuition. They even have a program where they basically chance you, and can change that into an acceptance, over the summer (no strings attached; it's called the CAP program).

With this in mind, how does it make sense for me to apply to Stanford or another big name school? It'll just add stress and lead to (I feel like) an almost definite rejection (and it costs money to apply!) when I could just start the school year feeling confident of where I am going. I am planning on doing the CAP program for Iowa State regardless, but I'm questioning whether it's even worth it to try for Stanford (I keep using Stanford throughout this, but hopefully it's clear it's one of several 'reach schools' that'd be cool to go to for me).

So, is it worth it?"

Currently, I am a junior at a competitive high school. So far, I have only applied to 3 programs. I have already been rejected by one, and the decision for another one comes out in two weeks. I don't really want to do the last one I applied to, but I just applied to it because my parents made me. I am interested in science and CS, but I don't know where else to apply. A lot of applications were already due a while back since it's late March now, and I don't know what to do. I'm looking to do competitive programs or internships (or just something useful over the summer) that are very enriching to improve my knowledge in STEM and will boost my college application. I have thought about emailing professors, but my résumé is not impressive, as I have no prior experience in science research. However, I am passionate about science research. Besides that, I don't have an idea of what to do, and my biggest fear is not getting accepted into any program. Any suggestions for good programs or other opportunities over the summer? Thanks!"

Hope everyone’s having a great day. I’m a junior in high school and I’m seriously considering computer science. I’ve loved programming since I was a kid and I learnt C++ for 2 years in school. I'll probably do computer internship at a company this summer. I have some questions for CS Majors, people who’ve been in the field a while, or people who just love programming.

1. I’m looking at Purdue, UMD, UCB, UC Davis for undergrad. I’m an international student. Realistically, what SAT scores, extra curriculars, programming experience etc., would I require to be considered?
2. The tuition in Canadian universities is considerably lower. But is the demand and pay for CS majors just as high in Canada as it is in America?
3. Will it be difficult for me to get a job after graduation considering I’m an International student? The demand and pay for CS in my country is next to nothing and I will consider America only if my chances of getting a job are high.
4. How difficult is a normal CS Program? I’m a pretty good student who can deal with 11th grade math well and I would say I’m focused. I don’t study 5 hours a day but I manage to get good grades. I just need to know I’ll be able to handle it without stressing myself out too much.
5. Although I started taking CS seriously when I found out it pays well, I am actually passionate about it from a young age. What would you say is an average starting salary straight out of college for someone who can actually do the job well?
6. Finally, does it really matter which college you go to? It’s no secret that I want to make money. I’m willing to pay more for a fancy CS school if I get a job that makes up for it after graduation. I’ve compared average starting salaries from various colleges and they vary vastly to say the least.

Thanks so much for taking time to read and answer. I appreciate it.

P.S. feel free to suggest some other universities with a good CS school that I can apply to."

Intended Major: International Relations/Political Science (depends on school)

GPA: 4.00 unweighted, 4.28 cumulative at the moment (this will likely not change, as I'm pretty sure I'll be receiving straight As this semester as well). I've already planned my classes for junior year, and my target is to have above that after junior year.

Classes: Our school offers a few honors classes and a good amount of APs, but the majority of said classes are available only to juniors and seniors. Honors classes are weighted, but we don't have that thing where every class can be honors if you test into it.

Freshman Year: English, Biology, Algebra 2, Honors Biomedical Sciences, PE, Symphonic Band, Spanish 1
Cumulative Semesters 1 &amp; 2: 4.14

Sophomore Year: English, Honors Human Body Systems, Honors Pre-Calculus, AP Euro, Spanish 2, PE, Chemistry
Cumulative Semester 1: 4.43
Presumptive Semester 2: 4.43

Junior Year (Planned): Mock Trial, Academic Leadership, AP Lang, AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP US History, Honors Medical Interventions

Presumptive Max GPA: 4.57

Senior Year (Planned): Mock Trial, Academic Leadership, iQuest (internship program), AP Statistics, AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Econ (macro/micro)

Summer Courses: 
Geography and Health A/A
Geometry A/A
Spanish iii - Presumptive A
Spanish iv - Presumptive A

We don't have rankings, but I would presume I am in my class' top ten performers.

Test Scores:
PSAT: 1280

ACT: Haven't yet taken officially, but my target is a 34, and I have reached said score on practice tests. 

Planning to take Math ii and either Biology or US History subject tests.

Extracurriculars:

Assuming school happens next year, I will be starting my school's chapter of Amnesty International. I have already selected my board.

I've been in MUN for the past two years and have received various awards. Board positions are for seniors only, but I am likely going to get on when the time comes.

I am the secretary and next year's VP of the Jewish Student Union. We work with other religious clubs to tru to fight anti-Semitism.

I am an avid member of Junior States of America and will likely run for a higher office within the club next year. I intend to win some Best Speaker awards next year as well.

I've completed over 200 volunteer hours, and submitted them to our school's Interact and CSF clubs.

I volunteer regularly at a local animal shelter and have earned upwards of 100 hours.

I tutor for four hours a week every week in math, ranging from elementary school to Algebra 2.

I played the clarinet for seven years, and, although I am no longer in the school band, I continue to play independently.

Next year, I am joining Mock Trial and Academic Leadership at my school. Y'all probably know what Mock Trial is, but Academic Leadership is going to be a new class, and it is essentially tutoring.

I will presumptively be an NHS member in senior year and plan to run for a board position.

Based on these, what could I do to improve my chances of getting into the following schools, and, if I were to do nothing else outside of what I put, what would my chances be?

Schools:

In-State:
CSUMB (Safety) (CSU Monterey Bay)
UC Santa Cruz (Safety)
UC San Diego
UC Davis
UC Los Angeles
UC Berkeley
Pomona College
Stanford University

Out-of-State:

fn4zoq,0,2020-03-22,job searching during COVID-19,engineheat,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fn4zoq/job_searching_during_covid19/,"I got my Masters in ECE from a good school 2 years ago, and I did an internship as a data scientist. After graduating I got data science offers but I ended up taking a job at a manufacturing site at a well known Fortune 100 company due to the high offer. I thought it'd be interesting to apply machine learning to a production environment. Unfortunately, only about 20% of my work deals with machine learning or data science.

Worst part is, the environment I'm in frowns upon working from home, even during this COVID-19 crisis. I really want out, and get a data science position in the next 3 month, preferably out in the West Coast but I'll take anything that's decent. I'm seriously considering quitting. I got $100k saved so I should survive for awhile. Just wonder how bad it's gonna look to future employers, and also I don't know the time frame to get a data science job in this recession... Has this virus impacted your job search so far?

Advice?

I just started a contract position at a hotel company. Help desk. Major lay offs and slow down of work as you can imagine. They sent us home for two weeks to work from home, but I am very pessimistic that we will be back any time soon. At the rate things are going I don't see how I will have a job in two weeks. I would definitely be the first to go.  Tickets and calls are already way down. All that is left is some projects to keep us busy, but that will end at some point. I think the company will just have to cut the IT department at some point so I feel like I am just waiting to be let go. I am the most recent hire and have least amount of experience. Its my first IT job after college. We have already been told that we need to prove our worth to the company and we are under a microscope.

The last couple of days I have gotten some emails from hospitals and other companies that still seem to be hiring. I have the money to last a couple months without a job, but I am wondering If I should jump ship now. There are tons of hospitals around and I imagine they will need to hire more people. I am worried that If I wait long enough all the ""secure"" jobs will be taken.

I just feel like I am on a ticking time bomb. Hotels will not go back to normal for a long time.

Any advice? I have a BS in IT and a 4 month internship. I have working at my current job for a little over a month.

fn5wsu,200,2020-03-22,I was invited to the kitchen of the Extraordinary Excelsior. But I'm not allowed to eat the food [1],likeeyedid,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fn5wsu/i_was_invited_to_the_kitchen_of_the_extraordinary/,"Simply calling the kitchen of the Excelsior a restaurant would be an insult to the artists who created this paradise made specifically for decadent dining and drinking. It wasn't a restaurant, it was a world full of wonders. As you walked in you were taken aback by the luxurious architecture: The ceilings were two stories high and decorated with majestic mural paintings that could have been painted by Michelangelo himself. Monumental mirrors were reaching over entire walls. The decoration looked as if it was donated by the richest kings and queens with materials of gold, ruby, and emerald. The first time I stepped inside I couldn't believe my eyes and how could I, when all I had seen my entire life was the color grey.

Grey flat-buildings, grey wardrobes and every day for every meal nothing but nasty grey slime. The world I grew up in was sad and cold and even if we tried to make the best of it, all of us in the grey town, as we called it, knew that we were insignificant. Not deserving of a colorful world and so all we had was hard work while we counted off the minutes of our lives. At least that's what I believed my entire life until a tiny piece of paper was about to change everything and teach me about a world I could never even have dreamed of.

We knew about the beautiful and successful residents who lived inside the Excelsior area but never in our life would they show themselves in our dirty town and trespassing the shimmering entrance was only possible with an amount of money even a whole life of work could hardly buy. Basically everyone in my town tried. They were sure to be as careful with their money as possible, one of the reasons we only ate grey slime, but I only know of a handful of people who ever saved up enough to pay for the entry.

Not knowing life beyond this land filled with depression made it difficult for me to accept what I was about to be given. In no way did I feel deserving enough but I wasn't gonna say no either. I was chosen to work in the kitchen of the infamous Excelsior. Not because I was particularly special or talented. My name had been drawn from a golden tomb filled with the names of everyone between the ages of 18 and 24. Maverick Cabilan, the incredible head chef of the Excelsior kitchen, was standing on stage dressed in a sterile white uniform and a pair of black gloves. There was a group of security surrounding him, which made it difficult to see his face. It also made the entire event even more spectacular. When I heard his deep voice call out my name, my heart stopped beating for a moment. Life as I knew it was about to be turned upside down.

During the internship you were allowed to live in housing inside the Excelsior and assist Maverick and his kitchen team, following him and observing the work. If you proved yourself worthy, you could be as lucky as being offered a permanent position.

Something nobody had achieved in 20 years.

I said goodbye to my parents and my friends feeling a mixture of excitement and dread. My mother cried her eyes out, not because she would miss me, she said, but because she was so incredibly happy for the opportunity I was given.

My father tried to stay strong but I could tell that this situation was overwhelming for him as well. In this grey world, we had nothing but each other.

""Son, I would love to give you some words of advice, tell you anything that could prepare you and make this adventure a little easier on you"" he took a deep breath in ""but I can't. Never have I left this town because never could my craving for a possible future in the Excelsior be stopped. Heck, all of us here are alive for the slightest chance that we might ever witness this other world and now my own child is getting to live it. You have no idea how happy I am.""

""How happy *we* are."" my mother added.

They were both smiling but it felt bittersweet.

""You know I'll be back soon, right?"" I said while wiping away the tear rolling down my cheek.

""Well hopefully not!"" My mum exclaimed.

""Son you have to do absolutely everything you can to stay inside Excelsior. Forget about this, forget about us. Whatever they ask of you, no matter how questionable it might seem or how hard it is, you do it. Understood?""

I nodded but I already knew that this was no option for me. I wouldn't be able to stay in that luxurious world knowing that my parents were rotting away in this empty and grey world. But they didn't need to know that now.

""Just stay long enough so they will accept you to visit their doctors"" my mother whispered in my ear as we hugged goodbye. Mothers can always sense what you're thinking.

Going through the entrance you thought you just entered a hotel with the main hall resembling residences of the aristocracy. I was surprised to see that the people looked even far more eccentric than I could have imagined. They were dressed in colors that took me a while to process and had their hair styled many layers up with all sorts of accessories completing their looks. It seemed as if every person was somehow trying to out style the rest which to me, seemed like an impossible challenge. Their cheeks were red, their eyes painted with dark pencils and they all looked well-fed, not like the people where I came from. Everyone that noticed me only gave me a look of disgust. I felt like a fool standing there, being completely overwhelmed by the stimuli surrounding me.

Finally, a woman approached me. She was the only one dressed reasonably normal, in a red jumpsuit and her hair tied up into a ponytail.

“Julius?

I nodded, still a little overwhelmed with everything.

“Great. Pull yourself together man. Yes, this place is fancy but stop staring at people. They don’t like that. And if one of them doesn’t like you, you might as well head back to the dirt hole you came from.”

“Right. Sorry.” I mumbled.

“I’m Tess and I work in the kitchen as well, I’m gonna show you everything you need to know for now. First, and I cannot stress this enough, remember Maverick is the chef. Whatever he says, you listen. Most important rule: don’t EVER eat any of the food we cook.”

“Wait, what?” I asked. “Why not?”

“Second. Don’t ask questions, just do as told. I swear if Maverick ever sees you eat any of the food, he will rip you into pieces. Literally.”

I swallowed. I had been dreaming about trying the food of the famous Maverick Cabilan, but staying on their good side was even more important.

“Alright, follow me. So this is the entrance hall. Guests come here to have a drink and relax. Never to eat. For that, we have the dining hall which you will see later on.”

“Why are they called guests? I thought they lived here for good.” I said while I followed her through the hall towards a big glass door.

“What did I say about questions?”

“This building is 13 stories high. On each level, there are different apartments for the guests. The higher up someone is on the floor, the more important they are. And usually, the fatter they are cause they can afford more of the food.” She puffed loudly through her nose. “They are also the more awful ones. Gluttonous pieces of shit,” she whispered.

“And where will I live?” I asked.

“Behind the garden. Where all of the staff lives. We have pretty awesome housing, everything is provided, even your clothes. But you won’t spend much time there besides when you’re sleeping.” she responded.

A guard opened the massive door for us and we walked through something I would describe as an entire indoor jungle with a pond and everything. If it wasn’t for the glass walls surrounding it, I would have thought that we were somewhere in the wild. Finally, we made it to my room. Tess was right. This place was beautiful. But she didn’t give me much time to adjust. I had to get changed into my uniform and then go right to the kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

As Tess and I walked in through the backdoor, I hardly had time to take in the beauty of this enormous kitchen or the smells of food I only knew from pictures. We stood back as we heard someone throwing gear all around the kitchen. Maverick was screaming and shouting. I wasn’t quite sure why, but the staff who stood lined up in a row listening to his insults were shaking like they were fearing for their lives. Some were biting their lips so hard that they started bleeding. Still, they didn’t move a centimeter, even when Maverick started throwing sharp silver wear around.

“Whose is it? Huh?” He now said in a calmer but not less scary voice.

“Which one of you bastards spoiled my masterpiece with a disgusting bloody nail?”

Nobody said a word. Tess and I stayed far in the back, hoping that he wouldn’t notice us.

After a really long moment of silence, finally, a man took a step forward. He was rather small and very skinny and was shaking even harder than the rest of the staff.

“I- I don’t think it belongs to any of us, chef. We all wear gloves as you told us to. I think it might have been an issue with the meat grinder. It could belong to one of the-”

He was cut off as Maverick threw a silver fork at him. He had to duck down not to be hit right in the face.

“I don’t give a shit what you believe. If that is the case, you pieces of shit screwed up even more. It is your job to make sure that everything we send out from this kitchen is absolute perfection. Mistakes will not be accepted. Your work here is done.”

He pointed at two other workers who grabbed the skinny man by the shoulders.

“Take him upstairs.”

&amp;#x200B;

\---

After that frightful start of my shift, I made sure to be as inconspicuous as possible while working as well as I could on any task Tess was giving me. Maverick left the kitchen shortly after his tantrum and didn’t come back until hours later when his apron was stained with the color of red meat. He didn’t speak to me or even look at me but quite frankly I was happy with that. He scared the shit out of me. The work Tess gave me was exhausting but I never complained. After twelve straight hours on my feet, I could hardly stand anymore and finally, the kitchen was closing down and the cleaning up was coming to an end. I was sent to my room to take a shower and sleep.

The first day had been the most tiring and most confusing day of my young life but I wasn’t going to give up just yet. There was a reason all of this was so hard. The payout would be incredible. Especially if somehow I could get my parents inside. That’s what I was thinking about as I sat outside on the stairs of my room, smoking one of the complementary cigarettes while I looked up at the intimidating building in the back. When I counted the stories I noticed something strange though. There were fourteen, not thirteen of them. I wondered if maybe the highest one was reserved for Maverick but I believe Tess mentioned something about him living near the other staff. I kept staring up and then I noticed something extremely strange. There was someone leaning on one of the windows. It was far away but it looked as if this person was banging against the window and shouting. I got up to get a better look. Then I noticed someone behind them. I could swear the head of the person had just slipped off from their head and there were stains on the window. I looked around me to see if anyone else had just witnessed what I believed I’d seen but there was no one. As I looked back up, the curtains of the room were [closed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)"

I've been thinking about dropping a minor for a while, this project really got me questioning, is this really all worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I started a CS minor is that I liked coding and had a room in my schedule. 131 was super easy, 132 was harder but doable but now I'm taking 216 and it is taking the most time out of all my classes. I know it is only going to get harder from now and I'm questioning whether CS minor is really worth it when I could be having an easier semester, graduate a bit earlier, and focus more on my ME classes. I like the things I learn in CS class but I hate the projects.

I thought having a minor would help with internships and job search,  but it doesn't and my advisor agreed, too. I feel like I have sufficient programming skills for engineering career from taking 131 and 132. It feels it will not be worth it to pursue CS minor and possibly endanger my performance in ME classes but it also feels like I'm giving up just because I can't complete this one project and panicking.

I am struggling to figure out what to do next. I am currently working for a technology company doing accounting type work like invoicing, entering bills, creating aging reports, responding to emails, etc. I do not enjoy the work at all, it is boring, I am not learning much towards my long term goals and I do nothing related to my degree. I only took the job as I did not have much work experience prior as I was a collegiate athlete so I couldn't intern too much, and I had a really bad concussion that I had to heal from one summer.

I am trying to break into financial analyst type roles but I am having trouble. I do not have much work experience in a FA role. I have created models in the past, mostly in class and previously at one company I worked for briefly one summer, but It has been awhile especially since I do nothing like that ay my current job. I'm thinking about getting my masters in accounting, getting my CPA and working for a big 4 then transitioning into a FA role.  I'm hesitant to this option as my passion is not accounting, and I want to get my MBA in 3-4 years so I can transition into IB so I feel like the CPA could end up being a waste as I would only work for possibly 2 years before being off from my job to enter into a full time MBA program. In addition, with the CFA getting moved to Dec, it will be hard to study for both programs at the same time. However, I know I could potentially use the CPA for higher level finance roles way down the road, maybe after I'm done IB.

So should I continue to try to find a FA job and pass on the Masters in accounting program? Or should I go into the masters program and try to move from a big 4 into a FA role? Also, what should I do in the meantime to improve my modeling skills and any other skills needed for FA roles?

I finished my 8 months masters internship two weeks ago and I have to submit my masters thesis in coming weeks. 

While I was very passionate about my project and spent all my weekends in the lab (it was basically my only priority) gave it all my energy and all. I now feel the exact opposite energy when it comes to writing, partially because we didn’t get the results we were hoping for and the gene I was studying had no effect.

This is not motivating me to write at all, I had plenty of time, especially now with the current COVID-19 situation I had my other study related plans postponed. So my focus should be all on writing. However, I really don’t have much written and every time I try to force myself to write I end up starting at the word document for an hr without getting anything done.


Any tips? I usually do not have this issue with writing, but I’m also thinking probably the reports I had to write were shorter, basically research proposals and reviews. Not entirely a project that consumed all my energy:(.


Please help and give me all the tips that cross your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I am already in my second year of my Media Design education and we are gradually being prepared to do an internship. These are of course our very first glimpse of working in a professional field.

We are busy creating our CV, Portfolio and other supplies to approach our applications as prepared as possible.

The problem with me, however, is that I started this course with 0 skills. I am still look for the profession I want to specialize in and what my skills are. To be blunt on it: I do not know what I want to do with my life.

This college tackled many different subjects, such as : some front-end web development, UX-design, photography, film and more. Many projects have already been made: Mobile app, website building, Desk research, external assignments ... but I can't really say that I really learned a lot so far.

Sure, I started working with a few coding languages ​​and we got told to use Photoshop and Illustrator, but we hardly used these 2 programs. I myself have now learned some Photoshop and Premiere Pro stuff, but it certainly still falls under amateurism.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I have hardly any skills, my projects are not particularly ""attractive"" in terms of design (I can't really create logo's/Proper UX design.. etc, because I was still new with all of it). They are not good enough to put in my portfolio, and since I don't have much time to work on new stuff at home and have little to no skills with the other programs, I have nothing to prove. I am here with an almost empty portfolio and a lot of worries.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only that is my problem. Many applications, like 95% of them, that I find online have hard requirements: Basically saying you ""need to be very skilled in Photoshop, illustrator and \[insert tool here\]"". Skills that I cannot learn at home because of the busy school schedule. It is more or less a ""job application but without pay"".

&amp;#x200B;

This puts a lot of pressure on my shoulders, because I have this image in my mind that my lack of.. anything will not get me chosen for any internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I stressing too much about this? Do I have the wrong image of an internship in my head and are my expectations too high? Are there any ""0-skill"" students who want to share their experience?"

Especially not entry-level positions, because those always have a minimum GPA, whether or not they explicitly state it. I have never felt so fucking useless in my whole goddamn life. The only difference between me now and me in middle school is that when I'm reading through job descriptions/ qualifications, I know understand what all of the words mean. No I don't have ""3+ years of object-oriented programming experience in Java or C++; in Linux, Windows, and/or Mac environment"" but I know some basics of algorithm run-times and data structures in C++ and Java. No I don't have any of my projects on GitHub because they weren't great, most of my projects in undergrad barely worked enough to get a passing grade but nothing was perfect so I didn't feel like any of it was worthy of showcasing/sharing online. I don't have any sort of experience with open-source projects or extra-curricular projects in general.

I have discovered I have a passion for teaching engineering through my TA-ship though. So that's something. But I'm also not qualified for any teaching jobs outside of my university (don't have a master's or a degree in education or a teaching certificate). Would it really be shameful if I just decided to move back in with my parents and work at a Costco or something? My parents would prolly love to have me as long as I have a job and can help with the bills and I heard the benefits for Costco employees are pretty dope. 

TL;DR: I have bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and don't know what to do with it because i don't have anything else besides that. After 4 years of college I don't have any marketable engineering skills or related experience. 

Anybody with a good ""fake it till you make it"" story to help me feel better? Honestly anything to give me hope."

Although I passed the interviews and my interviewers emailed me that they were really impressed by me, they said that sadly the position was cut as HR cannot fit any new opening to their queue. However, they wanted to recommend me for summer of 2021 or for a possible fall internship.

Has anyone experienced something like this before? Were you able to talk more to convince HR for the position? Did you guys do the internship the next summer? I feel that if I do this internship for the next summer, I might feel like I was held back a year. As I'm currently in my second year of college, I'm afraid that I don't have many opportunities for internships left. Now my only option is to intern at a small start-up this summer. Any thoughts on this would help, thank you!"

fnek5g,0,2020-03-23,Unsure How to Market Self in Job Market,besoden,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fnek5g/unsure_how_to_market_self_in_job_market/,"Hello everyone,

I am a December 2019 graduate with a bachelor's in computer science. I am currently looking for a job and I feel like I am marketing myself or job searching wrong because I feel as if I could be getting more callbacks for entry level positions if I figure out what I'm doing wrong. 

About my job search:

I am mainly using LinkedIn to apply to job postings, occasionally using ZipRecruiter if I'm unmotivated or tired of filling out job applications mindlessly. Aside from that I'm not active on any other websites. Most recruiters who reach out to me are the consulting companies that prey on student visa Indian students. I believe it's because I have a very Indian name because people tend to assume that about me even at my old university. LinkedIn's job search tends to mainly show me consulting opportunities, I'm not exactly sure why though, probably cause I use EasyApply too often lol. 

About my resume:

I have 4 tech internships on my resume (3 of which have bullet points explaining my work), as well as 4 major projects (1 bullet point per project) and a list of the hackathons I've participated in. I do not have my GPA on my resume because it is a 2.8 and my college career advisor suggests only mentioning GPA if it's &gt;3.0. I also have a list of skills and technologies I am proficient in, however I do not mention my proficiency level.

If anyone has any more questions or has any advice I would really appreciate it! I know that job searching is tough and I should expect to put out a lot of applications, but I believe that I should have had more success pre-coronavirus so I want to figure out how to get the results I want so I can go get the results I want :D"

The working hours are 12 hours per day man! like I get it its a startup you need to work but 12 hours each day? so many students left due to this(they had health issues forming , there were girls returning home after 12 in the night )but still they don't take any actions against it.

These are the steps I am planning to take against this company 

1. Go to labour court and file a complaint against them
2. go to my college placement coordinator and tell them about it

It's a full ride where they pay for your tuition, room and board, meal plan, associated fees, there are textbook and computer stipends. They require you to maintain a 3.5 GPA, do a study abroad program, an internship, and a fifth year MS Business degree (they pay for your study abroad and the fifth year as well). They do, however, forbid you from accepting any other financial aid but you won't need it. I HIGHLY encourage you to look into this scholarship if you are STEM and thinking of going to TAMU. There are some minimum requirements such as a 32 ACT but if you fit that then apply!!! The scholarship is only 3 years old and they accept 50 people each year so not a lot of applicants know about it. Also, there are interviews after an online application so the process if holistic and they want well rounded people, not just someone with good grades! It is the Brockman Foundation Scholarship. I got the scholarship this year so if you have any questions about the process you can ask me! I have yet to actually go to college though (hs senior rn) so I can't speak to the experience of being a Brockman Scholar quite yet."

(My internships are all SWE, I like SWE, planning on starting career with that.)

So I'm double majoring in business. Right now I'm a declared major in finance but I really didn't like the Accounting and Intro to Finance classes I've taken. The content of higher level classes in finance (derivatives, options) seems much more interesting to me but god those classes were so incredibly boring. 

I'm trying to figure out whether or not I want to switch into this ""Operations Management &amp; Business Analytics"" (OMBA) major. As title suggests I'd be studying operations and data analytics. I like working with data so it might be a good fit.

Questions (answer any number that you feel like, or offer any other advice you have, I appreciate all help):

1) What do you think of the idea of double majoring in business in the first place? It seems to impress recruiters even for SWE roles. Would this be valued in the workplace?

2) Does the career trajectory I'm talking about (SWE --&gt; PM/management) sound plausible to you? Any other roles within the tech industry that would fit someone with a CS/Business background well? Is it true that a business background can be helpful for senior SWEs?

3) Would the tech industry prefer a finance or OMBA degree? What would help me to achieve my goals long term?

I wanted to first say how grateful I am for all of you in this community. This page is one I stumbled on a while ago and have made an effort to keep up with.

With that being said, I am coming to you all for some guidance. I guess I am not looking for any specific types of response. I think if I can get all of my thoughts organized in one place that will be a huge help in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'll give you all a short background:

  
I'm 23 years old and just graduated this past December with a Bachelors in Insurance and Risk Management. Yes, Insurance was a major at my school, crazy right? The reason I chose this major was because during my  years of high school, my main focus was earning a scholarship to play D1 baseball. I was blessed enough to be given a couple offers and ultimately ended up picking the school that was the best fit for me. Though I was given a scholarship offer to play baseball, I still had to apply for actual school, also crazy, right?! All jokes aside, during my application process I was forced to pick a major. Being an uneducated 18 year old who had only thought about and worked on baseball, I naturally googled ""Highest paying majors"" and within that list were obvious choices like Pre-Med, Pre-Law, etc. I was more leaning towards something within the business school so my choices for ""Highest paying majors"" were along the lines of Finance, Accounting, etc. Our business school is sponsored by State Farm and offered an Insurance and Risk management degree. After googling, ""Average pay for Insurance and Risk Management major"" the choice was clear to someone as uneducated as I was 5 years ago. Most of the mid-level business courses I shared with the Finance students while my last 30 credit hours were more concentrated in insurance. I like to think I have a natural ability to learn. I am able to retain information really well and grasp new concepts relatively quickly. I graduated with above a 3.0 gpa with minimal effort put towards my school work. My main focus, again, was baseball. As my junior year came and went, so did my hopes and dreams of becoming a professional baseball player. I decided it was time to shift my focus and get real with myself. I locked in an internship with an investment firm in Chicago that taught me a lot about the industry. This internship guided me a little closer to understanding what I did and didn't want out of a career. After my internship I returned to school to finish my degree this past fall and immediately focused on securing a job post graduation. I ultimately landed a job with a great Financial Services company with an amazing staff, great systems in place and wonderful financial products to implement into client strategies. I started working there mid January and have been there since. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I will give you some information on what has been going on this past week: 

The past Wednesday morning I received a call from my boss with some unfortunate, but not devastating news. She explained to me that our company had made the decision to not extend any contracts indefinitely. With everything going on as a result of COVID 19, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the financial world. Our company decided it was in their best interest to not expend any additional resources for new hires/ recruits. What this means for me is I can continue working there if I choose to, only now I would not be given the small base salary allotted to new advisors while they build their practice and would be commission only for an undefined period of time. This presents a lot of troubles and concerns for a new advisor because being commission only in the first few years of your practice could mean an incentive to not always put your client's interests first. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some random thoughts I've been having:

I have a very good family friend who owns his own small wealth management firm who offered me a job as well as a small stipend to keep me afloat while I build my practice. I think this could be a good option for me if I choose to stay in this industry/area.

I've also been thinking... maybe my skillset would be better served within another role. At the end of the day, financial service is a high burnout career with a low retention rate. I have no doubt I'd be able to stick it out and make it work in the long term, it is just hard to not consider maybe my time would be more efficiently spent elsewhere. 

Some personal characteristics I take pride in are my leadership abilities. Being a catcher on a D1 baseball team, I learned a lot about how to properly manage people and how to entice a team to work towards a shared goal. I ultimately helped lead my team to a regular season conference championship and an NCAA regional. I say these things not to brag or sound like a ""jock"" but because I truly believe my leadership capabilities played a role in the team's success.

I've always valued relationships, communication, transparency, hard work and consistency. Ideally, I see myself in a career where I can connect with people, be a voice of reason for people, and have an uncapped earning ability, all while having the flexibility to structure it in a way that works for me. I really am deathly afraid of a job that requires me to work 9-5. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I work better knowing it is on my own time and will gladly put in extra time as long as I know it is my decision and I can see the results of my hard work. I am very entrepreneurial in that way and that was ultimately one of the biggest decision making factors in choosing to go into a Financial Services role. I like having the ability to work out of the office or from home and create my own schedule as well as my own checks and balances. 

I've also been kind of tempted to explore a different part of the country in hopes of finding a new home. I'm a born and raised in Chicagoan and man, do I hate the cold. I've figured that now is the perfect time to consider this possibility of living somewhere more warm. I'm as young as I'll ever be, single, and really tied to nothing here in the midwest besides family. 

I guess I just don't know what to do and any guidance will be helpful. Like I said, ideally I can find a career that will allow me to satisfy my desires of freedom, earning potential, flexibility, self-discipline... and hey, maybe in a warmer state!

Some of the things I really consider myself good at is forming meaningful relationships with people. I'm a great listener and naturally very trustworthy, reliable and honest. I'm a quick learner and somewhat of a perfectionist which I believe fits right in to my trustworthiness. I pride myself on knowing I will do extensive research to ensure the solutions I provide my clients with are the best they can be. I also have a wealth of knowledge in baseball and can spend hours learning about the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, any input it helpful. I'm looking forward to your guys' responses!"
fnqox2,0,2020-03-23,Job seeking amidst COVID-19 and EI eligibility,ZohmyGod,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/fnqox2/job_seeking_amidst_covid19_and_ei_eligibility/,"Hey PFC! 

As the title states, I was wondering about my eligibility for EI as a job seeker. 

&amp;nbsp;


To give some context, I was interning for a tech company last year from May 2018 to the end of 2019. I declined a full time offer, hoping to find a different opportunity local to my home province, and have been job seeking since January 2020. I had onsite interviews scheduled that have been postponed / cancelled, and job seeking has gotten a lot tougher in the past few weeks. I had been paying into EI during my internship, but unsure if that makes me eligible for EI, as I haven't been laid off, or working prior to the pandemic. Would my best bet be to wait for the Emergency Support Benefit, or do I not qualify for anything at all?

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: Working FT last year, decided to decline contract and job hunt. COVID-19 has made job hunting difficult; is there any form of EI that I am eligible for?"
fnrhw0,1,2020-03-23,I got an internship! What's next?,CaSe_InSeNsItIvItY,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fnrhw0/i_got_an_internship_whats_next/,"tldr: Should my side projects be related to what I learn in my internship or should I use them to learn something totally different?

I am a third year CS student, graduating next fall and staying for a 1 year masters. I went to a hackathon recently and was offered an interview when presenting my project, and that interview resulted in an internship. Up to 25 hours per week during the semester, set my own schedule (and it's remote now because of the illness), and guaranteed full time for the summer. The internship lasts as long as I'm in school and productive. I also get to keep my IP for anything I create outside of work that doesn't use their company data, which I've heard is hard to come by. I don't mean to sound braggy. I'm just setting the scene. 

My question now is, what's next? I don't have a ton of personal projects. I'll be doing web development alongside an ML project at work (that they're creating because I stated my interest in the field and some knowledge), so should I do something different for personal projects? Or should I use the skills I learn there and apply them to some side projects? Will this internship make it easier to find a full time position after school? Could it result in better pay having more experience? This opportunity came out of nowhere, so I'm not sure what to make of it. They do say that luck is preparedness + opportunity, but I never realized how true that is. 

I know the answer will be ""it depends"", but what would you do, and what do you think? Thanks!"

I'm pretty excited, as UCI is one of my top choice schools. I have a few questions:

1. How are the internship opportunities for CSE majors? I'm definitely interested in doing internships for any tech companies I can. Are there recruiting events/fairs? What is the best way to obtain an internship?
2. What are the research opportunities like for CSE majors? I've heard from people that if you have an interest in what a professor is researching, to simply approach them and inquire about taking part in research. At the moment, I'm not sure what area of CSE I'm interested in in, but I definitely want to do research of some kind. Do most CSE freshmen do research or is it done in later years?
3. How are the courses? I understand that CSE is a balance between EE and CS. Can someone offer more detail on this and what the courses mainly cover?
4. How difficult are the courses in general? I'm prepared to work for it but I'm wondering what to expect.
5. How is the culture for CSE majors(collaborative, competitive, etc.)
6. What are some good CSE-related student orgs to join?
7. How does UCI CSE compare to UCSD and UCLA?
8. Anything else that you guys think I should know?

Another thing is that i quite like my current colleagues, but working hours are not as flexible as i would've wanted, and work became also a bit, how do i describe it, boring combined with the fact that we're supposed to develop this new feature and all we do is talk about it and disagree, and change, and it seems like a lot of meaningless decisions are weighted too much.

For context, I am a freshman in college working towards a bachelors in computer engineering. I was hoping to find some last minute internships, as I did not realize internships are planned a few months in advance. With COVID-19 ruining a ton of engineering internships for others, along with the overall job market, I don't know where I should be looking for employment for the summer. I do not want to stick with my current part time job that would only give me &gt;20 hrs per week over the summer, but I'm not seeing any opportunities for engineering students near me (Olathe-Overland Park, KS)

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Does anybody know what the differences between the two majors are?

How are the job prospects for both? 

Is CET considered lower than CE?

Is CET a good major to Pursue to be able to secure CS jobs as well? 

How much coding is involved in CET vs CE?

What are the internship opportunities for CET?

I live in the Bay Area and eventually want to come back for a job here, would that be possible?

If I want to transfer into SE or CE or even CS how hard would that be?

Thanks in advance!

Sorry if this question has been asked before."
fnuiab,1,2020-03-23,I work in a grocery store and every fiber of my being is telling me to quit my job to keep me and my family safe from coronavirus. I don't know what to do.,ss33094,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fnuiab/i_work_in_a_grocery_store_and_every_fiber_of_my/,"I'll try and keep it brief. I work in a deli at a supermarket in NYC, which of course during this time, grocery stores are essential jobs. There's obviously no way to work from home, so I have no choice but to expose myself to potentially sick people every day.

I'm gonna be 26 in a week, and relatively healthy, so I know the chances of me getting deathly ill are relatively low. However, my mom was laid off a little over a month ago, but in about a week or two she'll be receiving unemployment pay. She also receives child support from her ex husband. My brother is doing his internship online, but as a result his hours have been cut way down, so he's not bringing home much money. So as it stands, I'm the only one bringing home any kind of decent money.

My mom still has savings that will get us through the next few months, even more so if our landlord decides to freeze rent payments for the time being. And I also have a good chunk of money saved up with my only bills every month being 130 for my phone, and 300 to my mom for rent.

With that said, I'm now going to be the only person going out to a high risk job every day, and coming back to a quarantined family that consists of my diabetic mom in her early 50s, a decently overweight but otherwise healthy 25 year old brother, and a teenage asthmatic brother. All of them are more at risk than me for those reasons, and I worry about bringing that virus back to them.

So what should I do? Should I quit my job so my family and I can effectively quarantine ourselves through this thing and manage what we have saved on top of the little money they will be bringing in, or should I go out take this huge risk every day for some job security and the paycheck? I also worry about all of our abilities to find a job once this is over and the economy is in the toilet.

I'm at a loss and it's driving my anxiety crazy. I don't know what to do."

fnxdir,0,2020-03-23,"Fired first week on the job, got asked uncomfortable personal questions during interview.",IAgreeToTheTOS,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fnxdir/fired_first_week_on_the_job_got_asked/,"I live in Florida.

A couple of weeks ago I interviewed in person for this internship position at a small company in my city. The person interviewing me was the CEO of said company. As soon as I walked in, he said he hadn't read my resume and was interested in ""getting to know each other"". Most of the interview was him going on unrelated rants, and went into uncomfortable political and personal territory. He disclosed his sexuality and said he was looking ""to hire someone who would be ok with that"". He pressured me a lot about my personal political views and how I leaned and eventually started telling me about his boyfriend and personal stories about fights they've had over different issues. At some point during the interview he started crying, and it was bizarre. I left the interview feeling like this man was seeking to hire people specifically who aligned themselves with his personal political and ideological views and that skill was not something he cared about at all (as he stated he hadn't even read my resume). There was one other person in the room with us during the entire interview, which was another intern who was leaving and I was supposed to take her place.

I got hired and their emails congratulating me were extremely condescending and gave an air of ""you should be thankful we chose you"".

First day of work was Thursday where we had a video call with other employees. I was logged in to our online platform 15 minutes before the meeting and messaged him exactly on the dot, and joined the video chat exactly one minute after its supposed start time. I was given new hire paperwork, Adobe documents, which were locked and I was unable to sign them electronically. Not having access to a printer or scanner in my home, this employer required me to go somewhere to pay out of pocket to print and scan these documents during a pandemic lockdown thanks to COVID-19, because they were unable to send me paperwork I could sign electronically. I was unable to get these papers signed and scanned and sent to them until today (Monday). On Monday he called me while I was showering so I could not pick up, and less than an hour  later I received an email from him telling me my employment was being terminated due to not responding to his phone call promptly enough and due to not submitting the new hire paperwork ""in a timely manner"". This even after I had emailed the HR person to let her know of the circumstances and why I could not have done it sooner.

She called me and told me his other reasons for firing me before even finishing the paperwork were that I was ""late for my first day of work"" (which is not true, as I stated above) and did not reply to emails or phone calls promptly enough (even when these attempts at communication were well after business hours or over the weekend, such as a Sunday at 10pm). And that also he had said that since I am ""a computer person"", I should have been able to find a way to sign the paperwork electronically (these documents had been locked and encrypted, and I spent two hours trying to sign them electronically before finally giving up and emailing saying I'd have to print them). Regardless, they were not willing to rethink the decision and said I'd be getting a check in the mail for the one day worked and that was that.

This is purely speculation and I don't think will have any bearing on anything at all, but I'm afraid he looked me up online and dug up maybe old stuff and saw political opinions I had expressed that did not align with his own and decided he didn't want me to work there any longer.

I know I wasn't even legally an employee yet, but I feel like a lot of worker's rights have been broken here. I'm leaning more towards cutting my losses and finding more professional and respectful workplaces, but this entire situation has been completely insane and off the wall. What are worker's rights for, if not to protect workers from being treated like this when seeking employment?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

After speaking with my girlfriend, I began realizing how bad the problem is. I don’t care about many things, not just the mundane stuffs, but also my own life. I do things because they NEED to be dealt with, if the matter isn’t urgent, I will just leave it until it has to be done. As I delve deeper, I realize that I am not living for myself, I hate myself. I’m trapped in my own failures, such as the getting into huge debt, hurting my families, damaging friendships, failed to live up to my families’ expectations. Deep down inside I had already given up on life in general, no matter how hard I try to fake it, there is no convincing way to fake motivation, especially when you don’t care. A former friend once said to me that she felt as if I was soulless, looking back now, I think she was right. She is currently working her dream job, living happily with the people she loves, when I am still trying to sort out the damage I did to myself years ago. 

If you finished reading my essay, I thank you for the patience. This coronavirus thing completely destroyed my hope and threw me back to the dark hole that I have been trying to climb out."
fnz6y8,3,2020-03-24,How should I go about securing a summer internship???,kym0,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/fnz6y8/how_should_i_go_about_securing_a_summer_internship/,"Background info:

I am currently a senior at my University, studying Marketing with a minor in graphic design. I’m set to graduate in December, a semester later than most of my peers. Therefore, I have time to pick up a summer internship.

Last summer, I interned with a prominent entity in the sports &amp; entertainment industry (Company A). It was a great experience, I met really cool people, had so many networking opportunities, and overall really enjoyed my summer. The actual work was...eh, but I could tolerate it. This year I interviewed with them again, just as a plan B because I knew I would get it - but I wasn’t really planning on going back to the same company. 

Over the past couple of months, I’ve also been interviewing with multiple other great companies - one of them being my dream company (Company B). I went through 4 rounds of interviews with said company, and was feeling pretty confident during my final interview, but I don’t want to get too ahead of myself. They said they would reach out by the end of March, but I have a gut feeling that this whole COVID19 fiasco will delay that.

The other company I interviewed (only 1 interview for now) is one of the top advertising agencies in the world (Company C). I felt pretty confident in this one too, but they told me that they probably would not get back to me with next steps until April.

The company I interned with last summer offered me a position within their internship program again, and told me to accept my offer by March 25. 

Well....it’s March 24 and I still haven’t heard anything back from the other companies, even though it is not the end of March/ April yet. I don’t want to accept this offer, and then have to take it away, because company A is literally my LAST choice. No other interns are coming back, and a lot of the full time employees have left because of a recent merger. Also, I really am not fond of this company’s values + principles, and do not at all stand for what some of their employees/ fans stand for. 

I want to have an internship for my final summer in college, but I want to make sure I’m making the right choice. How could I go about asking for an extension to accept my offer to company A? Honestly, I really want to decline company A’s offer, without knowing if I have other offers lined up, but I know that wouldn’t be smart. Especially given how hard it is for ANYBODY to find a job/ internship right now. 

Any advice helps."

I hold a Statistics degree from UIUC and had a software internship plus a research assistant position working in Computer Vision (but it didn't result in any publications and I'd consider any recommendations coming from here as like a 7/10 at best) so I considered myself somewhat practiced on stuff like DS+A, but I haven't ever taken any formal classes on upper level CS topics so I feel like my background might be a little lacking for what's required. I have taken an intro programming class, a database class, and an ML class but is this enough to justify applying or should I take some accredited courses before committing to applying? Also, is it acceptable to take accredited courses now while you wait for your results as long as you state that?"
fo0u7o,3,2020-03-24,Can someone help give some advice to an economics major?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fo0u7o/can_someone_help_give_some_advice_to_an_economics/,"As the title mention, I am a junior in need of serious advice. Last year in my Introduction Macroeconomics course I had a B. Everything made sense and I actually understood what the professor was talking about. However, when I took Intermediate Microeconomics, nothing made sense after that. The first two introductory courses in economics barely involved mathematics but all of the sudden math was crucial. I passed the class with a B but I barely understood anything. Right now, I'm taking Intermediate Macroeconomics and Financial Economics and these two courses don't make sense at all. The textbooks are so complicated that I don't find them useful at all. I was able to understand the first two introductory textbooks.

I'm writing this because I feel so lost and I have no one to talk to. I'm doing terrible in these two current courses. I'm also stressing out about getting a job after college. I was planning about getting an internship this year but with the COVID 19, this doesn't seem likely.

I heard that most Econ graduates usually work in career fields that have them work in excel, R or some sort of computer programing. I'm planning on getting a BA but I have no experience with these at all. In my college, the major doesn't prepare us and teach us how to use these tools. I feel like I'm not going to be able to find a job. I'm pretty much an average student with an average GPA and lack computer skills. This combination is going to kill me. Not only this but I barely remember anything at all from college. I'm so scared and feel so unprepared for the future. I feel that I wasted 3 years and gain no skill or knowledge at all.

To those with an economics degree, what advice will you give me? What should I do with the time I have left to prepare myself for the future? I was planning on getting my Masters in Data Science but the only math I've completed is Calculus 1. Ps: I didn't do too well in it. I've always loved math and it was easy for me but for some reason, Calculus never clicked with me.

TDLR: I'm junior majoring in economics and I'm feeling unprepared for the future. I barely remember anything and don't have the necessary skills that most jobs are asking."

 * Teacher Recommendations:

Writing Elective (Writing Center) Teacher (8): Reading her letter made me cry. It highlighted my collaboration and people skills. Highlighted me as “one of the best ever” in terms of positivity and self-awareness. 

BC Calc Teacher (9): Used to be a college professor, so his letter was great! Highlighted me as one of his best students in the past 40 years in terms of “pure joy of learning”, so I took that as a good sign. Made me cry too.  

 * Counselor Rec:

Counselor (8): He had to use 8 point font to fit everything he wanted to say, so I guess it must’ve been good. 


Acceptances (No financial aid anywhere)

Johns Hopkins University 

University of South Florida w/ 48k in scholarships

George Mason University w/ 8k in scholarships 


General Thoughts

Strengths: Essays!! I believe my essays set me over the edge. They were heartfelt and really showed a different side.  Potential Hook (Disability) and National achievements/presentations in four activities. 

Weaknesses: Forgot to submit AP Scores and bad AP Scores in general, no SAT Subject Tests

Why you think you were accepted: I’m a relatively normal kid. I have accomplished stuff, but I haven’t founded nonprofits and won science fairs. I’ve just tried my best to be the best version of myself as a friend and as a leader in my community, and I guess the admissions committee saw that in me and decided I would be a good fit for the Hopkins community. 

Final Thoughts: I have been in denial for the past four months, expecting a rejection from JHU because I got intimidated by everyone’s stats on Reddit/College Confidential. I never believed I was outstanding enough for JHU, despite the fact that my teachers and friends all believed I would easily get in. When I opened that decision, I just bawled so hard because I was in disbelief. I’m so grateful that the admissions committee saw something in me and decided to admit me the JHU class of 2024! "
fo4fa7,15,2020-03-24,What to do with old college papers and exams as a former computer science student?,CompMath,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/fo4fa7/what_to_do_with_old_college_papers_and_exams_as_a/,"To keep things short, I am a recent computer science graduate who graduated in December of 2019. I already have a job that I've been working for almost a 1 year since I transitioned from intern -&gt; co-op -&gt; full software Developer. Since I have finished school I have all my school papers, exams, binders and folders of stuff and wanted to know if it all worthwhile to keep? I raise this question because I have no interest in going to grad school so they wouldn't be used much. I am keeping my old projects that I built over the course of college. The thing is, most of the information is out there on the internet and I have different books to reference. So should I throw away everything or should I keep most stuff which is important? I already am going to get rid of papers from other classes which aren't related to computer science. Open to all suggestions and comments!!"
fo4zeo,0,2020-03-24,Reapplying after getting rejected by the ATS?,chonyyy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fo4zeo/reapplying_after_getting_rejected_by_the_ats/,"Hi, I'm currently still a student. I recently applied to the big tech companies internship with my first resume. And I have gotten some of the rejections right after one to two weeks. 

I think it's because I didn't know anything about the ATS when I was making my first resume. I found out it turned out to be extremely ATS-unfriendly, which I think that may be the reason for me to get the rejection in a so short period of time.

I have read some articles said that I might be automatically rejected by the ATS, which means probably no human has ever seen my resume. 

Now I have done a lot of research and updated my resume to an ATS-friendly version. Can I reapply to the internship with my new resume? Will my new application gives the companies bad impression and do harm to my future applications? Is another rejection the worst thing that I can get?"
fo52w9,21,2020-03-24,"If you've been affected by recent events and are looking for something to work on, I've created Projects For Programmers, a Discord server set up to facilitate open-source project development.",BlueFieryIce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fo52w9/if_youve_been_affected_by_recent_events_and_are/,"You may have seen u/ar243's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/flfoc3/yesterday_i_started_an_open_source_project_for/) about a similar discord server for interns affected by the recent cancellations. Most of the comments on that post expressed concern that a group so unorganized won't get much done.

As an alternative, I present to you, **Projects For Programmers (PFP)**.

How does PFP manage its projects?

* Experience and Language/Framework Roles
   * When new users join, they will be given the opportunity to select their Discord roles.
   * Experience Roles - describes their overall programming and industry knowledge
      * High School Student - someone who is beginning to learn programming concepts
      * Lower Undergraduate - someone who has worked on multiple projects
      * Upper Undergraduate - someone who has had multiple internships or had some industry experience
      * Industry Expert\* - someone who is knowledgeable about current industry standards, best practices, etc.
      * \*Industry Experts are asked to change their name to show what they are an expert or have in-depth experience in, along with how many years they have been in the industry. Ex: ""JohnDoe"" -&gt; ""JohnDoe | Full Stack Developer| 10 years"" or ""John Doe | Machine Learning | 4 years""
   * Although these roles seem odd compared to ""beginner, intermediate, advanced..."", they...
      * Match the overall Reddit populous, to some extent

I am very interested in joining COMPANY's mission to transform communications technology and entertainment that connects people with the: INTERNSHIP TITLE. I am a student at XXXX pursuing a degree in marketing, with experience in content marketing and Search Engine Optimization for xxxx, a rising health clinic, and I have the analytical skills needed to thrive in a large corporation. COMPANY is of interest to me as it has sustained a reputable position in telecommunications, mass media, and entertainment through strategic acquisitions and worldwide coverage for more than 56 years.

As a Marketing Intern for xxxx, my analytical skills have enabled me to perform successful content marketing on the YouTube platform. I examined existing uploads and recognized the advantage of the team focusing on search engine optimization for content related to the services provided by the company. Using Excel, YouTube Analytics, SEMrush, and Ubersuggest, I analyze and implement keywords with the highest search volume and relevance with the lowest competition in the video description: resulting in a 134% lift of video impressions, thus improving brand awareness for the organization. My experience with search engine optimization, content marketing, analytics, and project/time management, combined with my passion for strategic planning, would allow me to tackle all digital marketing activities and efforts—and ultimately communicate the value of COMPANY’s offerings even more efficiently than they already are.

These experiences and skills make me an excellent candidate for any INTERNSHIP TITLE internship position. After you have reviewed my attached resume, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the internship position at COMPANY with you.

Some background: I joined this company as an intern, and I’ve been doing really well. My team and I have mutual interest of giving me a coordinator position at the end of this semester. I didn’t want to count my eggs before they hatch, so I went ahead and applied to other positions.

I received a phone interview for an internal position that fits my skills a lot better, and this position i am interviewing for is associate manager, a level ahead of coordinator (normally its intern—&gt; coordinator —-&gt; associate manager).

while i expect to do well, i know that asking for help of my manager/team is something i have thought of doing. she is extremely well known within the company, and i know her advice would be great. however, i am fearful i am going to rub her and the team the wrong way by interviewing for a position outside of our team.

It is my last semester before our mandatory internships. This semester, we have a whole class dedicated to creating a project that utilizes all that we have learned over the last two years. The idea is that this project can help us get internships and jobs. 

Currently, we're still in the design phase. My project idea is to create a Unity Instant Game (UIG), and deploy it to a wordpress (WP) site that I make. I will host the website on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) that I rent. I  also want to add firebase integration to my game so users can save their progress and log into the game. I am only creating a basic web game. Players will only be able to move up or down on a 2D scrolling plane to dodge incoming objects. Note, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate hosting my own website, building my own website, integrating and managing a database, and to show my ability to learn a new framework (in this case UIG). 

**Here are my questions:**

1. Can I easily add UIG to a WP page? I can create a webpage from scratch if need be, but I'm familiar with WP and it scales automatically to different platforms (mobile, desktops, tablets). I did find this tutorial [https://gamedevbill.com/how-to-post-unity-games-to-wordpress/](https://gamedevbill.com/how-to-post-unity-games-to-wordpress/) . However, I am unsure if my teacher will let me use this plugin (it does a lot of work for me), and it also requires mobile users to click ""request in desktop mode"" to run the game properly. 
2. Would it be easier to use the WP database to save game progress or to use firebase? I wanted to use firebase so that I can manage one less backup if I migrate my website or decide not to use WP. 
3. Should I look into regular game dev in Unity via HTML5 and skip the UIG? The scope of the game is small, and I want to be able to show off my project quickly at interviews or career fairs."

I am in Virginia, I have recently been hired at my internship that is necessary to have in order to graduate.

The HR manager at my company inquired about this one job and I told her that it had shut down and that it was only paid in cash so I do not any W2s from it and no longer have any contact with personnel, she advised to not put it on the background check since it is effectively unverifiable.

Several days later after I submit my background check, the background check people (which is a different company) are asking me about that one particular job even though I never put it down (I'm assuming they're cross checking my application).

I am an Out of State student at a top 10 public tech school. I am currently planning out my classes for next year (entering sophomore year), and because I entered college with a lot of AP credits, I could graduate early. I am debating whether to graduate in 3 or 3.5 years. If I graduate in 3.5 years (7 semesters), I could take it relatively easy (13 ish credits) a semester for the rest of time in college. However, the CS department at my school is notorious for being difficult, so even 13 credits would still probably be hard, although I could do it no worries. Now if I graduate in 3 years, I would have to take around 17 credits every semester, with the exception of my last semester (14 credits). This would definitely be difficult, but I would be saving around $25,000 for that extra semester I didn't do. 

I am fortunate enough that my parents pay for my education, and they are willing to fund my education regardless of whether I go for 3, 3.5, or even 4 years. However, we are not super well off and $25,000 is a lot of money even if they can pay it. 

Although I could do it, taking 17 credits a semester sorta worries me. I feel like I would be super stressed out. At the same time, I am the kind of person who likes a challenge, and 13 credits might be too easy for me.

Another concern of mine is receiving a full-time offer. I want to work in the industry hopefully at a Big 4 following college and my one wish is that I walk across the stage at graduation with a job to work at following graduation. I want to have a full-time offer when I graduate. Most of the time, students get a good internship the summer following their junior year and if they do well, that company will offer them a full-time job for after their senior year. Sounds ideal, right? The only problem is, if I graduate in 3 years, I don't have that summer after junior year. I'd have to get my internship that would lead to a full-time offer next summer (summer after sophomore year). I do not know if I am skilled enough to land an internship next year at a really good company.  


Also, this is the least of my concerns but it is still there to some extent- I really enjoy college and if I graduated in 3.5 years I at least get an extra semester with my friends in the perfect college life. However, this is not important enough to really have a bearing on my decision.  


I was wondering what advice anyone has for me- do I take the extra semester, or graduate early and save that money? Thank you!"

It’s probably too optimistic to say this, but I’m sort of hopeful to be graduating in the current climate. 

I’ll be graduating this August with an honours degree in psychology and linguistics. I’ve fallen absolutely in love with what I studied, and the internships / assistantships I’ve done have opened my eyes to all the possibilities out there. 

I know there’s a recession (some day a depression) looming in the horizon, but I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to tide through. Problem is, I have too many options, as well as questions

should I continue applying for internships? 
- I don’t mind the low pay, the learning opportunities and experience I get is often enough, but I’m often hit with “why don’t you get a *job* instead?”, and I sometimes feel ashamed for being a small fry in something possibly big 

working holiday
- so I had spent some time on a semesters exchange in Australia and met some amazing friends and connections. My goal had been to volunteer at a research lab under a prof I was on good terms with to slowly work my way to a PhD, but in light of the financial situation I’m honestly not sure if that’s feasible. My visa’s all ready and I’m good to go upon graduation, but I’m honestly not sure if I’ll be able to survive. My parents are comfortable and not willing to support my studies but I’d much rather not put that burden on them. 

r/iWantOut
- im honestly rather disillusioned with my home country (Singapore). It’s a great place, safe and comfortable, but I honestly feel like it’s just so sterile and I wouldn’t be able to achieve what I want to (in academia / research) and grow without having top of the class credentials

TLDR: how do I better prepare for an uncertain future? 
- apply for an internship/ contract role and see where that goes
- wait out the virus and develop my interests before travelling overseas 
- apply for postgraduate studies overseas 

*edit: I’m also a little worried about the racism situation overseas as I’m Chinese, and the whole situation with the “China flu” hasn’t been positive for most Asians in general.

I'm very grateful. However, now I have to decide if it's actually the right place for me. I was content with the idea of attending University of Utah in the Fall, but I don't want to waste a good opportunity to attend UM if it's really worth it. Would appreciate any input you might have to help make the decision! Here's some things I'm factoring in:

University of Utah:

\- As far as I can tell, they offer in-state tuition to anyone who's lived there for one year, even if you moved there for college. That would be real handy.

\- When skimming forums about the university, the students all seem to have optimistic things to say about the CS program.

\- Their early CS classes use Java, which is what I'm learning at my CC right now. Would be nice to be able to use my prior knowledge going into their weed-out classes.

\- My husband and I like the idea of Salt Lake City.

University of Michigan:

\- It's #8 on CS rankings, compared to #34 for Utah. There has to be a compelling reason for that.

\- I've heard fantastic things about the connections and programs UM offers for extracurriculars, internships, and after graduation support.

\- Their average CS starting salary is higher than Utah's.

\- I believe I would be paying OOS all 3-4 years, so unless I get significant scholarship offers, it will definitely cost more than UofU.

\- LSA is not considered as ""rigorous"" as their Engineering program.

As a side note: I've also been accepted to CU Boulder, but I think Utah wins because of the potential in-state tuition after a year and a lower cost of living. Otherwise, I've heard they're mostly comparable. Feel free to correct me on that if you have differing information!

Any thoughts you have on the universities, their programs, the surrounding areas, etc. that might help steer my decision would be greatly appreciated!"
fo9v8d,492,2020-03-24,"I was a clown, and didn't apply to any safeties I liked. Now, I'm regretting it more than ever.",LonalynnCharmed,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fo9v8d/i_was_a_clown_and_didnt_apply_to_any_safeties_i/,"Please, for the love of ALL things good and holy, apply to real safeties that YOU like, kids.

UC's are not safeties, nor are schools with an acceptance rate below 50% - no matter HOW good your stats are. I'm saying this with all the love in my heart. Even if you've got a 5.0 GPA and found the cure for cancer, just apply to one or two safeties you could see yourself attending for 1-2 years (since you can always transfer!). Trust me, it'll save you. If nothing else, the peace of mind it'll give you is absolutely worth it.

**Don't just take that optimistic shot in the dark. I'm speaking from experience.**

I was way too confident in my grades, scores, and extracurriculars. I thought that they'd amount to something, in the end, that I could just write my way in, flex my stats, and be done with it. My parent went to UCSD, and they reassured me that I was guaranteed to get in, that UCSD was a surefire ""safety"" for me. My friends and family agreed - there was just no way that I'd get rejected from that school, not with my stats.

Spoiler alert: that didn't happen.

I've been rejected from every school I've applied to so far - UCSD, MIT, Notre Dame, UVA *\[edit: CMU\]*. UCI waitlisted me, bless their hearts, but that's no guarantee.

The only school that accepted me was the one I applied to because my parent encouraged me to, Liberty University. I'd absolutely hate going there. I toured the college over the summer and didn't click with it whatsoever - it just didn't feel like home to me. After reading into the controversies surrounding the current president's treatment of staff and students, I was certain that it wasn't the place for me at all. Now, it's looking like my only option.

With only Brown and Duke left to go, I've pretty much lost all hope of getting into a school that I love. I guess I'm going to apply to some late deadline schools, but I genuinely wish I'd just applied to a few ""real"" safeties that I liked, not just one that my parent did.

*My Stats, for reference:*

* *Applied Compsci/Polisci*
* *33 ACT, 1460 SAT (I only submitted my ACT if possible)*
* *3.8 GPA UW, 4.0 W*
* *4s and 5s on all AP exams*
* *610 Physics, 630 Math SAT subject tests (this is, I'm convinced, the thing that got me rejected.)*
* *Internship at a local political news organization*
* *Owned a dance studio junior year*
* *Competitive Swimmer*
* *Competitive Dancer*
* *11 APs, 7 of which are in my senior year*

**TLDR: Safeties aren't a joke. They're not a ""dumb kid"" thing, they're an ""every kid"" thing. EVERYONE needs to apply to at least one school with an acceptance rate that's over 50%, even if it's just for the peace of mind of having a college as a backup.**

Please, don't make my mistake. I'm more depressed than ever because of it.

***EDIT: Thank you for the advice! Gonna answer a few questions I've been getting here, so that I don't have to keep replying to them:***

* *I had no choice but to submit my subject tests to certain schools (Carnegie/MIT, looking at you!) Unfortunately for me, retaking them wasn't possible. I took them in November, since I decided on my major in October. A word of advice: Take a few subject tests junior year, even if you don't know what you're majoring in, so you have time to retake!*
* *Yep, my stats are a huge strugglebus. I am abundantly aware of this now. Please roast past me, not present me. Present me has the emotional strength of tissue paper.*
* *I'm from SoCal, if that affected the UC process in any way.*

All my plans for the summer is ruined, especially school is also ""kicking"" people out and we are in quarantine.

The company that I was going to intern at is a medium sized software company so maybe that's why they decided to cancel fairly easily. It truly sucks tho. I was hoping to work with them since it would be my first and only internship before I complete my masters degree (i was originally biology in college and switched to bioinfo but switching to CS now). 
Ngl, I'm so jealous seeing other big companies sending out confirmations saying they won't cancel. 

Regardless, hope everyone the best and won't experience this"

I’m graduating this semester. I haven’t even started applying for jobs because I’m scared. 

What do people with low GPAs do after college (grad school isn’t even an option)?

Or even younger. Due to my circumstances growing up I wasn’t really able to make a lot of friends. I started college at age 18 and I stopped after my first two years because I just felt like I needed to move to a new place. I ended up following my parents to a new city and decided to study engineering. Now I had to take a semester off which at the time I thought ok that’s fine but in reality I ended up losing a lot of my work ethic since I couldn’t get any internships or any good jobs for that matter other than delivering pizza. Started school and fell into a deep neurotic state trying to keep up with my classes and developing so much anxiety that I ended up almost dropping out. (And this was due to the fact that I didn’t have any friends in this new university and I felt incredibly lonely just constantly studying in the library) Now I feel like just killing my self deciding what I really want to do with my life. Or if it’s worth continuing. I ended up just sleeping more and running away from doing anything involving studying. Every time I would open up a book or try studying something I would lose my mind thinking I’m just going to fail. I know that in order for me to improve and I need to keep trying but part me feels like I just gave up all hope. Like I just want to die in my sleep. How do you guys deal with this? If I had to make analogy I would say that I’ve been climbing a mountain my whole life trying to struggle to get to the top but I keep getting pushed down and down and down and now I feel like I’m back at square one.... like I don’t even feel like doing something as simple as eating a full meal.

fohcv6,25,2020-03-24,Dear Admissions...,Bear6415,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fohcv6/dear_admissions/,"I originally wrote this for my school newspaper (but it was canceled due to covid), so I decided to share here:)

Dear College Admissions,

It’s the end of March now—the time when we finally hear back from you. The culmination of our time spent together. So let’s take a little recap of our relationship, shall we?

For some of us, you have taken up serious real estate in our minds since early high school. Dragged on college visit trips with siblings, we got a taste of what being with you was like—but we still had no idea how evil you were. For the rest of us, you crept up on us Junior year, measuring our worth on a 1600 or 36 point scale and expecting us to become best friends with our teachers—no, our art teacher doesn’t count—*core academic teachers* only.

The following summer, many of us worked hard to please you—taking on internships, research camps, and summer courses. But when the end of summer came around, nearly all of us had forgotten the piece of advice that still echoes in our minds today: “START EARLY!” We started senior year laughing with friends about how we haven’t even set up a Common App account or thought of a Common App essay idea. But as months start to pass and we realized that school was still difficult and our extracurriculars were still demanding, we started to panic—our early apps were due in a week, and you had no mercy. 

So naturally, we locked ourselves in our room and the serious work began. We opened a google doc and titled it, which warranted a quick two hour break for our efforts. After we returned from our YouTube spiral, we were forced to reflect on ourselves to answer the essay questions. What makes me interesting? What have I done that’s unique? We soon found ourselves in the midst of an identity crisis as we realized the answer to both questions was “nothing” and we felt like we didn’t truly know ourselves and were nothing special. *When will we ever be good enough for you?* To distract ourselves, we googled the school we were applying to and soon found ourselves on College Confidential. Our hearts sank as we saw yet another kid asking if he’ll get into Harvard after curing a rare cancer and founding a nonprofit for starving children in Namibia. Our self esteem crushed, we got back to work, trying to get at least something down on the page. After we finally finished, we’re 300 words over the word limit, half the document was covered in spelling and grammar mistakes, it’s 1 am, and we haven’t started studying for calc yet. The cycle continued. Our bitterness towards you grew.

But don’t get us wrong! Sometimes you were quite pleasant. There was nothing like the relief of extended deadlines. The comfort of receiving college emails was also unparalleled. Seeing declarations of love from the 25 random colleges in our inbox boosted our self-esteem. 

December soon approached, and our relationship became tense. You broke many of our hearts, leaving us collecting the shards while still writing you more applications as you so generously gave us another chance. As the end of December neared, our panic intensified—we still had ten more colleges to apply to by January 1st and we were going on vacation next week!

So we sat on the beach, trying to concentrate on relaxing, but it was still just you on our mind. 

Come January 1st, we’re in a hoodie and sweats, staring at our computers in the dark with our brains fried and fingers numb from typing, and thanking God for copy and paste. Then, we remembered that we forgot to send our scores, and our lives flash before our eyes.

By the end of the month, we’ve submitted everything to you, our hearts in our hands. But we’re worried—from the rumors, you’re quite unpredictable and unfair. But still, all we can do is hold our breath. 

So it’s finally the end of March—when we find out if you’ve accepted us or not. It seems like everything we’ve ever done has led up to this point. We want to make sure our tears, money spent on coffee, missed social events, mental breakdowns, and lost sleep weren’t all for nothing. So, please. Be kind to us. 

Sincerely, 

Stressed-Out Seniors"

The startup biotech company I was working for lost all funding and went under due to the pandemic, so I was recently laid off from my job as a (pseudo) systems administrator. A little background...

I joined on as an IT tech to fulfill my internship requirement for my A.S. At that time, most of the sysadmin and network admin duties were being sourced out. Eventually, my boss gave me free reign to take control of any and all systems I cared to try.  

I feel like I made some big accomplishments for the 2 years I was there. These include:

\- Taking a flat network and implementing a fully-functioning VLAN network, complete with network security

\- Implemented and configured VPN with a Cisco ASA 5506

\-  Configured 3 bare metal servers from scratch with EXSi and Vsphere on each one and bringing them all into a Vcenter environment complete with HA, Vreplication and Vmotion

\- Took over administration of all Windows servers including AD, GP, Fileshare, and DNS

\- Configured any new Linux VMs that were needed (mostly CentOS)

\- Configured and administered VEEAM, Jenkins, and OOSEC

\- Worked alongside the Software Dev team on full-stack projects

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what am I missing? Everything I learned so far, I learned for this particular organization's needs. Are there any core skills that I am missing? What would a prospective employer expect of me during an interview?

Edit: I should also mention that this was a small business, no more than 50 employees / 100 workstations."

fojjw4,2,2020-03-24,Should I Accept This Aerospace Job?,ocicrab,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fojjw4/should_i_accept_this_aerospace_job/,"I'm a senior at a top mechanical engineering college with 4.0 GPA and great internship/project experience (I'm super grateful for the opportunities I've had the past two years!). Completing my Master's Degree in Aerospace engineering this December.

Because I don't graduate for another 9 months, I haven't been actively job searching, especially since few companies hire this far in advance. Through a career fair I ended up talking to a company, getting an interview and was offered a job. I've been going back and forth on whether to accept the job or not, and would love some input!

Nearly everything about this job seems fantastic:

* Pay is very good ($70k starting in inexpensive Buffalo, NY plus straight overtime pay) and benefits are good (insurance, 401k, stock options). Most other aerospace companies have lower entering salaries or are in very high cost of living areas like LA.
* The culture is fantastic, many people stay at the company for most of their career. Great mentorship. I know several people who have interned at the company and one who works there full-time and they have only great things to say about the company.
* The position seems right up my alley in terms of the kind of work I'd be doing. A mix of mechanical design, controls engineering, systems engineering. It sounds like it would give me a very solid foundation for my career in the aerospace industry. Plus, the teams are very flexible allowing each employee to cater their position towards their interests/expertise. Many people switch between teams after a few years, or decide to learn something new by switching from design to analysis for example. Overall seems like I would learn a ton in the specific type of work that I hope to do, and could be a great stepping stone towards projects/roles that I'm really interested in.
* The manager seems really good and people-focused. He would set me up with a few mentors on a project to learn what I need to learn and take on more responsibility relatively quickly.

However, I'm not particularly excited about the projects:

* I have always been extremely passionate about space exploration, hoping to work on flagship space projects. With my current experience (internships at NASA's JPL and SpaceX, and research group designing CubeSats), I'm sufficiently qualified for entry level jobs at most space companies. The company with the job offer DOES do work for the aerospace industry, but it's a subcontractor that supplies high-precision/performance components to the large aerospace companies. So while the work I would be doing MAY go into space, it would be as a small part of another, more exciting project.
* Additionally, the company has teams that work on Space, Aircraft, and Defense applications. My team is primarily in the defense side, which isn't particularly exciting to me. With the flexibility, I may have opportunities to work on space projects or eventually move to a space team, but no guarantees.
* Although the experience I would be getting is spot-on in terms of my interests, the fact that it isn't space systems means that I'll miss out on getting more exposure to problems that are unique to space (materials cold-welding/outgassing, radiation, orbital mechanics, attitude determination, etc.)

Then in comes COVID-19:

* Markets crashing, people losing jobs. It now seems very uncertain what the job market will look like in a few months. On one hand, it might be very wise to accept a job while I have an offer in-hand as it might be very difficult to find the kinds of jobs I'm looking for in the coming months AKA don't be picky during the impending depression. On the other hand, if the market was fine, I would not be worried much about landing the right job because of my experience/qualifications and the 9 months I have before I graduate (it's also okay if I don't have a job lined up straight out of college (could live at home) so I really have up to a year or so to find another job if I turn this one down).

Should I take the offer I have? It's a great company culture, great salary/benefits, work that I'm interested in doing/getting experience with, but it doesn't have the exciting space factor that I've been working for so long to achieve. It could, however, be a good stepping stone for me to land a more exciting job 3-5 years down the road. If I accept it, I might miss out on even better opportunities once I start applying to other companies. If I decline it, I run the risk of being unemployed in the coming job market or not finding a job that's well-aligned with the experience I hope to get."

Looking for general advice for large tech companies (eg big 4), other major Bay Area tech firms as well as startups. 

Current freshman here studying CS and Economics, looking to recruit for SWE internships for the summer of '21. I know it's fairly premature, but I don't have anything lined up for half of the summer (taking classes in the first half) and I want to get a headstart on recruiting in the fall. 

I know quite a few people who've bagged offers from Google/Microsoft (which have dedicated programs for freshmen/sophomores) as well as Amazon. What exactly does it take to land one of these internships, and how can I prepare for them? 

I've also met a lot of people going to Bay Area companies that are super prestigious in the tech world, but a little less well known outside (Slack, Stripe, Palantir etc.). However, most of them intern post junior year and already have previous internship experience. Is there any way a sophomore could realistically get a spot at one of those companies and if so, how? 

Another thing I'm considering is interning at a startup, which will probably be a little more feasible given my sophomore standing. My school has a program which connects kids to startups as well as a career fair, so I plan on doing that. Any general tips for startup recruiting would also be appreciated! 

P.S - I've completed coursework in Discrete math, introductory OOP and I'll be taking a data strcutues class over the spring. I've also been working as an app developer for my school's newspaper. I'm considering applying for TA positions in the fall as it's something I'm passionate about - will that help?

folad7,32,2020-03-25,"Clearing up CS, 'fintech' misconceptions + AMA",TopCancel,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/folad7/clearing_up_cs_fintech_misconceptions_ama/,"A lot of HS students (and I was right there with ya'll when I was in HS) seem to have misconceptions about CS, both from an academic and professional perspective. I don't claim to be even close to an expert, but over the past several years, I've learned a lot about the CS 'meta' if you will, both from experience (failing a lot of interviews lol) and from chatting with professionals in the field (senior managers and devs at 'big N', traders, quants, etc). I hope I can clear up some of the misconceptions that ya'll may have and answer any follow-ups.

Misconceptions (in no particular order):

* You need to be good at coding/already know how to code before college

Nope. I personally didn't know a lick of coding before college and I'm doing just fine. Same with a lot of my peers. And my school doesn't give out free As unlike another school in the bay *cough*. 

* School/prestige doesn't matter (i.e. tech is meritocratic) 

Yeah, maybe more than finance (because of the grueling technical interview loops), but not nearly as much as people think. Even for big companies with the resources to cast a wide net (and look for 'diamonds in the rough' at podunk U), there's inherent bias at every level of the hiring process. And most elite prop shops/quant hedge funds will forgo on-campus recruiting at anything but top schools, similar to top management consulting firms. 

* CS 'ranking' matters way more than overall 'ranking'

This is also a common misconception; the Ivys are actually really well represented in Silicon Valley even though they aren't as 'good' at CS. It's generally better to go to a super elite school than to go to a higher ranked for CS  school. Anecdote: At my Goldman tech superday, there was this random dude from Yale who had taken like, 2 CS classes total. Maybe Goldman really just loves the Ivy league but pretty much everyone else was from top CS schools (CMU, Cal, MIT, GaTech, etc). This is even more blatant, again, with prop shops like JS or 2Sigma or quant hedgefunds like Bridgewater. Another anecdote: a boutique quant hedge fund I talked with at a career fair bluntly told me they only hired new grads and interns at two schools. 

* fintech is fintech

Fintech is Stripe, Square, Visa *NOT* prop trading, high frequency trading, 'quant' or whatever.

* the money is good

no the money is obscene. I bring this up because it can actually change your financial situation. I have many peers who ended up being able to cover their tuition entirely with their internship salaries. Some are able to cover living expenses as well. So even though the 'better' school may be more expensive in terms of sticker cost, the increased opportunities (like internships) from going to the better school may offset the cost difference. 

Basically, if you want to study CS and are at all interested at 'quant' or being a dev at a place that has quants, you should be shooting for the best school you can. If you want to work at FAANG or a big N or whatever, it's still best to go to the best school you can (on some balance of CS and overall prestige) because it still does make a difference. Feel free to ama."

I am currently interning for an MSP 3 days a week on the service desk. I am also undergoing cancer treatment.

This internship is my first real IT experience, and it has been extremely stressful on top of being sick. I also currently don't have any benefits and am making minimum wage.

I really do not feel right now that I am in the right frame of mind, and somehow working from home has made this job even more stressful.

Would it be right for me to quit right now or would that make me a big pussy? I currently live with my mom and she is able to support me a bit for now but I am always looking for employment (when in good health). I plan on looking for full time positions when I am in the right frame of mind as well as considering working at UPS again."

Just wanted to throw out a Chance Me for both accuracy on a few schools and actual chances for a few others especially with Death Day aka Ivy Day coming up

I'm also deathly scared that someone who knows me will find this so I might take this down if I suspect that my identity has been discovered. Therefore, I am very sorry about all the parts where I decided not to share a piece of info and probably made it harder for an accurate Chance Me. However, my curiosity has overwhelmed my fear so here I am making this post

**Demographics:** female, Asian, CA (Bay Area), large public high school

**Intended Major(s):** math/applied math (I put this on all my apps but not totally sure yet)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

SAT: 1590 (790 Eng, 800 Math)

SAT II: 800 Math, 800 Bio M, 800 Chinese (kinda useless), 770 Bio E (didn't send)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.97 UW, 4.44 W, school doesn't do ranks but I think I'm Top 5 or 10 (I would say my school is decently competitive and pretty challenging overall)

**Coursework:** basically the most advanced track in our school, also lots of self study

AP Courses: 10th - Bio, World History, 11th - Calc BC, Chem, APUSH, Eng Lang, 12th - Stats, Phys C, APES, Eng Lit, Gov

AP Self Study: Chinese, Phys 1, Micro, Macro, Psych

AP Scores: all 5's except 4 on Macro (for ones taken before 12th)

College/Dual Enrollment: DE in Spanish 3 &amp; 4, 1 yr band, took Multivar at community college 1st sem senior year

**Awards:** National Merit Semifinalist, National AP Scholar, PVSA Gold Award (3 yrs) - volunteering award, I'll put more in ECs

**Extracurriculars:**

??? - One of my main extracurriculars relating to math is pretty unique but will also be a dead giveaway as to who I am so I won't be including it. I participated since I was 5 and won multiple international awards for it as well. Founded a youth organization for this in freshman yr with other students. I created curriculum for this EC and was a volunteer teacher at an afterschool for 4 years of high school. I also got a paid job for teaching this at a different afterschool in junior &amp; senior year.

Math Club - 4 yrs (Treasurer 10th, Pres 11th-12th). Coached elementary and middle school math clubs all 4 yrs of high school as well. Awards: AIME qualifier (3 yrs), attended Math Prize for Girls (3 yrs), placed at Stanford Math Tournament, a few other small things.

Dance - dancing since I was 5 yrs old, submitted dance supplements to most of my schools (privates), multiple 1st place awards (and a 1st place at a national comp for my solo in junior year summer which I'm still pretty proud of lol), the type of dance I do is also pretty unique but also a bit of a giveaway :)

Volunteering - founded a volunteer youth org in freshman year, did lots of performances at senior centers, volunteered at a program for special needs kids, some other misc stuff, accumulated around 200-300 hrs each year of high school (mostly for teaching math &amp; that first EC, as well as some of this other stuff I just mentioned)

Spanish Club - Treasurer 11th, I got into this through taking Spanish at school, participated in the Spanish dance show all 4 years of high school &amp; helped choreograph for 3 yrs,

Science - a bit scattered, did SciOly in 9th, did SciBowl in 12th, accepted into an online science program thing that is decently well known (I think) in 10th grade &amp; continued through 12th

Music - played flute from for 6 years, but quit in beginning of 11th, played in a flute ensemble &amp; did lots of performances, mentioned in my activities but that's about it

Summers! - participated in a pretty prestigious summer math camp for 10th &amp; 11th grade summers, participated in a less well known one in 9th summer, a few weeks of internship at a biotech company in 11th summer as well, national dance competition for about a week every summer, attended an international comp for the first EC in 9th

Research - did research at my summer math camp at the second year in a group of studnets, presented at JMM and trying to get published in a journal!!!

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I think my CommonApp essay was decent, a few of my supplements for RD privates were slightly rushed but still ok since I reused a lot of my early essays (which I would say were pretty well written and thought out, as I started in May for earlies), UC app essays also solid. Lots of essays about the first EC involving both learning and teaching, a lot about dance, some math essays, and a few more about gardening &amp; skiing (hobbies), volunteering, etc. I did have a counselor for my essays, so that obviously helped a lot (since my natural talent for writing is practically 0)

LORs: I got one from my AP Chem teacher and one from my APUSH teacher. I would say both recs were pretty solid since both teachers liked me decently well. One plus for my LORs is that my school counselor knew me by name and said she would right me a more personal rec instead of one from a template (rare in a large public school where each counselor has to write for like 100 seniors each year)

**Overall:** Personally, going into the college admissions process, I thought my grades, standardized testing &amp; ECs were pretty solid, just unsure about my essays &amp; LORs.

**Schools:** MIT (EA), Caltech (EA), Ivies (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, UPenn, Columbia), UCs (UCB, UCLA, UCSB, UCD, UCI, UCSD, UCSC), Stanford, Duke, USC, UIUC \[some for actual chances &amp; some for accuracy\]

\^and yes this does include all the schools I applied to this year

If you got this far, thank you for reading through all this, and I really appreciate your input. If I feel comfortable doing so, I will update this with my actual results in a few days after all my schools come out with decisions. Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy!"

&amp;#x200B;

I have zero motivation or ambition, or desire to make something of myself. I have nothing left to give. I'm spent. I'd hate to see myself in another two or three years time, time spent self-loathing and wallowing in despair as I watch time pass by and I still haven't done anything with infinite time.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't wanna study. I don't wanna bore my brains out studying business, the only thing I'm half smart at but bores the hell out of me, for four years, just to get a crappy internship, to get a crappy full-time job that I'll do for 45 hours a week, paying barely enough after taxes to make ends meet, a job that is a 45 minute trip each way because I can't afford to live closer, so I can make enough to pay rent on a house I'll never own. I'll never get married and have kids; I suck with chicks and have never seen myself as able to commit emotionally to somebody else. Ya I could get married but then she'd just leave me at 40 years old when I'm balding and fat and I'd have nothing to live for, wasting an entire 20 years on where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't the meaning of life. If somebody were to come down and tell me that's exactly what my job and life is going to be, I'd end it all right now. I cannot do that for the rest of my life. I only want to live if I can be successful, but I'm so lazy and dead inside that it's just not feasible. I can't commit to anything. I barely do anything with all my time and I still can't cope with university - it's like I'm addicted to failure and coming up short. I used to be smart and bright, and I'd wow my peers with my general smarts and ability to absorb information so easily. I don't have that anymore; some time in my last year of high school my brain just fried and I couldn't do school anymore. I only did okay on my final exams and I took a year off to refresh and try and find happiness and satisfaction (all the spare time and lack of working toward anything just led to unfulfillment  and even worse depression than I already had in school).

&amp;#x200B;

But if I don't study and get a job in that area for the small chance that I wind up somewhere that pays handsomely and I can buy my happiness, what else is there?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't work a trade. It's just not me. Do I become one of those guys who just works an unqualified job for the rest of his life - supermarket manager or something? Meh, same as before - overworked, pay sucks and nobody will want to be with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have talents. I suck at everything and always have. That's why I relied on my intelligence so much but now I'm not even an average trucker - I stink at working and learning now too.

&amp;#x200B;

Man I wish I didn't have family that loved me and a few friends from school that still talk to me. I'd love to go without shattering anybody. I wish I could cease to exist and nobody would even care or remember who I was.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is 100% regret. I hate me and who I've become, and I can't see myself ever being happy. I could win a billion dollars in the lottery and never work a day again and I'd be bored and lonely. Life is a trap. I never asked to be born.

&amp;#x200B;

Like seriously, life sucks. What are people working for or toward? I tell you what, I have nothing but admiration for those who can walk through each day with a smile on their face. It's been a long time since the last time I smiled. A very long time."
forfco,29,2020-03-25,"the closer I get, the more I fail",damondan,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/forfco/the_closer_i_get_the_more_i_fail/,"I am 27 already and still in college, mostly due to a lifetime of emotional abuse and apparently undiagnosed ADHD.

college was the first time in my life when I truly felt better about myself and was incredibly active and driven.

yet again after  2.5 years of studying, I had a major breakdown last year and had to take an entire semester off, because I was utterly depressed and suicidal for about 18 months. it nearly killed me.

within my smog of depression I naturally fell into a hellfire of selfhate and doubt and no longer wanted to continue with my degree.

yet again I kept on going. I transferred to another college near my hometown, of which I originally had fled. but I had realized that I can travel to the end of the world and it doesn't make a difference. I carry my demons with me wherever I go.

so I transferred back near my hometown, which was an incredibly complicated process, took me 6 months to finally have everything official and I lost 40 creditpoints (out of 210 total), so basically 1.5 semesters.

still, it was too late by then to go back.

I proceeded with an obligatory semester of internship. 6 months fulltime, while still suicidal and depressed.

I lived at home again, with my mom and little brother.

I felt like a complete failure. too old, too stupid, too ugly. just a horrible waste of space.

yet again i kept going.

I fought through my demons, I did all the work I had to do, I kept on searching for a flatshare in the city I study now. I had a look at 8 flatshares and all of them didn't want me, which was devastating.

winter was there in full force. 

also I had issues with a long-distance relationship. a girl I had met at a mental health hospital. I loved her but could not cope with the distance due to my circumstances. so I broke up.

so there I was. 27. pursuing a degree I don't even want. just broke up. depressed. suicidal. lonely. just a fucking mess.

but I fought through. I got into therapy. I started educating myself about my conditions. I found a flatshare. I started to enjoy my intership. I actually did so good that they wanted to hire me parttime while I am still in college! I made new friends. I started enjoying life again. i started living again!

last month was the first time in several years that I truly felt alive and as if I finally had my shit together! I felt amazing!

college was about to start!
I had that cool parttime job in a company that actually appreciated me.
I was about to finally move into a flatshare and meet new people.
I wanted to join an impro-theater group and a mediation group.
I wanted to finally start working out again.
spring and summer are approaching!
I can finally socialize!

this is it. I am finally starting my own life I thought!

3 weeks later:

Coronavirus. A pandemic.
college is postponed and nobody has a clue about how things will develop. most likely I will have to learn everything by myself from home. (screams in ADHD) If I hadn't had that major breakdown last year, I would have  been done with my degree this May! now it will take me at least 1.5 years longer.

people here are advised to NOT move into a new place aka my flatshare.

social life is nonexisten everywhere.

gyms are closed. theatergroup is dead. mediationgroup vanished.

and I just got laid off from my parttime job, because the company had to close down.

oh and my adhd-meds have helped for a while, but at the same time they are causing really bad sideffects and blow my anxiety through the roof.

I was so fucking close. so fucking close. and now only 3 weeks later, I just want to cry myself into oblivion. fuck me."
forjy7,0,2020-03-25,Has my passport doomed me?,thegoldengamer123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/forjy7/has_my_passport_doomed_me/,"I'm currently an Indian undergraduate student at a top-20 American university with majors in computer science, computer engineering and financial engineering. I also have a lot of stuff on my resume to show. (Well, except for internships but that's in progress)

That said, I've been getting increasingly worried about my career prospects after graduation. Looking for internships, the vast majority of jobs and openings I've either require a US citizenship, or are the ""outsource-y"" kind of places making it immensely hard to get an internship compared to my peers who get interviews every week.

I suspect a big part of this is my citizenship. Once I graduate college, has my citizenship doomed me? I'm worried that I'll get lumped in with the stereotypical ""outsourced indian programmer"" when I apply and miss out on opportunities.

I suppose my question is then threefold:
1. Will I be at a significant disadvantage due to my passport?
2. If so, was studying in the US a bad investment compared to other countries?
3. How do I set myself as far apart as possible in order compete with my American peers?

Alternatively, am I just getting worked up about something that is not a realistic possibility?"

Obviously, the US is one of the planet's largest economies and Silicon Valley is the tech birthplace of the world. Almost all the large tech giants are located there.

Nonetheless, a lot of these companies also have huge offices in (Western) Europe, such as Amazon in Luxembourg, Google in Zurich and Facebook in London.

Now, I after researching various internship position at FAANG-like companies in both places, it can be seen that the compensation in the US is ENORMOUS (i.e. Facebook: 8000 USD/month, Google: 7500 USD/month, Lyft: almost 10K/month).
The highest compensation packages I could find in Europe were mainly in Switzerland and the UK (Google: 5K/month, Facebook: approx 5K/month - which is already a lot, tbh... ). 
Large companies in other european countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg seem to pay at most 2K/month to their interns.

I wondered, why is this the case?

Due to housing and living costs? 
I could strongly argue that living in London and Zurich is still very expensive.

Due to higher education level?
I believe there are some excellent technical unis in Europe as well...

Due to Europe being a smaller market? Maybe...

fov29j,3,2020-03-25,I'm Having a Hard Time Picking My Specialization (LONG),TigerLillians,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/fov29j/im_having_a_hard_time_picking_my_specialization/,"Hello there! As my second year in college is coming to a close I'm now forced by my college to apply for an engineering specialization. My main problem is that I don't think I have a GPA high enough for computer science, really the only engineering specialization that interests me, and I'm having problems coming up with second, third, and all the way to fifth choices. I'm lost and I honestly don't know what to do. I find that writing things helps me put together my thoughts and am curious to see what other people think of my current situation if you're willing to read through all of this. No TL;DR's here.  

When initially coming to college I knew I liked engineering because I was in a VEX robotic engineering project team, was in two different coding clubs, and had internship experience as a project management intern for a friend's startup engineering firm. I found out when at the firm, that I really don't care for circuitry, so electrical and computer engineering possibly ruled out as a result but I wasn't really exposed to a lot of it. So, I was going into college with the expectation of possibly a more general engineering major with a PM minor or computer science.

In college, I found out that I genuinely hate chemistry (to be completely fair, I had an awful teacher) and I've hated biology since I can remember so that rules out chemical engineering and biomedical. I also would like a stable job market considering the possible recession that's going to happen, so petroleum engineering is out of the question as well (not that it interested me much anyway) and any architectural engineering (however, I was slightly interested in this one). During my first semester, I really screwed up trying to work full-time in addition to being a full-time student and tanked my GPA. Made a D in government. I can't really recover from that as well as not making good grades throughout my time as a freshman and a sophomore due to family emergencies constantly happening. 

Also, I joined an all women's VEX team (had problems with the prior one in high school but kept with it at the time as I loved it so much and was a good resume booster) and found myself on the programming team. I really enjoyed testing to see if my code works, and making changes based on the results. During the state competition, I was one of two girls who stayed up late recoding our entire autonomous code because it wasn't working. We finished around 5 AM and had to get up at 7 AM. 

During the competition, instead of finding myself working on one computer on one robot with the entire programming team (8 girls, too many cooks in the kitchen situation) I found myself looking at how the design of the robot could be better. I've always liked designing things and I genuinely enjoyed researching online and looking for newer claws, or lifts that would better suit our needs. Even drawing out a baseline of plans, and writing a quick script in Python to see that if we make the measurements x then we will have to rotate y and z joints i degrees. Going back to the researching part, one girl from the mechanical team saw what I was doing and for probably a couple of hours we sat together discussing the pros and cons of each design and seeing which best would work together. I also enjoyed the documentation. When I presented this to the head of the mechanical team I was immediately offered a position on their team while my programming head (the other girl who stayed up late with me recoding) almost looked panicked as I was probably the most dedicated on my team. Kinda decided that I would float in-between the two groups as prior to the competition I had also taken a look at our robot from an outsider's perspective (I joined the team later in the year) and was able to point out all the design flaws. 

Moving onto specific college classes, I want to briefly mention that I absolutely loved my introductory coding class to Python as it is similar to Java Script which I had learned in high school, and I was able to basically teach the rest of my team how to code because of that. I didn't really enjoy the team aspect of it namely because of the disparity between our skill levels. I also had a university physics lecture and lab. The lecture was pretty good, didn't mind physics, just had a bad teacher and was able to make a good grade because of my tutor. For the lab, I adored it though. They would post what we were planning on doing in lab online before the class and I would come in with all of the mathematically proofs done along with the necessary charts to explain the physics parts (aka free body diagrams). However, I again didn't like the team aspect but for the different reasons of treatment being the only woman in our group, and me and one other (thank god for him though I enjoyed working with him) pulling the majority of the weight. I am also taking engineering project management and I absolutely love it and am considering a minor in engineering project management. 

Now for my current options. Obviously, computer science is still my number one choice, but it is one of most competitive majors to get into at my college that they really don't consider those below a 3.3 cumulative GPA average and I'm nowhere near that. I went to a seminar about industrial engineering and was actually thinking of putting that as number one, but looking at the major requirements it doesn't interest me one bit. Not interested in aerospace engineering, civil, ocean, or nuclear. Thought about mechanical engineering but that's even harder to get into with people who are above the 3.5 GPA auto admit threshold being asked if they would switch majors. The department of engineering technology and distribution really piques my interest, which industrial distribution being the most followed by (not in any particular order) manufacturing and mechanical engineering technology, electronic systems engineering technology (hesitant because of circuits), and multidisciplinary engineering technology on the mechatronics tract. I'm hesitant to go into these majors because they are strictly classified as engineering technology and I'm constantly told whenever I bring them up that it is not as open-ended as 'normal' engineering majors and as a result, is not as applicable to different jobs. Not even to mention that the average salaries and the projected job growth for these majors aren't that great in comparison to other engineering majors. 

Now, looking outside the college of engineering. If I go outside of the college, I'll still be able to come out with an associate in engineering if I take enough classes, so at least my two years in this will be for completely nothing. Honestly, if there was just a sort of 'design' engineering major that would teach me CAD, coding, and other online software I would choose that. I love designing things and have had a 3D printer in the past and loved using it. The best equivalent I've found in my university is in a different college: BS in visualization in the college of architecture. The salaries can't be compared to the engineering ones at my university, so if I wind up happy with an engineering major I am really considering double majoring. If I'm not at all happy then I might go to the college of science with a BS in applied mathematics with a computational emphasis. Basically like computer science but focuses more on math than the coding aspect so although it is a good back up, computer science is still number one. In the same college AND department of computer science, there is a BA in computing... however, it is so close in its program requirements to a BS in computer science that I don't want to take it literally just the difference of not taking 3-4 upper-level science classes. I'm lucky enough to be able to say that my parents are paying for my education and I have brought it up to them before and I'm doubtful they'd be happy (there is a chance) and not pay for a BA for me. I don't blame them at all for doing this and I really don't want a BA either. Now for my university's college of business. As previously stated I love project management and while at my internship I was also exposed a lot to the supply chain. Specifically, in the department of information and operations management, with both of the BBA in management information systems and BBA in supply chain management. I am hesitant to make such a big jump in majors as not only is it hard to get into my university's college of business but I if leave there's no way I'll really ever be eligible to come back to the college of engineering. I'm thinking that if the business world still does interest me I can get a master's in science in management information systems which is also non-thesis one. There's a 4+1 program for this master where I include in some of the prereqs in my 4-year degree (definitely not getting out of here in four years that's for sure) and only have to take the graduate-level classes for one additional year. Again the problem is with my GPA for getting into this though.

&amp;#x200B;

My ideal scenario? 

Associate: Engineering (this I'm going to get regardless of anything since I'm so close)

Major: Computer Science/Visualization

Minor: Engineering Project Management/Math? (would only have to take 2-3 more classes for math with CS requirements)

Masters: Management Information Systems

&amp;#x200B;

Despite having an awful GPA, I love being in college. I like classes, learning, and although they are hard, I like the challenge. That's why I'm probably loading myself up for a lot and am probably not going to leave anytime soon. It's probably too much but I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm just not willing to pull all-nighters and affect my physical and mental health to make As in all my classes. I'll put in the work, mind you, but I won't kill myself for a letter--despite my anxiety eating me up for the not as good letters. 

Well. This kinda helped me. I feel a bit better having this all written down, but I need to get together and submit a degree plan within the week, and next week Entry to A Major (ETAM) opens up but stays open for submission for about a whole month. I just don't want to write my essays during finals if you get what I mean. 

If you read through all of this kudos to you, thank you for your time, please let me know what you think of this all. I hope everyone is having a good day and is staying safe. Thanks"

There is one more school I have yet to hear from but since they are my ""safety"" and I am not concerned about their decision I won't name them. 

Honestly I thought it was a long shot for me because I was a mediocre student in college (I had like a 3.2 GPA) but I did well on my first try on the GRE and didn't take it again. I also am currently working as a data analyst and had an internship during undergrad. No research experience. Only one faculty member wrote me a recommendation (she also is/was the dept chair) and the other two were from my internship and current job, respectively. I had my personal statements proofread by the aforementioned faculty member and a trusted friend who is pursuing a PhD at Harvard currently and their notes helped a ton.

foyc0d,1,2020-03-25,Should I accept this Aerospace Job?,ocicrab,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/foyc0d/should_i_accept_this_aerospace_job/," I'm a senior at a top mechanical engineering college with 4.0 GPA and great internship/project experience (I'm super grateful for the opportunities I've had the past two years!). Completing my Master's Degree in Aerospace engineering this December.

Because I don't graduate for another 9 months, I haven't been actively job searching, especially since few companies hire this far in advance. Through a career fair I ended up talking to a company, getting an interview and was offered a job. I've been going back and forth on whether to accept the job or not, and would love some input!

Nearly everything about this job seems fantastic:

* Pay is very good ($70k starting in inexpensive Buffalo, NY plus straight overtime pay) and benefits are good (insurance, 401k, stock options). Most other aerospace companies have lower entering salaries or are in very high cost of living areas like LA.
* The culture is fantastic, many people stay at the company for most of their career. Great mentorship. I know several people who have interned at the company and one who works there full-time and they have only great things to say about the company.
* The position seems right up my alley in terms of the kind of work I'd be doing. A mix of mechanical design, controls engineering, systems engineering. It sounds like it would give me a very solid foundation for my career in the aerospace industry. Plus, the teams are very flexible allowing each employee to cater their position towards their interests/expertise. Many people switch between teams after a few years, or decide to learn something new by switching from design to analysis for example. Overall seems like I would learn a ton in the specific type of work that I hope to do, and could be a great stepping stone towards projects/roles that I'm really interested in.
* The manager seems really good and people-focused. He would set me up with a few mentors on a project to learn what I need to learn and take on more responsibility relatively quickly.

However, I'm not particularly excited about the projects:

* I have always been extremely passionate about space exploration, hoping to work on flagship space projects. With my current experience (internships at NASA's JPL and SpaceX, and research group designing CubeSats), I'm sufficiently qualified for entry level jobs at most space companies. The company with the job offer DOES do work for the aerospace industry, but it's a subcontractor that supplies high-precision/performance components to the large aerospace companies. So while the work I would be doing MAY go into space, it would be as a small part of another, more exciting project.
* Additionally, the company has teams that work on Space, Aircraft, and Defense applications. My team is primarily in the defense side, which isn't particularly exciting to me. With the flexibility, I may have opportunities to work on space projects or eventually move to a space team, but no guarantees.
* Although the experience I would be getting is spot-on in terms of my interests, the fact that it isn't space systems means that I'll miss out on getting more exposure to problems that are unique to space (materials cold-welding/outgassing, radiation, orbital mechanics, attitude determination, etc.)

Then in comes COVID-19:

* Markets crashing, people losing jobs. It now seems very uncertain what the job market will look like in a few months. On one hand, it might be very wise to accept a job while I have an offer in-hand as it might be very difficult to find the kinds of jobs I'm looking for in the coming months AKA don't be picky during the impending depression. On the other hand, if the market was fine, I would not be worried much about landing the right job because of my experience/qualifications and the 9 months I have before I graduate (it's also okay if I don't have a job lined up straight out of college (could live at home) so I really have up to a year or so to find another job if I turn this one down).

Should I take the offer I have? It's a great company culture, great salary/benefits, work that I'm interested in doing/getting experience with, but it doesn't have the exciting space factor that I've been working for so long to achieve. It could, however, be a good stepping stone for me to land a more exciting job 3-5 years down the road. If I accept it, I might miss out on even better opportunities once I start applying to other companies. If I decline it, I run the risk of being unemployed in the coming job market or not finding a job that's well-aligned with the experience I hope to get."

I've been dropped from the place that originally hired me, so I've given up trying to find something. My grant instructor said he was fine with me staying with my current employer because of the extraordinary circumstances we're all in right now. I went to my current boss two weeks ago and said ""hey, I'm still here. When do you want me to come down for the summer"" because their state is on lockdown. He told me he'd ask his boss. He hits me up today saying that they were all under the impression I wasn't coming back and they started the hiring process for someone else. He said that he'd see how far along they are with the hiring process for this other guy to see if they can still keep me. I told him it's no big deal if they can't keep me because it's my fuck-up.

After that conversation. I had two places reach out to me for interviews. I feel terrible. I'm still going to interview for these places because I lose my grant if I don't get one. I need income for the summer. At the same time, I feel like I'm screwing over someone else from having an internship that they likewise desperately need, and I definitely feel like I'm screwing over my boss. Part of me really hopes that they choice that other guy over me."

I've become very disillusioned with life in the US, especially considering our pathetic joke of a healthcare system, and am looking for countries where it would not be too difficult to immigrate to with international credentials. I'd prefer to do intern year/specialty training in whatever country that may be as well. Income/paying off loans is not a huge factor for me, as I am lucky to go to a school where tuition is cheap.

I speak Spanish, Italian, and French, and learning another language would not be a problem for me. The current options I've identified are the UK, Sweden, Germany, and Finland (as far as I've found to be the easiest to go to with non EU credentials and also be able to place as an intern.) I am curious about other european countries as well however, as well as any good options there may be in South America. It'd be great to hear from any other non-EU graduates working in the EU as well!"

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a graduate mechanical engineering student at the UNIVERSITY and would love to use my combined knowledge of mechanical systems and software engineering to fill the POSITION position at COMPANY.  I believe my robotics knowledge and the experiences I’ve gained through my studies, research, and internships make me a great fit for this position.

I am interested in advancing the state-of-the-art robotics software made by your team.  I would love the opportunity to develop ROS applications for robotic platforms using my knowledge of control theory and simulation.  My most relevant experience comes from assembling and programming a 1/10th scale vehicle to autonomously race around the UNIVERSITY engineering center’s basement.  This project required integrating Python, C++, and ROS, and implemented algorithms for object avoidance and collision detection.  Through my coursework, I’ve also gained a solid understanding of robust multivariable control and knowledge of general machine learning and other related algorithms.  My research in the RESEARCH LAB primarily involved developing the SOFTWARE PACKAGE, an open-source package written in the Julia Language for simulating and controlling soft robotic platforms.  Additionally, through my time working in the lab and interning for a small engineering firm, I’ve learned that I thrive working with a small team of skilled individuals.

In conclusion, I think I would make a great addition to the COMPANY team. I would love the opportunity to further advance your cutting-edge products and work with clients to develop new and creative solutions to problems. I believe my strong programming skills and deep understanding of mechanical systems and robust control theory make me a great fit for the POSITION position. Most of all, I believe I will add value to your company and serve as an excellent resource for the future.

Thank you for reviewing my application. Please don’t hesitate to email or call me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,  
NAME"
fp0s3g,1,2020-03-25,Husband Received Job offer - not sure if he should take it - advice please!,Ailyra,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fp0s3g/husband_received_job_offer_not_sure_if_he_should/,"Hi!

We have been mulling things over for the last week, and I'm looking for outside perspective.  Some background that is odd: we currently technically maintain two households in 2 states due to his current job, although they are only a couple hours' drive from one another (therefore travel between is very cheap), he's with me approximately 50-60% of the time, and we do not own any property.  Complicating everything is that this is happening NOW, while the nation and world are in a whirlwind of uncertainty.  This is causing even more anxiety.

Here is where we stand on our Pro/Cons of the new job, starting with Neutral:

Neutral:

* Pay.  New job is in a more expensive state but comes with more money.  After rent and respective states' taxes, take home is estimated to be the exact same between the two jobs
* Same level position
* Both jobs offer travel for conferences (a must for him)
* Both jobs have similar PTO policies/benefits

Pros:

* New job is in the state we want to move back to, in one of the general areas we would be interested in living in
* New job is at a highly successful large company, in a cutting edge research division partnered with the government in areas my husband is very excited to have an opportunity to work in
* We have friends and family in the area where he would be moving
* New job has better retirement offerings/contribution
* Route to promotion is much faster at new job (he is unlikely to be eligible for promotion at his current company for 7+ years, versus 1+ at new company)
* New job offers potentially higher bonuses than current job
* New job has opportunity for much higher yearly raises
* New job might (this is not entirely certain, but suspected) be in a slightly better funded field than his current, and may be increasingly so in the future

Cons:

* Cost of living in new state is very high, commute times are higher, healthcare is more expensive with higher deductibles
* We would be long distance for quite some time before I could find a suitable job there (because I am also in a niche field, and the job market for my industry has absolutely been wiped out by coronavirus/economy), and we would have to pay to fly to see each other for basically just weekends because the new job does not offer much in the way of telecommuting
* Any job I get in the new state will offer significantly less PTO than I have now due to my level of seniority with my present company
* We have a very comfortable social network here
* I may not be able to keep some of my professional affiliations if I move jobs
* He currently has a government job (technically contractor, but very secure), so not sure if he would be losing some job security switching to private industry?
* He has to give up the projects he currently manages (which were his ideas that he has personally developed and has a lot of pride in), including the network of other facilities, students, and interns he has cultivated

As an unknown: My current job is incredibly stable (minus current coronavirus unknowns), and I have quite a bit of seniority and excellent benefits.  On the other hand, I have no opportunity for advancement, and minimal opportunity for more money (especially right now).  I'm effectively professionally stagnant, and would not be opposed to a new opportunity.  Moving would not guarantee an upward mobility, however, as my industry is quite small and I may be forced to look for similar level positions, lower level positions, and not necessarily more pay in order to make the move.

Would love to hear your advice Redditors!"

&gt;Pay &amp; Logistics aside, I'm wondering if anyone could share their experience with a data science/analytics internship. I've done a software engineering internship before and I have been interested in cloud technologies + software automation but I'm also curious to try something new (Data analytics internship) since Data 8/Data100 turned out to be kinda interesting. I'm also a sophomore so I'm wondering if I take the Data Analytics internship but end up not liking it, would it be possible to switch back to SWE (in terms of recruiting SWE internships for  Junior year  - would it be harder) .

However, prospects of getting a job here before I lose my subsidized housing is pretty much nil because things are gonna be shut down for quite a while because coronavirus is particularly bad here. I feel like I'm out of time, I have to find a decently high paying job by July or I'm fucked. My bf insists on teaching me  to code, he says its my best option (he used to work in the industry and has successfully taught other people from nothing) but I don't believe I can do it because I don't feel smart enough to do it, and I don't fit the image of a person who goes into the tech industry. My mom in high school told me she would be incredibly angry at me if I became a ""code monkey"", for example. I don't have an undying passion for anything, I don't have any internship experience besides a sales internship which didn't really teach me much of anything. I was thinking of doing marketing but it looks like most people who are pursuing that already have a ton of experience and are infinitely more qualified than me. I really don't know what to do, I have major depression and I don't see it getting any better with therapy or meds. If the economy keeps tanking and doesn't recover I may just give up entirely."

More relevant details: I'm an undergraduate majoring in statistics, and I've taken machine learning and data science classes, so my hope is that this academic background alongside a software engineering internship (at a F500 financial company) would prime me well getting my foot in the door for data science.

I was already worried about a recession since everyone was saying it was only a manner of time, but as a third-year, this quick descent into madness is not what I envisioned. So, let me give you my rundown. I am currently majoring in UX. I am set to graduate next year, but for some reason (probably statistics) my advisor just ignored my minor when giving me my classes. I am nearly certain to take another year to graduate (scholarship covers it as long as I don't take all of a major's class).
I have a couple of kinda related internships. My actual abroad internship got canceled. Yay! I know I can work on some of my other skills to have a better chance. However, UX does not have any kind of labor statistics. From what I found, it is around 10% growth rate and the salary is DECREASING (for entry-level folks). I took a gander out to their sub and there are quite a few
who are saying that the entry-level field is saturated (my University is one of the few who actually has an actual degree program, so it might be Bootcamp grads). I was thinking of grad school, but some say that grad school is for AFTER you got experience and not a sub.

So, onto adding another major. I was looking into tech writing. They also say that their market might be flooded with entry-level talent. Amazing. Also, only 8% job growth.

Looked into IT (my minor) and they say experience trumps everything. Great. I just remember the reason I switched from a more IT major to an IT minor is because I was NOT clicking with the interviewers and no one was offering me a job in the field at the start of the school year. I looked again and some of the same places were re-posting their ads, so that made me feel
great(had interviews at the career center and they thought I was doing good). 

Anyway, I have landed on a research/data type of job. Great job growth (around 16%-25%). My school has a linked graduate program. I can't double major in the bachelors anymore. However, there is also a certificate my University offers(data analytics) . I was planning on taking one of the classes and something else related in the summer to the career field just to gauge interest( it'll be a cost vs benefits things as I can spend my own money on learning new skills and software or paying to take classes for a better potential fit) . I looked on Linkedin and besides the linked masters (any degree can do it), they nearly all had some research lab work (my school shut down the research labs).

Nearly all of these jobs involve a lot of communication. It'll be great if I can find one that doesn't(less because I am an introvert and more because of my stutter).

However, I am wondering if I should just be dragging my heels into the ground and trying to learn more skills for my current path. Or, try to compete with people whose path has been what I am trying to get on for the past couple of years and have the internship experience to boot. I am not unfamiliar with work (it is not unusual for me to have 2 jobs at a time), so this is not me trying to choose the easiest path. I just need it given to me straight. I remember going to my career advisors, one told me to major in sociology. The other told me she had no experience working with recruiters, so I am unsure of how valuable their information will be.

TL;DR; Thinking of changing my career field my senior year, adding a grad program and
another year to try to have a chance at a field with a higher growth rate. Unsure if I should try to compete with those who will have more relevant internship experience, or if I should just try and become one of the best entry level people in my current field. I don't have an affinity to one over the other."

The following in this journal are entries from my previous and current hunts. I’m still kind of new to this whole system. Sorry, I’ll start from the beginning. I’m a hunter of the mythic, the monstrous and the impossible. It’s sounds a lot cooler when the more experienced ones say it. I’ve had way too many close calls as of recently, and decided to write this in case I’m killed out there. If the entries stop coming, I’m still on a job, or assume the worst. Anyway, I’ve rambled on enough for this entry.

Entry 2
My first actual mission. I and two experienced hunters were each given a file for an unclassified beast. A forest notorious for wendigo sightings had been littered with their carcasses. We were tasked with finding the cause of the sudden change of predator. Leaving within the hour, our destination would be the village next to the notorious forest. Asking the locals about any information they might have, they directed us towards the center of the neighboring woods. They warned us not to go, several of their own people had failed to return after sent to investigate. Warnings that fell upon deaf ears, we left early the next morning to catch our prey.

Winter had started earlier than previous years, providing a perfect cover for predators of patience. Lying down beneath a foot of snow, freezing my ass off, in the middle of what I like to call wendigo forest. We waited for any signs of our target.

“Hey Scotch, you see anything yet,” a gruff voice asked over the radio.

“Sorry Tex, I got nothing. You sure this is where they were last spotted?”

Tex responded, “Yeah, a couple of locals said they saw something walking around yesterday in the distance, covered in what looked like blood. That could be our culprit. How’s the kid doing?”

My slightly youthful voice joined the conversation, “I have a name you know.”

“Sure you do,” Scotch replied. “However in this line of business, we go by nicknames. It helps with keeping hunts on the down low.”

“Speaking of which,” Tex started, “How’d you get your name? Scotch. That’s my least favorite drink.”

A few seconds of silence passed before Scotch responded. “There was an outbreak of ghouls, or something in my hometown, infecting everybody. I was having a few shots at the bar before going to see my parents. I got buzzed, and noticed some people didn’t look right. It’s pretty foggy after that. By the time some hunters got through dispatching the infected, I was found behind the bar counter with nothing but a shattered bottle of scotch protecting myself.”

I was silent, too amazed to reply. “So you never found out who started it,” Tex asked.

“I don’t really want to find out to be honest. What about you?”

Tex sighed deeply before responding. “I had a daughter. She was kidnapped in the Tex Killing Fields. In my rage, I tracked and killed every kidnapper I suspected of taking my little girl, some of them weren’t human. I doubt I found the one responsible for taking her, not yet anyway. Word got around and I was bailed out, only if I agreed to be a hunter. I figured I’d do something I’m good at. It beats the job I had before” Several seconds of silence passed while we absorbed Tex’ story. “Hey kid, what happened to you?”

Shuddering trying not to remember what introduced me to this new aspect of the world, “I don’t really remember, I couldn’t if I tried.” That was a lie, I hate thinking about it. I wish it never happened.

A warm breeze began to pick up, interrupting our chat. Carried with the increasing wind, was a voice as delicate as a lullaby. As if in a trance, we became unaware of our changing surroundings. The snow began to gradually melt, exposing wet grass and leaves. Newly exposed nature began to dry rapidly. The increasing heat dove us deeper into our subconscious. The voice grew closer, louder. A scorched leaf scraped my face, waking me from the trance. My eyes locking onto the source of the heat, I froze in shock.

Fifteen meters away, a crimson figure steadily walked towards us. Her eyes seemed to twinkle, like sapphires glistening in a sunset. Her skin resembled the color of rust. Orange tribal tattoos covered her. Her hair the same bright orange, like clouds of flames rolling down her back. Her presence sent waves of terror, while her soothing voice seemed to calm even the greatest of fears. A memory gnawed at the back of my mind, activated by the flaming siren before me. It was as if, I remembered her.

Her hands were inches away from my face. The heat must have finally woken up Tex, he shot her through her shoulder. Her soothing voice shifted into one of pain and rage. Flames engulfed her entire body, burning the surrounding nature into coal and ash. Scotch pulled me off the ground, waking me from my dazed state. Putting some distance between us and the woman, we ran and hid in a nearby cave. The stench of rotting flesh hit my nose, and I almost vomited. Definitely a more preferable situation than the intense heatstroke outside.

We’ve been here for quite some time. I don’t know if it’s night or day. The flames are still visible from the cave’s entrance, providing an inconclusive light. I don’t know what’s going to happen, Scotch is looking for another exit while Tex is going deeper into the cave to find the source of the rot. I don’t know if we should stick close or split up. Until the next entry.

Entry 3
Scotch’s attempt at finding a way out was fruitless. The way we came in, was the only way out. Our best chance was to find somewhere to hide deeper in the cave, going around her praying she passed us. After descending roughly thirty yards, the light from the fire brightened, reflecting off of the glistening cave walls. I don’t think she noticed us, yet at least. We slowly walked backwards, keeping our eyes on the growing light.

My foot stepped on something slimy with a crunch. Before I knew what happened, I fell slamming onto my back. The sound reverberated throughout the cave. A playful giggle came in response to the sudden sound. In the time it took me to get back up, the woman advanced enough to see us. Our eyes locked, a devilish smile crept upon her face. Only her eyes and her hair glowed with flames. She steadily walked towards us, as if stalking her prey. I drew my gun and aimed towards her head. I fired, watching in horror as her hair melted the bullet before grazing her skin. The gunshot deafened my hearing temporarily. I didn’t notice Scotch and Tex firing as well. My ears barely picked up a sound that made my blood run cold.

A guttural chuckle resounding from behind us made the woman freeze in her tracks. Her smile disappeared, her eyes now filled with fear, her flames began to dwindle. Turning to look behind us, I noticed a large figure looming in the shadows. Before my eyes could register anything else, I felt a strong gust of wind seer past me. Turning back to the woman, the large being now clenching their hand over her throat. In a desperate attempt to free herself, she scorched his arm. A loud snap was heard, the flames now gone, her eyes empty, faded as if the night sky overpowered her starlike eyes.

Unceremoniously, her body was dropped to the floor, joining the Windigo body parts strewn about. Only then did we notice the several limbs littering the floor. We discovered the source of the foul scent, the decaying remains of the Windigos. They were torn apart, as if by the teeth and strength of a powerful beast. The calm breaths of this beast drew my attention. To my amazement, he spoke.

“The scent of gunpowder, and blades. Hunters I take it. Interesting prey. You may be challenging to hunt as these beasts were.” He gestured to the limbs strewn about the floor. The predator of these species had definitely been found, which means he was even deadlier. We watched him, seeing what he might do next. He continued speaking, “If you wouldn’t mind, could you lend me a knife?” He gestured to his charred arm. Scotch slowly took his hunting knife, and threw it towards the beast. The blade buried itself into his skull, he began to arc backwards, slowly falling to the ground. Stopping his own descent, he stood there with his back arched.

Bellowing laughter soon followed, “Excellent aim.” Scotch’s eyes now wide, we watched as the being stood back up as if nothing happened. The knife was plucked from his forehead. The slit disappeared, as if Scotch’s knife never grazed his skin. The creature stabbed the knife into their burnt limb, cutting through his entire shoulder. He threw Scotch’s knife into the obsidian like floor, inches away from Scotch. The monster of a man, proceeded to tear their own arm off, only for it to be replaced by a brand new arm, completely unscathed. “Carbonized cells can’t regenerate. You’ve earned yourselves a bone, bringing her here.” He pointed with his lifeless limb towards the corpse that pursued us into the cave. “I’m feeling generous right now. So, I’ll give you a thirty second head start. Tick. Tock.” Stepping away from the entrance to the cavern, he allowed us to leave.

I sprinted out of the cave, looking behind me to find Tex throwing a grenade into the cave with Scotch in tow. The trees, grass and leaves surrounding us, once pure white as the snow that surrounded it. Now blackened, burnt to ash. Twenty eight seconds had passed, there were still several hundred yards ahead of us before we could reach the village. Twenty nine seconds, what good would the village be, it’s not like they could stop whatever pursued us now.

Thirty seconds, a familiar gust of wind flashed past me. Before my eyes could register the figure before me, I was sent flying backwards. My back collided with Tex, who in turn smashed into Scotch, knocking us all to the ground. The impact was lessened for me, where as Tex and Scotch were knocked unconscious.

I tried to stand back up, only to be shocked by the pain my body was in. Looking towards the direction of the village, I could clearly see the massive being. They stood at seven feet, long black disheveled hair atop their head, their physique could make even the strongest of men quiver. Their eyes, glowing blood red, his skin looked as if it absorbed nothing but darkness. Smiling sinisterly, his voice sounded almost bored as he spoke, “Shall you provide me with an actual challenge? Before I tear you apart?”

He leapt towards my fear stricken body. Time began to slow down tremendously as I witnessed this creature posing to take my life. A voice began to ring in my head, as if it were a forgotten memory buried within my subconscious. ‘No, no, no, NO!’ Before his fist could collide into my face, a golden barrier manifested into existence before me.

Halting his fist’s path, he was flung backwards, before forcing himself to stop due to the momentum. A look of confusion overtook his face, slowly becoming wrathful. “What? How......how? HOW!?” He leapt towards me, being met with the same result. His barrage of attacks didn’t stop, each attempt increasing in ferocity. “How!? Why!? Why you of all people!? Why did they choose you!? Tell me!”

I slowly raised my fists, not knowing what else to do. Preparing myself for his next strike, I stood up, tolerating the pain my body was in. Waiting to time my strike with his next move, I said quivering, “I was the only one who listened, so I helped. I had no idea what would happen!” Thrusting my fist forward a spherical barrier formed around my clenched fingers, colliding with the being.

Energy rippled through his face, flinging him into the distance, towards the mountains. The force popped my shoulder out of place, making me fall to my knees from the collection of pain. Turning around, I noticed both Tex and Scotch staring at me. Their eyes filled with confusion and slight betrayal. Wordlessly, we made our way to the village.

Entry 4
We returned to the base, I’m not allowed to call it anything else apparently, heading to the infirmary wing upon arrival. My injuries were minimal, while Tex and Scotch have fractures along their spines. The recovery system here is way more advanced than any hospital I’ve ever been to. Given a week to mentally recover, we were questioned heavily by our employers following the seven days.

Afterwards, we went to the documentation booth. A small room with a doorway leading to the file room directly behind it. Two side walls, and the shatter proof glass window with two openings. A circular grate for dialogue, and a small rectangle one for any documents passing through. A manila envelope was slid and handed to me. My first actual payment on this job. If my jaw could hit the floor, it would. Twenty thousand dollars, for one job. My excitement was lost when I looked towards Tex. Having no interest in the amount. His focus was on the operator within the closed off room.

“What the hell were we hunting out there,” Tex asked, irritated beyond belief.

“Your clearance level restricts you from having that knowledge. We are grateful for you taking this mission. With the information you have provided us, we can now form a team of, preferable hunters, for a different kind of task. Rest assured. You will be given another mission more suited to your level of experience. Thank you and good hunting.”

Tex punched the glass separating us from the operator, creating a spiderweb of glass fractures. The operator was unaffected, calmly grabbing the telephone and making a call. The three of us left to our separate dorms. Before I could enter, Tex grabbed my shoulder spinning me around to face him. Looking me dead in the eye, his tone serious, he demanded, “I don’t care if you don’t want to talk about it, but you are going to tell me exactly what you know. You knew what those things were, and didn’t say a thing. Until you give me a reason, you’ve lost my trust.” I didn’t respond, giving him a blank stare. After that, he stormed off to his dorm.

Turning around, I entered my room with my head down. Quietly shutting the door, I leaned against it, sliding down onto the floor. I shuddered as I remembered what sent me here in the first place. My mind swam in my memories, reliving what I constantly feared.

Four months ago, I was part of a scientific team experimenting to perfect the unsolved mystery. We were trying to create the perfect super soldier. The subjects of our tortures were mostly humanoid beings with a variety of abilities. The task of impossibility was to combine their abilities with a human being. It always ended in failure as far as I can remember.

I was starting out as an intern. We didn’t usually last long, meaning if any of us were found incompetent, our lives would be terminated. I was given the tasks of delivering tools, fluids and messages to other members in my assigned team. It was simple on most days. On occasion I would be assigned to retrieve a subject for dna extraction.  It was the last subject I ever set my eyes upon.

Subject zero zero one, the enforcer. They looked as if they were an old man, eyes sunken as if they’d seen more than their fair share. Their skin and muscles reduced to sagging papery flesh. I couldn’t bare it to look at them. With what sounded like great effort, the shriveled old being spoke to me. “Young man, would it be alright if you could hold my hand? I’m afraid of the pain that will happen soon. Please?”

Hesitating, I slowly reached my hand to the feeble old man lying on the gurney. Grasping his bony hand, he grinned maliciously as his hand was full of strength almost immediately. “Thanks kid. As gratitude, when this is over, I won’t let you die.” His body began to rapidly disintegrate, while he lay there laughing maniacally. His voice disappeared along with his body, reduced to dust.

A massive earthquake soon followed, destroying the building. Large pieces of rubble caved around me, almost crushing me, miraculously sparing me from being smashed. Unable to do anything, I waited as the structures fell around me. It was five hours before I was found by a rescue team. The fact that I was unscathed left my rescuers bewildered. Soon after I was assigned to a hunting organization. A better option to keep me quiet than executing me on the spot.

After everything happened, I can only form a few ideas of what happened that day. What I did caused a chain reaction with what we classified as those subjects. Their constant appearances over the past few months can be linked back to our experiments. As to what they are, I have no idea exactly, but I doubt that’s the last I’ll see of them.

Entry 5
A loud knock on my door woke me from my slumber. With a deep sigh I stood, readying myself for a barrage of questions Tex would have for me. Opening my door, I was surprised to not see Tex’s grizzled face looking at me. Instead a slightly annoyed young woman stood in my doorway. Studying my face, she remained silent for a few moments, before finally sighing and breaking the silence. “Agent T-3X didn’t answer his door. I assume he’s passed out from over drinking, yet again. When you see him, could you please give him this?” She reached to hand me a rather thick folder full of documents. Grabbing it, I realized it was much heavier than it looked. My mind swarmed with multiple possibilities of information I grasped. “Say nothing of our interaction. I owe him a favor or two.” As quickly as she appeared, she began to speed walk away. Before I could utter a response, she glanced over her shoulder towards me, “It’s Agent T-5J by the way.” As quickly as she arrived, she disappeared.

I must have been standing for what felt like a few minutes at least. I almost jumped out of my skin when I heard Scotch ask me something. I didn’t really hear what he said.

“What ya looking at,” he repeated with a curious expression.

My words stumbled as I answered his inquiry. “Oh, um. I met Agent T- um.” Scotch put his hand up, stopping my failed attempt at an answer. He began to ask me about who I just met.

“Was her hair red with white tips?” I nodded. “Five foot five?” Again, my head answered him. A devilish grin spread across his face. “Did her eyes seem to glow like amber jewels?”

“Who is she,” I finally asked him, getting flustered at his barrage of questions. The grin never leaving his face, he answered. “Agent T-5J, or her more notorious name, Arachne. She doesn’t really open up to anyone. Anyway, I’m here to give you this.” Scotch handed me a thin file. “I officially give you, your second mission,” he said to me with a hint of sarcasm.

“What’s that you’re holding?” Scotch gestured to the thick bind of files I held. I responded to his question. “It was given to me by T, you know who. She said she owed Tex a favor or two.” Scotch raised his eyebrows, giving an impressed look. I handed it to him, presuming he would deliver it to its intended recipient. Sarcastically, Scotch retorted, “Apparently he has better game than I first took him for. Speaking of Tex, don’t try to bother him or anything. He usually mourns when he’s not hunting. We’ll see him on the plane.” Sure enough, he was in his seat waiting for us.

Tex didn’t say a word, I assumed he’s still angry that I hadn’t said anything to him. Scotch slept through the flight, my nerves wouldn’t let me rest, so I decided to read the file I was given. An endless tsunami plagued the shores of the main continents, the worst being in Florida. At the same time, winter didn’t seem to let up at all, constantly releasing its flaky downfall. The build up of snow was getting out of hand. We were tasked with finding the source of the oceans and nature’s wraths and reporting back to our employers. I don’t know what we’re going to find, but I hope it won’t be like what happened not too long ago. Until the next entry."

fp5st2,1,2020-03-26,Chances of getting into CS PhD programs - What were other people's backgrounds?,_coffee_beans_,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/fp5st2/chances_of_getting_into_cs_phd_programs_what_were/,"I am a current junior at the University of Pennsylvania. I am planning to apply to computer science PhD programs in the fall of my senior year. I know it is probably a bit unrealistic to hope that I could get into the best PhD programs, but I would be curious to see if I even have a chance at some of the second tier ones. I would like to get into a program where I will be able to do meaningful work (so I don't care if it isn't a top 5 program, but maybe somewhere in the top 40 schools). 

I have a slightly unusual background. I am a student in the College of Arts and Sciences (rather than the school of Engineering). I got interested in computer science fairly late, and am completing CS as my second major (first major is cognitive science with a concentration in computation and cognition). I also ended up taking a lighter courseload my freshman year because I had a medical emergency and prolonged recovery (though I am on track to graduate on time).

The only area where I feel that I am a particularly strong candidate is my GPA which is a 3.9. Unfortunately, based on what I have read online, this doesn't really seem to count for that much.

I haven't taken the GRE, but I plan to take it this summer. I am not too worried about doing well enough on this. I have heard from other people that all they really care about with the GRE is that you pass a certain baseline (especially for CS since most of the material isn't super relevant). 

I will probably end up applying for research related to Natural Language Processing. I have done a small amount of research with one professor. Last summer I worked on a team research competition in which we did fairly well. I was probably the least knowledgeable member though, so I feel that my contributions were not important enough to stand out in an application. I am currently working on a couple research projects in that same lab. One project I am working on with another undergraduate, but I feel that in that project the other student is more senior than I. The other project I am working on is an independent study; unfortunately I have hit a lot of roadblocks, but I plan to continue working on the project this summer. My biggest issue with research right now I feel is that I often do not have enough knowledge / familiarity with complex research pipelines. I often have ideas and am good at brainstorming, but bringing those ideas into reality is always the main struggle. I worry that I will not have accomplished much by the time that I go to apply for graduate school, and this will hurt my application. 

I have only worked with the one professor, so I am also struggling to figure out potential letters of recommendation, as I really don't have many relationships with professors (all of my classes have been large lectures, and I generally haven't been a frequent student at office hours). 

I know extra curriculars aren't that important for PhD programs, but I will mention some briefly just for full disclosure. I was a TA for one intro-level CS course for one semester, and I was a grader for another CS course for one semester. I am on the board of two clubs, one of which is Women in Computer Science. I am active in undergraduate peer advising. 

My main questions are these: Any response would be greatly appreciated!!

1. I have heard that if I know I want to pursue a PhD, it does not make sense to apply for a Masters (and I would rather just go to a straight PhD program than pay for a Masters anyways), or work in industry (of which I have no internship experience). Does this advice make sense, and would I even have a chance of getting into a decent PhD program based on the bio I have provided?

2. I am willing to take a gap year to continue working on my research before applying to PhD programs. I was thinking that I would apply in the fall and if I didn't get in anywhere then I would do this and reapply with more research under my belt. Does this strategy make sense?

3. I would welcome any stories from other people who have applied / gotten into graduate school, especially if they were in similar positions. 

4. Any advice that people have?"
fp70k0,0,2020-03-26,Where to begin,Jakewitz1,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/fp70k0/where_to_begin/,"Hey everyone! So I know everything is getting all busted because of coronavirus so I’m not even sure how likely it is internships will be available in the summer. However, in the off chance many are still occurring (varies per company and whatnot) I need some advice. So I am a senior in high school and I was fortunate enough to have an internship last year at a biomedical startup. I worked with the finance side a bit but mostly marketing and I LOVED every second I was there. Before college, I want the same experience. So I have been trying to find internships in the Bay Area for companies relating to biomedical/ medtech/ investing fields. Pretty variant in industries but I have experience with biomedical startups and also I’m very interested in venture capital and the stages of startup funding. However, I have had trouble finding places to start and don’t know what to do as I fear I’m not qualified for most internships as I’ll be just out of high school with no formal college education yet. I didn’t explain this earlier but I was fortunate to be matched to the startup through a special program which I can’t join again as I won’t be in high school. I’m using platforms like Angel.co and have been struggling. 

Tl;dr: I’m just out of high school and want an internship but have had trouble finding one as I’m not qualified enough bc no college education but I have prior internship experience and I will be just out of high school with some certification ( a diploma). Idk how good of a job I did explaining myself so if you need clarification please PM or just comment. 

Thank you so much for your time!"

I was PLANNING on doing research for doing research this quarter like asking around professors etc, but this whole virus thing has kinda left me confused fam

1. Would it be like insensitive or time inappropriate to be emailing professors regarding research for Spring 2020? Like I feel like they're already pretty busy with the remote transition and worried about everything, the last thing I want to do is burden them. But internships are looking bleak tbh (mine got cancelled), and since a lot of students won't be here I feel like there might be openings.
2. Also though I'm in computer science, maybe will other majors neurology biology etc be looking for cs? Like which?
3. Since the school is shut down it seems, so the actual research itself will not be opened until like later into SpringQ? So the correspondences with the professors will only be through email, and will be like interest questions?

Anyone else that planned the same thing and confused? lol"
fpcav2,803,2020-03-26,"I was accepted by Harvard 15 years ago. On Ivy Day, hear my application story and take my advice.",acchang88,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpcav2/i_was_accepted_by_harvard_15_years_ago_on_ivy_day/,"Before decisions come out today, I want to share my TEDx talk on my Harvard journey ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs)) and share more stories that I didn't mention in the TEDx talk. The video, especially, should alleviate some of your stress as you anxiously wait for your college results today.

**tl;dr**: It's really okay to not get into an Ivy League school, because a college name is not what life is about.

&amp;#x200B;

**== My Application ==**

If I put my stats in r/chanceme, people will say I'm probably a T30 student at best, and I agree:

* Asian-American not from a rich or famous family
* A sub-1500 SAT score: I had only a 1450 SAT (converted from 2180 on the old SAT)
* Not ranked top 7 in my class
* Only 2 AP scores when I applied (and 3 APs in senior year), one of which was a 4
* Never had individual awards with a scope that is larger than regional/NYC (our math team, of which I was the team captain, won joint-first places in competitions like American Regional and NYC Interscholastic Math League, and I won 4 personal medals with our school team in two prelim rounds of science olympiad in NYC
* Didn't start anything, didn't publish papers, didn't have internships
* I was over 1 hour late to my interview (granted, there was a snowstorm, and my interviewer arrived 5 minutes after I, but still...)

The top of my college list was MIT, Cornell, Caltech, and Stanford. Harvard was not on my ""list"" because I never doubted that my chance of getting in was 0%, so I spent the least amount of time on my Harvard application. I applied to Harvard just because it was on the common app, it didn't require a dedicated essay, and I wanted to say ""I applied to Harvard"" to ""sound smart.""

&amp;#x200B;

**== Ivy Day ==**

I was ecstatic when I came home and saw large envelopes from NYU and Columbia. Large envelopes meant acceptance with brochures and everything, while small envelopes meant a ""thank you but this year was competitive"" rejection letter. However, I had my mind on Cornell after being waitlisted by MIT, and I was dejected when I later saw my rejection decision from Cornell. Then, An email notification came in: ""New email from Harvard College Office of Admissions.""

""Oh, I forgot I applied to Harvard. Ha.""

I opened the email. It was short. After rereading it about 20 times, I realized I got in. I was the first from my high school over the past 4+ years.

&amp;#x200B;

**== Results and Decision ==**

I was turned down from the top 4 schools on my list, as well as Washington University in St. Louis, but I got into Harvard, NYU Stern, Columbia, Tufts. When I shared my good news with our school counselor, I told her I was considering NYU, Columbia, and Tufts, but I was not considering Harvard because it didn't have a good engineering program and it doesn't have a business major. However, I loved Harvard's Pre-Freshmen weekend, and I made my choice for Harvardafterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

**== Harvard years ==**

It's pretty much everything in my TEDx talk, Link again here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGupYFaCGs). You should watch at least part of the video before you continue reading.

&amp;#x200B;

**== Post-College and My Life Advice ==**

I want to write this post to echo [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fomnzw/i_got_into_my_dream_ivy_league_school_10_years/) Reddit post from yesterday, because I, too, was unhappy and stressed. After the four years I mentioned in the video, I no longer had suicidal thoughts, but I continued to feel unhappy at times. I am proud of my friends for making TIME and Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, I am happy for my Harvard dance mate to receive mentorship and millions from Mark Cuban on Sharktank, and I brag about being in the same economics class with Jeremy Lin, but until a few years ago, I still felt ashamed that I'm not ""at their level"" post-college and was afraid that the peak of my life may be the college degree I received a decade ago.

What am most I proud of today? I'm proud that the stress I encountered in college has helped me develop mental toughness; I'm proud that being turned down by top tech, finance, and consulting companies has led to my career today, a ""college counseling"" company that focuses on mentoring self-development and preaching all of my life lessons; and I'm proud that my stress and disappointment then have led to my happiness today.

**If you get in today:** Congrats on all your hard work! However, if you do decide to go, know that this honor and label will become a responsibility and even a burden for the rest of your life. It will not bring you happiness, money, fame, or success; in fact, with the overly high expectations from an Ivy Leaguer, going to a top school may bring you sadness, breakdown, bad health, and a less-desired future than going to a non-top school. You have worked your butt off all your life to get into an Ivy League degree, but this may be the beginning of your nightmare. I have persuaded some of my students who got into Ivy League schools to attend state schools, and all of them are extremely successful and happy today.

**If you don't get in today:** Just like getting turned down by your crush, you have all the right to cry and feel disappointed for a while. However, consider a few points. First, the stress and competition at a top college are extremely toxic and only those who go through can understand how miserable it is. Next, if you value your career and future success over your college degree, top companies choose students from top schools only because of the people and not of their degrees; if you have the hard and soft skills, you can get into any top company with a T-100 degree, and I'm sure anyone aiming for a T-10 school can get into a T-100 school. Lastly, if you are looking to pursue a post-bachelors degree, getting good grades in a T-100 state school will give you a better chance at getting into an Ivy League grad school than mediocre grades (\~3.5) at a T-10 or T-20, so you may be better off attending a great state school now anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, those who say ""but an Ivy League degree at least increases my chances of finding a good job and being successful in the future!"" do not know what they are talking about. I didn't get an offer to any of the top full-time jobs I applied and I'm not alone, while many of my high school friends who went to state schools are extremely successful today. There's a correlation, but not a causation, between a college degree and a good future. The causation is between someone with hard and soft skills and a good future.

Continue working hard, develop good character, and everyone can be an ""Ivy Leaguer"" in life. Instead of saying ""good luck to your college decisions!!!"" I'll say ""good luck in your future!!!"" 😎

I'm a Computer Science student and last year I was hired by this company that needed help on developing apps that mainly helped their HR on collecting information from workers and/or helped automating some processes within the company.

This company has an IT department(which I'm not involved with) that mainly takes care of their database and gives user support for employees. Working as developers is just me and this other guy that coordinates what my tasks are and helps me if I get stuck with something I'm not experienced with.

At first, I mainly did some webscrapping tools with Python that were just fine to deal with, but later I was involved on developing apps using Microsoft's PowerApps Platform and been doing so since then.

I never heard about it before, so I got along and started learning how to use this tool and not much later, I realized too little programming language was required to make such apps and how limited I was when introducing some features on those applications.

I mean, PowerApps is great and easy regarding some solutions, but, in my opinion, as the problems grow more complex,  so does our need as a company to migrate to Platforms that allow better answers for these issues.

I feel really privileged, because after I pointed these concerns everyone has been really open on letting me learn how this can be done and to be sincere, I'm kinda in the dark here. There are so many frameworks available and so much documentation on the web that I don't know where to start.

So this is why I'm reaching you guys from r/cscareerquestions, what is your opinion on what would cover most ground when developing Apps such as those done with PowerApps?

I have little experience on web working with Laravel(not much, I would have to re-learn most of it), I know languages such as C, Python, Java, Javascript, etc. We have access to Microsoft's Visual Studio and Azure Resources. I did some reading and would want an opinion on [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net) Framework, is it good to work with? Looked for some tutorials and they were like 2 years old, is that a bad thing?

As an extra, and as a long term goal, my superiors reached to me and talked about some interest in using blockchain validations in the future. I would love to know more about it and to start learning how to develop with this technology, where should I start in and how I start trying it out?     Please, remind that I work only as an Intern and I have a lot to learn, but would be great to have some direction from people that are on the Market for longer.

Thank you all! :)"
fpe9v4,1,2020-03-26,Should I change my major from Information Technology to Computer Science,DashProdigy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fpe9v4/should_i_change_my_major_from_information/,"Some background about me is that I am 20 years old and I am in the second semester of my junior year of my Information Technology degree. When I declared my major, there was not Computer Science degree and my university is going to start offering it starting in the fall semester.

The IT degree at my university is very similar to a standard Computer Science degree. Like the degree still requires basic computer science classes like Programming 1, Object Oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, calculus and discrete math, Web Design, etc...

Most of my classes will transfer to the new degree, but I will still most likely have to have another semester of school. I think for the Computer Science degree I will have to take Calculus 2, another math class, and some higher level programming classes.

I know the name ""Computer Science"" holds a lot more weight than ""Information Technology"" when it comes to looking for jobs, but I'm not sure if it will be worth it or that much more beneficial when it is going to make me have another semester of college.

Another important piece of information is that I already have a software development internship lined up for this summer. I have seen that experience matters a lot more than your degree when it comes to looking for jobs. Will having internship experience offset not having a Computer Science degree and having an IT degree instead?

Edit: I wanted to include that I want to be a software developer in the future."
fpf89i,0,2020-03-26,Any advice for networking?,RenegeOffer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fpf89i/any_advice_for_networking/,"Since I got a return offer from my internship this year, I mainly applied to top tech companies but failed interviews with all of them so I had to accept my return offer. I'm going to reapply to as many top tech companies as I can soon, this time with better interview preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of all the top tech companies I applied to this year, only a few gave me interviews (Google, Microsoft, Amazon). Companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Dropbox, Lyft, Twitter, Uber, etc. ghosted/rejected me.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm concerned about is when I reapply, it'll be the same situation for landing interviews, e.g. if I apply to \~20 companies (including those mentioned above), then I might get 3-5 interviews. I want a higher response rate for interviews something like 50%, so for the previous example, it would be 10 interviews for 20 applications. Is this unreasonable?

&amp;#x200B;

My main method of applying to jobs has always been online, which I know makes it even more difficult. I know referrals from employees are a great way to get interviews. However, it's more difficult to network in my area as I don't live near the companies I mentioned above. What are some creative ways to land interviews?

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, you can say just pass your interviews and this wouldn't be an issue. However, I do want to cast a wider net in the chances of securing a job offer and ultimately more job offers leads to more options and salary negotiation."

fpgsr8,25,2020-03-26,Deciding Between Two Internship Offers,WhyAreYouGey,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/fpgsr8/deciding_between_two_internship_offers/,"Hello,

I was fortunate enough to receive an offer from two companies for an internship this summer (finishing my 3rd year of CompE). Before going further, I did already accept one offer because they requested such a short notice and the other company didn't formally make an offer at the time (the manager told me it was in the works).

The positions are somewhat different. For the position I technically accepted, I'll be a Firmware Engineering Intern at a company that makes a lot of HDDs. Salary is good, but they don't offer any form of a housing stipend which is critical because their facility is in a very HCOL area. At the other company, I'll be a Software Engineering Intern doing OOP in C++ for a team working on a new radar control system (they're a defense contractor). The offered salary is better than the former and they do offer a housing stipend in a lesser HCOL area.

I know one of the biggest - if not the biggest - factors is whether or not I enjoy the type of work I'll be doing because in theory I could be hired full-time for that kind of work. The problem is I would like to see both sides and wouldn't mind either one. And for job demand from what I've read they both have a ton in the future. I've also looked up reviews on Glassdoor for each company and they're pretty similar in terms of reviews. 

Aside from the work, growth, and salary I'm kind of at a loss for how else I should approach this. Any advice? Thanks"
fpieia,4,2020-03-26,"Intern - No Senior Software Engineer or any Software Engineers, Burned out, No Hope",csthrowaway5150,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fpieia/intern_no_senior_software_engineer_or_any/,"I am currently interning at a big biotech company as a Full Stack + Data Science intern (weird mix, I know) on a Data Science team. I am 4 months into the 12 month internship. I accepted the job offer under the impression that I would be mentored and supported (that's what was sold to me at the interview). Instead I joined the company and unfortunately found out that there are no software engineers in this company at all. Myself and another intern are the closest things to swe/cs in this entire company. No one has a background related to it whatsoever.


About a month into the internship, things started to pick up and my manager proposed myself and another intern design a new dashboard web app for the company. The expectations were to design a highly critical complex application that scales, is maintainable, robust, and is capable of being used by the entire department for a year or possibly much longer. There is A LOT of emphasis on it being able to scale over time as the application's features would continue to grow.


Given that this is my first internship and the other intern's swe background isn't very strong either, we warned the manager multiple times going into the project that without the adequate guidance or support of any experienced engineer, this would be a bad idea and the project may be susceptible to failure. The manager insisted, gave me full control of the project, encouraged we use a very limiting all-in-one Python library that weirdly mixes both front-end/back-end together, and told us to get started on Sprint 0.


We are now 2 months into the project. The project is not scaling well and quickly becoming spaghetti code because of the library - there are lots of bugs. For some reason the entire company was revoked access to AWS and is now looking at internally hosting the application using old server hardware. It's becoming harder to add more features as the library that was recommended to us was not designed to be used for something this complex. The code is tightly coupled and very difficult to work with.


I am quickly becoming burnt out from constantly working on the same project on a daily basis. While the other intern and I are starting to uncover and correct big mistakes that could have easily been pointed out by someone with experience, they will be leaving in 1 month as their contract ends. That leaves me as the sole person working on this project without any support.


Despite the embarrassingly bad sprint demo we just gave, the manager is still pushing that we complete the project ASAP and continue. I feel trapped and feel like there's no way out. I am ridiculously stressed and I don't want my internship to be me essentially doing a poorly designed capstone project that may fail. Can anyone offer some advice or help?"

The short is I am working on a clients website and went to update some css. I flushed the server cache and the plugin they use for optimization's cache. I checked the page to make sure everything looked correct and it does not. Upon view in dev tools the css that comes up is the old css.

Disabling the plugin, and checking the css file shows the updated css. Checking the css file the plugin loads which also has cache breaking also shows the correct css. Clicking on the file in the css sidebar of devtools and looking at the file shows the correct css.

The issue is the frontend does not and for some reason is applying the old css.

I am at a loss at this point. Any ideas? I have wiped all caches on all my browsers and my co workers also see the same issue.

EDIT: My title is unclear. The front-end and devtools show the incorrect CSS despite all the files it could possibly be loading from having the updated styling.  


**SOLVED:** It seems our intern compiled the scss files into a directory that was not the correct one and left it. I hadn't noticed anything when pulling code until now. Weird that those files would be loaded though regardless as the directory was wrong. Oh well its fixed!"

I'm on my first job as a software engineer (I've however done internships). It's been 2 months and I notice that 50% of the time, I take longer than expected to finish a task.

While I get things done, I feel like I could be more efficient but am at a loss for how! I identified a few external pain points- such as lack of formal handover, KT, processes etc; but how I can be a better/ faster dev tomorrow than today? I've gathered the following tips so far:

1. Don't make the same mistake twice.
2. Structure your issue in a sentence and explain the issue to yourself to get clarity on where to look."
fplvlp,1,2020-03-26,Struggling with life and severe anxiety after running away from an abusive household and a forced cousin marriage [F22],runawaynims,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fplvlp/struggling_with_life_and_severe_anxiety_after/,"Today has marked one year since I ran away from my abusive household. Even though I was born, raised and lived all my life in Switzerland, I lived a rather strict muslim lifestyle.This meant not going out to play with other kids as a child, nor going out to cinema, swimming, parties or whatever a normal teeny would do.

I feel like I wasted my past 21 years caged in a prison, looking outside through the bars at everyone enjoying their lives. All I did in these years was to cook, clean and watch Indian soap operas because I was not allowed to go out, have hobbies or live a normal life. My mother would always find something that bothered her if I started gaining interest in an activities. When i started drawing to keep me busy, I was often made fun of, and told it was against the religion, when I started working out at home, I was told that girls shouldn’t be „moving like this“. 

Another point was that they were very manipulative. They did things such as going through my phone, snooping through my things, forcing me to at all times have my bedroom doors open and never being in my OWN room expect sleeping, handing in my laptop &amp; phone after 8 o‘clock so I wouldn‘t do „wrong“ things??
Something they would do often is to come and sit me down for a talk, where they would get angry and disappointed and say they know what i have been doing and if I am not ashamed etc, shouting at me till it had me crying and confused because I actually hadn’t‘t done anything. They would do it to check and see if I would confess any wrongdoings they weren’t‘t aware about if they acted like they knew and scared me. You know the whole deal. 
Throughout the years a lot of people tried to help me but often, I denied the help because I couldn‘t imagine actually doing anything against them. In our culture it would be extremely disgraceful and would bring shame to the family if I decided to involve a third person or even went so far to leave my home.
I guess I had made my peace with my situation that this is how my life is supposed to be. I could write a lenghty post of the different kind of abusive I expierenced, but i want to keep it as short as possible. 

Somewhen I joined University and started pursuing a degree in Human Computer Interaction and I was really happy. It kept me busy and it was a possibility for me to flee from the problems and issues at home. I was excelling in my classes and was very liked by most professors. Since University was 1.5 hours away from my hometown, it also allowed me a new freedom, I was able to hang out with friends for lunch, bunk lessons to explore the city or do things I wasn‘t allowed before. I went to the cinema the first time!! I was so happy to eat popcorn and watch Infinity War in the Cinema. I went for the first time for a swim in the lake in my underwear. It felt so amazing to feel the water on my skin under the heat and then go grab an ice cream in the park. I was able to do all the things I dreamed of.

My parents soon caught on, that I was lying and hiding and somewhen they got stricter and kt became a lot harder to keep going on. They expected proof pictures and videos and sometimes wrote my buddies from university behind my back to confirm my stories. There was several people in my social circle in university and during that time they really did have my back and i thought they were really good friends.
In summer 2017. I got a really good internship in an IT company I loved. They wanted to hire me as a part timer and I would have loved to! But my parents did not allow it since they thought I am probably doing wrong stuff over there. I begged and pleaded but to no awail.
They decided to get me a job at the airport where my dad would work as a part timer. This was only so they would see and keep an eye on me. I hated the job but atleast I wasn‘t stuck at home 24/7 anymore.

I suppose the airport is where my life went down the drain or everything spiralled out of control. After a year of working there, I feeling love with a guy who worked there. It started as a crush, an innocent one, and progressed to flirting. We didn‘t have each others phone numbers but I would always be excited to work and hope I would see him there. It was a good distraction.
I shared with him my problems and my stories and over a year of working there, he had known more about me than anyone else. Somewhen we exchanged numbers so I could have someone to vent or go to help to. However as expected, things grew and we had sex. 
Even while I was having this sexual relationship, I was deeply convinced that this is just me enjoying life before I have to stop and finally marry a guy of my parents choosing and will be shipped of to Pakistan. Infront of everyone I would often pretend or act like I would be leaving from somewhen, but it is was charade. I really wanted to.
I often dreamed and shared with him what things I want to do, that somewhen I want to learn to swim, or be able to celebrate my birthday with friends or go away for holidays, see the ocean and the sea, or something as basic as being allowed to wear a skirt. But i couldn‘t ruin my families reputation for my wishes.

Things developed and my parents got a hint of what things I have been doing and suggested in December 2018, marriage to my cousin in Pakistan. I cried and denied but they didn‘t listen but used my refusal and crying as a confession tat i was hiding or having an sinful relationship. They set my marriage for Summer 2019. I was going to be married and would live my life in Pakistan with my husband and his family.
It was a nightmare. 
Through University and the guy i had fallen in love, i got to saw and expierence things, which made the idea of marriage and moving to a third world country which is super religious and treats the majority of women like house slaves unbearable.
I couldn‘t imagine being only a house servant after experiencing love and enjoyment of this.

I decided to run away. And I did in March 2019. I went to work and never back. Changed my number, organized myself a small place and left.
Throughout this time only two of my friends + the guy i was in a sexual relationship with were there for me. Slept over at my place, stayed awake all night listening to me cry, tried to hold me back from running back home, fed me etc.
My parents tried everything to find me, they went to the police, showed up in university and harassed my friends. It made it impossible for me because of that to finish my bachelor as I was supposed to in Summer 2019. 
However it is understandable, I was in a low, was on my own, and severally depressed &amp; in a constant panic they would find and hurt me.

However even though it has been a year, I am still in a low, i still haven‘t managed to get my bachelors due to my sudden incapability to concentrate, I haven‘t done or achieved anythng in this past year even tho i can say I have not struggled with my parents and am over it since November 2019. 

I know I should be finishing up my last course and writing my thesis but i keep finding reasons and excuses not to and just procrastinate.
I haven‘t managed to meet new people and have still only those two friends who sadly life further away. This means that i do not go out often or do things I always dreamed of or hoped to do. I know I could do it on my own but i just can‘t manage to put myself together to do the things I want to. I actually do not feel like I am doing anything expect sleeping, eating and procrastinating. The only times I do things is with my boyfriend (the same guy still).
However I realized that I have a lot of anxiety and problems which often makes things hard  in the relationship. My apartment is a mess and I still only live from a mattress on the floor and no furniture. I should try to get an internship or start a hobby but I just don‘t.

I actually started hating myself. I finally got the oppertunity to turn my life into what I want but I just can‘t and I can‘t even tell what my problem is. going to therapy didn‘t help and I just do not know what to do anymore. With this post I hope to get some advice, insights or tips on how to get my life together. 
How do I build my life again? How do i deal with this anxiety, how do i manage to fix this mess?
I wake up every morning wondering if i did a mistake with running away, but i don’t want it to be."

fpmny8,7,2020-03-26,Is it okay to reneg an internship offer in the current situation?,inuyashiuxX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fpmny8/is_it_okay_to_reneg_an_internship_offer_in_the/,"I  already accepted an offer in a different state, but its a Fortune 500 company that I'm really interested in working with. But... (1) They're working out policy changes, and I fear they might cancel the  internship program. They're being really cryptic about it. (2) I'm  worried I won't be able to fly out to the site come summer 2020, because  of travel bans/lockdowns.

A  company 10 minutes from my house gave me an offer (response due very  soon) but they only pay half as much, and I'm not as interested in a  future w/ that company. They seem to have already decided that their  intern program is remote, and won't be cancelled. I feel a greater sense  of certainty with this company than I do with the other, but I already  accepted that one.

At the end of  the day, I really struggled to get either of these opportunities and I  really am trying to be more financially independent because it's harming  my mental/emotional health having to depend on my parents for it, and  my situation at home is really shitty. I'm having trouble deciding if  it's okay for me to accept the second offer, and then \*renege\* if I hear  back from my initial company that they're planning to keep and not  cancel the internship.

I  understand that the current situation is really bad for everyone, and  reneging is already frowned upon. But I also don't want to be dropped  from my internship this summer. **What are the consequences of reneging (if I do it politely and with a valid reason)? How will it affect me in the future?** I've heard really terrible stories, but I also heard people moving on just fine.

Note:  I do have a genuine reason for reneging because I am planning to travel  back to campus and will be in the state the first internship is in, and  I can explain that I do not want to travel back to my current location."
fpmrvy,13,2020-03-26,Stupid international who's actually pleased with his results,procrastinating4lyfe,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/fpmrvy/stupid_international_whos_actually_pleased_with/,"Hi! After months of emotional highs and lows (and a shit ton of mental breakdowns), I finally received all of my college decisions! I know it's a long post but I learned so much, and want to share with those who are willing to hear :) Here, enjoy the results of a semi-competitive applicant:

**Schools:** I know there's a lot :/

**EA:** ASU (Rolling), UMN, UIUC, Case Western, UMich, UNC, Northeastern, Ohio State, Reed

**RD:** UPitt (Rolling), Temple (Rolling), UW-Seattle, UCD, UCI, UCSD, UCLA, UCB, WashU, Amherst, Colby, Emory (Emory Scholars Deadline), USC (Scholarship Deadline), NYU, Cornell\*\*, Brown\*\*, Duke, Yale\*\*, Georgetown\*\*

\*\* indicates that I got an interview from the school. (As for interviews, the one that I had with Yale sucked; just before I left, the interviewer basically suggested I'd be a better fit at a school like the University of Arizona rather than Yale. (While I don't know what he was implying, I still interpreted this as something negative because of the way he said it. I want to clarify that nothing's wrong with UofA, it's just what I wasn't expecting to hear.) The others were great; I had stellar discussions with my Georgetown and Brown interviewers, as I was able to properly explain what I want to do with a degree from that specific school and why I could be a decent fit.)

**Canada:** UToronto St. George (Life Sciences), UBC Vancouver (Arts), McGill (Arts), Western (Social Sciences), Waterloo (Social Sciences)

Didn't apply for financial aid at most of the schools, except the ones that are need-blind (Yale, Amherst, Georgetown\*\*\*)

\*\*\* To this day, I honestly have no idea whether Georgetown is need-blind to international applicants or not. My interviewer told me they're need-blind but aren't full-need-met, but take it with a grain of salt because I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere.

**Demographics:** Male, White (Middle Eastern), International attending a private, competitive school that has sent people to colleges in the US before (including Ivies + Stanford), LGBT (Would you consider ""male applying to non-stem majors"" a hook? IDK anymore.)

**Intended major(s):** Applied for BA Psychology as my first choice at most of them, except Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies @ Yale and Human Development (HUMEC) @ Cornell. I put down Gender Studies as my second choice, if applicable. I also intend to do a double major in something like neuroscience or public health while I'm at college, so I tried to mention that in my essays. I want to be in academia, so grad school is/will be a must for me.

**Academics:**

**SAT:** 1480 (770 M, 710 EBRW) - took the test three times and this was my highest score (single sitting, not superscored)

**SAT II:** 620 Biology E (ew), 700 Maths 2, 750 Maths 1 - only submitted the 750 to some colleges (i.e. the Ivies)

**TOEFL:** 108/120

**Class rank:** 14/467 at the time of application, but prolly a lot less now as I kinda flunked senior year lol

**UW/W GPA:** 95.47/100 UW at the time of application, my school claims it is weighed but it's not, as my country weighs our classes according to the number of hours they're allocated per week (i.e. maths is 6 credits because we have 6 hours of maths per week, not because it's harder). Course difficulty isn't considered while calculating GPAs.

**Coursework:** I did the IB (until the exams were canceled lol) in addition to my country's national diploma, so the majority of my junior- and senior-level courses were IB classes. I also took Psychology SL online in addition to my original six classes as it wasn't directly offered at my school. My predicted grade was 41/45, though I assume it'll be much lower now. Until my junior year, all of my classes were regular as my school doesn't have anything to be labeled as honors, nor do we have APs.

**Awards:** I didn't have much. I was awarded a full-tuition scholarship by my school for merit, as well as a full-tuition merit scholarship for my online IB course (which was given by the course provider).

**Extracurriculars:** I think they were pretty standard. Some community service (including developing projects for visually impaired people and low-income students at my school), MUN (for 3 years, also organized our school's conference - which had 300 participants from across the country), research/internship in cognitive psychology under a faculty member at a well-known research university in my country, art/design/photography (compiled a portfolio but didn't send), writer at my school's newspaper, semi-self-taught German learner (got a CEFR B1 diploma), organization of a couple of school &amp; city &amp; country-wide academic events and symposiums

**Recommendation Letters:** I believe they were alright, I have no idea about the counselor one tho. Got two for teacher recs, one from my IB Literature teacher and the other from my IB Biology teacher. I would give them a solid 6/10.

**Essays:** I thought they were decent, but guess they weren't lol. My CA essay was about me making houses from egg-cartons (QuIRkY is what I attempted to go for, and I think I failed...), and my supplements varied in quality. The one that I liked the most was for Brown, and Amherst &amp; Yale were the ones that were definitely not thriving :(

**Results:**

**Accepted:** UToronto, UBC (15k scholarship), ASU (15.5k/yr scholarship), UMN (15k/yr scholarship), UIUC, Case Western, UMich (deferred EA), UNC, Northeastern, Ohio State, Reed, UPitt (w/ guaranteed master's in public health), Temple (10k/yr scholarship + honors), UW-Seattle (pre-science), UCD, UCI, UCSD, UCLA, Emory (both Emory &amp; Oxford, rejected Emory Scholars), McGill (Arts), Western, Waterloo

**Rejected:** WashU, Amherst, Georgetown, USC, Yale, Duke, Cornell

**Waitlisted:** Colby (didn't take spot on the waitlist), UC Berkeley, Brown (I'm honored), NYU

**Reflection:** No humblebrag intended, but honestly, I believe that my application lacked in a lot of departments when compared to a standard T20 applicant - especially the standardized tests and extracurriculars. While I feel like I could've studied for the SAT more (or perhaps try taking the ACT instead but I didn't do well in practice tests so I'd given up on that a while ago), I'm still incredibly proud that I got into amazing schools (and a waitlist for a freaking Ivy, I'm lowkey shook). Maybe because of all the high expectations people around me had about me, but I tend to degrade the amazing options I have in my hand, so please don't mind me!

Don't rely solely on rankings while deciding on your college list (or decision)! Multiple factors make a particular college suitable for you. If you still want to look over some rankings, I recommend you utilizing ARWU as well, as it's highly dependent on research output. (I wanted to make sure that my choices were all R1 universities, as research is what I want to do for the rest of my career.) Still, your end destination doesn't have to be a T20; one's future school's ranking in no way describes their aptitude, and I believe that one can always strive to make a difference.

I previously said I felt stupid over the fact that I applied to over 30 schools, but reflecting back, I was glad to have some decent options, even after the EA round. (This doesn't mean I didn't regret applying to some of them; please try to choose schools that you can see yourself attending.) I wasn't sure whether I'd get into most of the schools I was considering applying, and I'm utterly grateful. (Also, if you're an international requiring financial aid, I believe 30 schools wouldn't be too extreme, given that the concept of ""safety"" loses its meaning in such a scenario; I'd recommend at least having more than 15 in that case.) I'm also happy that I applied to quite a few reaches, as I'd definitely want to see my chances if I didn't.

Make sure to follow your deadlines, and please conduct some research on scholar programs! Schools like WashU, USC, Vandy, Duke-UNC, Case, URochester, BU and Wake Forest offer some nice (incredibly competitive yet rewarding) merit scholarship programs that are worth the extra effort. Mark your calendars and make steady moves! Try to keep up with this process via sources like CollegeBoard and A2C (and maybe even CC, although it's a bit too toxic); I feel like I learned more through these resources, perhaps even more than what I'd learn from a professional college consultant.

And finally, for my fellow international applicants (or even domestic ones), please remember that colleges in the US aren't the only options you have. Countries like Canada and the Netherlands offer incredible programs and decent merit scholarships, and they might be cheaper than your alternatives in the US. This process can truly be unpredictable and is an emotional rollercoaster, so don't lose hope! If you happen to get rejected, please keep in your mind that you're not underqualified - it's just that they're not ready to accommodate you just yet. There's always grad school and summer internships :) Good luck!

(I'm not sure where I'd like to be at next year, I guess we'll see depending on my parents' financial situation and the opportunities each school offers. I'm leaning towards UToronto and UBC, as Canada currently appears to be more friendly for post-grad employment and the schools are more affordable &amp; offer a great education.)"

I’m currently still in school as well, its going to be my last quarter so I’ve been juggling that and work at the same time. But my first two projects took me a while to do when they didn’t seem to difficult to complete. It’s taken me a while to understand the database and other already written code as well as learning the other tools. I’ve had my coworkers help me a lot during my first few weeks to the point where they were basically holding my hand and it seems like just now I’m getting the hang of it. I’d say I’m a decent programmer, I’m definitely not the worst but I do have room for improvement. This is my first ever programming job I’ve never had an internship in the past or had any coding related jobs. The only coding I’ve done was during school. Is this fairly normal for people starting off or am I just a slow learner?"
fpn02o,14,2020-03-26,a fuckin depressing reality,allignstaken,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fpn02o/a_fuckin_depressing_reality/,"just need to ~~rant~~vent a bit sorry-

I've been a visiting student here for 4 semesters now. Having completed mvc/diffeq/linalg by freshman year of hs, I opted to start taking some upper-div and graduate classes here thru concurrent enrollment from Fall 18. It went well. Did well in my classes, joined some undergraduate research through Beehive, and got my professors to know me. Shit was straining though, as a hs sophomore, having a 13 hour day due to a two-hour commute.

So when junior year rolled around and my hs was forcing me to retake classes just to fulfill the final grad reqs, I chose to leave hs with GED and split my would-be junior year as a gap year between an internship and my classes here. And I loved it. Joined a club here, undertook a couple research projects (some for classes), and got two advanced college-level internship offers at NASA and the lab.

But I've become disillusioned with the reality I so desperately want to see myself in. I've bent my whole academic path around an institution that has no reason to help me. 25 units of graduate coursework. 7 units of upper-div coursework. 3 research projects. 1 research lab. 2 (related) internships. 1 stem club. 1 planned reader position. Hell, I'd have spent more time at Berkeley than hs by the end of hs.

And I've held myself to a philosophy. In 8th grade, I had a couple seniors in my Mutlivariable Calc class. Some of them were math majors. And if in 4 years, they'd be able to get a bachelor's degree, while I'd still be in high school - then it'd be a failure on my part for not being able to keep up with people that were once my peers. What would it say as to my utility as a student if I could not keep up with the person sitting next to me whence my parents had invested more into my education, paying for me to take classes? My education would be a failed investment solely on the fault of my own efforts.

I've always found a way to enjoy what I'm doing. I remember my counselor about a year ago asked me what if I couldn't find an internship after dropping out of high school. I told him that I'd sort something out one way or another, and surely enough I did. But college decisions is such an ultimate equalizer, and I've found it so hard to grapple with that. My fate is uncomfortably outside my control for the first time.

And I went for it, applied as a would-be high school junior who dropped out to pursue their interests. I thought I had a chance, 1550+ sat 4.7+ w gpa 14+ aps, a list of traditionally college-level work, and your typical spiel of high school activities. Vouched a couple grad professors and a math teacher who I had for four years to put in some recs for me, and figured I'd put together some essays on overcoming barriers to pursue my interests.

But alas, I've just been rejected from Berkeley. it stings, it really does. Not only that, rejected from ucsc, ucsb, ucsd, ucla, uci, mit, the ivies ... I could go on but you get the point. And I honestly don't know why I'm posting this here, but I don't know how I'll bear finishing the rest of the semester. I still have three major projects and a flurry of small assignments to do, but I can't muster the motivation to finish them knowing it has no tangible effect on my future. I love the material, I really do. But I can't bring myself to pull these long hours working towards an aimless goal. I used to convince myself the long nights and effort were worth it for pursuing my passions, but that simply isn't true anymore. Whether I spend the next three months sleeping or studying my ass off makes no difference. I've been doing GRE practice to fill my time, for some weird semblance of normalcy. Thank god everything is online at the moment, I don't know how I'd save face going to classes and extracurriculars. I honestly would spend more time working at my research associate position, but like half the people there are Stanny post-docs; I fear I'll become to dependent on it.

And I've yet to come to grips with my reality. I am a sixteen-year-old high school dropout who is not in college, who has 32 units from a university that does not want them, and hopelessly overshadowed in a research position that expects them to enter university. And I honestly don't know where to go from here. I entertain myself with the possibility of solely working at that research position for another year, not going to school - but I fear I am digging myself into a deeper hole.

Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted talk."
fpn3zh,18,2020-03-26,I need advice,buJ98,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fpn3zh/i_need_advice/,"TLDR: I feel like I'm not learning anything in the university and lost the ""spark"" I had in community college. I learned a bunch of cool languages but don't do shit with them to keep myself sharp. What did you guys in industry do to keep yourself sharp and not feel useless?

&amp;#x200B;

The title says it all. I am going through a computer science program at a UC and I'm about 15 months away from graduating with a BS in computer science. The thing is.. I really don't feel like I'm learning anything.

I got into Computer Science when I was 18 in the community college, I took an introductory Java course and felt like a god for being able to print out ASCII art to the console, or for being able to explain to someone how the Scanner class worked. 

I loved it so much that I spent 3 years at that community college taking as many CS courses as I could before transferring to the UC I'm at now (I took 2 more Java classes, 2 more C++ classes, a Python class, and a pretty simple assembly language class). I loved it all and I had lots of fun solving these puzzle-like programming challenges and staying into the later hours of the night coding like the edgy 19 year old I was. 

Fast forward to now (I'm 21) and I'm about to finish my 1st of 2 years at the university as a first generation college student. It has been absolute hell. The theory classes at university have just been a scramble to score above the curve, memorize really robust concepts in 10 weeks to forget immediately after the exam, and I almost feel like I'm not learning anything. My GPA is passing but not resume worthy because of what feels like insane classes.

Credit where credit is due, I did take a class that had programming in C.. and that was REALLY fun. The programming classes here are often merciless which is great but I still argue that I'm not learning anything because its always ""sort this!"" or ""make that!""

Although I learned all these cool programming project solutions, I'm almost done with my degree and all I've learned is how a linked list works (which I already learned in the community college!) and how to sort shit. I've forgotten all the rest because its always learned within weeks and then forgotten after the exam. Things feel bleak and I feel like I'm not holding myself to a responsibility of bettering myself as a programmer. 

This is where my main question comes in: 

What do you guys in the industry do to keep yourself looking sharp and marketable? I feel the pressure of an internship and even a job in the near future, and I have no personal projects to showcase my abilities.  I've had exposure to many languages at this point, but I haven't really done anything other than ""ooo"" and ""ahhh"" at them. I'm not applying myself and I don't know what to do. I have a github, where a lot of my community college projects went. That's all. Do I make a stupid little console game? (sarcasm) or do I make a web application in some random framework that will probably outdated in 4 years. What are some tools/resources (blogs, articles, etc.) that you consistently follow to stay with the program?

I appreciate anyone willing to read this whole thing, it is definitely a rant but I'm very serious about this and could really use some helpful advice/tips."

ECs: (My biggest downfall - I didn't actually know I was supposed to do stuff outside of school and kinda just did my own things which aren't necessarily impressive to an AO considering I'm an Asian male in CS)

- Member of school choir (9-10th grade), bass section leader, executive committee member. Performed internationally with choir before.

- Self-formed a cappella group (9-12th grade). I was the groups beatboxer and arranger. We performed at several charity concerts.

- Total 100 hours community service.

- Have been playing classical piano since really young, and I have an Associate Trinity College London (ATCL) diploma in piano performance. Also self-learnt jazz piano. I believe ARCT is the US equivalent of ATCL. I'll submit a music supplement of me playing the piano.

- Also have grade 8 for drum set.

- Very brief (2 weeks) unpaid work experience at a concert hall as a bouncer .

- Machine learning research internship at a T30 uni planned for the next few months which is probably being cancelled because of corona (rip)

- Stanford will update 
- Rice will update


My only regret is that I didn't start thinking about college earlier. I only really started caring about college in my final year of HS - prior to that, I put in minimal effort to get decent (but not amazing) grades and mostly played video games at home instead of doing more meaningful ECs which I had the opportunity to do but turned down out of laziness. I'm beyond grateful to have UMich as an option and will most likely be committing there unless Rice/Stanford pull through (very very unlikely). Huge congrats to everyone who got into their dream schools and I hope this helps someone in their college application process.

- 1 internship in IT at big fintech company.

To be blunt, I didn't expect my results and I'll spare you from my woes and the extensive amount of crying and panic I've had over them. I'm here to ask what was lacking, where I can improve, and how I can be better so that hopefully I can get into the kind of graduate school I want or if I decide not to go to grad school then at least live a productive, fulfilling, and impactful life.

\-Spent a lot of 11th and 12th practicing art (by no means skilled enough yet to have even thought about submitting portfolios to colleges, but same deal as the Japanese)

\-Muslim Student Association Member/@home Quran classes - 4 years

\-JV Track and Field - 10th only

\-Pretty mediocre amount of volunteer hours (\~200), nothing organized by myself or anything

**Essays/LORs/Others:** Tried my best and put my heart into vast majority of essays. Close relationships with both rec writers; worked with AP Bio teacher for a lot of time outside of school for things, and AP Lang teacher said I was the onyl student she'd write a rec that year. This is most probably just an excuse but I came to high school from a small religious private school and I moved high schools my freshman year so the courses on my transcript are kinda weird and my weighted GPA just couldn't be as high as some of my friends even as we got the same grades.

I definitely spent a lot of high school studying for science competitions rather than doing things that were *activities* per se. I also put more of an emphasis on my grades than I probably should have; there were many a night in which I would study probably way too much for a test to make sure I knew how to do every little thing and get the highest grade I could manage. This is probably more so reflected in my transcript than my GPA, but I'm thinking it probably would have been to my benefit to not think too hard about grades and just take care of the work necessary to manage an A for the semester such that I would've had more time to invest myself in meaningful activities. I also definitely did have times throughout high school, sometimes reasonably-sized stretches where I just lacked motivation and just overall did not have a great work ethic and I probably could've done more if I was better about that (and I hope to be better about that in the future).

I just kinda included that spiel to ask where i could improve my approach to school/general productivity for college and my future.

I'm sorry if this is extremely long .\_., but anyone who is willing to put in the effort to truly think about this is really really appreciated.

Using my alt account here since I'm pretty embarrassed about all this.

Summary of my path so far:

* Graduated 10 years ago (non-CS degree)

* Got into Digital Marketing, hated it

* Switched careers to coding, loved it (went the bootcamp route - Ruby/Rails and JS/Node mainly)

* First job was a 3 month temp contract at startup (Rails + JS)

* Second job was a job at a dinky web agency, nothing spectacular, but cut my teeth on some real websites and web apps (PHP, JS and lots of CMS stuff w/ Wordpress)

* Moved to America (permanent resident, born in UK, married American) 4 months ago, been looking for work in the Orange County area ever since

* Can't find a job; can't move, due to reasons, so have to look local (or remote work)

I've filled in hundreds of applications, done everything I've read here and elsewhere about setting up my LinkedIn and cover letter correctly, I even paid for some professional resume and cover letter templates. I'm chasing up recruiters, trying to hunt down every lead, and nothing.

I've had one on-site interview so far, but they decided to go with someone more experienced (this was after no contact for about 3 weeks).

Recruiters reach out to me almost daily on LinkedIn, but 50% of the time I never hear back after responding. The rest I have a phone call with... and then hear nothing. Half of them seem to be Indian too, and whenever I speak to them on the phone it all sounds very dodgy, and the positions all sound very scammy/weird, and like they're just probing for a cheap H1B recruit or something.

I'm a pretty affable person, and I don't think I come across as a complete asshole on the phone. My resume has gone through a ton of revisions, but no change yields anything better. I've tried customising my cover letter specifically to each position, and tried sending the same generic one to everyone, and neither gets any more response than the other.

I'm just getting more and more depressed and anxious, and running out of money. I saved up a hefty chunk of change before I came out here, but I didn't expect it to take this long to find a job. I'm not completely green, and I'm not a grad, so internships aren't really an option. But I'm not advanced enough for a lot of the positions that seem to be available either, where they seem to want someone with just a few more years of experience (I'm like 2 or 3 at best).

And now with the current crisis and the economy is tanking, I just don't know if I'm gonna be able to find a job at all. What on earth am I meant to do?"

# Reflection

It may sound cheesy, but today has been the best day of my life. I went in to Ivy Day with really low expectations, but am so humbled to have received acceptances from my top choices. It's only once every few years that my high school sends students to T20 colleges, so please never give up hope even if you don't come from the most competitive school community. I'd like to think that colleges care as much about who you are as where you come from. I really want to thank this forum in particular for providing so much guidance ever since I was a freshman who was clueless and full of heart. I'm really so grateful and can't wait to see what the future holds!

# Takeaways

1. **Don't feel pressured to apply early** if you haven't finished polishing your common application or supplemental essays. In all honesty, the reason I chose to apply early to MIT was that they have their own application portal, and I didn't end up starting my common app until November. This bought me some extra time to really narrow in on a topic that I felt comfortable writing about and to dive into that to the best of my ability.
2. **Find an unconventional essay topic** that really speaks to who you are. I struggled for the longest time to figure out what I wanted the theme of my essays to be because I never felt like I had a compelling story to tell. For me, the big realization was that my essay didn't have to impress the admission officer so much as it had to stick with them.
3. **Utilize each supplement to showcase a unique side** of yourself to the admissions committee. If possible, try to avoid repeating the same topics, especially between your common application essay and the rest of your supplements. For me personally, the topic of my main essay had virtually nothing to do with the rest of my extracurriculars. It was more an attempt to highlight intellectual curiosity in a way that I felt the rest of the application couldn't.
4. **Pour only as much effort as you need to into testing**, even if that means settling for a lower score than you might have hoped for. For the ACT, I set the goal of reaching a 34C, and committed to taking it as many times as I needed. Once you hit that bar, don't stress about getting incrementally higher. There will always be what if's, but that time can be invested so much more effectively towards extracurriculars and essays.
5. **Treat your extracurriculars as items on a resume** that you might show off in a job interview. I really tried to build a consistent theme across extracurriculars related to my intended major, which provided me more space in the essays to focus less on professional aspirations and more on who I am as a person. I think that helps make your application seem much more rounded.

# Questions

I'm happy to answer any questions about my application or the process in general. *Thanks for reading!*"
fpsskn,4,2020-03-27,What did I do wrong?,mshsjahajakais,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpsskn/what_did_i_do_wrong/,"Now that all the decisions are out, I don’t know wth happened. 

For some background, I’m an out of state state student studying in India. I applied to a few unis in US. Now to be fair I’m gonna extremely glad cause I got into my top choice uni, but the rest of decisions make feel like I lacked a lot.

I applied for CS with comparatively lower stats. I had a sub 1400 SAT and non 4.0 GPA. However I had everything you would expect someone who enjoys CS to have. I was average in my overly smart class. However, I had the highest CS marks in my grade. There aren’t many opportunities where I live, there aren’t any research internships or whatever for me to take up. I still had a fair amount of CS related extracurriculars. I had a lot of participation and awards in Hackathons and codewars. My prized achievement was when I represented India at an International hackathon. 

Now I know there are gonna be like a lot of people who surpass me in every single aspect. I’m not gonna compare myself to them. I’m gonna compare myself to people at my school.

I know people with slightly higher stats who have had other people write their Essays, Lied on their apps and gotten into similar/ higher level of colleges than me. 

Looking back honestly I don’t know what I did wrong. I don’t know if it’s me or colleges or what. Within people of my school, I’ve seen people get into T20’s with no ECs whatever but higher stats. I’ve seen someone with lower stats and less ECs get waitlisted from somewhere I was rejected. 

Now I know the obvious, it’s probably my essays. Now I felt that too so I had people from current unis go over and gimme advice. Conservatively, it was prob a 7/8 on a scale of 10.

Now I don’t know what I did wrong. I got into my top choice so I think I did something right. I know I probably overshot way too high for my stats, but if someone else who applies with similar stats can get in why can’t I? I don’t know why but it’s sucks to see people Lie and Have others fill their apps get into Uni’s for some work you’ve done. It just plain sucks that the recipe to get into college has become to lie on your apps and have your essays written by someone else rather than work hard to achieve it."

Now I chose that uni because It's given me a good scholarship. I'm not sure if I'll be attending grad school. I hopefully want to get a job in the US after my studies and work for at least a year if I choose to go to grad school since I'll need funding. 

Most people have told me that the CS experience at most universities are almost the same. I heard from a classmate that employers care about the University and it's acceptance rate. KU has a whopping acceptance rate of 93% but it's honors program is really good afaik. Will it affect my chances of getting a job? 

I have the basic knowledge of CS. I know the basics of C++ and Java and how object oriented programming works. I'll be learning python and making apps for Android this break. 

I'd be starting University in fall 2020 so should I go with it or is it better to spend on a better schools, like a shit ton of money since I haven't got any scholarships from them?

I have also applied to Google CSSI and I'm not sure if I'll be selected.

I really want to excel as a CS student and will do whatever it takes. At least will try to. So should I go with the above university or is it a straight up no. Any grads here? I would also want to intern during my years of college at least 2-3 internships.

Thank you! Any help would be appreciated."

fpwdt4,432,2020-03-27,How should I handle being OVER-paid and UNDER-worked?,TA_Duder_091,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fpwdt4/how_should_i_handle_being_overpaid_and_underworked/,"Total throwaway account here, because I'm fairly certain I've tossed my employer's name around on my other account.

I'm 29 years old, and I work for a mid-sized tech company that specializes in commercial and residential automation. I've been with the company for 7 1/2 years and recently weaseled my way into an executive level position.

I started here when I was 22, after stupidly dropping out of my CS B.S. program one semester short of graduation. I started in a generic tech support role, making about $40K annually and pretty strictly stuck to the phones and chat queues without taking on much else. After about a year, I began helping develop slack apps for the department and writing some simple Python scripts for my manager, and I received a 20% raise to a $50K salary and split my time pretty evenly between web-dev projects and tech support.

In 2015, management created a position just for me: ""Customer Success Engineer."" I was given a small raise to $55K, and spent 75% of my time writing slack apps and scripts and 25% of the time managing social media inquiries. I was pulled into marketing and sales situations like crazy due to the social media element, and found myself networking around the company incredibly aggressively through such. This was the busiest I'd ever been at work, and I loved the absolute hell out of this job. I remained the ""Customer Success Engineer"" for two years, piling on more and more sales and marketing responsibilities along the way on top of my coding and PR management, and in 2017 I made $64K scored a perfect review, which was undeniably rare. My salary was boosted to $73,000 for 2018.

In March of 2018, a senior manager told me that I wouldn't be able to continue in my current role because is was too ""ambiguous"" to justify my salary, and that I'd have to choose between becoming a generic Marketing Analyst or a Level 1 Web Developer. I took the Marketing route, mostly because I really enjoyed the people I'd worked with in that space and knew I'd remain a valuable tech asset in that department. Little did I know, that I was becoming a supervisor for a new team of three marketing interns specializing in social media and web design. This went off without a hitch, I trained and got all three of my interns hired on, scored a perfect review at mid-year, and wrapped up 2018 with $88K and a new class of 24 interns coming in in 2019.

2019 was again, busy, and I got the majority of the interns either hired or outsources accordingly, and I'd single-handedly devloped a new tech support training regimen, a marketing essentials training, and a networking portal for interns.

Then everything went to hell.

In December of 2019, our Senior VP of Operations retired and my manager told me to apply for the position. I was 28, still incredibly youthful, and had no interest in executive leadership but went for it anyways and landed the job. Evidently other executives were seeking millennial blood and fresh ideas on their team, and I was the answer to that. So I accepted.

New Salary: $191,000/year.

There was zero training or immersion for this role; I was just told to move into my new office, attend a few training seminars around the country, and begin attending meetings with the rest of operations oversight and leadership.

My typical day consists of dressing up in a suit, attending one three hour tele-meeting in the morning where I have zero input and rarely get to speak due to risk restrictions, a 2-hour sit-down lunch with other oversight leaders where we vaguely discuss work, and then 4 hours in my office in the afternoon.

I immediately jumped on projecting volume forecasts for our resource center, data scrubbing, and doing a cost-benefit analysis for some improvements to our Operations department, and was rudely told by a senior colleague to ""leave such work to the data analysts and accounting. Play some Solitaire.""

So... I'm incredibly bored. A three hour meeting, lunch, and responding to some emails every day doesn't match the excitement and vibrancy I was used to in the previous positions. I'm not even permitted to ""socialize"" per se with former colleagues because of potential future claims of nepotism or favoritism. I'm stuck with these old bats in their 60's who are our of touch and allegedly, do nothing all day and expect the same of me. The majority of them are out the door before 2:30PM every day and I feel a weird, possibly imagined pressure to follow suit since I'm trying to ""fit in."" Ever since COVID-19 started, my colleagues attend this morning meeting from home and disappear off Slack and Outlook for the rest of the day. It's literally like they do NOTHING.

The pay is absolutely phenominal, I cannot lie. I don't feel like I deserved even a third of that pay in my prior role, and for the absolute joke of a job I'm doing now, I actually feel ashamed to be receiving this level of compensation. I'm lost and bored and confused and feel like an impostor. I've pondered asking our CEO, who is 82 and out of touch with our entire office, if I can get more involved with the marketing/tech overlap as I was before (If not, just go back to my old job because it was invigorating, at the least) but I fear how bad of a career move having that talk would be.

TLDR; I got a huge promotion, the job is way too easy, I make a balling salary but do nothing, and I want to go back to my old job but am afraid to say anything. Help!!!"

1. All the blue words are attached with a link, is it fine to organize it like this? I'm afraid that the recruiter won't notice there's a link that they can click on if I put it in normal black font.
2. Is it appropriate to put open source experience in the experience section? I have never seen anyone done it before.
3. I know maybe I should sort my projects based on the starting date. But I would like to put the better projects (I think) at the top. Can I do it like this?

I did well in school because that's what I always did, and didn't really think any more than that. 

During sophomore year, I read the prep scholar article that made it clear if you wanted into college you had to be a star, a phenom, someone truly amazing to even have a chance, and honestly it really stressed me out. I know I didn't feel amazing, smart, or interesting. So I started to mentally resign myself to maybe T30 or even T40, and just did what I wanted. I played sports, joined some clubs, got leadership positions, but college was never the goal.

By junior year the idea of ANY T20 seemed impossible. Everyone else had huge internship plans, worked harder, and constantly seemed to be fighting each other to be better. I was on the side lines, but I was ok with not being in the rat race, and it wasn't like I really planned on competing with them anyway. My mom dragged me to as many college tours as she could, and I remember kicking myself for liking the schools we saw. I was 100% sure I was setting myself up for a momentous L, and hyping myself up to apply would only end in tragedy.

Well long story short, I did apply to a few of those schools that I went to see.
Brown, UPenn, Princeton, and Harvard.

And yesterday, I got accepted to all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a multitude of circumstances which can be summarized with difficulties with undergraduate university admission, financial issues and (of course) the virus, I have found myself with at least 6 months of free time, potentially a lot more if I end up taking a gap year (which due to the mentioned difficulties is becoming a more realistic outcome of all this). And so, instead of wasting it away, I really want to develop some skills that will be super useful when it comes to either re-applying to university courses, or just applying to internships/jobs during my potential gap year and general job applications in the future. 

So, kind people of this sub, what do you think would be the best investment of my time? Currently, I can code to a decent level in Java, and I have a basic appreciation of Python. I have products from the company [XINABOX](https://xinabox.cc/), and through messing around with the chips I have I'm developing a rudimentary understanding of C++ and Arduino electronics. Lastly, if this holds some weight, I've studied physics to a relatively high level, and so if there's anything hot out at the moment that incorporates physics too then I would love to take a look. 

I am interested in pretty much anything computer science related, and willing to try anything and everything that can add value and quality to my skill set. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any replies and suggestions on what I can do to best set myself up for internships and potential jobs!

TL;DR: What should I learn during quarantine to best prepare myself for CS internships and jobs?"

However, since I already accepted the offer, I stopped the conversations with all the other employers I was in talks with at the time. Essentially I have no more leads and in the current economy, it seems all but certain I won't find anything.

The reason for my thread is this:

\- I'm curious if this is happening to other students.

\- Could we claim the financial losses to the current EI program being rolled out by the Canadian Gov?

\- Is there any potential of maybe finding a research/administrative/assistant position at McGill or is it way too late for that?

Before the college application process, I was so scared I wasn't going to get in anywhere. I scoured the internet for something that could make my application stand out from the thousands of others. I watched hours upon hours of college decision reactions (I've probably watched all of them tbh) that youtube offered. Then, one fateful day, I stumbled upon this website. I literally, and I'm not exaggerating here, visited this website 3-5 hours a day, looking for anything about my schools. I became a college admissions expert, to the point where my classmates would ask me about updates from THEIR colleges (ones I hadn't applied to). I truly fell in love with the process and this sub.

Finally, the college decisions began to roll out. So far, (I still have to hear back from U Mich) I have gotten my list down to three schools:

I was just recently admitted to the Jindal school of management for my freshman year, and I'm currently split between Jindal and the Ohio State Honors program.

I was impressed by the tour I was given of the school, as I received the opportunity to talk to the head of the Supply Chain Management program as well as the head of the Honors College. However I find it quite difficult to make a decision between the two schools, and I have several questions:

- For those of you in the Jindal Honors program, would you say that the Honors program is worth it? For instance, do you get to meet with many company CEOs and receive priority over other students when applying for internships?

- Is the ranking of UT Dallas important? Just from a pure numbers perspective, UT Dallas is ranked just below Ohio State for their business program and I was wondering if that makes a difference in applying for jobs or internships.

- How easy is it to change majors within Jindal?

- Does UT Dallas have a large alumni honors network that can help you land jobs post graduation? 

If anyone is from the Jindal Honors program or just a student in Jindal in general, please DM me as I would love to chat with you!

fq0lm1,1,2020-03-27,Should I focus on getting promoted at my current job or practicing for interviews at a different job?,mdzzl94,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fq0lm1/should_i_focus_on_getting_promoted_at_my_current/,"So I’m(25F) currently working as an entry level software engineer for the past 2-ish years. I started off as an intern Jan 2018, before getting promoted to full time May 2018.

So, I love my job. It’s extremely flexible to my schedule which I like and has great work/life balance. My boss is great and always looking to push me but also understanding of life circumstances. My coworkers are awesome and easy to work with plus we’re always encouraged to look into new technology. I feel like I’m learning everyday. And more recently, due to the Covid stuff the particular office I was working in was permanently closed and they had the employees working there transition to working from home full time which honestly is my dream situation! I was looking to eventually find a WFH job especially when I plan on having kids so this is great!

The only thing is the pay. The first year I was making around 69k and with a merit increase the second year it went up to 71k. I have a lot of other engineer friends who make way more than that for the same entry level positions. Around 80-100k. Obvs location matters due to cost of living, and my area is a little lower in cost of living than theirs but I am still feeling kind of unsatisfied in that sense and feel like I can be making way more elsewhere. If I get promoted in my current position it will be around 10k increase which I feel I’d be more satisfied with. My boss did express interest in promoting me last year but I feel like I need to show a little extra to get to that point.

Due to covid and general finance situation I will probably stay at this job for at least a year (currently living at my parents, working to pay off my student loans and save up for a home of my own). But my question is should I invest that time in looking at ways to promote in my current company? Or to start practicing for interviews in other places?"

College admissions are over for me and I've been super lucky to choose between Dartmouth (intended Math), Columbia (intended Computer Eng.), Berkeley (pre-CS LAS) , and UIUC (CS).

I won't be doing any tours since I already visited these schools last summer.

In terms of CS rankings, history, and prestige I think Berkeley and UIUC win. Berkeley is obviously BERKELEY (it's been my dream school since i toured) and UIUC, while not known at all outside of the CS industry, has had some really impressive alumni attend the college (founders of Tesla, PayPal, Advanced Micro Devices, Palantir, Wolfram Alpha, YouTube, Yelp).

My brother strongly recommends NOT coming to Berkeley for the BA in CS for 2 reasons: 1) While it is not insanely difficult to declare CS, it is not worth the risk of being a CS major. A lot of his friends chose pre-CS L&amp;S Berk over similar tier schools (Waterloo, GTech, CMU, UIUC, Harvey Mudd, UT Austin, UW Seattle, etc.) and were unable to declare CS so ended up majoring in math or Data Science instead. This really held them back for internship and even full-time job applications at top BigN / Unicorn companies since they couldn't make it past resume screening for SWE positions. 2) Once you actually do go through the grueling effort to declare, the difference between Berk and other top 7 CS schools makes no difference in the eyes of recruiters. For context, my brother is a senior at Berkeley EECS so he never had to worry about declaring.  But I'm still unsure if declaring CS at Berkeley is as difficult as he claims.

When looking at the curriculum for CS, Berkeley and UIUC have far more technical requirements than Dartmouth and Columbia. The core req for Berk in particular is insanely comprehensive and there are a ton of elective courses to take. While Columbia and Dartmouth were amazing places, I can definitely say the CS resources/curriculum did not compete with Berk and UIUC when I visited. There seemed to be a massive emphasis on the arts which makes sense since ivies are LAS oriented schools.

I'm still torn tho because Columbia and Dartmouth were such amazing places. I'm just afraid of required english and history courses cuz AP Lang and APUSH was a STRUGGLE for me. Also the general people I felt surrounded by at Columbia and Dartmouth were awesome and the community seemed really close/tight-knit.

Oh and I'm OOS for both publics so everything is essentially the same price.

What do you guys think ? Given these criteria what is the best choice."
fq2ev6,16,2020-03-27,TIFU by forgetting food in a pot for a month. Another Victim of the Virus.,EmperorAnimus,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fq2ev6/tifu_by_forgetting_food_in_a_pot_for_a_month/,"Before you categorise me as a filthy piece of shi* give the story a chance.

So I’m currently interning in a neighbouring country, and some time through that, my mother started cooking me meals every weekend, since I go back almost every week. It’s Usually one for breakfast, and one for lunch (which I do help her prepare). Every day, I’d take out a portion for sandwiches in the morning to take to work, and Heat up lunch in this rice cooker that I took from home since no one ever uses it, and that has been my routine for a few months now.

Enter Covid-19 and public panic.

One month ago, I was on-call an entire weekend since someone switched with me, so second day comes, and I take all my stuff with me thinking I’d go home for a night and take my food, see the family, go out with friends etc. Only to be told the moment I walk into the interns room that morning that the borders are closed. Took a moment for it to sink... along with all my hopes and dreams.

But that’s okay, since I’m an independent grown up man, and I’ve already been abroad for 6 years. I just bought some groceries, and gas canister for that portable stove I bought two months prior but never got to use, and started making all my meals, like any adult would do, never using that rice cooker again. 

Getting the point:

Today I wanted to make something different, like steamed potatoes with melted cheese and beef, so I pop open that now dusty Rice Cooker and to my horror I see the most repulsive, disgusting pile of , nightmarish black mush covered in green mold with  with little orange seeds of nopes, and wriggly ‘I’m gonna throw ups’. I can’t describe it with any besides saying it’s like someone took an infested mushy dump into the pot... disgusted? Well, consider how I felt! 

I put the pot into a plastic bag, but that stuff won’t fall off no matter how much I shook or hit the pot. I go back to see the cooker, and the lid had worms crawling on it with orange eggs or cocoons or whatever the hell that was, grabbed the whole thing and hosed it down, but they wouldn’t fall off [how could they hold on that tight? Does their will to destroy my dreams give them that much power?]. 

In the end I wore a pair of long sleeve rubber gloves, took a new sponge, double plastic bags, manually isolated that miniature cursed swamp while trying my best not to cry or throw up, taking breaks when needed, because I’m now staring at entire life’s sins given form in a pot, and that oughta be traumatising regardless of who you are. Finally I scrubbed everything like there’s no tomorrow, using my figurative tears to wash what remained down the drain... I think I’ll have sleep for dinner, I don’t want to eat anymore. 

TLDR: forgot food in a pot, got stuck in a neighbouring country, started cooking using different pots and stove, opened it today only to be horrified, cleaned it as I held back my tears... and stomach content."

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said that is my current plan. I work a comfortable, cozy job making $20/hr as the head kitchen lead. I have very minimal bills. Life is very comfy for my right now. Which may lead you to ask, why career change? I hate my job. Plain and short. I do not want to do kitchen work for the rest of my life, I want something more rewarding. I feel like IT would be great. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side of THAT coin, I don't want to take a huge pay cut currently (saving for a house) but want to eventually advance my career. Which leads me to my question(s):

* When I get A+ certified (no schooling) could I possibly find a part time job? (Even an internship would be fine just so I could be doing that during the day, then my main job during my regular hours)

After I get A+ certified I don't plan on stopping. I would then go for my Sec+ and Net+ but only once I started gaining some experience from an employer."

**Conclusion:**  
Ever wondered what happens when you bumble through high school but are good at standardized testing? Here ya go. I really wish I started enjoying learning before this (senior) year, but that's what happened, so here I am. This whole process really sucked the life out of me, but I'm ""glad"" I spent so much time on it because otherwise, I wouldn't have the options that I do now. I think I'm going to commit to USC regardless of my last two decisions because they offer a great scholarship for NMFs. These posts got me ready for the wave of denials that I faced, so I wrote this to give back to future applicants (especially those with high test scores but average ECs).  

**Personal tips for future applicants:**  

1. Before you start any supplements (esp. your CommonApp essay), **find some really good examples of said essay** (ones that got people admitted) and **see how good they are.** You'll feel bad about yourself for a little bit, but it'll give you an idea of what these universities are looking for and a goal to aim for.  
2. **Be real with yourself.** I expected full denial and I managed to get into some great places. However, I know lots of people who babied themselves and thought they had ""very good"" chances for admission at competitive universities and didn't take the process seriously and are now regretting it.  
3. This process rewards those who have A). **Ground for the last three years of high school** (GPA, ECs, Awards, etc) and B). **Grind for first-semester senior year** (Standardized testing, supplements, interviews, etc). If you're aiming high but are lacking in category A, go all out during application season. I personally spent 4-6 hours each day working on apps alone (slow writer, I know) from Nov 1 - Dec 15 and presently, I'm very glad I did. Otherwise, I'd probably only get into my safeties and would be considerably less excited about college than I am right now (**serotonin**, yay).
4. It's better to **apply to too many colleges than too little.** Even if you think you have almost no chance of getting in, it's better to have closure than a permanent ""what if"" after decisions are finally released. **But if this isn't financially feasible, that is completely understandable.**"

I work roughly 50 hours a week in the theme park (food and beverage) industry while I am getting my BS in Computer Science. I'm in a salaried role, so I can't transition into any type of internal internship or anything like that. As such, the prospects for getting an internship during my schooling or any similar experience seem extremely slim. I am not able to quit my job or take a pay cut as I am the sole provider in my household, and I don't want to lose my (or my family's) healthcare.

That being said, my expected graduation is Spring 2022. I don't have many projects to my name as of yet, but I'd like to change that. My current courses primarily tackle algorithms and data structures, but I am looking to apply those concepts to actual, feasible projects.

When creating personal projects, is it better to consistently commit smaller scale programs, or start developing something larger, such as an app and continue to improve it over time? Additionally, what other things can I work on or learn now to become more competitive in the future? I am really looking to start filling up the gap in my resume where an internship would be now, so that I am not struggling later on.

Thank you!"

I've created a subreddit, [Project Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/projecthub/), for sharing and developing projects. As we're all sitting at home, self-isolating, I figured this might be a way for people to engage with others and develop personal and professional skills in a meaningful way. Additionally, I'm sure some people have had their internships cancelled and may be looking for something to do over the summer. My hope is that this can be used as a supplemental resource.  

At the moment, it's super bare bones. The only posts are my own, as the subreddit was private up until today. Any and all feedback would be appreciated; additionally, if anybody would like to help run the sub, I would, of course, love the assistance.

While I admittedly created the subreddit with computer science projects in mind, this is intended to be a resource for all disciplines/backgrounds.  

As with many other resources, the sub's content will become better as more people actively participate. If you look at the sub in its current state and think that it's empty and worthless, I would ask that you think about ideas you've had that you've been unable to pursue due to a lack of general interest. At the moment, I'm only submitting this to the UMD sub, but I may open it up to others eventually.

Because I wasn't able to find an internship for this summer and won't be able to take class during the summer semester I was thinking of using the free time to make a decent portfolio.

I am mostly the kind of guy who doesn't not care which technology to use to achieve a wanted functionality. I'm pretty much wiling to use whatever is convenient and appropriate for my software ideas.

For example, earlier this year I made a small command line application which is a  minimalist version of YouTube [Link](https://nassimslab.itch.io/mt). I needed this because I was addicted to YouTube. I wrote this in Python.

Now If I want to be a software engineer do I need to pay attention to the popular frameworks and languages? Should I do my projects in X because it's in high demand.  Or is just making good useful software is enough?

When I was looking at jobs some are very specific like java developer, react developer etc...

Also what is the difference between a general software engineer job listing compared to something more specific like react developer?"

I'm 24 years old. I'm a student, still. Today I feel very sad and empty inside. This feeling is torturing me for a few weeks, maybe months, now. I'd like to ask you for some advices. Sorry for my potential english mistakes. 

Here's my story: 

Since I was a little boy, I always wanted to be a doctor. I always wanted to have my own place where I could help people or simply work in a hospital. Years passed by. I finally got to med school. I've started at 21 y/o due to health problems (I should start at 18 in my country).

This year I've got my first internship at a hospital. Well, it was pretty much as I've expected it'd be. I was very motivated. I was trying to accomplish every task, even the most annoying ones, in a best possible way. It was my dream and it became so incredibly real, who wouldn't be excited, right? 

One evening, after work, some kind of doubt started to build a nest in my head. It started very slowly, I could chase those thoughts pretty easily. Now I can't even go to sleep without that weird feeling in my stomach: I can't see myself doing this kind of job for the rest of my life and it's killing me. I'm 24 years old and feel like I'm currently studying a field I couldn't care less about. 

Well, here comes the problem. I'm getting old. My wish would be to stop my studies and start something else. I've even dreamt about it a few nights in a row last week. That's how obsessed I am right now.  I was looking for something else for a few months. I'd like to completely change the field and I'm thinking about Computer Science which also gives a lot of opportunities. 

My parents are actually paying for my studies - I'm currently living in France (alone) and the costs of universities aren't even close to US. I don't know what to do. Am I too old to change studies? What if I switch to Computer Science and feel the same way as in med school? The other problem are my parents - they are already criticizing me for being 24 and not having any diploma yet. We're not a very close family - we don't talk very much about our feelings and stuff. If I told them how I'm feeling right now, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't understand and would probably stop financing my studies if I decided to switch. 

I know it's unethical and I'm kind of expecting what kind of answers I'll get, but should I switch without telling them anything? Maybe should I force myself to continue? Should I simply stop? 

I really have noone to talk about it and I'd like to feel happy about my future again. Please, help."

BU has been one of my favourite universities for a long time, but I wanted to ask a couple questions, and would appreciate any insight!

\- I've seen a lot of stuff saying BU lacks school spirit and such. Now i myself am not one who is super eager on attending school games and such, but what do you think of the ""lack"" of school spirit?

\- are there any students on here who did IB before attending uni? because i'd love to talk to someone about the transition from IB to college, and how much harder it gets

\- since BU does not have a proper campus, do you feel you miss out on the ""community"" feel and aspect of college?

\- how easy/difficult is it to make friends? of course there has to be effort on our own part too, but what were your experiences like when you first joined BU?

\- ive heard lots about grade deflation at BU, and wanted to ask about that? Is the grade deflation thing a big deal, and how does this impact your chances for grad school? I've also been accepted with the presidential scholarship, but to renew it, a certain GPA has to be maintained- is that really hard to do with the grade deflation?

\- I've applied for neuroscience, so also wanted to ask about research and internship opportunities

\- finally, any thoughts on the dorms, housing, and food is also greatly appreciated!

thank you, and hope everyone is keeping safe during this challenging time"

I am currently a sophomore at a Business school and am doing a minor in Computer Information System. I am currently enrolled in an intro to database management class and have some knowledge of SQL. 

I am currently planning my courses next semester and would like to ask which class should I take first: Python/HTML/More SQL. I will need to take these classes no matter what in the future, but I am wondering if I should take one before another. Another concern I have is that recruiters seems to favor python skills more and I will be applying to internships next semester. Would taking python give me a better advantage than other coding classes?

Any feedback is welcomed! Thank you in advance!"

 I got accepted to the University of Florida’s innovation academy. A program that limits your majors and basically your minor is focused in innovation. A factor that is tilting my decision is that the major of interest is computer engineering while the innovation academy only offers computer science. I found a way to go around that by just taking electrical engineering electives and than having a graduate degree in CE or find a way to petition out of the program.

Pro factors:

1. No.7 Ranking in the Nation

3. Cheaper Costs ( Cambridge Diploma = Bright Futures )
4. Traditional College

Cons:

1. Locked into the Innovation Academy. 
2. Limits my majors. ( I think I may want to try Biomedical Engineering)’
3. Nothing exciting in GaineSeville. (I heard)

UM: I got accepted to the University of Miami for the fall term with the engineering as undecided.

I live in Miami and honestly I would still dorm to keep the same away from home feeling I hoped for. A factor that heavily effects this decision Is.... THE COSTS. 60k a year? I haven’t submitted my financial aid information yet but that is a lot of money. Especially if I chose the 5 year track. 60k x 5= 300,000+ and I did want to travel for internships or study abroad. Maybe if my Cambridge Diploma can land me bright futures in UM ( its a private school ) I’d be more interested in the program.

I applied for CS for both schools but applied to Letters and Sciences in Berkeley. I know it is a really competitive school for classes and getting that major in junior year. But I do know that it is #1 for CS and has great job opportunities. However it is really a big risk that I could potentially not get the major and compromise to data science or something similar.

For UCLA however, I've been admitted directly to my major, so I know getting classes/opportunities in school won't be as cutthroat. I've also totally fallen in love with the campus and overall vibe. It just worries me that I won't get as many job opportunities (as I am farther away from the bay area) and that it isn't as prestigious in CS as Cal.

Here's my pro/con list for each school:

**UCLA** \- Computer Science and Engineering

**pros:**

Has a great ""college experience"" feel

Really beautiful campus and location

My best friend is going to a nearby university

accepted direct to major

prestige

**cons:**

Not as close in proximity to Silicon Valley for jobs and internships

Not as good for CS as UIUC or Berkeley

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**UC Berkeley** \- L&amp;S pursuing a CS/Data Science degree

**pros**:

proximity to Silicon Valley for jobs and internships

close to home

great for CS

nice campus/good location

prestige

**cons**:

Not admitted directly to major

L&amp;S is really competitive for CS and might have to resort to Data Science or other majors

Pretty competitive school

fqdvkf,10,2020-03-28,College Rejection Can Have an Impact,Timely_Union,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqdvkf/college_rejection_can_have_an_impact/," Hi everyone,  
I am a recent college graduate and will be entering graduate school in the fall. Having gone through both the undergraduate and graduate application processes, I have faced a fair amount of rejection, and I thought I could offer some insight from my experience. I would like to preface this by saying that this is not going to be one of those many testimonials telling you everything will work out for the best if you get rejected from your top schools. I think too often, many people put shut heavy emphasis on the idea that rejection is not the end of the world, that they forget that rejection is still a negative that must be addressed. I also apologize in advance for the length of this post.   
For background, I was a very strong high school student with a very good GPA, a solid SAT, multiple diverse extracurricular activities which included several leadership positions, and multiple other line items that are standard on the resume of a strong undergraduate applicant. I applied to a number of Ivies as well as a few other well-know,  elite or prestigious schools. I was rejected from each of the elite schools to which I applied, and I was even waitlisted at a school I thought was a target/near safety. As a result, I ended up attending a semi-safety school that had offered me a scholarship. In retrospect, I wish I had simply attended a slightly lower ranked state school to save myself and my family the cost of a private education, as it would not have changed my professional and academic prospects significantly.   
This school was not particularly well-ranked in its specialty (my field), but I hoped that if I tried to performed exceptionally at a less prestigious university, I could stand out or in some manner, salvage what I could of my undergraduate experience. I found most of the academics fairly easy, compared to high school. It was a lot of busy work that failed to foster critical thinking or greater depth of knowledge. I earned near perfect grades (there was one course in which I did not achieve an ‘A’ grade). My performance allowed me to take graduate courses in place of a number of my undergraduate courses. In addition to my academic standing, I was also involved in the school’s honors college and completed my own research paper that has been published. I had two jobs on campus and had a leadership position in a community service organization, along with a few other extracurricular activities.   
This school did not have great on-campus recruiting, which greatly impeded my ability to get an internship with a larger firm, despite my competitive resume. I managed to attain three internships, which were all at small firms, were not developmental/educational in nature (again mostly busy work, office stuff), did not offer any networking benefits or meaningful long-term connections, and were not helpful in attaining other internships down the line.   
In my last year at this school, I studied for the graduate exam of my field and applied to a number of graduate schools. The programs to which I applied were targeted at recent graduates with minimal full-time experience. I did fairly well on the graduate exam (90th percentile), but I definitely felt I could have done better if I had prepared better (hindsight, right?).   
My recommendations were very good, except for my professional recommendation. Given my struggle to get impressive internship experience, my professional recommender was a man who was career professional in the field and who had somewhat impressive accolades, but given the nature of my work with him, he could not speak to my skills very well. He could basically say that I did what I was told in a timely fashion. My other recommenders were two professors, one who is a part-time researcher at an Ivy League school with whom I had done my research project. The other was a professor who has a very impressive background in my field and who taught me in one of the graduate courses I took as an undergraduate.   
My applications ended up rather strong. The only detracting factors were my internship experience and, therefore, my professional recommendation, and my undergraduate institution.   
I recently received the responses to my applications. I did not get into the elite programs to which I applied. As such, I will be attending another semi-safety school that has offered me scholarship, as I do not have any better options. I would assign approximately 50% of the blame to my undergraduate institution, and the other 50% to myself. I think I could have done better on the graduate school exam, but I did not do poorly. I also think if I tried a lot harder, I could have possibly had better internships. However, getting a better internship would have been a matter of luck, as I did put in a lot of effort seeking internships. I believe that had I gone to a better undergraduate school, I could have had better internships and simply having the name of a more prestigious school on my resume would carry more influence. Having these factors could have potentially led to being accepted into at least one of the elite programs to which I applied.   
So, I guess what I am trying to convey with my story is that if you get rejected from college not everything will necessarily work out for the best. Even if you put in 100% effort and work yourself ragged to stand out at a less prestigious institution, the brand name you lack can still preclude you from many amazing opportunities that are offered to average students at elite schools. So, if you have the option, do not attend a mediocre school, especially if it is a private school, simply for cost reasons. Attend to your local state school (or the best public school in your state) or even a community college, establish a very good GPA, and transfer to the most elite school you can, assuming the best public school in your state is not already elite (like UNC, UCLA, UT Austin, etc.).   
I still recognize that I have good career prospects and that I have a lot going for me. I have the privilege of living in a Western nation and have the freedom, finances, and aptitude to seek higher education. I know that I should have faith and that this is all a part of a God’s perfect plan. However, I estimate that my undergraduate institution has set my career progression back by about 1-2 years. Thus, I want to offer an admonition and some advice to others who are in a similar situation to the one I was in about four years ago. 

I am open to answering questions on college applications, dealing with rejection, how to build up your resume in college, etc.   
 

tldr: attending a worse undergraduate institution can have a material impact on your future career and academic prospects"

I am looking for a new laptop for general use. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Marine Science and I am pursuing a career in that field, so  I need something that can handle the following:

Microsoft office (word, excel, etc)

RStudio and JMP

Has a good battery life

Can last me 4-5 years (I used to have this pretty nice hp, but it stopped working after two years when it got updated to windows 10 back in 2016)

Also if it can handle GoPro Studio, Zotero, and ARC GIS that would be nice but I can go without those. 

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Total budget**   
$400-$600, USD
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No, looking for a new laptop.
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Performance and battery life are important, looking for something that doesn't lag too much and won't run out too quickly. 
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Not very important, but I do prefer a thicker laptop.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
12-16 inches.
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
GoPro Studio (maybe), not planning to game with this laptop.
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Nothing fancy, but I am looking for something that can handle RStudio and/or JMP, as well as microsoft office. 
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
I'm hoping to use this laptop for general use but also for things like RStudio/JMP in case I need it for work in my field, and I did make use of these programs in college and in my internships so I am planning to use them in the future.

I looked around and while I haven't made up my mind, the Lenovo ideapad S340 seems pretty good (also noticed that is was recommended in the quickpicks from the sidebar).

Would the Lenovo Ideapad s340 be a good laptop for me, or if there are others that might be better which ones should I check out?

I'm an Indian student from Dubai with a strong academic background. I applied for a BS in Data Science to many universities in the US.

As of now, I've to decide between Purdue University and Pennsylvania State University (Hons) 

Pennsylvania State University

I've been offered admission to the college of Information Sciences and Technology for Data Science at University Park Campus. I've also been offered admission to the Schreyers Honors College. Some benefits of the Honors College are as follows

•Access to Integrated Undergraduate Graduate (allowing completion of undergrad and grad concurrently and permits students to use the honors thesis for the graduate thesis , as well as using some courses towards both degrees)

•Honors housing
•Specially Trained Honors advisors
•Priority registration for scheduling classes
•Access to Senior Faculty
•$5000 annual scholarship
•Small class sizes
•Fellowships ( Better internship and research opportunities) 
•Scholarships

Purdue University

I've been offered admission to the College of Science at Purdue University for Data Science. I've heard that you cannot go wrong with Purdue as it is a solid choice especially with regards to engineering. A lot of students from Dubai opt for Purdue, so it may seem to be a more familiar environment for me. 

Additional Information

The fee structures for both universities are similar (around $48K a year). Furthermore academics is the priority between these two colleges. I'm an INTJ, and not a big fan of partying or Greek Life. However I look forward to participating in various clubs recognised by the university. 
I'm currently undecided on whether to pursue a grad degree after undergrad.

I appreciate any constructive input on the above matter."

**LORs and Essays**

* LORs: I read both of my teachers' recommendations but did not read my counselor's recommendation. Both of my teacher recommendations were extremely flattering, and I imagine they played a large role in my acceptances. One teacher said I was the ""best student of her career,"" and another said that she rarely sees a student like me. They also focused a lot on my character and personal qualities outside of academics, a lot of which corroborated well with how I presented myself in my essays. I genuinely think I wouldn't have gotten into all of those schools without these recommendations.
* Common App: I think I'm a pretty strong writer, but even then, I didn't love my common app. I thought it was kind of cringy and I felt like it seemed a little inauthentic, but I do believe that it at least highlighted my personality traits. However, I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought because I received a note from one of my admissions officers saying that my essay was ""moving"" and complimenting my writing.
* Supplements were a mixed bag. I thought my Yale and Stanford supplements were pretty good, and I spent months working on them. On the other hand, I didn't particularly love my Harvard and Brown supplements and thought they felt rushed.

Thanks for reading and feel free to comment or PM me with questions! I'm far from an expert in college admissions, but I guess I did something right lol."

I am going to do an internship at big 4 TAS in Europe starting in a few weeks which lasts until July. However, I have been given the option to postpone my position and be an intern during the fall of 2020 instead.

I am thinking of accepting this since being an intern now will probably mean that I will work from home which I find quite daunting as an intern. However, if I postpone it until the fall then I’m afraid of other issues such as it not suiting my university schedule (dates are not up yet for exams etc). Also, I might still need to work from home during the fall anyway.

What would you guys do? Thankful for any input. :)"
fqg03p,1,2020-03-28,I hate that I like my crush,G33kyArmy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fqg03p/i_hate_that_i_like_my_crush/,"I'm a 21 y/o female, I assume my crush is 22 (he should be in his fourth year of university come fall given he'll be doing his internship then), he's in a club I'm in at uni, but I don't know much about him personally, and I don't even know if he's single. I don't know why I like him. I have never gone on dates because teenage dating was off limits, and now I just haven't found a guy I want to date/would date me. Even the guy I like, date sounds fun in theory, but not worth it in the long run. 

He technically checks off my ultimate dealbreaker, which is not a personality thing or anything super serious, I just don't want to get into details. And even then, he's generally not really my type of guy to begin with. I was in denial about liking him for like two months. But in hindsight, I wanted to watch Friends season 8 around the time I started liking him because it was where Joey gets a crush on Rachel. A friend of mine says she sees the parallel, of developing a crush on a friend, not being able to do anything, not wanting to ruin the friendship, yadda yadda, so my desire to watch something kind of heartbreaking or distressing was odd, even to me.

In hindsight, again, I always felt an impulse to keep conversations going when he and I were alone after the classic icebreakers, I sometimes tried to go more full out on activities the club did when he was around, and when he performed at an event that we both attended, I caught myself kind of gazing at him the way I had with my high school crush when he was the lead in the musical. 

My sister said crushes happen more easily when you haven't liked anyone in a while, and considering my last crush was in 2017 in my first year in post secondary, I say it's fair to assume that could be the case. But at the same time, this guy has many admirable traits, and I do personally think he's attractive.

The aforementioned sister and I also have a joke that I'm like an anime protagonist, and I had one situation with this guy that felt very anime-esque to me. Club had bad news regarding something I was leading. The group talked about it, then I had to go fill my water bottle. After I left, he chased me down, giving me my phone (for reasons I am still unsure of) and as I grabbed it, he kept hanging onto it, our hands touching, and asked if I was ok, and saying that our group would figure things out. Then he left. I kept my composure until he left. I was a little dumbfounded by that, but I laughed at myself afterwards, and thought it was just the cherry on top of my faux anime life.

The only good I've seen come from this crush is I've finally matured to a point that I can talk to a guy I like without looking or sounding awkward/ making it obvious. The hand touching thing was the only exception, and I didn't even make it awkward, my brain and heart just raced. 

Probably gave more details than anyone needed, but I just want to get over this guy. The self reminders that he's not whatever don't help. I'm stumped, my friends have no advice, a couple of my friends think my crush is cute, I have to keep this a secret from my best friend because she shipped us before I liked him, and I do not want to encourage that, and my parents would give me the high school lectures again of not causing drama, and then give me grief for feeling things for him. Please please give me some advice on getting this guy out of my romantic mind? I can only listen to ""I Hate Myself For Loving You"" by Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts so many times before it stops helping me feel the slightest relief from all this."

I know employers don't really care about an applicants major for a full-time job, however would I be placed at a disadvantage compared to my CS major peers who apply for a SWE internship? Would I be placed at a disadvantage for grad school in a quantitative discipline? 

What is the best way to receive an internship, I know all about the interview process, but what is the best way to get the call to do a physical interview with a company? 

I understand that some questions like these may be asked a lot on this group, but any clarification will be greatly helpful."

Right now I work full time and am in my junior year of computer science. Coming this fall, I'll be in my senior year. The thing is, I need to support my wife physically can't work, but getting disability, my three kids and my mom who lives with us help out with the kids, the oldest being 8. 

If I were to quit my job for an unpaid internship, my wife's disability + mom's SS checks really can't pay the bills. They are also both in debt still. We all are. Even if I get a paid internship, it will end at the end of summer. Then I'll be out of any jobs, and would need to explain to employers in my field how I did a 3 month internship for a different field.

My positions consists of helping call center agents troubleshoot issues while answering emails from senior managers, and conducting training plans for new hires. 

My friends believe I have enough experience to apply elsewhere and make more money, but I feel like that doesn't consists with my future plans.

Should I stay for another couple of years until I start applying for internships, so I don't deal with the stress of a new job + school, or should I look for new opportunities.

This sounds cool especially since I’d be able to study abroad first semester in Paris. I’d miss out on all the freshman experience though...no football games, no freshman dorm, none of that. By the time I get to USC I feel like everyone is going to be friends. Also, I live 30 min south of USC, and I don’t really know how I feel about the city vibe. I’ve visited plenty of times. I don’t like how huge it is. I don’t like how when you take one step off campus it’s like a third world country. I also don’t know if study abroad will be available because of corona, and I don’t want to get stuck doing community college for my first semester while all my friends are at their schools having a blast. If corona does make schools go online in the fall, maybe USC would be the better option because I wouldn’t be in school until the spring. 

Meanwhile, I got into Tulane 3 months ago and have fallen in love with it. It is pretty incredible. The idea of being in New Orleans, the beautiful campus, the less competitive atmosphere, smaller classes. I have also visited a couple of times. It’s close to my grandparents so I’d be able to visit them on the weekends. I like the idea of getting out of California for once in my life. I am a street performer (trumpet) and I want to be a part of the jazz capital of the world. I would start in the fall at the same time as everyone else. I would be in the honors program and I would get to be in the honors dorm which are suite style. I received the Community Service Fellowship too which only 25 students received this year to be part of a community service cohort. It just seems like I would be happier there, but how should I know? Maybe it’s all just in my head. Maybe I will hate it at Tulane. Who’s to say Tulane won’t be hit by another hurricane in the next 4 years that sends all its students home like what happened with Katrina. Maybe Tulane will be closed in the fall semester due to corona. 

I’m not really a sports guy, and I don’t like the idea of Greek life dominating a school. I’ve heard this is big at USC.

I was admitted to the business school at both schools. THIS is what makes me lean toward USC. The fact that USC’s business school is tremendously better than Tulane’s business school. Granted, Tulane has a great business school. I don’t know how much the Tulane name carries to employers... From what I understand, finding internships from USC is a piece of cake because of the amazing alumni network and the excellent facilities and connections. Then finding a job after undergrad is pretty easy too. If I received a masters from USC, I know I wouldn’t have any problem finding a high paying job. You supposedly really have to seek out internships at Tulane.

I feel like if I go to Tulane, I’ll look back and think I should have attended USC because I would be more successful and I’d have nearly guaranteed admission into the graduate school. However, I feel like if I go to USC, I’ll hate that I didn’t go to a school that I really really really aspire to be at. If only Tulane was ranked higher, maybe my parents could understand.

So before you give me your opinion here are a couple of things to note: Money isn’t a problem. I am not 100% sure I want to study business. And I am going to graduate school no matter what undergrad I go to. I know I will get a masters. 

Thanks.

Edit: I picked Tulane"

So background story: I (35F) met a guy (30M), let's call him Gee two months ago on a Meetup and we hit it off very well. He coincidentally also works for my company so I felt a little more safe and psychologically felt he can be friends with and is harmless. Anywho, we have hung out as friends and had some cool fun time - played video games, karoke, Netflix, movies etc. He flirted a lot with me and I had a feeling he was definitely showing interest in me. Over the period of time it was apparent he was looking for a casual relationship, he is also different than I am in terms of lifestyle- does weed, prompted me a lot to try it, isn't into fitness, less goals and more just having ""fun"". We have never gotten intimate.

One week ago we hung out at my place, I was cuddling with him on the couch just in a friendly way but he attempted to get intimate, I was very much in control (as much tempting as it was); but the next day when he asked me if we want to hangout again I mentioned to him we shouldn't hangout anymore since we both are looking for different things interms of relationship (I am looking for a serious relationship). He replied to my text saying why ""relationship"" is even a factor here and I just stopped texting and he didn't continue either.

Two days back out of boredom and being holed up at home and getting irritated I texted him on my office network and just said hi and how he was doing surviving the stuck at home situation. I also before signing off said to him how we had a good friendship and he ruined it. He went on to say something but I reminded him we are on the office network. So he texted me back on my phone (it's been a week since we did after my last no contact) - I told him we could have helped each other during this indoor situation but he ruined our friendship and that he didn't even apologize. He replied back saying he isn't apologetic about what he did and that he found it tempting and didnt sound like a big deal.

Here is the real issue: Yesterday someone looked up at my LinkedIn profile from my company who isn't part of my network . When I looked him up in my company network this person is an intern in the same group as Gee. 

Yesterday, later in the day Gee texts me and said he is willing to calm his desires for me and can still be friends with me!! The only questioned I had for him was If he knew the intern to which he mentioned he spoke to this kid for the first time yesterday. I asked him if he mentioned about me to this intern but he denied, he some how makes it sound like the intern could have access to our conversation on the company internal Network a day ago. It makes no sense to me and as an intern you don't get this level of access, I have a feeling Gee definitely said something about me to this kid and he looked me up! I generally never get involved with anyone at work because of reasons like this. Gee sounds very nonchalant and generally doesn't really care much! 

I was almost going to hangout with him again; but there are too many red flags, way too many. Nothing sounds good here; am I missing something?"

I'm an Indian student from Dubai with a strong academic background. I applied for a BS in Data Science to many universities in the US.

As of now, I've to decide between Purdue University and Pennsylvania State University (Hons)

Pennsylvania State University

I've been offered admission to the college of Information Sciences and Technology for Data Science at University Park Campus. I've also been offered admission to the Schreyers Honors College. Some benefits of the Honors College are as follows

•Access to Integrated Undergraduate Graduate (allowing completion of undergrad and grad concurrently and permits students to use the honors thesis for the graduate thesis , as well as using some courses towards both degrees)

•Honors housing
•Specially Trained Honors advisors
•Priority registration for scheduling classes
•Access to Senior Faculty
•$5000 annual scholarship
•Small class sizes
•Fellowships ( Better internship and research opportunities)
•Scholarships

Purdue University

I've been offered admission to the College of Science at Purdue University for Data Science. I've heard that you cannot go wrong with Purdue as it is a solid choice especially with regards to engineering. A lot of students from Dubai opt for Purdue, so it may seem to be a more familiar environment for me.

Additional Information

Pennsylvania State University

I've been offered admission to the college of Information Sciences and Technology for Data Science at University Park Campus. I've also been offered admission to the Schreyers Honors College. Some benefits of the Honors College are as follows

•Access to Integrated Undergraduate Graduate (allowing completion of undergrad and grad concurrently and permits students to use the honors thesis for the graduate thesis , as well as using some courses towards both degrees)

•Honors housing
•Specially Trained Honors advisors
•Priority registration for scheduling classes
•Access to Senior Faculty
•$5000 annual scholarship
•Small class sizes
•Fellowships ( Better internship and research opportunities)
•Scholarships

Purdue University

I've been offered admission to the College of Science at Purdue University for Data Science. I've heard that you cannot go wrong with Purdue as it is a solid choice especially with regards to engineering. A lot of students from Dubai opt for Purdue, so it may seem to be a more familiar environment for me.

I'm a Front end dev looking to get a junior dev role or even an internship. I only apply to recent postings in order to be one of the first to get my app in, but I've yet to even get a declined notice. Some recruiters have reached out, but one was looking for a React Native Dev(I have basically no experience in React Native) and another said he had a long term contract for me, but I don't think the hiring manager is going to hire a JR dev with no industry experience as a contract, so I'm expecting to get declined.  I've been using JS for 2 years now and I started react/redux, Mongodb,express about 7 or 8 months ago. I've started  applying to everything I fit the qualifications for in the entire country. What can I do to even land an unpaid internship?

Electrical components and such are backed up mostly by my grades and classes as far as that could go. My programming and coding wouldn’t be so easy since our common core classes have yet to incorporate any computer science into our curriculum so far and even though I have the experience and knowledge I want to be able to communicate that. Since most students are in the same position as myself this could potentially secure myself a job by giving me an edge.

I’ve had some small projects every now and then, but none of them have been that great or worthy in my mind. Anyone out there with some experience in creating these types of portfolios mind sharing a tip or two?"

**Schools:**

* MIT (EA) - Accepted
* Caltech (EA) - Deferred, Rejected
* UIUC (EA) - Accepted
* UCB - Accepted (Regents' Scholarship)
* UCLA - Accepted (got Regents application, but didn't end up getting it)
* UCSB - Accepted (Honors College)

* UCSC - Accepted
* USC - Rejected
* Duke - Waitlisted
* Harvard - Rejected
* Stanford - Waitlisted
* Princeton - Rejected
* Yale - Rejected
* UPenn - Accepted (University Scholars)
* Columbia - Rejected

I'm very lucky and very privileged to have super supportive parents who are willing to help pay for my higher education, so I did not apply for (and would not have qualified for in the first place) need-based financial aid at any of my schools.

Stats are mostly copied from my Chance Me, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/foqjr4/chance_a_current_senior_for_accuracyivy_day/). However, I have edited them slightly, so I believe what I have below is a slightly more polished version that is easier to read.

**Demographics:** female, Asian, CA (Bay Area), upper? middle class, large public high school

**Intended Major(s):** Math/Applied Math, I think Physics for second choice for some schools

**Academics:**

ACT: didn't take

SAT: 1590 (790 Eng, 800 Math) --&gt; took it once only in Dec my sophomore year, also down to give SAT advice to those who want it :)

SAT II: 800 Math, 800 Bio M, 800 Chinese (kinda useless), 770 Bio E (didn't send)

UW/W GPA and Rank: 3.97 UW, 4.44 W, school doesn't do ranks but I think I'm Top 5 or 10

**Coursework:** basically the most advanced track in our school, all honors if possible for courses not listed

AP Courses: 10th - Bio, World History, 11th - Calc BC, Chem, APUSH, Eng Lang, 12th - Stats, Phys C, APES, Eng Lit, Gov

AP Self Study: Chinese (9th), Phys 1 (10th), Micro (10th), Macro (10th), Psych (11th)

AP Scores: all 5's except 4 on Macro (for ones taken before 12th)

College/Dual Enrollment: DE in Spanish 3 &amp; 4 + 1 year of Wind Ensemble (Band), took Multivar at community college 1st semester senior year

**Awards:** National Merit Semifinalist (now Finalist + scholarship!), National AP Scholar, PVSA Gold Award for volunteering (3 yrs), department award for math, I'll put more in the ECs

**Extracurriculars:**

* ??? (9-12) - One of my main extracurriculars relating to math is pretty unique but will also be a dead giveaway as to who I am, so I won't be including it here. Participated since I was 5 and won multiple international awards for it. Founded a youth organization for this in freshman yr with other students. Created curriculum for this EC as a volunteer teacher at an afterschool (did this all 4 years of high school). Got a paid job for teaching this at a different afterschool in junior &amp; senior year.
* Math Club (9-12) - Treasurer 10th, President 11th-12th. Coached elementary and middle school math clubs for all 4 yrs as well. Awards: AIME qualifier (3 yrs), attended Math Prize for Girls (3 yrs), placed at Stanford Math Tournament, a few other small things.
* Dance (9-12) - Team Captain 12th. Dancing since I was 5 yrs old, on dance team for over 10 years. Submitted dance supplements to most of my schools (privates). Received multiple 1st place awards in competition (including 1st place at a national competition for my solo in junior year summer). The type of dance I do is also pretty unique but also a bit of a giveaway.
* Volunteering (9-12) - VP 9th-11th, President 12th. Founded a volunteer youth organization in freshman year. Did lots of performances at senior centers, volunteered at a program for special needs kids, helped out at homeless shelters, and some other miscellaneous activities. Accumulated around 200-300 hrs each year of high school (mostly for teaching math &amp; the first EC, as well as some for this youth organization).
* Spanish Club - Treasurer 11th. Got into this through taking Spanish at school. Participated in the Spanish dance show all 4 years of high school &amp; helped choreograph for 3 yrs.
* Science - A bit scattered: did SciOly in 9th, SciBowl in 12th, accepted into an online science program that is decently well known (I think) in 10th grade &amp; continued through 12th.
* Music - Played flute from for 6 years, but quit in the beginning of 11th. Played in a flute ensemble &amp; did lots of volunteer performances. Mentioned in my activities but that's about it.
* Summers - Participated in a pretty prestigious summer math camp for 10th &amp; 11th grade summers, participated in a less well known one in 9th summer. Did a few weeks of internship at a biotech company in 11th grade summer as well. Miscellaneous: attended national dance competition for about a week every summer throughout high school &amp; attended an international competition for the first EC in 9th grade summer.
* Research - Did research at my summer math camp in 11th grade summer (second year there) with a group of other students. Presented at the undergrad poster session at JMM and currently trying to get published in a journal!!!

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

My EA and UC application essays were definitely the best since I started working on EA essays in May and worked a lot on refining my UC essays. I think my CommonApp essay was decent, but a few of my supplements for RD privates were slightly rushed (they were still ok since I reused a lot of my early essays). I wrote a ton of essays about the first EC I mentioned above (involving both learning and teaching), a lot about dance, some math essays (relating to competitive math &amp; my summer math camp), and a few more about miscellaneous topics like gardening &amp; skiing (hobbies), volunteering, etc. I did have a counselor for my essays, so that obviously helped a lot (since my natural talent for writing is practically 0).

LORs: I got one from my AP Chem teacher and one from my APUSH teacher. I would say both recs were pretty solid since both teachers liked me decently well. I read my Chem teacher's rec, and it talked about my attitude and good performance in the class as well as some of my ECs. One plus for my LORs is that my school counselor knew me by name and said she would right me a more personal rec instead of one from a template (rare in a large public school where each counselor has to write for 100+ seniors each year). I also got an extra rec from the lead professor at my 10th &amp; 11th math summer camp, but I have absolutely no idea how well that's written since none of the students in my camp talked with him very often and only saw him at lectures. However, for schools that accepted a dance supplement or 2 extra recs, my dance teacher wrote me an amazing rec highlighting my leadership &amp; hard work that I was able to read.

**Thoughts:** I'm incredibly honored to have gotten into the schools I did (a bit of imposter syndrome though). I do believe that luck does play a big role in college decisions, but I also believe that hard work throughout high school and pursuing ECs and academic subjects that you love will take you incredibly far towards getting into good colleges, even if it does not land you in your dream school or the T20 schools. In addition, the skills you gain in high school and the passions you pursue should NEVER be done solely for the purpose of college, and these are skills and lessons you can take with you for the rest of your life, no matter what college you end up studying at.

I must emphasize that your essays are incredibly, incredibly important, and I think this is one of the main reasons I was successful with MIT and the UCs, as I poured a lot of time and effort into capturing a complete(ish) picture of who I am in these essays. Then, unfortunately, I got tired for RD, so my CommonApp and supplements for privates were slightly less well written (and not edited as much as I wanted), which I think is one of the reasons I was rejected from most of them. Please, please remember to *start early* on your essays. This is much more important than it sounds and so difficult to do, but I promise it will help you so much in the end!

I am also one of those insane people who applied to no true safeties and decided that some the UCs could be safeties when choosing what schools to apply to (I was also told this by my counselor, parents, etc.), so I am not the best example to follow on applying to a wide range of reaches, matches, and *true* safeties. My Asian parents and the competitive Bay Area community I grew up in has pushed me into that mindset that only the T20s are acceptable colleges to go to, and I am lucky enough to have gotten into a few schools that fit that guideline. I don't know when my brain decided in the back of my head that getting into Harvard was like an ultimate goal (and yes, I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get in despite all my other success), but I am slowly coming to terms with the idea that prestige doesn't matter as much as everyone seems to think. I think the idea of not going to a prestigious school feels very different from actually attending and having the full college experience at a school that isn't considered prestigious, and I hope everyone (including myself) can keep this in mind moving forward.

Overall, it's been a stressful and emotional process, and I wish the best of luck to anyone applying now or in the future. To everyone out there involved in college decisions, please support each other, reach out to friends who may be upset by the decisions received, and congratulate those who have managed to get into the college of their dreams. Please feel free to dm me with any questions you might have about the college application process, especially for more general advice or tips about the UCs and MIT :) Best of luck to all the other seniors out there and to the Class of 2021 for next year!"

I’m planning on going into cybersecurity after graduation so because Rutgers doesn’t have that, I am doing a computer science major there or if I go to Drexel, the cybersecurity major (CST). 

Drexel Pros:
- has a specialized program for what I’m looking for 
- co ops (3)
- bachelors &amp; masters earned in the 5yr program
- in philly/whole city to explore 

Drexel Cons:
- expensive &amp; wud have to take out a bit of loans (18k/year scholarship)
- brand new city &amp; completely unfamiliar 
- 1 hr from home 
- need to make completely new friends and start over
- bad area/campus? 
- small school? 

Rutgers Pros:
- very close to home 
- will have a bunch of familiar faces and friend groups 
- very cheap (in state)
- huge state school 

Rutgers Cons:
- no cybersecurity major so would be learning only hardcore CS 
- no coops and internships would be harder to seek out 
- would need to extra certifications/ courses to learn what I need for the jobs I want 

Please give your input &amp; advice based on this and help me decide!!! Thanks guys"

**Intended major:** international relations or whatever was closest (global affairs, etc.)

**Academics**:

ACT: 35 (36 English, 33 Math, 36 Reading, 34 Science), 9 Writing

SAT: didn't take

SAT II: 760 Math 2, 760 Literature, 720 Spanish (shoutout Georgetown for making me do 3 of these)

Class rank: school doesn't rank

UW/W GPA: 4.0/4.75 (absolutely wack grade inflation at my school, honors classes get the same weight as AP/IB classes)

**Coursework**:

AP classes and scores: Psych (5), Spanish Lang (5), Microeconomics (5), Macroeconomics (5), Calc AB (3), US Gov (this year)

IB classes: Spanish, English (11th and 12th grade, no scores bc I took the AP test for Spanish last year and who knows what's going on with IB scores this year)

Honors classes: English (9th and 10th), Chem (10th), school's Engineering program (9th - 12th), Math (9th and 10th)

Internship with county judge (summers before 11th and 12th)

JV Softball (9th and 10th, captain 10th)

**Essays:**

Nearly impossible to self-assess, but that's not going to stop me from doing it. I'm a good writer, but I'm not all that creative. I spent a lot of time on my Common App essay, and I think that turned out pretty well. Some of my supplements were a little last minute tbh, and probably could/should have been better.

**LORs:**

Again, very difficult to know. I'm a proud teacher's pet and I genuinely like my teachers, especially in humanities/social sciences classes, so I think these were solid. One was from my English teacher from 9th and 11th grade; I actually got to read it and almost cried. The other one was from my Spanish teacher from 11th and 12th grade, also probably good but maybe a little more generic.

**Schools and Results (1/1 on safeties, 5/5 on matches, 1/7 on reaches)**: 

Georgetown SFS (EA): Deferred --&gt; Rejected (sad boi hours, this was my top choice)

UVA (EA): Deferred --&gt; Waitlisted

UNC Chapel Hill (EA): Rejected

UMich (EA): Deferred --&gt; Waitlisted

U Richmond (EA): Accepted

Princeton (RD): Rejected

Tufts (RD): Waitlisted

Brandeis (RD): Accepted, $20.5k/year scholarship

American (RD): Accepted, $20k/year scholarship

Colgate (RD): Accepted

**My thoughts:**

Organization is super important, especially if you're applying to more than 10ish schools. I have so many spreadsheets and folders and subfolders. I also am very aware of the privileges I had in this process. I have parents who support me, but aren't overbearing. I wouldn't have gotten either of the internships I did if my mom didn't have some connections. My school counselor was super helpful. And I'm a good test taker.  Of course I worked hard, but I know that's not enough for a lot of people. If anyone has any questions or advice for me about where I should go (I have almost no idea at this point) please lmk!"

Do portfolio projects like apps etc count? Or should I be trying to get involved with teaching programming at a Dojo or something?

I'm a rising senior at a top 25 college. I saw that SVMP looks like a great opportunity, but I would need to miss a week at my tech internship (for a business role). Does anyone know if SVMP would help significantly with admissions, and if it would affect my full time return offer chances detrimentally? Past interns have gone to the program and received return offers.

I'm a diverse candidate (female, URM, etc) with a 3.9+ GPA, president of two clubs (finance, community service), etc and I feel like I'd have a strong chance without the SVMP program anyways. Would I still be advised to go? I'm concerned that if my internship shifts online due to COVID-19, it may be hard to differentiate myself and compete against other interns for a return offer.

However, I am also interested in Android development (sort of) and am going through some of the Google codelabs, and it seems alright as a career path as well, many upperclassmen I know have been successful in it.

I want to choose one of these and become a master at one of them. I have some questions:

* Which field would you go into today?
* Which field is more difficult to become an expert in? Is learning and becoming a software engineer easier than a data scientist?
* Is the difference in salary significant? Is there opportunity for retiring early in one rather than the other (want to FIRE)
* Is there more opportunity in one than the other? (Opportunity in terms of higher paying jobs, less saturated industry for more positions, etc)
* Is one easier to have a work-life balance in? I want to ideally work 9-5 and have time to spend with friends, family, and by myself (is that too much to ask for lol)
* Is one of the fields phasing out? Especially Android, I have heard will not have many jobs or the industry or shrinking or something. Is this true?

I want to work hard during college and learn everything about a specific field, and spend my working life with lots of free time for hobbies, etc. What will allow me to do this?"

fqxnp4,25,2020-03-28,UWaterloo vs UCLA CS,burnyman02,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fqxnp4/uwaterloo_vs_ucla_cs/,"I was recently admitted UCLA CS. While I was initially very excited to go, I have read numerous stories online and from a current CS major there about how the course is overly theoretical and teaches outdated technologies, has less course rigour than other school's CS programs, lacks startup culture and overall is not extremely well regarded in CS. I was also told you are forced to take a lot of low quality engineering courses as the CS course is in the department of engineering. 

However, I have heard that it is possible to get into top tech firms if you are willing to work hard and look for opportunities (though this appears to be the case from any university), and therefore good internships and job opportunities can be found at UCLA.

I am currently waiting for an offer from the UWaterloo, which I have heard has a very strong co-op program, excellent startup culture, and is very well connected into Silicon Valley. Further, as an international student, the costs of tuition, room and board at UWaterloo are about 18000USD a year cheaper than UCLA. It is possible to earn money in co-op terms at UWaterloo which further offsets its cost, however I have heard it is also possible to earn a substantial amount of money doing internships at UCLA, though these are typically only found from sophomore year onwards. Due to co-op, the CS program at UWaterloo is 5 years long compared to 4 years at UCLA, which means I would be paying for school for longer, but would have two years of work experience.

Would anyone care to give me reasons to pick either school, assuming I get into UWaterloo."
fqy47m,21,2020-03-28,I'm a UW CS Alum that posted my reflection on getting into UW CS years ago. AMA!,gestone,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/fqy47m/im_a_uw_cs_alum_that_posted_my_reflection_on/,"Hi /r/udub!

A couple years ago, I published this [article](https://medium.com/@justinharjanto/reflections-on-my-journey-to-uw-cs-cdd2fe5d692a) reflecting on my journey on getting into UW CS that's posted on the sidebar of this subreddit.

I know this subreddit has a lot of folks that are CSE hopefuls (I was once there!) and I know the system has changed quite a bit with the department giving more spots to direct admits. Now prospective admits to UW that want to major in CS have to make a pretty tough decision with whether or not they want to commit to a college without having the guarantee that they'll be admitted to CS. I still get emails to this day with questions (which I'm always happy to answer!).

To ease fears and to give insight into what it's like working in this industry, I figured that I should give back to the reddit community :). For a little bit more background about myself, I've had 4 software engineering internships (some of which I got without being a CS major) and I now work at Redfin as a software engineer (soon to be Amazon!).

Objective:

ACT: 36 w/ 9 on writing

Never took SAT

Subject Tests: Math 2 (800), Bio M (760), Chem (750), World (740)

UW GPA: 94.4/100 (straight average of all grades), slight upward trend (including 1st semester senior year)

School does not rank, but school profile indicates that I’m *probably* in the top 5% of my class for unweighted GPAs &amp; higher for weighted

Course Schedule:

* Freshman: AP World (Year 1), 4 Honors, electives
* Sophomore: AP World (Year 2, 5), AP CSP (5), AP Chem (5), 3 honors
* Junior: AP English Lang (4), APUSH (5), AP CSA (5), AP Calc BC (5), AP Physics 1 (4), H Latin IV, extra science just for fun
* Senior: H Multivariable Calculus, AP English Lit, AP Physics C (both parts), AP Stat, AP/DE Econ (both parts), AP US Gov \[no foreign language\]

Applied as a CS Major (in engineering where given a choice). Second choice major was linguistics (interest explained in supplements for many schools).

Extracurriculars:

* Interned at a small tech start-up last summer in a technical but non-coding role. Promoted to PT employee for senior year
* Engineering Competition Team for 3 years, Captain. Briefly discussed nature of competition and my role as captain
* Debate for 4 years, Secretary Jr Year and Captain Sr Year. Discussed what I did to transform the team as leader
* Model Congress for 4 years, President for 2 years. Discussed nature of club, role as leader, and changes I made to club.
* Service Org since middle school, VP. Discussed both service activities and actions/results as leader
* Ran a summer math/tech program for low-income middle schoolers in the summer before junior year
* Probably didn’t make a difference: another engineering team 9th/10th grade, MOOCs, personal coding projects, NHS

Awards:

* Top 10 National Finish in team-based engineering competition (not the year I was captain though). Competition is fairly recognizable but not exactly the Intel Science Fair
* National Honorable Mention in Tech Competition. Recognizable but not prestigious
* Debate Champion, Model Congress Best Delegate (put in the same slot for space)
* NMSF
* Brown University Book Award. For UVA, replaced this with school nomination for Jefferson Scholarship (I was a finalist but ultimately rejected :))

Common App Essay: honestly, I have no idea if it was good. I started and finished it very early (so not rushed) and no one I showed it to had any real suggestions for improvement. Definitely can hear my “voice”

Supplements (I’m going to be brutally honest in my assessments): 

UConn (for scholarship application): rewrote the day it was due (oops). Content was strong but stylistically bland

Pitt: wrote all five optional supplements, integrating past experiences with Pitt opportunities in most of them. They were solid, but also the first supplements I wrote, so they could have been better

UVA: The engineering one was light-hearted and fun and the community one aligns very well with UVA’s values. I liked them both. 

UMich: Extracurricular essay (about debate) was light-hearted and fun. Why UMich essay was very specific to the school and combined my past experiences with opportunities I am excited about. Community essay was okay, but not great.

Rochester: why Rochester had good content, meh writing style. Scholarship essay was pretty good given the limited space.

CMU: ""Why CS"" essay was good. The successful college experience supplement was possibly my strongest of all essays. “Free Choice” essay was okay, not great

Cornell: pretty good, imo

Northwestern: solid content, writing style meh

Rice: interests essay had good content but was choppy. Solid “Why Rice” essay. The community essay was pretty good, but similar to my Common App in content. My submission to “The Box” was clever, imo (and, most importantly, not a box of rice!), but probably had no effect on my decision.

Recommendations: I won’t bother to rate them (as I have not read any), but I can describe my general relationship with each recommender and what I think they wrote about.

CS Teacher: Had her for AP CSP (10th) and AP CSA (11th). I did read part of her rec for another program I applied for, and she said I was one of the best students she’s ever had. However, I believe she wrote my college rec fairly quickly.

English Teacher: Had for AP English Lang (11th). Loved me, said my rec was very easy to write and that I “nailed” every assignment from her class.

Math Teacher: had for H Algebra II (9th) and AP Calc BC (11th). She has told me that she thinks I’m one of the most creative students she’s had. She said my rec was very easy to write and on the longer side. Only sent to schools that allow 3 teacher recs.

Guidance Counselor: Thinks I’m one of her top students, likely integrated a lot of information from my brag sheet. Considers me to be a strong leader and nominated me for both the Jefferson Scholarship at UVA and UConn full-ride

Tech Internship Supervisor: I did read this one. It heaped on praise, but lacked specifics. Only sent to schools that allow outside recommenders.

Interviews:

UConn Scholarship: found a common interest with one of my interviewers, so conversation went very well

UMich: went fine, but not great. UMich says they won't consider anything bad the interview says about you though :)

Cornell: nice guy and we had a good conversation. This is apparently informational only

Northwestern: good conversation with a very nice guy

Rice: lasted like 15 minutes because the alumni interviewer wasn’t interested

Rochester: I did an on-campus one with a current student. From what I’ve heard from my friends, all of their interviews are pretty scripted, so fine

High levels of demonstrated interest for all schools

Demographics:

Race: white

Gender: female

Residence: CT

High School: high-performing suburban public school. For reference, our average SAT score is \~1250 and more than 10% have committed to T30s already

Family Income Level: $100k

Parents are both educated, but I have no family connections at the schools to which I applied

Strengths: I assume very strong recs, used most of the allotted space in the activities section to describe my leadership and contributions to the activities (as opposed to the activities themselves), awards were pretty strong, white female with track record of interest in CS can’t hurt (plus cited interest in linguistics)

Weaknesses: some of my supplements were rushed, B+ in the 1st semester of AP Calc BC junior year (did get it up to an A second semester), didn’t take a 4th year of Latin (even though Linguistics was my 2nd choice major at most places)

\-----------

I was kinda hoping posting this would give some hope to future applicants. In my junior year, I spent WAY too much time on College Confidential (I didn't realize how toxic it is until recently) and was convinced that I was wasting my time applying to most of these schools given that all these seemingly perfect applicants were getting rejected. I don't know what AOs saw in my (very imperfect) application, but maybe they'll see the same thing in yours :)"

My stats were a 35 ACT with two 800 SAT Subject Tests in Math Level II and Physics. I wrote my essays on my love for mathematical problem solving and math in general, the AI and deep learning club I founded in school and about a personal challenge I overcame in my life. However, reading over my essays, I realise I did not specifically discuss any of the programming projects I have done at hackathons, internships or recreationally. I have no way of checking my application and am therefore not certain if I specified these projects anywhere else in the UC application, but do not remember listing them specifically, and therefore am not sure if the admissions officer new about these. 

Is there is any chance of providing all this information in an appeal and getting into UC Berkeley? In addition, I was wondering if I should complete some other projects before the appeal application is due in order to strengthen my appeal."
fr03uu,1,2020-03-29,Should I focus on learning new technologies or improving ones I already have?,houndk4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fr03uu/should_i_focus_on_learning_new_technologies_or/,"Hi all, 

I'm a recent graduate who's been struggling with finding a job. My first onsite interview (after 100 applications thrown away) was delayed due to the outbreak but I'm not here to complain but to get some advice on which technologies I should start learning or improving to be able to find a job in the near future. 

To introduce my background a bit, I have strong knowledge in databases, solid background in cybersecurity (penetration testing) and some basic knowledge of ML algorithms. No internship experience but multiple nontrivial projects. Skill summary: 

Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS EC2/S3, Django, Node.js/Express, Bootstrap4, Linux

With that, I concluded I should focus on either

1) refreshing/improving on my existing skills: 

\- improve web development skills with Django (most recent project so shortest time expected)

\- work on a new project to refresh NoSQL as I haven't worked on NoSQL databases for a year

\- brush up network/cybersecurity knowledge (need some time as the cybersecurity training was more than 5 years ago so I'm not sure if it's worth spending time on this unless I want to be a network developer or security engineer) 

2) learning new skills to broaden job searching: 

\- learn React for full-stack (I'm not into front end but seems really hot)

\- learn TensorFlow for ML 

\- learn Spring for Java backend (Should I keep working on Django/Node.js to save learning time?)

\- learn GCP for clouding (Should I focus on AWS?)

\- learn Hadoop/MapReduce for Big data (I'm into interacting with data but will it take a long time?)

My goal is to get a job as fast as possible and to use my time wisely knowing what to focus. I'm not sure if I should be familiar with all the hot technologies or should be an expert in a few. I spend most of my day studying algorithms and doing LeetCode so plan to spend 1-2 hours a day on the learning part. Or should I spend more time on it + side projects as I don't have internship experience? 

Thank you for reading this long post. Any advice or suggestion would be really appreciated!"

During my finals I had an interview that I would've probably handled well but I couldn't focus, I panicked and bombed it. That's a story for another day. 

I am still hunting for internships and will continue to do so until summer. 

But my chances are bleak at this point. So my question is how do I best make use of my summer? What could i learn or do to boost my profile so that this does not happen to me again when i start looking for full time opportunities?

**GPA UW**: 3.9 | **W**: 4.6

**Rank**: counselors ""don't rank"" anymore but I'm at least in the top 9% of my class

**Awards** (barely any are academic and mostly about music even though I'm not going to major or minor in music :.))

\-basically recognized as a top student among the soph, junior, and senior classes at my school

\-""passed"" one of the highest levels of music examination in my state 

\-recognized by the congressman in my district for community service

\-President's volunteer service award (gold) a few times

\-won at regional music competitions and a BUNCH of awards from music competitions at local levels

\-a BUNCH of other recognition at lower levels for community service

**EXTRACURRICULARS** (just ""major"" ones)

\-speech and debate (10-12) I just do speech (OI) and I'm the president this year (but have I won any awards NO); only a club that has no actual mentor (no s&amp;d class at school)

\-music group performance at a senior nursery center (9-12): vice-pres in 11/12th grade

\-council of school's art program (10-12): was a co-director (organizer) of an after school showcase of performances (considerably big event) in my 12th grade

\-supps: I didn't really visit any schools, so the ""why \[college\]"" essays were meh, talking about the programs and departments that I liked. I recycled a lot of material from the 4 PIQs for the UCs and those were also eh, maybe 5/10.  

**LETTERS OF REC**

3: one each from chem/AP chem teacher, AP English teacher, and choir teacher umm I think they all liked me and I'm the type of person to ask a lot of questions on hw (chem) or essay feedback (eng assignments) but I don't have a personal relationship or anything serious with any. I actually saw my choir teacher's rec and I think she sounded really enthusiastic tho

**Reflection (thoughts on my admissions process, advice, and my school selection):**

I wasn’t too surprised about my results. I think my ECs brought me down—I didn't know what field of study I liked nor was I stressed about college admissions and didn't know what AOs were looking for until I started the admissions process :,). So, I only did ECs that I was most familiar with (music, but not majoring/minoring nor any noticeable awards) and was scared to join any academic club (scared of not being smart enough around the top people of the class). Also, because I'm not sure of my academic passion, I was scared to do college interviews and any essays touching upon my academic interest didn't stand out (I'm not a strong writer too. Me trying to do creative writing? Cringe). But, I think my upper-income background helped me, esp for USC--was expecting a rejection.

If I would've told myself advice 9 months ago, I would've told myself to look into the colleges' programs of at least the colleges that I heard, for a start. I felt so lost and confused on how to find schools that I liked that in the end I had to scramble an RD list after submitting ED &amp; UCs (they were based off of the ""popular colleges"" in my area, anyway). yep...If I would've told myself advice from the start of HS, it'd be to join more academic clubs, try to look for internship opportunities, and look into college majors that I like.

As for which school I'm leaning towards, I'm weighting my decision a lot on financial package and academic strength, so I'm leaning towards Chapman as they have the best finaid and I was invited to apply to their honors college, but I'm also looking at the UCs and CPP. I might do that ""price matching"" thing that some people do to increase their FA package as well for privates?...meh.

fr4d2r,1,2020-03-29,Should I let go of my idea to do a Masters for now?,Tcharly,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fr4d2r/should_i_let_go_of_my_idea_to_do_a_masters_for_now/,"A bit of background first: 22F, I am French in the French education system, I have been studying engineering for four years and did two years of scientifically-oriented high school before that. Hated the high school except that one subject, biology, taught by that one teacher. Failed/dropped out of my first year of college, which was a non-specific, high workload and competitive curriculum that drove me deep into depression for which I took meds for 8 months, changed for a more specific programme that was less time-heavy and more group-work oriented and I am about to finally finish my bachelor. 

I hated the whole process since I started doing science intensive curriculum in high-school and could only ever tolerate (but loved) the subjects taught by the teachers I loved. I have been dragging my feet and hiding my stress from myself for years. The main reason I (probably) will manage to graduate is my boyfriend, who I met in my course, who pushed me to work.

Now boyfriend’s back in Mexico and planning to start working. I was always told growing up that having a Master’s degree is the best insurance of a good career, a safety blanket to always fall back on. Plus, education is very cheap in Europe (I am looking at programmes that cost no more than 3000€ a year, most of them completely free and my family can afford it). That came mostly for my dad. So I grew up not even thinking of the idea of not doing a Master’s. I have found a few options, a bit more oriented towards a subject I think I like, design, as I was studying Mechanics and Aerospace engineering till then and liked the mechanics part. 

Still, now I don’t want to live like this anymore, doing something I don’t like but do because I am academically inclined and getting passing, and even decent marks is not too hard for me. I am just not sure if I would really like any master’s I found and would get into and if I don’t, I won’t have the force of pushing through it like I did till now. I have been stressing out, in sort of low-grade depression, for almost as long as I have been doing my bachelor’s. I don’t want to see people, talk to people, I don’t have any hobby except watching videos all day, have no memory or focus. I lose so much hair it’s terrifying, it only stops in the summer when I’m not in school (has been going on for two years). Finishing the last projects for that degree is very painful. I limit the sport I do and refuse to meditate because those activities make my emotions surface and I start crying uncontrollably.

My plan was to enroll in a 2 years Master’s programme in Europe (usual length in EU), and then move to Mexico with my boyfriend, work either in an engineering company, assist him as an entrepreneur or something else (like teaching French). I am starting to think that I should stop living my life like this and maybe doing a Master’s isn’t the thing to do right now, so another plan would be to, when I will have done my mandatory internship and the coronavirus craze will be over, take some time off and work for some time to figure out what I want. Engineering is all I’ve been doing all my life because my father and grandfather did it before me, I don’t know how to do anything else and I don’t know what I would like to do.

A few problems with that: I would probably go do those six months in Mexico, and don’t know if I could ever have the strength to come back, without him, to do my Master’s if I decided to. It would make our two years before being together and starting our family two years and a half. My father is emotionally unstable and will freak out if I tell him I am postponing my Master’s indefinitely and moving to Mexico, especially if I don’t have a precise plan of action. It’s a conversation I would not wish on my worst enemy and will be extremely hard, especially as I am not in the best emotional shame myself. Finally, I am scared as shit of giving up on the life plan that’s been ingrained in me since childhood and making such a bold move. For the reasons aforementioned I can’t really discuss that with my parents, and my boyfriend has heard me talk about it so many times but can’t really help.

I am sorry if the post is a bit disorganised, unclear, and long, but this has been putting me in very distraught states and I cannot get help from anyone around me. I will make corrections and clear up any detail needed."

**Tl;dr: Have fungal infection in armpits and groin. Rubbing apple cider vinegar on the areas to treat it. It burns but the infection seems to be going away. Is this a good idea?**

-	Age: 21

-	Height: 6’ 0”

-	Location: US Midwest

-	Weight: 176 lbs

-	Gender: Cis-Male

-	Medications: None at the moment, but previously Ketoconazole Cream 2% (Prescription), 1% Hydrocortisone (Over the Counter), and 150 mg fluconazole tablets

-	Smoking Status: Non-Smoker

Previous and Current Medical Issues: I’ve had an ongoing fungal infection in my armpits and groin area since July 2019. For a long time I didn’t do anything about it because I didn’t have the resources to do something about it (poor intern / poor student).

In late December I was prescribed 2% ketoconazole, to be applied 2x a day for 14 days. This was at a walk-in clinic in my hometown. Because my family went on vacation on the 10th day, I never finished using the prescription as prescribed since it wasn’t travel sized.

In early January, I was prescribed 4 fluconazole tablets, 150 mg, taken orally once per week, and those did alleviate the symptoms and fought the infection, but when the prescription ran out the fungal infection came back roaring with a vengeance. This was prescribed by the same walk-in clinic, but a different doctor.

In late February, I was prescribed another prescription 2% ketoconazole, to be used once a day, for 2-3weeks. This was prescribed by my university’s clinic in a different city. The prescription ran out on day 12 and I didn’t have the time or resources to get it filled (had no car and was broke) This fungal infection still didn’t go away. I tried using a 1% ketoconazole over-the-counter medication to alleviate the itching but that doesn’t seem to work.

-	Duration: Almost 10 months

-	Location of Complaint: It exists in both of my armpits as well as my groin (my thigh, the skin where my legs attach to my torso, my testicles, and any place covered by pubic hair) 

-	Photos: I only took photos of my armpits because I didn’t want to upload pictures of my groin to the internet.

-	Original photos of skin condition: https://imgur.com/a/k146Eei

-	New photos of skin condition, after topical treatment of Apple Cider Vinegar: https://imgur.com/a/JmbcaI7

The itching used to be unbearable at times, and I was looking for home remedies to alleviate the itching. I didn’t want to go to a pharmacy, not just to avoid COVID-19 but also because I have a dermatologist appointment in late May and don’t want to use anything that would make my fungal infection anti-fungal resistant.

I tried using an ice pack on my most itchy areas, as well as garlic, but they only provided temporary relief for an hour, max. I decided to use a topical application of apple cider vinegar on my fungally infected areas, 3x a day for a week. Currently on day three of using this.

The itching has mostly stopped and it appears the fungus is going away, because I see more of my normal skin, but it burns and is very painful, and the area is now very red and dry skin is flaking off. The skin there is tender to the touch and now very sensitive, and I’m worried I might get permanent chemical burn scars, especially around my groin which would mess up everything down there. 

Should I continue with this treatment or should I stop? Should I go to a walk-in clinic again or wait until my dermatologist appointment in late May?"

I have currently finished the college admission process and have been left with the following choices. 

\*Note: Cost is not a factor for me, California Resident

UW (CS-DA)

Georgia Tech(CS)

UIUC (CS- college of engineering)

Obviously, due to the Corona, all the admitted day events have been canceled, therefore I'm coming to you guys to feel the vibe of the CS department here. 

Here are some of my questions:

How cutthroat are the classes? (competitive or collaborative) graded on a curve? Grade deflation/inflation?

I have heard that Seattle-based companies such as Amazon, Microsoft have close connections with the school of cse. How true is this? Are internships opportunities readily available? How are the career planning resources/ career fairs? 

Additionally, how wide is the research scene? Is it more undergrad/postgrad focused and how easy is it to get involved (competitive or not)?

How hard is it to get the classes u want. I know that in some UC's due to a large student body, it occasionally takes more than 4 years to graduate due to the limited number of classes, Is this the case with UW (especially the cs major required classes)?

How is the overall social scene on campus? Dining Halls? Things to do on campus and in the area?

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, if you have had experience with or friends go to any of the other schools on my list, how would u compare the UW CS department to them? In terms of the stuff I mentioned in my other questions

I know I asked a lot, but any info would really be helpful in choosing my future for the next 4 years.

Thanks again guys,

I graduated with a MSCS from a mediocre California State University at end of 2018. I've submitted hundreds of applications from private and state sectors jobs, but I have not received a single offer.

During my studies, I applied for internships, but never got an opportunity. I spent my last year as a TA grad student.

I've had so many different interests in cloud computing, cryptography, GPGPU computing, AI/ML, deep learning.

I've read cracking the coding/Elements of Programming Interviews/ scoured reddit and youtube for all the information I could find (TechLead, Joma, etc...)

Reviewed month from MIT 6.006 Algorithms course on youtube. I've practice implementing heaps, BST, BFS, DFS, 2-pointer Sliding window, 1 pass hash, tries...

I made it to Amazon on-site in Seattle last month, but did not receive an offer.

I've had many odd ended jobs before, but lack work experience in the software industry and I think that is what is preventing me from getting an offer.

There's a fine balance between putting your best foot forward and lying, and I hate lying. On on-sites I feel like instead of being strategic, reserved, and cunning, I usually end up being straightforward and honest, and I pour my heart out.

I want to provide real value with people on the same mission, but at the same time I need to get my foot in the door. As long as I can feed myself, I could care less about salary. What is most important to me is the product I am working on and what value I can provide.

My ideal role is in SWE or ML/Deep Learning.

Now the opportunities are even less. I've never reached out to the community, so I am giving this a try.

Any advice or criticism is greatly appreciated, Thank you."

I don't want to come off as thinking I'm extra special or undergoing extreme hardship, especially in the context of the spread of COVID-19. 

Okay. I'm just about to finish with my Masters in the Earth Sciences, where my work implements deep learning using attention-based LSTMs for multi-step time series prediction. I feel very comfortable with a variety of deep learning methods, as well as a number of data science applications for geospatial data. One of my committee members was the former head of AI research at a large auto manufacturing company (name omitted for privacy), and he/she describes me as someone who is capable of developing original data science products with variety of soft skills needed in the field, despite my lack of a formal background in computer science or statistics. Furthermore my work is about to be published in a leading journal in my field.

I've applied to a number of jobs for Data Science/Machine Learning/Analyst fields, with an emphasis on positions still in the natural sciences, if applicable. I've been rejected without interviews from numerous entry level positions where they seek Bachelors degrees in some quantitative field as a minimum requirement. Part of me is beginning to feel concerned I'm in a bit of a 'no man's land', where I don't have a formal degree in CS or Math, which seems to exclude me from Data Science/ML positions (despite my work and references to back up my skillset), and my Masters degree seems to preclude me from more advanced, PhD-required positions in the Earth Sciences. The furthest I've been able to get in any process is for a part time summer internship that's also open to recent high school graduates.

I'm really beginning to feel discouraged here. I've worked my tail off in graduate school and the work I'm doing is the first to be published in my field... my advisor is completely stoked I've been able to make such progress in the 18 months of my program. I don't say this to brag (I actually feel pretty poorly about my skills), but I feel like there's such a disconnect with the feedback I'm getting in grad school vs. the complete apathy from others in my job search. 

I really don't know what to do. I feel like the very real data science and ML work I've been doing is completely disregarded because it's in the Earth Sciences, despite it's broad appeal to NLP or other time series analysis, in addition to my general quant/coding skills and soft skills needed to produce original research. 

Any feedback is extremely appreciated. I'm really losing steam here. Thank you all so much."

* Small team that consists of 1 BA, 1 Part time programmer and 1 senior manager
* Both programmers are old and not well versed in new technology
* I will be responsible for learning all I could from the senior manager and eventually take over his role after 3 - 5 years when he retires and the new systems will fall onto my shoulders.
* They also would like in a couple years to build an in house IT team(They said I will help them hire the team) and get rid of all contractors, as of now they have no plan to bring in another person.
* Potential for growth is huge but also risky(Maybe a little sketchy too?).

**Government offer, System Analyst:**

* Maintaining an old system with outdated technology, with no opportunity for development, just adding new functionalities to old system, so no opportunity to learn and apply new technology.
* Did a couple internship with them, so I am familiar with the code base and I know the team  well and have a good relationship with all of them.

General Advice

* Put work into your essays
* Break out of the junior year workaholic attitude because it's not healthy and not necessary
* Take classes you're legit interested in, I didn't in junior year and it wasnt a good time
* The process extends far from just hitting the submit button. You still got interviews, scholarships, the waiting game...
* Sign up for interviews!!!! My boyfriend forgot to do this...but hey he still got in everywhere I did with interviews so it's whatever if you dont
* Don't be toxic and flex at school
* You might think this year is going to be hard, if you're a junior, but it'll be even harder than that. That being said, it does end, and you will survive, and everything's going to be okay. 
* Get LOTS of people to read your essays but know that their comments can be conflicting and it's okay to not take all of them. I had someone hate on my UC essays, didn't change anything because the advice was bad, I turned out fine. 
* Your parents and friends and everyone are gonna get really annoying asking about college ALL THE TIME, what I did was set out a day (you can do times too) where I tolerated it. So like if someone asked me about college on any day other than Wednesday I just wouldn't respond. Maybe it's rude but you gotta do what you gotta do after a certain point.
* Idk if this is true for other people but I felt like my friend group kinda divided after app season, like people who were in ED were in a different world from those of us still waiting. Just be prepared for that and if you wanna avoid it take steps to communicate with them. 
* Decision days are hard as fuck, don't plan on anything the whole day because acceptance or rejection you're going to feel emotionally destroyed. 
* In the end, the places you get in are probably where you belong. I realized this after not getting into my original top choices (ED heavy privates) and realizing I'm a better fit with the technical schools and publics that I was accepted to, community and education wise. 
* Colleges don't care about you until they admit you. You go from peasant to OMG WE LOVE YOU COME TO US in like two minutes. 
* People around you can be toxic but you dont have to buy into it. 
* GOOD LUCK!!!!!"

I will be graduating in April with a vocational diploma and I've received two offers. Both have similar compensation now, but one working for the government and the other is for the private sector.

**Private sector offer, Full Stack Developer:**

* Maintaining an old system with outdated technology but contracted overseas to rewrite their application with newer technology
* Small team that consists of 1 BA, 1 Part time programmer and 1 senior manager
* Both programmers are old and not well versed in new technology
* I will be responsible for learning all I could from the senior manager and eventually take over his role after 3 - 5 years when he retires and the new systems will fall onto my shoulders.
* They also would like in a couple years to build an in house IT team(They said I will help them hire the team) and get rid of all contractors, as of now they have no plan to bring in another person.
* Potential for growth is huge but also risky(Maybe a little sketchy too?).

**Government offer, System Analyst:**

* Maintaining an old system with outdated technology, with no opportunity for development, just adding new functionalities to old system, so no opportunity to learn and apply new technology.
* Did a couple internship with them, so I am familiar with the code base and I know the team well and have a good relationship with all of them.
* Worklife balance will be great and the pension plan is also great.
* Could potentially earn up to 100k in 7 - 10 years as I move up in classification.
* Relatively stress free.

Any advice will be great. I can add more info if needed.

Hi everyone! Here is some context to who I am and my ideas on the two schools. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong and I'm really interested in hearing your opinions as a student of UMich!!

I'm from California's Bay Area and I want to pursue computer engineering in college. I am fortunate to where cost is not a concern and I know UMich is more expensive. I really want to get involved with student organizations during the year and work either research or internship positions during the summer. After college, I want to 100% work in the Bay Area/California and possibly pursue an MBA or eMBA. I don't know too much about these two colleges, so if you can correct me or give me advice that's much appreciated!

**UCSD:**

Got in for first-choice major: ECE-Computer Engineering

Pros:

* Attended a residential STEM summer program before so somewhat familiar
* Within California (I'm from the Bay Area)
* Strong engineering program and I got into a capped major
* Got into 6th college which is going to have brand new dorms
* Great for working in California/Bay-Area post-grad (from what I understand)
* Engineering is known to be practical in application
* Warm Weather

Cons:

* Known for being socially dead (I want to be active in orgs and communities)
* Weird college/GE system that I still don't understand
* Not as prestigious which might impact MBA application

**University of Michigan:**

Got into their Engineering college with interests in: Computer engineering, EE, CS

Pros:

* Prestigious program (ranked T10 for engineering &amp; computer engineering)
* Great college town and enthusiastic social life
* From what I understand, stronger student orgs than UCSD (which I want to help lead and be apart of)
* More of a complete college experience
* New environment for someone who has lived in the same place and will likely return
* If I want to get an MBA after, Ross is a great school
* The prestige of university could help with MBA application (to California schools like Berkeley HAAS)

Cons:

* Cold weather (I like to wear shorts)
* Might not be a direct program for working in California
* I heard they don't cap certain majors like CS in order to promote diversity, creating crazy waitlist for courses
* Recruiting for summer internships and post-grad jobs likely will be from companies in that area of America (AKA not California)
* Lots of in-state kids that may have a different perspective than me
* Different culture (more white) than I'm used to which isn't bad (I'm an Asian male that hangs with Asian males lol)

Again please comment if you have any advice or ideas. I'm sorry if I'm wrong about UMich I actually have never visited and it doesn't look like I can anytime soon with the whole Covid-19 situation :("

I’m planning on going into cybersecurity after graduation so because Rutgers doesn’t have that, I am doing a computer science major at Rutgers or if I go to Drexel, the cybersecurity major (CST). 

Drexel Pros:
- has a specialized program for what I’m looking for 
- co ops (3)
- bachelors &amp; masters earned in the 5yr program
- in philly/whole city to explore 

Drexel Cons:
- expensive &amp; wud have to take out loans (18k/year scholarship)
- brand new city &amp; completely unfamiliar 
- 1 hr from home 
- need to make completely new friends
- smaller school

Rutgers Pros:
- very close to home 
- will have a bunch of familiar faces  
- cheap (in state)
- huge state school 

Rutgers Cons:
- no cybersecurity major so would be learning only hardcore CS 
- no coops and internships would be harder to seek out 
- would need to extra certifications/ courses to learn what I need for the jobs I want 

Please give your input &amp; advice based on this and help me decide!!! Thanks guys"
frhwhy,10,2020-03-29,I feel like my social life and overall community engagement is better in self isolation,baljeet101,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/frhwhy/i_feel_like_my_social_life_and_overall_community/,"
I saw a post earlier about someone’s parents who never let them pursue any hobbies. I related with that so hard! I was never allowed to go outside to engage in sports (except in my backyard). My parents never really invested in art, music or any type of lessons as they thought it was useless. I never got to hang out with my friends (unless they were from our own Asian community). The only time I got to go outside was school or monitored by my parents (even then it was only grocery shopping trips and such)! 

This obviously made socializing super difficult and my friends wouldn’t accept my excuse that my parents were just super authoritative. 

This is now big issue in high school, especially since I moved to America. In American high schools they really emphasize community involvement and this is super difficult if you’re not allowed to leave your house. 


But now with the pandemic shutting everything down and things moving towards online platforms, I can finally engage in community activities. This week alone I received offers from a mayoral campaign, a political organization and a non profit to pursue remote internships! Instead of canvassing, I could just email and phone bank now. Instead of meetings in person, we can do online chats. My friends are no longer  mad at me for not being able to hang out with outside of school! I can just FaceTime and text them and it’s perfectly fine. 

I thought the pandemic would be the worst thing that happened to me as I assumed I’d be more isolated than ever. But I was wrong. It has given me a valid and believable excuse for me to be housebound all day. I have gained more opportunities than I ever could have  otherwise. 

COVID-19 has had devastating effects on our society so I feel absolutely horrible to say I have benefited from it :(("

Here is the fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

I'm an international student and have been accepted into the MS CS programs WITHOUT any financial aids. I've done my research on the universities and have arrived at the following broad conclusions:

1. Both are Top 20 programs in AI/ML (which is my preferred concentration) (CSRankings says: UMass 11, NYU 20)
2. NYU is about 1.5 times costlier than UMass (Tuitions + Living On Campus)

I will be taking a student loan for attending either of them but for NYU I will have to stretch a bit. So wanted to get an idea if the NYC experience would be worth the extra loan I will have to take.

Bottom line, would be great if you guys could help me see some subtle points that I might be missing in favour/against both of these awesome UNIs.

TAships, Internship Opportunities, Job Opportunities hold a higher priority for me than other stuff.

I cannot fight this problem on my own. It's long but i will be thankful if someone reads it.  
My problem is unique. I am not a classical lazy person- i have excellent results in university(computer engineering) + i do strength training almost everyday and i have been on internships and always got great feedback from employers. I am not antisocial and have solid number of friends.  
BUT, when there is nothing  forcing me i can spend 24h doing nothing and contacting no one. Since this outbreak i just sit home and do nothing. I waste whole days. I hear other people watch movies, play videogames, read books but i cannot do even that.   
This behavior did not start with corona outbreak. I am always like that i will just do what i must and then do nothing. Even playing game or watching movie or party with friends it always feels like 'let's just get this over with and return to sleep or do nothing'   
i don't have a hobby. my hobby is sleeping, watching porn movies and doing nothing. I always postpone all my duties until final moment, then i start working hard and somehow i always manage to get great results. Weight training is only thing i do regularly and don't try to evade it.  
I am always late, but if i know i must not be late like exam or work day, i am never late and even come earlier. But if it is meeting with friends or normal day at university i am always late. I tell myself i won't be late and leave in time but like magic i still don't leave in time it's impossible to explain.  
At night i always promise myself - tomorrow you will read a book, watch movie, work on your skills...  
But the next day some force just won't let me do anything. It's a feeling like i am sleepy. i always feel sleepy no matter how much i sleep.  I cannot do anything productive. Everything feels very boring and pointless. I have friends who are similar to me but the difference is they are also poor in school have no job no money and usually do drugs or alcohol. I don't do any of that.  
Somedays i am forced by turn of events to have full productive and social day and i feel very happy in the night, i promise myself i will make more of my days like that but then next morning again same story. i feel like doing nothing.  


Is this some mental problem and should i seek help? i feel powerless."

**Stats:**

GPA: 3.9 UW, HS did not weigh, (had 4 Bs in total)

No Rank, but in the top 15%.

Rigor: Pretty rigorous load for my school, 8 APs (2 soph, 3 Junior, 3 Senior), but there were others with more APs than me. Mostly 5s and 4s, one 3.

SAT: 1550, 720 in Chem (only 1 SAT Subject)

**Extracurriculars:**

* Student Government (ASB)
* Young Legislators Program for 41st District
* City Council Campaign Intern
* LA Superior Court Intern
* Student Board Member on District Board of Education
* California Boys State (Gov. Cabinet position)
* Varsity Volleyball
* Other school clubs, (Challenge Success, CASC, clubs)  but these are the main ones I talked about and listed

**Awards**:

* National Merit Commended Scholar
* Scholastic Arts and Writing Gold Key Award
* 2019 QuestBridge NCM Finalist
* Congressional awards from Boys State

**Essays:**

Since I applied through the QuestBridge Program, my main essay was basically a mini biography about my early life as an immigrant, and then how I grew from my financial shortcomings to be who I am today (themes of resilience, ambition, perseverance). I wrote really personally about my thought process in life, and how various experiences caused my mindset to grow and change, and ultimately backed it up with specific events from my ECs.

I realized this type of essay is literally identical for everyone in QB, but I think the best advice I can give is really be honest in answering the prompt, instead of trying to write what you think will look the best. Ultimately, I think being genuine and honest will allow you to write the most compelling and appealing aspects about yourself.

There are so many things I talked about for diff. supplements, but I think the most important thing I attempted to portray was passion. I didn't talk about my ECs, but about the small things that LED me to pursue those ECs, and why I did those things. Additionally, the next important thing to include in supplements were the values and virtues of the school.

**LOR:**

I honestly didn't think they were going to be the most stellar, but given the results, I am so so thankful to them and glad I asked them. I asked my Chem teacher (who I had 9th and 10th grade, and was my ASB Advisor for 10th grade) and my 11th grade English teacher.

**Quick, final thoughts:**

I myself was **super** surprised with my results. Although I always considered ambition a trademark virtue for myself, there was always some doubt, especially when the rejections rolled in. I realized that the amount of work I put in was the best that I could do given my resources and capacity, so in the end, I was prepared to accept whatever results I got. Despite my results, I firmly believe that college applications are not *formulaic*, and many, many qualified applicants do not get into the schools they are more than qualified for. As you could see, although I got into my top schools, I also got rejected from many, many of them. In my opinion, it honestly comes down to whether or not the type of person you are and your virtues matches the school you applied to. No matter how qualified I was, it was completely possible for me to have gotten rejected to every school, because there are so many qualified students. I think the main thing I learned was to stay true to myself, and just learn to portray myself not as the most perfect applicant, but someone who had the most potential and eagerness. Idk if any of this made sense; please don't hesitate to ask any questions :,)"

My eyes are set on UCSD due to the overall prestige, diverse environment, campus area, and graduation time that it has to offer as opposed to my other option- Cal Poly SLO. 

My mother seems to want me to go to SLO as it entails a strong career path as soon as I graduate. However the lack of social connections and being a majority white school as a Hispanic isn’t so appealing. As well as the cost actually being higher than UCSD by $3000, not significant but definitely in consideration. 

So to that, is it possible to get a job soon after graduation and have a few internships under my belt. Thank you very much!"
frod3b,3,2020-03-30,Feeling more and more discouraged to my current job - am I wrong?,janex-PL,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/frod3b/feeling_more_and_more_discouraged_to_my_current/," Currently, my job is the first job related to programming I landed. I had an internship last summer and after that, I started working for the company remotely because I'm studying in the city, where there is no branch of that company.

The internship was great and I've learned a lot and had a great time working there, but today after 6 months of working remotely I fell more and more discouraged to work there. It all began, when slowly I was given task more related to the actual products, that we are offering, rather than task focusing on improving development/testing environment e.g. automating builds, conversion of TFVC repository to Git, updating internal websites, etc.I'm having a hard time trying to understand the source code and the documentation. Source code seems to be not following KISS principle and it's filled with spelling errors and strange names for files and variables. The documentation in Confluence is written poorly and definitely not beginner-friendly, if not unreadable sometimes.

Additionally, the company is slowly moving towards web development, which is great, but they are going to use a JS framework, which is definitely not popular as Angular, React or Vue and the reason why is that it has lots of components to use. For me, it feels definitely not beginner-friendly and it's much harder to find information or additional tutorials, compared to the frameworks mentioned above.

On the one hand, I know that it is my first job and I should just focus on trying to get as much knowledge and experience as I can, even if it's not going to be that easy. On the other hand, I just rather want to continue learning (bought a yearly subscription of Pluralsight) and focus on my personal projects, because they are a lot more interesting than the tasks at my job.

I'm thinking of finding a job at a different company and I've already sent out resumes, but deep down I have a feeling, that I'm being ungrateful and I don't know if it's justified. Also, I'm worried that I won't get any offers because almost a year of work experience feels like it's not enough for a junior developer, .NET to be precise.

I'm trying to find employment for when I finish university in a few months but I've been turned down from multiple graduate positions where they've all started the uncertainty surrounding the virus outbreak. I completely understand their reasoning but I'm also worried about my future because if this. And also the immediate future of not having a job when I finish and so not being able to pay rent etc.

I have studied a 4 year computer science course (including a 1 year internship) with a focus on business IT.

Can anyone please help with some guidance or ideas that they think might work? 

Thank you for reading this!"

frqo0o,5,2020-03-30,I am really struggling.,reinai2,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/frqo0o/i_am_really_struggling/,"I got into three schools and am deciding between them: Georgetown, BU Honors, and UC Berkeley. I am so lucky and grateful to have gotten into these three schools, especially as an international kid. But now, I don't know where to go. I think I need to write this more to get it all out of my head so if you want to indulge me, any opinions would be very welcome. I go to a very competitive international school in Asia. It is constantly ingrained in my head that if I am not getting A's, I am failing. For my American parents, the Asian mindset that I have is one that treads into the uncharted ground. At the beginning of the senior year, I knew I wanted to apply to these three schools, but only thought, realistically, that I'd have a chance at BU. My school has a very good relationship with BU as a lot of the kids accepted actually attend.

Out of the three, my heart fell in love with Georgetown. It felt forbidden because it was always branded as a reach school. I loved the international mindset is seems to foster and how prestigious it was, among other things of course. But because I'm not at the top of my class, and I didn't have the scores or grades that my classmates had, I never thought I stood a chance. I got deferred EA and my spirits were crushed. I poured my heart and soul into a continued interest letter that was vulnerable and emotional and prayed that they'd take a chance on someone who could not compare to her classmates. I want to study Chinese and Statistics, most likely in a double major. Berkeley and Georgetown's Chinese programs both have international reputations, Georgetown's especially. They have brilliant Chinese professors who, when I reached out to them during the time of the HK protests, understood and expressed interest and care for the situation that my country was in. Berkeley's professors, too, responded to my questions with enthusiasm. This definitely piqued my interest in both of these school's programs.

To finish off talking about Georgetown, I want to try and work through a few more things. Georgetown seems to be very humanities-focused, which was never what I was good at during school, but don't mind. I love psychology and would find pleasure in exploring it more. Their general education requirements can be filled through my specific Chinese program which is helpful, there seems to be a lot of flexibility there. However, they do not have a specific statistics major, only a major in mathematics and statistics, which means that I have to take a lot of Calculus. It's not my favorite subject, but that also could be because I had a very sexist and degrading teacher for AP Calculus. I'm worried about the culture at Georgetown and about making friends. As I mentioned before, it's really international which I find comfort in. But, I want to still have the college experience where I can go to parties and have a really big sports culture and lots of school spirit. I think, in general, I'm really nervous about moving to America. Though I hold an American passport, I've never lived there and consider myself to be from Hong Kong. I'm struggling. I think I cry every single day about moving there, but in order to have the freedom to explore academic subjects, I need to go to America to study. Georgetown has programs in Hong Kong, which is where I want to spend my year abroad, but they aren't with HKU, which is where I want to be. Despite that though, it is Georgetown. It is the school that I thought would never accept me because I never thought I was good enough.

Onto Berkeley, it is also an amazing school. I love the impression I get of the culture there. Besides everyone seeming to be dependent on drugs, I love the school spirit, sports culture, and how much everyone loves to be there. Academically, the size of the school seems to offer me a lot of academic opportunities. They do have a statistics major and their Chinese program is really solid as well. However, Berkeley seems to have more of a STEM emphasis, which yes, is fantastic for me wanting to study Statistics, but it is difficult because Chinese is the program that is MUCH more important to me. This paragraph is shorter than the Georgetown one but only because I need to go get more ice for my knees soon and want to finish this up while I'm still in my pensive mood. It is not that I like Berkeley less, I mean, why would I be writing this if I liked one more than the other.

Finally, BU honors. I rushed my application to Kilachand very much but still ended up getting accepted. I was elated. The honors program has a small community that would get me a lot of contact with my professors. The honors program curriculum is also flexible around what I want to study and seems to be offering me essentially what Georgetown is offering. By this, I mean that the honors program places an emphasis on having an understanding of global events while letting me study Chinese and Statistics. They also do have a statistics major. However, Kilachand students live with each other and don't live with BU students not in the honor program; I don't know how I feel about that because I want to get to know everyone. I've heard good and bad things about BU's culture. I've heard that there isn't a lot of school spirit, except for hockey, that the party scene is dying because the school is making frats close down, and that people only care about their academics. I've grown up in an environment where people only care about academics so that one doesn't phase me as much. Additionally, I worry about not being able to get internships or opportunities because I would be competing with Harvard and MIT students. I'm not sure the reality of that situation but I had that thought.

This isn't everything on my mind but it is most of it. The cost of these schools is all insanely high because I'm international so I can't really factor it in. I'm not a resident of the US so I'm not in-state anywhere. One last thing to consider is each city's respective MLB team. Out of the Giants, Nats, and Red Socks, I like the Nats the best, but they will NEVER live up to the Cubs, don't @ me. If you've read all of this, truly, thank you. I've been really stressing about the move and having to deal with my identity crisis so it's immensely helpful to get a lot of it down and for someone to read it. If you have extra time and would be up to giving me some advice or your opinion, please please do. I would really appreciate it. I guess that's all, thank you for reading &lt;3"
frsgh4,10,2020-03-30,Negotiating higher pay,stephanr21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/frsgh4/negotiating_higher_pay/,"
I have been working at my current company for over a year now. When I started I was still in school, working limited hours. It was my first gig so I was just considered an intern and getting paid as one. 

Now over a year later I’m doing sprint work/making updates to our reusable component library/ working as the point man for fixing defects during business validation, but they are still paying me as an intern. And now they want me to start making updates to their node services. I feel that they are not compensating me enough for my skills. 

I have already contacted my contracting company, saying that I am exploring other options. They replied that my manger is evaluating my performance for pay increase. I was supposed to hear back from them in a week about the final word whether I qualify for the increase, but never did.

Yesterday I started working remote with a startup company making MORE than my current job.

For you guys that have been in this industry longer than me how can I leverage a higher pay

TLDR: I have been working at my company as an intern for over a year, and want higher pay as my skills have increased/doing more work. I now have a second job with a startup making more money. How can I negotiate a higher pay?"

Hi   everyone, I am a sophomore student majoring in computer engineering. I   have done an internship in Hong Kong in a smaller company as a web dev   intern, but I don't have much experience. I don't have any side   projects, yet. I know python and C++, but I'm not really good... I have a CCNA certificate that I obtained last summer. I am currently grinding some leetcode questions as I am taking data structure and algorithms  this semester.

Is there a way to   get a paid summer internship in Japan? I think I will need a visa, but   I'm not sure whether I should apply for the working holiday one or  not.  It would be nice if it is a Japanese branch of a multinational  company  or a well-known company. But I will settle for anything similar  if  that's not possible. I guess applications for 2020 are closed (and  might  be cancelled because of the Wuhan virus) But what can I do in  order to  prepare?

I am fluent in  English,  Cantonese and Mandarin. I have an N1 certificate but I might  need to  brush up my Japanese. My Japanese isn't good.

I would greatly appreciate if you guys could give me some advice.

Thanks in advance."

***Essays and LORs***

Rec 1: APUSH Teacher. We were pretty close and he was very fond of me. Unfortunately, he passed away really suddenly which shook me and the whole school but I was able to read it before he did, and it was glowing, 9.5/10.

Rec 2: AP Gov Teacher. Serves as advisor for Dems club and he cited me as one of two best students in his class during Parent-Teacher, so I'd guess it was pretty darn good, 9/10.

Essays: Duke was the only school where I submitted an out-of-the-box Common App, and it worked. Wrote about a box of transit maps I have in my room, making a (well-written, I must say) analogy to an art gallery, and what my transportation obsession has taught me. For other non-QB schools, wrote about an experience facepainting during a campaign event and what it taught me about public service. My QB essay was trash, periodt.

***Reflections***

I've been a fairly strong student all of my life, always lacking in STEM but making up for it in humanities subjects. By second semester senior year I ended up with several Bs and 1 C on my transcript and I thought I was f\*cked for all of my schools. In junior year I studied my ass off for the SAT to compensate, bringing my score from a 1210 to my 1530 and I poured myself into extracurriculars to show dedication. Yes, I got rejected from my dream school, Yale and from most of my other top options. If I put a little more time into studying physics, or calc, or geometry I could have probably had way better grades. But for all the friends I made and experiences I had, I don't regret it one bit.

I had applied to Duke completely on a whim and submitted just a few hours before the deadline to where I would get an interview. I went into my interview knowing jack about the school, only scrambling and searching up some programs using the three-click rule on the train ride on the way there. But everything seemed to fall into place, my interview was probably one of the best I had (I had amazing Pomona and Harvard interviews as well). I didn't think much of the school after I finished my interview, and if anything I thought I might have a shot of getting into Cornell or Dartmouth, Duke wasn't even on my mind.

But who knows what goes on behind those sacred doors in those admissions offices. I'm the only person to get into Duke out of the likely 70 applicants from my school this year and for many years Duke took **nobody** from our school, and the last time a person went was four years ago. Doing research over the past few days, I've found that Duke was such a perfect fit for me with its amazing intellectual curiosity and school culture and opportunities, and maybe somehow the admissions committee overlooked my academic fall-shorts and missteps because they knew that it was.

I feel so privileged and blessed to be able to attend such an amazing institution and I know I'm going to have an amazing four years. Don't be afraid to apply to all of the schools of your dreams, because you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. If anyone has any questions, please PM me, I'd be happy to answer."

When I started college in 2015 I was a Computer Science major, but decided to switch my major to Business &amp; move back home to a local college out of fear. I didnt like Business at all, but my parents pressured me to stay in school and I didnt want to disappoint them so I ended up graduating in Dec 2018 with a Business Bachelor's. The next few months of finding a job were tough, and I was getting really depressed about my future. I ended up wanting to go back to school last Fall for another Bachelor in Computer Science, thinking that I felt more confident and mature than in 2015. Now, I'm 23 and am almost failing my Computer Science classes and just dont enjoy learning programming like I thought I would. I am also in an IT internship right now, so if I drop out I would likely have to stop that.

Now I am thinking about stopping school again and get a full time entry job in the tech field as a try. My problem is that my parents were nice enough to pay for my first degree &amp; are even helping pay for this 2nd one, and I just hate the idea of telling them all that money was for nothing. I'm just feeling depressed about my future and not sure how I should proceed. (Note: While I am depressed, I dont feel suicidal. I am excited and look forward to the future, I'm just not sure now how to make a living &amp; be happy)."

I am currently a Sophomore who interned at an event/data company last Summer as a web developer. This Summer I was invited back to join them as a software development intern, however just a few minutes ago I got a call saying that, due to all of their events being cancelled for the foreseeable future, they are not taking on any new hires, and are therefore rescinding my offer. I now have nothing lined up for the Summer and I am looking at any available options. Any advice on how I should move forward?"
frvo2p,111,2020-03-30,How deploys work at Slack (written by someone who was confused as hell by deploys as an intern),michaeldeng18,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/frvo2p/how_deploys_work_at_slack_written_by_someone_who/,"Link: https://slack.engineering/deploys-at-slack-cd0d28c61701

Sorry if this is somewhat off-topic, but I'm hoping this helps people who have some of the same questions I had when I was an intern. Back then, I worked on user-facing products at two big cos, but I was always very curious about the ops side, specifically how we shipped code (not just the commands but what actually happens behind the scenes). But most people I talked to didn't fully understand it and the people with historical context had left. So in the end, I was still pretty confused about why deploys were the way they were.

3 years ago, I joined Slack out of college. Slack was pretty small back then and had a simple deploy system. Since then, I saw it evolve firsthand. I filled in the gaps in my knowledge by interviewing senior engineers and going through old Slack conversations and commits.

A few months ago, I finally felt confident enough to share it out my learnings. With the help of a great co-author, I wrote this post on how Slack evolved from a barebones deploy system when we first started to what we have now.

Anyways, hope you learn something from this post, and happy to answer any questions about our deploys or Slack in general."

I was wondering how valuable this experience still is since most companies nowadays make web applications. My goal is to land an internship at a big tech company such as Google or Microsoft in 2021 and I was wondering how much my experience at this company will help me with that.

Although my upcoming internship isn't web based, I still have experience in web applications through side projects."
frvx7w,0,2020-03-30,UCLA vs Berkeley vs NYU,ydjasc,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/frvx7w/ucla_vs_berkeley_vs_nyu/,"so i recently got admitted to ucla and berkeley and was having the most STRESSFUL time trying to pick between them. i got in chemical engineering for both ucla and berkeley. then BAM today i get accepted into nyu stern (business)🥺 i live in cali btw. please help me choose ;(

UCLA pros:
- closer to home
- food is TOP class
- better social life
- beautiful campus
- guaranteed housing for 3 years (i think?)
- feel like im gonna have a great time at ucla after watching a bunch of youtube videos

UCLA cons:
- lacks in chemE than berkeley
- hard to enroll in your needed classes
- quarter system


UC Berkeley pros:
- #2 chemE program in the nation
- chemE in is college of chemistry so greater focus on chem
- lots of internships and research opportunities (silicon valley)
- semester system

UC Berkeley cons:
- friend told me that chemE is the hardest major at berkeley
- classes are HELLA hard
- grade deflation
- far from home
- lots of homeless people
- crime rate is high in surrounding areas
- HOUSING crisis (only guaranteed one year of housing and finding good housing around the area is hard)


NYU pros:
- in NYC (i love nyu bc i was born in nj and lots of family members live in ny so i visit ny basically every summer. NEVER get sick of going to nyc)
- grandparents and aunt live like 45-min away by subway from nyu 
- got into stern which is the business school and i think business fits me better (for now)

NYU cons:
- HELLA expensive omg like oos cost was 80k but i got a stern scholarship so it went down to 65k but thats still SO expensive and thats only for the first year. so rest of the three years are basically 80k which is ABSURB. (ucla instate costs 35k and berkeley costs 37k)
- i dont have on-campus housing?? like in my financial aid it says only off-campus housing (can someone else check theirs?)
- if i do commute from my grandparent’s house, ill be taking 45 min by subway every day to get to nyu
- quarter system
- visited last summer and didnt really like how there was no campus

right now, i dont really know if i want to do chemE. i just put chemE because i liked chem and did well in chem. so im thinking more on business rn but not 100% sure. i kinda want to try chemE but im scared that if i dont like it or it’s too hard, im gonna be stuck. berkeley has HAAS (business school) and i know pre-haas students don’t have a guarantee spot in the haas program because they need a certain gpa and then APPLY into the program. does anyone know if i can switch my major from chemE to pre-haas for berkeley right when i get to berkeley? and ucla doesnt have their own business school which is a con if i end up choosing business. 

SORRY for all the info but please help!!"

frw6yj,3,2020-03-30,Beautiful inside,Linardice,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/frw6yj/beautiful_inside/,"Raindrops bounced off the plastic rafters and tables outside, forming an orchestra of micro-percussions under the cyan glow of the large neon sign. All that noise, however, barely made a dent over the rambunctious dissonance of alcohol-fueled men and women packing the dimly lit pub that night. My group of friends, along with lots of other people from our graduating batch, crowded those familiar dingy tables and filled the narrow spaces in between, leaving barely any room to walk. The sea of noises emanating from the drunk patrons undulated along with the rhythms of 90’s classic rock blaring through the speakers. After our convocation earlier that day, we were qualified engineers. Though we still had an entire year of internship ahead of us, we were all quite stoked to have finished this part of our journey.

I whipped my head back as laughter erupted all around the table, momentarily overcoming the loud music, even earning our group a couple of glares from people around. “I’ll be right back,” I told my friends as I made my way out of the middle of the booth, trying not to trip or crush the numerous feet in the way. I took a drag out of the lit cigarette carefully held in my hand as I similarly made my way down the length of the pub, making sure to not trip over the forest of legs and footwear filling the path.

Whistling, I emptied all the processed beer into the relatively clean urinal in the men’s bathroom. Washing my hands, I made my way back to the table where my friends were still chatting loudly, trying to converse over the music reverberating through the bar.

“Oomph!” I heard a soft cry as I bumped hard into someone short. A rather petite girl, about 5’ 2 was down on the floor adjusting her thick-rimmed glasses. “I’m so sorry,” I said as I held my hand out to help her. She reached out with her thin arms and held my hand as she pulled herself back up. Once back on her feet, I could see her face a little more clearly. A little jutting chin, a small nose on which a heavy pair of black-rimmed and solid glasses sat with large doe eyes behind them. Her shoulder-length black hair forming a curtain around her head. Her large brown eyes darted left and right behind her glasses. I could sense she was confused, maybe even embarrassed to be there. “Wait, I know you,” I started as she focused her gaze on me, “You were in professor Malhotra’s Computer science class right?” I asked, drinking in her fine appearance in short top and skirt, a far cry from the attire I usually remembered seeing her in. “Ummm…” she replied, clearly fumbling under the sudden attention from someone, who, from her perspective, had just drunkenly knocked her down to the floor. “Hi, I’m Shuchi.” I reached out with my hand, introducing myself. She gingerly shook it and said, “I’m Mina.”

“Sorry for bumping into you like that.” I said with a slightly embarrassed grin. When I looked at her, she averted her gaze again. “Are you hurt anywhere?” I started as she cut in, “No, No, It isn’t your fault at all, I’m not really used to going to a place like this but Archana insisted so much that I try it out… Have you seen her, by any chance…?” She rambled. “Archana? I think she left already.” I neglected to mention that she had left with my friend Dinesh, both clearly drunk and all over each other. “OH.” she replied, looking slightly crestfallen at that point, “She was supposed to be my ride back home though, now what am I going to do…” she muttered, looking at the rain outside the large glass window. “I can give you a ride back if you want…” I said, slightly amused and slightly concerned about this lost looking girl.

“No I couldn’t possibly”, she replied, looking at me rather suspiciously. “It’s all right, I understand, you know,” I told her, giving her a large smile and proceeding to grab my backpack from our table and saying goodbye to my friends there, “It gets exhausting, being amidst so many strangers, doesn’t it?. It’s ok to feel uncomfortable.” I told her as she still seemed hesitant in following me out. That statement seemed to strike a chord with her as she looked up straight into my eyes and stared for a while before replying with “OK, but only if you are sure you aren’t going to crash into a pole like you just crashed into me.” “Believe me, its fine,” I said, smiling back at her still unsure expression.

The heavy rain outside had slowed down to a light drizzle as we made our way in my car. She was looking out the window for most of the ride, still a bit on edge. Her place being far away, we were driving on the highway, the only sound in the car being that of its humming engine and the noises made by the wipers as they occasionally wiped the raindrops off the windshield. “You can relax now, we are here, see?” I told her as I pulled up to the wrought iron gates of her six storied apartment complex. “Thanks a lot!” She said, a clear look of relief spreading out on her face at the sight of her familiar abode. “Before you go though.” I said, before she stepped out of the car, “If you feel like you want to talk to somebody,” I said, scribbling on a small piece of paper, “Here’s my number.” She tentatively took the paper from my hand, but then smiled and said, “Thanks, be careful on your way back.” After which, she ran up to the main gate of her apartment complex. I watched her enter through the heavy door beside the main gate and once she was inside, started the engine and pulled out. Driving back, I couldn’t help but think about her.

It was nearly two days later, I was back from work and was stir-frying some mushrooms when the phone rang. “Hi Shuchi?” said Mina, her voice like whispered honey, filled with a shaky nervousness at the time. We both got a little more comfortable as we talked. I asked her out to a movie that weekend and she agreed. That Saturday evening, we joined the throngs of families and couples with our own tray of popcorn and had a blast. Once out of her shell, she seemed like a very energetic and chirpy person, I kissed her as I dropped her off that night. She was… beautiful.

It was that very same night that I got that first mail. An innocuous piece of email sitting two rows below some generic spam in my yahoo mail account. There was no subject, the contents being just a line of plain text saying, “Watch this” and a download link to a file named he@\^69n&amp;199087tA\^i42O.onion.

Now I had always been something of a connoisseur of all things weird and obscure, outside the realm of what most would most consider ordinary. Not that I was really superstitious or religious in any way, I guess I was simply fascinated with the lore and the possibilities of it all. I downloaded the surprisingly large file and opened it after running it through my antivirus software, only to find myself staring at perhaps the most familiarly eeriest scene I could’ve imagined. I was staring at my own room, from my own PC’s webcam’s perspective. I could see my twin size mattress in the background, and the pile of books on the ground beside it. I know, I know, a complete sob, but it’s really not as bad as it sounds.

I checked the length of the video, a whole three hours! There was also a watermarked timestamp at the upper left corner of the screen showing the date and time, this was… yesterday! I watched, enraptured, for around ten minutes; which, again, was kind of stupid, as it was basically the still image of my own room, me being out at my temp job at that time. After stupidly staring at that same unmoving picture for a while I started skimming through the video, my heart started to pound in my chest when I finally reached the part where I saw the door to my apartment open at the very edge of the screen, indicating that I had returned. I watched my feet enter the frame, the mattress and the pc being only a small distance above the floor, the me in the video walked onto the messy study table on the other side of the room my feet crossing across the frame. I watched myself return back to the screen with a hot cup-noodles. The hour passed and the video of me going about my daily activities finished leaving me lost for words.

The first thing I did, once I had processed the reality of having an online stalker, was to cover the laptop camera with black electrical tape. I was breathing hard, like I had run a whole mile. I tried to think about what it meant, surely this had to be some sort of a threat, “what else can it be?” I thought. Maybe they had my identity for ransom, I couldn’t imagine them having any real use for that, me being just an average broke college student. Maybe they had some clips of me jerking off… “Fat lot of good that’ll do them”, I thought. I didn’t need to deliberate my next move for long, as I saw a notification on the email page, indicating that I had a new message.

“Finally got around to covering the camera? Smart move.”

I stared at that message for a min, then, with slightly shaky hands, I started typing back…

“What is this? What do you want from me?”

The reply showed up on my browser within half a minute

“I wonder… Tell me, what do you think I want from you?”

Was this a joke of some kind? A prank maybe, from one of my friends, colleagues? Impossible, none of them had ever used my PC as far as I remember.

“I don’t have any money if that’s what you are after.”

I sat there with growing apprehension for a full ten minutes before I got the next reply.

“HAHAHA

LOL

☺

Relax buddy, I know that you don’t have any money.”

Over more back and forth e-mails, he told me he had made a habit of peeping into people’s webcams over the last month, using the IP addresses he got from a certain onion directory which listed out such similar IP and port addresses of computers with exploitable webcams. He told me that he found my private antics quite fascinating and decided to contact me on a whim, more than anything else.

I had to check it out myself, of course I did. I vaguely remembered having read about something like this on some message board I was browsing, didn’t think much about it back then. I logged into the tor client and entered the address attached to the email on to the browser. After about a minute of waiting, the page fully downloaded. It looked like something out of the ’90s, red-colored hyperlinks lay in a table format made of white borders, in front of a black background. The links themselves were a jumble of letters and numbers followed by the HTML extension. Beside each one of them, within brackets, was a blue colored number, most of which were in the double digits with only a few above a hundred. I wiped a drop of sweat off my brow with cold hands, I clicked on one of the links and it opened up another window, with a video player showing the scene of someone’s living room. Even through the low resolution, I could still clearly make out the middle-aged woman sitting with a child over at the dining table, behind the sofa eating lunch. The next link which I clicked on didn’t open anything other than an error message in the video player, the next showed me an office, a young man was lounging on the office chair covering half the frame, behind him were more desks, computers, and people all going about their work, completely unaware of their unseen watchers.

The next day being Sunday, I spent hours on that site, watching people going about their normal everyday life, unaware, that they were being watched; all of this was engrossing and… strangely calming. I didn’t even notice the sun setting outside and enveloping my room in complete darkness before the ringing of my cordless phone finally pulled my attention away from the bright rectangular CRT display. The caller id said Mina, I remembered I had promised to see her that evening and to call her before that. I had been so engrossed in watching those hacked cams with headphones on, that I hadn’t noticed all the times she had called me, there were about a dozen or so voice messages left recorded in the inbuilt answering machine. Granted, I shouldn’t have ignored her, but this seemed a tad bit excessive. On the call, she seemed more concerned than anything else, though I could sense the frustration in her voice.

Despite all the weirdness of the preceding day, we had fun at dinner that night. She seemed to cheer up the moment she saw me, we got pizza and she told me all about her snooty roommates as we ate our hot cheesy pies and drank our sodas. However, once I returned to my dingy studio apartment later that night, I saw another message from the same user, dragging me back to my present reality, one of having a stalker and perhaps… being one myself?

“Enjoyed yourself, did ya?” said the simple line on my monitor, the cursor blinking just below the line, urging me to engage further with this strangeness.

“It’s illegal though, isn’t it? How do you know I won’t just go to the police?” I replied

“You could, but they wouldn’t care about something like this, believe me.

But that’s enough about me, let’s talk about you buddy. Did or did you not have fun?” the anonymous username asked.

I had to pause before I answered; you see, for me, honesty had always been problematic. Not that I was a compulsive liar or anything, quite the opposite in fact. People had called me blunt and insensitive before and I suppose there was some truth to that. I just didn’t want to waste my energy complicating my life with lies.

Oh, how foolish I was back then.

“It was… is, certainly quite interesting, as illegal as it is.” I replied back.

“I knew it! I fucking knew it!” came back the unexpectedly excited looking reply.

He told me he knew I would be interested in it since he had been watching me for so long, from one purveyor of weird to another. Thereafter we stayed in infrequent contact via mail, both of us exchanging info about occult and creepy things we would find online. At the same time, my relationship with Mina progressed smoothly, to the point where she used to spend most of her free time hanging around my apartment. Needless to say, I had taken a more serious look at my online security as a result of which a black tape lay over any cameras that I had in my house much to her amusement but I never told her or anybody else about the webcam hack, “the fewer people involved the better” I thought.

It was nearly a month and a half after that, that I first started noticing the fibers. Clumps of white synthetic Acrylic fibers, the kind that’s shiny and makes a crunching noise when squeezed together. In the beginning, I found them around my bed, thinking that they must have leaked from inside the mattress, I didn’t pay much attention to it then. As days went by, I started finding them in more and more places and soon they were mixed into everything that I had; my books, my bag, my clothes, even my hair. Things really came to a head when one day, while cooking up some lunch, I found a giant clump of that fake wool in the packet of rice, the minuscule white threads finely and evenly distributed in the off-white grain. When I asked Mina if she had any idea where all this could be coming from, she said that she didn’t, seemingly bemused at the strangeness of it all. “Maybe there’s a spirit haunting you?” she said, looking at the heap of fiber that I had collected from all around my room that day with a very uncomfortable smile upon her face.

Weeks of this took a serious toll on me, I tried everything, sealed every entrance to my room, started wrapping everything in plastic, even went so far as to buy a whole air filter and when all of that failed, I tried to videotape my room in my absence in order to figure out exactly what the hell was going on. However, almost with a comical disregard for my excitement and apprehension, the tape showed nothing at all; other than Mina dropping by once to grab some of the books that she had left in my room, my place being closer to both of our workplaces. The fibers themselves were usually too imperceptible to show up on my friend’s cheap Handycam, so at the end of all that I had nothing to show for all that effort but a daily increasing heap of white fibers. I stayed over at one of my friend’s place for a while, I had to get away from all that… all that madness! It was there, while I was checking my mail on my Ashok’s pc, that I received an exceedingly deranged reply from my online contact, with whom I had last been in contact with nearly a month back when I had sent him a long email about my current weird situation only to receive nothing but silence in reply. I didn’t fault him for that, as such, we only corresponded infrequently, him always behind the veneer of complete anonymity. Now though, the black dots on the screen made out the following perplexing line of text,

“Why don’t you drop the fucking act already?!”

“Huh?!” the near-incomprehensible reply to my month-old message had me stumped. I started typing in my reply, “What the hell are you…” ‘Hang on’ I thought to myself, my brain starting to connect some of the dots, ‘does this mean…?’ I deleted what I had typed before

“What do you know about this?” I asked him. I got his reply within the hour, I hadn’t moved an inch the whole time.

“Stop fucking with me already, I know it’s all you. You are good at pretending, I’ll give you that but you ain’t fooling me, you got nowhere to run.”

“HUH? What’s wrong with you man? What do you mean I am pretending? You got something to do with this?” I typed back.

“All of this is your own fault.”

That was the last email I ever received from that account and no matter how many emails I sent to him over the next couple of days there was no reply after that.

I stayed at Ashok’s place for a whole of two weeks, his place was small with a single bed but we made do, with me sleeping on a ragtag pile of sheets on the floor. He didn’t mind the intrusion but as the chores kept piling up, it became almost impossible to manage all my extra stuff. Furthermore, towards the end of my stay, the fibers had started to accumulate over at his place as well, that’s when I knew that it was time to go back. Opening my familiar wooden door with some trepidation, I was half expecting my room to be overflowing with a sea of that fake wool, but what I found, however, was significantly worse.

The first thing that hit my face like a canon was the smell; an overwhelming metallic stink immediately filled my sinuses, making me reel back for a moment. The metallic odor was so overwhelming, in fact, that I almost didn’t notice the faint undertones of rot at first. Nearly all of the floor had been splattered with this sticky looking dark brown stuff. Half dried, half congealed, this sticky mess had stained the numerous clumps of fibers with a dark maroon color, it now lay matted, clumped together, disgusting to touch and harder to clean. The most striking thing about all this was that In the middle of the room, almost like an eye of the storm, lay a single stuffed unicorn, dripping with the same stuff that now caked my room, whatever its original color it may have been, now obliterated by the liquid which I realized later to be old dried blood.

I went to the cops this time around, telling them everything and firing an FIR for the vandalism and break-in but, just like the anonymous user had said, they didn’t care about this. The exhausted-looking cop even said so “Look, there’s really not much we can do if nothing’s been taken, even then, it wouldn’t really be on our list of priorities. Sorry kid.”

“How strange…” said Mina, she had come over and found me dripping with sweat and cursing under my breath as I tried to clean all that disgusting gunk out of my apartment. “You must have done something, why else would anybody go this far?” she said, picking up the gunk smothered unicorn stuff toy in her hands and feeling the hard horn on top. It didn’t occur to me then, but later that night, while I was having dinner, what she said, wasn’t it really similar to ‘his’ last message?

The daily onslaught of the fibers didn’t stop and now that seeds of suspicion had been planted in my mind, it was almost impossible to keep it from growing; especially since I had to spend most of my evenings cleaning all the stains, fibers and stuffed unicorn parts that increasingly filled my apartment each day. Even the neighbors had started to take notice of bags and bags of wool that I cleared out each day, with rumors starting to circulate throughout the building. Driven to the end of my rope I did the only thing I could and confronted Mina, while we were on a date over at a traveling circus passing through the town. She was having so much fun that day, all smiles and wide eyes. I had earlier thought of her flippancy about my “situation” being a result of her inability to help. It’s not like I had been injured or physically ‘harmed’ by the fibers in any form; but now that the parasite of suspicion had taken a root in my head, I couldn’t help but think about another potential reason for her offhandedness; an innocent act, from a severely twisted mind. I really didn’t believe that though, I didn’t want to.

It was in the hall of mirrors, amidst a menagerie of misshapen reflections of ourselves that I finally confronted her. Putting my hands on either of her shoulders I looked into her eyes, the incredibly serious expression on my face made her constant smile falter, “What’s wrong Shuchi?” she asked me. “You know I can’t sleep anymore. I hadn’t had a good night’s sleep in months, I keep… I keep imagining breathing and swallowing those damned fibers all the time. Please… Please tell me the truth. Are you doing this?” I implored her. I think that’s when she finally took a good look at my face and saw the dark bags under my eyes, my sickly skin and realized how bad I was doing. I had sunk to the floor in front of her, crying, releasing all the frustration that I had accumulated. She kneeled down in front of me, hugged me and said, “I don’t know why you’d think that, but it wasn’t me honey.” She said, patting my back, “I am sorry that I didn’t realize that you were having such a tough time.”

“Wait… Wait a second!” we were both surprised by this hoarse voice and looked at the entrance to see a really emaciated unkempt looking man, possibly in his 30’s, wearing a disheveled shirt and tattered pants approaching the two of us. ‘Had he been listening to us the whole time?’ I thought, as he stepped under one of the lights, bringing his features into view, the man looked even more tormented than I was feeling. “No, No, NO, NO!” he shouted, looking at me with an expression of pained fury in his sunken eyes and hollowed out cheeks. “You really don’t know?! Don’t fuck with me, you knew I was there and that’s why you are putting up this… this…” I could see him breaking down as he struggled to finish the sentence, watching the look utter confusion on my face really seemed to let all the air out of him. Mina looked as shocked at this strange man’s appearance as I was, she just stared at us, confusion seemingly the main theme of the day.

“It’s you,” I said, the realization setting in, this must be the guy. I was partially relieved that it wasn’t Mina, but that was simply eclipsed by the fact that I had no god damn idea who this haggard man was.

“Me?” he sneered, looking infuriated at the accusation. “It’s all your fault motherfucker, you did this to me! If I didn’t watch your cam all those months back…” his voice trailed off as he started to pant, his face still a mask of anger and pain. “Hey…” Seeing him struggle to breathe, I moved towards him but he immediately flinched and retreated back, bumping hard against one of the curved mirrors. “NO! Get the hell away from me!” he breathed out, his voice now broken and raspy. “Look man,” I started, trying to make some sense of all this strangeness, “I don’t know how you are doing what… whatever it is you are doing, but you need to cut that shit out. Why the hell are you stalking me and what’s with the fucking unicorns and the wool?” I asked, trying to keep my panicked voice steady, careful to keep my distance from him.

He looked up at me with a look of complete and utter defeat. “You really got no clue huh?” he rasped. He then proceeded to pull on his shirt with surprising strength, ripping the buttons off it and giving us a full unobstructed view of his severely scarred and mangled torso. He looked like had been starving for weeks, if not months. His scar filled skin stretched over his visible ribs, the scars themselves being of all different shapes and sizes, ranging from circular patches to longer rectangular ones, covering all across his abdomen, chest and reaching up to his throat, with thickened skin forming bridges over some of these areas. Both of us were stunned speechless as the man fell to the ground, his back arching up in response to some immense pain. “That’s when it started,” he gasped, his crying eyes starting to roll away from each other, as protrusions started forming under the skin of his bare abdomen, pushing up slowly… deliberately. A terrible scream rang out of his throat as one of the bigger swellings started to rip, revealing a solid bloody point peeking from that first wound. “Why the fuck does it have to be unicorns,” he croaked just before another point started to rip out of the side of his throat, filling the dark hall with bloody gurgles, as the rest of the protrusions started to break through the skin as well, each one of them making that same sickening noise, almost akin to ripping fabric. Mina’s scream joined the cacophony arising from the man as those hard points emerged further and further, with wounds ripping and blood gushing in the process, revealing the segmented plastic horns connected to the head of stuffed unicorns.

Within a minute, the misshapen heads of the first two stuffed unicorns were peeking out from deep gashes on his stomach. Furthermore, more of those segmented plastic horns had started bursting out from all over his mangled torso and limbs. Mina fainted with a loud thud as the man’s left eyeball plopped out of his head and another horn started to emerge from behind it, pushing out… and making that same unnerving cloth tearing noise as all the rest of him.

More and more of those gore-soaked unicorns kept pushing out of the man’s dead remains as I dragged Mina out of the blood-filled hall; luckily, before anybody else had a chance to happen upon that ultra-violent scene. Once Mina was sufficiently back to her senses at her place, I apologized to her profusely but she just told me to leave her alone. Guess I really messed up there…

It’s been one week since then and I still haven’t heard back from her, for now though, that’s the least of my worries. I was sure that I was somehow going to get implicated in… whatever happened to that man but, strangely enough, there was no knock on my door from a police officer or a raid at my office of some kind, there wasn’t even any news about someone dying at the circus on the local news channels. I suppose that should provide me some relief, but that’s really the farthest thing from my mind at the present moment.

I think… I think I am having hallucinations.

There’s no way,

No way that there is something poking my right eyeball from behind.

Right?"

I recently posted a YouTube video where I review a few resumes submitted by current CS students who are applying to software engineering internships.

I'm a current SDE at a Big 4 and went through the internship gauntlet fairly successfully, so you may find it worthwhile to give the video a watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QosqIO1bJlE&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QosqIO1bJlE&amp;t=5s)

I have been planning my summer / fall courses, so I spoke with my advisor this morning, who basically trashed my idea of doing web development and mobile app development as my tracks, of which each graduating student must have two. He said to do software development and mobile app development instead, because front-end has no future. I know WordPress really well, so I can see that, maybe? I'm not opposed to this change-up in principle, but I just don't know what to do or which pathways to take. I know that my few hand-coded websites are super messy (I'll get better, right?), and I need experience. I just don't know how to get any with my very limited skill set. I would be happy to take on internship-level work to improve my skills and get some mentorship, but I don't even know how to do that.

I'm currently a freshman in bio. I'm really interested in marine life/wildlife conservation(more strongly in marine) and that's why I chose to major in biology, thinking that it would give me a general idea and education. I was thinking of getting into a more concentrated area of study when I go to graduate school. 

However, these days I'm thinking of perhaps changing my major to ecology&amp; evolutionary bio(same campus - main) or marine bio(satellite campus) as I get into my sophomore year. The reason to this is because I feel as though I'd be able to get  the education I really want and that really interests me without needing to take other required courses as a bio major(although I think it might help me have different perspectives?). Plus I think it might help me going to grad school or getting internships in the related field by connections with professors from that field? 

The thing is, changing my major to eeb would be relatively not that big of a change, but if I want to change my major to marine bio, I'd have to move my campus from the main campus to a satellite campus. I'm kind of worried of missing out the college life experience as the satellite campus is small and quiet, although it has very good opportunities and resources as a marine bio major. 

The other alternative route I was thinking was to stay as a biology major and try to get internships or research opportunities in the field I'm pursuing. I could also take one semester in the satellite campus without changing my major.

I'd very much appreciate any advice as I'm completely clueless as what would be better for me!! THank you everyone, I hope you stay safe and healthy!"
frywa1,9,2020-03-30,Quarantine is really reminding me that I need to cherish myself,persimmonsareawesome,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/frywa1/quarantine_is_really_reminding_me_that_i_need_to/,"Just wanted to get this off my chest and sort out my thoughts. I (21F) moved to a different province for university to get away from my family as I found it was too suffocating and I got depressed easily when we were under the same roof. And over the last four years I really showed that when I’m apart from them or interest with them in limited doses, I do a lot better. For the first time in my life, I made real friends that really cared about me and for whom I’d go out of my way for; I got good grades and developed great relationships with my professors; got great internships and part time jobs; I was elected to student council and was also elected president of my sorority; got into a top law school in the States; and in general, I just felt more confident, more at ease, and loved myself more. 

I’ve been at home for 9 days thus far since my school closed and I haven’t been thriving lol. My mom is very paranoid about COVID-19 (she’s one of those people who buys N95 masks and doesn’t wear them properly) and has told me to quarantine myself in my room for 14 days. If I leave the room I have to wear gloves and a mask (she’s upset I wouldn’t constantly wear a mask in my own room). At the same time she complains that I’m lazy and don’t do chores like washing the dishes etc....which are in the kitchen...which obviously isn’t in my room. 

My dad on the other hand, I do feel closer to him but he’s much closer to my younger brother, who’s into computers like him. I’m happy for my brother’s successes but I feel that I really was my parents’ “guinea pig child” and they’d joke that they “won’t make the same mistakes” as they had with me. My contact with my family for the past 9 days has mostly only been me getting food. Today my bathroom ran out of toilet paper and I asked my brother if he could get me some (since I’m not allowed out of my room nor am I allowed to touch anything). My dad started joking that I’m “only good for eating and sh*tting” and then followed it up with how smart my brother is etc. He sounded so proud of my brother for just doing 8th grade homework questions. On the other hand, I was admitted into a special scholars program at my intended law school which takes only 10-20 people a year out of 500. His only question was “does it come with extra money?” And then was disappointed when I said it doesn’t. Mind you, I already received a 60% scholarship. 

I’m realizing right now that in a situation like this, it’s so easy to get depressed and let myself go. At school, I have a strict routine that has allowed me to be successful. Here, it’s been disrupted. Every summer when I’m home I’d start spiralling but I’ve always been able to overcome it by thinking about seeing my friends again in September. As a senior right now, obviously that’s not going to happen. It’s really lonely sitting alone in my room hearing them laugh downstairs but I know I will get through this. I’m going to do well in my online classes, my research for my professor, I’m gonna knit my rabbit a sweater, and I’m gonna learn some new skills using online free courses.  I’m also going to write that book I’ve been promising myself that I will write! 

For anyone else having a rough time in quarantine especially with their family, you’re not alone and please cherish yourself. I feel much better now after writing this out and reliving the reasons why I’m worth it, and I know that I’ll come out of this stronger. 

Stay safe and healthy guys ❤️"

I've been seeing a lot of posts with good information about the post-MBA landscape for big tech and larger start-ups. I am particularly interested in Product Marketing (PMM), as it seems to be a more interesting and more influential function than traditional business strategy/sales support roles at many tech companies. However, I know that the PMM role can differ widely across companies, with some roles more focused on outbound marketing tasks, and others being more focused on product development and research. 

&amp;#x200B;

From my research, it seems that the best MBA PMM roles in tech are:

1. Facebook (more strategic and more visibility than traditional PMM roles, and tend to be highly compensated
2. Google (rare to see this company give MBA internships in the PMM function, but their Associate PMM program is highly coveted and competitive)
3. Microsoft (heard from a friend that they pay the most for PMM interns)
4. Adobe (have noticed a lot of Kellogg grads hired into PMM positions here, and have read that it values those who are more creative)
5. LinkedIn (have heard anecdotally that the PMM function is not as well-respected as at other companies)
6. Amazon, Uber, Lyft--&gt; more operations driven companies mean it is not worth it to pursue PMM here

(Hopefully) short summary of my life so far: 

My main goal in life has always been to be the person I needed when I was younger, and to help people who cannot help themselves. 

I started working (part time) as a primary school teacher, then a preschool teacher, but gradually became disillusioned by the bureaucratic obstacles in public schools, then by how parents would undo most of the progress in the children I worked with. 

So I set my sights on being a child psychologist, and worked in various research labs through my four years in Uni. I’ve managed to snag some amazing internships in research institutions, but I’m sort of at crossroads right now due to restrictions surrounding the covid situation. One major thing that struck me while I was doing research with children was how helpless I was as a researcher, not being able to interfere as an impartial/ objective witness in abuse or neglect situations.

I’m still planning to pursue postgraduate studies in developmental psychology, but am planning to save up to avoid student loan debt as much as possible.

I'm a software developer with a bachelor in software developing. I'm working already 4 years as a software developer and had a 1 year internship. I worked at a big company, a small company and a startup. So I guess I had them all?

However with every employer I get bored and depressed. Sometimes that I'm crying at home because it's Sunday and I don't want to work again the day after. I'm often just staring at my screen not knowing why I chose this. And then I'm starting to panick and sweating realizing I need to do this for at least 40 more years.

I'm probably an odd one in CS, since I don't own a computer back home. (Yes I own an iPad, a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, iPhone, etc.). And I like technology. But I'm not a freak. For me these things are used when I'm bored and have nothing else to do.

When I see other collegues developing as a hobby in free time or get exited about a new project with a big customer, I kind of get jealous. I want to be exited too. I don't want to drag myself to work each time. 

Because of my lack of passion for the job and software development I also have no connection with my collegues. Who are mostly men. I like to travel, learn about new cultures, go shopping, go to parties, etc. I don't care about career and making big money. 

Sometimes I like developing, but that's when I can make something new. But until now all jobs I had was 20% making something completely new and 80% bugfixing or changing existing software.

I'm living in a country where your degree limits your career. Meaning that without a degree you can't work in another field. So I'm kind of stuck in software development. The jobs I can get are jobs like a waiter, which don't earn enough to pay the rent and drive my car. I don't care about big money, new cars, fashion brands, etc.  but I care about being to do more than just buying food and rent. 

Anyone who was stuck in the same position? And how did you got out?"

I majored in Political Science and Mandarin Chinese, in hopes to get a job someday working for a government trade office. But since then, it seems I’ve fallen into a pattern of taking extremely high stress jobs with objectively bad bosses. 

My past three jobs have been office jobs, working as a congressional staffer, then in international sales, and now as a sourcing analyst for a fortune 500 company. Not a bad career path in my honest opinion, but the road has been really hard on me. 

At the first job, I worked for a politician who had a temper, constantly yelled and swore at his staff, and was battling sexual assault allegations (now found to be true). I worked as this person’s personal assistant for a year in absolute fear of my job, working 70 hour weeks and constantly receiving negative criticism for nit picky things like not memorizing their coffee preferences and  how to mitigate their migraines for them. I was eventually fired for taking a wrong turn on our way to a meeting, resulting in us being a few minutes late. 

At my second job, I replaced someone who had been fired. Again, my boss was extremely unlikeable. She constantly fought with other department heads. When I acquired interns for my position, two of them quit because they could not deal with her. About two years in, she fired the best employee I’d ever worked with, for seemingly no reason. At the three year mark, she placed me on a performance improvement plan with vague intangible goals. I immediately switched jobs. 

Now at my current company, I am 9 months in and I am seeing red flags once again. I find myself being asked to come in to work nearly every weekend. During the week, I rarely leave before 6:30 at night, despite coming in at 8. Instead of receiving praise for the long hours I am asked to work, I am constantly being asked to put in more hours and given impossible deadlines. When I push back, my boss gets upset and blames her stress on us. I constantly worry I am once again going to fail at meeting the expectations of my boss at this job, resulting in me getting fired or having to leave. 

I’m writing this to ask you reddit, have you ever felt like you’ve jumped from bad job to worse to worse? How did you break the cycle? Did you change career paths or something else?"

I tried applying to several universities for a Masters degree in these fields but I was required to obtain some quantitative knowledge/education. 

Could anyone recommend a route to get into finance, whether through getting the quantitive knowledge from an online course (would be great if you could recommend a course) or through another route.

Also, does anyone know any apprenticeship programs in the big companies where they would take me for a course or a training program?

(School life balance, burnout)",StardustNyako,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fsfirw/i_need_help_school_life_balance_burnout/,"Sorry for extremely vague title, but I feel like my issue doesn't fall neatly in one topic I guess as it's a sorta complex web of issues

&amp;#x200B;

To paint the scene, I graduated high school in 2013 on time, and got in a good college but my mom got laid off and I couldn't go to school. Instead I stayed in a house that rapidly got super dysfunctional. I knew I needed to leave and so I literally just gave, all of myself to reach that goal of permanently leaving and finding peace.  Needless to say I worked my ass off.

&amp;#x200B;

But it almost never paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned a ""trade"" , IT but certs actually don't do much for you, not CompTIA anyway. As a result, after a 5 month contract job, I had nothing to move on to because I had n o degree. Those 9 months of studying and then working on weekends while dealing with a dysfunctional family? All for nothing.

Spent two more years attending community college online in this home , with that same burning urgency to leave the house, did well enough to get into a public ivy that some friends went to, those friendships going to shit unexpectedly , and a shitty roomate situation left me a bitter mess emotionally but more importantly here

&amp;#x200B;

the fact that I put so much effort in already and am today in an environment that kinda has fed me the message of ""that wasn't enough, now you gotta spend at least 2 more years working your ass off and hopefully you'll get somewhere - that''s killing my motivation. I'm completely burnt out.

&amp;#x200B;

For me that hasn't resulted in like giving up and doing nothing, it's resulted in me being incredibly sloowww with my work. I end up working 12 hour days basically and I still am not doing all I should and am barely skating by in my classes. I look bad really.  And of course, I have no time to socialize. Like the person with a semi similar post today, I've tried going to clubs, none of them seemed like they'd really contrast from being in school or just weren't interesting. The only club I went to semi regularly was anime club and I didn't make super strong friendships really but that's prob just a time issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no time for side projects (CS major) , or internship search or prep.

Question for you: How long do you spend doing work in a day? I know my 12 hour days aren't good and making a schedule can simetimes get me to work faster but it usually gets interrupted cause my brain is spacey and cant focus well enough. I just, see people enjoying life outside of school, but any time I see someone studying I know that's what I should be doing so I focus on that  
I know I need to balance better tho and be happy but I don't know how

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any help / advice for me to achieve a  better school balance is appreciated, verryyyy appreciated."

Has the lock-down and other pandemic responses affected academics to an extent that will place their career trajectories at risk? Many of these individuals were STEM-related academics, leaving me to wondering about my prospects post-pandemic. I understand no one is a fortune-teller, but is it reasonable to say that certain careers will be untenable for older students (i.e. 30 yrs old or older) after the pandemic passes? Is it sensible to exclude the heavy financial and emotional burdens that this virus will inflected on individuals when considering career trajectories? Many people find it difficult to look past the current crisis due to the uncertainty of developing events.

To better understand my situation, I am a US Chem MS student starting my thesis work. I have loans from my undergrad and my current program, and I will have to take on a little more debt before I finish. I have only one publication from an internship, as I helped a little with the project. However, I have not been a first author on anything, yet.

fsis80,3,2020-03-31,How to stop from spending money during social distancing?,artfulroyale,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fsis80/how_to_stop_from_spending_money_during_social/,"I know this sounds really ridiculous, but I need some advice on how to stop myself from spending money/sticking to a budget while social distancing. 

So, I had a retail job that I mostly worked on weekends. With the virus, I've not been fired, but I'm not working because the store is closed (it's a non-essential mom and pop shop). I'm in a very lucky, very privileged situation where I live with my granddad so I don't pay rent or utilities, and I get an allowance from my father.  

My problem is that for a while I have spent really unwisely. When I was an undergraduate student I was really good at putting money into my savings (and I have a couple grand saved up) but since I started graduate school I not only haven't saved anything, I've spent around $1000 of my savings on unnecessary things (mostly big things like tattoos or gaming consoles). I'm not sure what happened, but I think it's just been retail therapy and not having anybody around to check me. In undergrad, I always went shopping with my friends and I think they were good influences on my spending habits. Now, I don't have them around, so I only have to justify my spending to myself (even though my friends never actually judged me or anything, it was mostly just they would spend reasonably so I also would). 

I had been making some progress towards limiting frivolous spending. I stopped going to Starbucks, I would tell myself I could buy only $20 worth of ""fun"" stuff when I went to Target to get something I needed, etc. I never really online shopped because I prefer to see stuff in-person, so when I was trying to stop myself from spending money I just wouldn't go to places where I could spend too much money. It helped a little bit. 

Now, with social distancing, online shopping is a problem. I'm very anxious about my father (who is 63 and has heart problems) and my grandfather (who is 91) getting the virus, and that anxiety is made worse because my mother died of cancer in February, so I'm still dealing with that. Retail therapy seems to be my way of distracting myself and making myself feel better.  I'm teleworking for an internship and I have online classes, so that distracts me for part of the day, but it's hard for me to really focus on them because teleworking is boring and frustrating and I'm just checked out of my classes. Whenever I get the chance to buy something, I have been, and my credit card is almost maxed out already and it isn't due for another 20 days. I've been justifying it as giving myself something to do for the next several months, or something to make my room a happier place to be stuck in, or whatever. Also buying groceries for me and my granddad has been really expensive, as each time I've gone to the store I've bought more than I usually do so we have enough in case I can't go out again for a while, and I've been buying more snacks I can eat while home. 

I'm just not sure what I can do to stop myself from spending. It's harder to put myself in a situation where I can't spend when I can just use PayPal. I've been trying to distract myself with TV or reading, neither of which hold my attention for long. Video games kind of work but I can only play Animal Crossing for so long before I get tired of it. I text my friends but that doesn't really distract me, and I'm trying to avoid my granddad as much as possible in case I'm carrying the virus with no symptoms, so I can't really spend much time with him. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to keep myself from needing to spend money or at least keeping within a budget?"
fsj3ny,1,2020-03-31,"Story – first teaching experience was horrible, is this normal?",Vegetable-Chain,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/fsj3ny/story_first_teaching_experience_was_horrible_is/,"I started my master of science in education program in January. My concentration is preK-12 music. My school has a program where you can do a teaching internship at a local school full-time in exchange for free tuition. I took advantage of it because why not? You get a year of experience, free tuition, and get to experience what it's really like.

My experience started really great – I was nervous as hell though. I had never babysat in my life, never really talked to children, and haven't taught anything that wasn't high-school level (my internship was at an elementary school). On that first day, one of the teachers went right up to me and told me to just relax – apparently my body language looked super afraid. I *was* afraid.

After about a week, I was getting used to my job. I was working with kids at the back tables, walking them to lunch, playing with them at recess and during gym. I was getting along with the staff. After two weeks I was substituting, filling in half of the day for teachers who left early or had meetings. My internship advisor told me that the principal had told him I was ""starting off slow, but wasn't an issue."" I was a bit confused by this, since I had *just* started, but I figured she meant that I was slowly getting the hang of the job.

Around the three week mark, the principal sat down with me that morning and asked how I'm liking my job. I told her so far it was great and that I was really getting to know the kids. She proceeds to say, ""yeeeaaaah about that. I've noticed you're not interacting with the kids enough."" I was taken aback by this. I could not figure out what she meant – all I *was* doing was interacting with the kids; substituting, tutoring, reading and playing with them. That morning I happened to be sitting alone in the cafeteria before school started typing up an observation for one of my classes, so maybe that's what led her to that conclusion. But, she came at me very strong for something that seemed minor.

Then she says, ""did you not expect to have to interact with students as an intern?"" In what world was I not interacting with the kids?? I was so confused. I thought that so far, for someone who has never done anything like this before, I was doing pretty well for myself. I was proud up until this point. Then things started to go downhill.

At my grad school, they told us that if we had nothing to do at work, we were allowed to work on our observations and other school work – that school comes first. A lot of the time, there ended up being nothing for me to do. I would be placed with teachers who had me sit in the corner and not do anything for hours. But, the moment I pulled out my laptop to write up some observations of that specific class, the teacher would report me to the principal. If I *was* doing something, I was teaching special education classes that focused on math (my grad school's contract stated that it would be illegal for any intern to be alone with a special education student because the intern is not yet qualified to teach special ed students – why that rule exists? I don't know). But it was a rule, and my internship school completely disregarded it. I do not know how to teach math. I'm a music education student, and I failed math twice in undergrad. The teachers did not know where to place me or what to use me for because I do not know about other subjects – I know about music, and maybe language arts. The other interns were elementary education students, so it was easier for them to succeed.

Four weeks in: The principal reaches out to my university, telling them they're considering removing me from the internship for ""not interacting with the kids at all, being meek and unengaged in everything I do, and not having proper classroom management skills."" All I could say when my professor showed me that email was ""what the actual f\*\*\*?"" One month in, ONE MONTH INTO a new job that I have never done before and had no proper training on besides a two-day orientation teaching us ""how to send kids to the office"" and the principal wanted to fire me. I couldn't believe this – I drove home crying, not knowing what more I could possibly do when I thought I was doing everything I was supposed to be doing.

In the days that followed, I came home crying everyday. I couldn't stand to teach another math lesson, couldn't stand to be reported to the principal every single time I leaned against a desk, took a seat at the back table alone, or even for playing the xylophone in music class trying to learn the song the kids were doing (yes, I was actually reported for trying to learn more about my OWN subject). It seemed like anything I did was not acceptable and was reported to the principal. I even explained to teachers that I was completing observations whenever I had my laptop out – I would NEVER blatantly surf the internet during work like that. I've had plenty of internships during undergrad where I did very well and was never reprimanded for anything, so all of this came as such a shock to me. After awhile, if I had nothing to do, I just stopped doing my observations during classes because it was such an issue. My hatred for this internship started to show in my work, and that's when I knew I had to get out.

The day before I quit, a professor from my school that I didn't even know decided to ""surprise"" me at my internship. The surprise was basically that I needed a ""firm talking to"" and she proceeded to ask me why I ""wasn't doing a good job"" and ""don't you care about this?"" ""Why are you having these issues?"" I broke down crying in front of her after all the badgering and said ""MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE FIELD FOR ME THEN. BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT I DO, NOTHINGS WORKING."" Even with tears in my eyes, she had the audacity to say, ""Maybe it isn't for you. You could always teach music privately."" I quit the next day and when I tried to get in touch with the principal about it, she would ignore my messages and calls.

I was ashamed to quit my internship. But after that day, I knew I couldn't go back and cry every time I came home, or teach something I wasn't qualified to teach, or deal with the principal breathing down my back. My family has been so supportive – at first they did not want me to quit. But once they learned what I was putting up with, they were begging me to never go back. I was told that the school I was working at was an INCREDIBLE school, and that there was no reason for me to be struggling.

I try not to let this experience dictate my entire career. I want this job more than anything because I care about the kids. I want every child to know I support them and allow them to be their unique selves. I believe that someday, when I am a teacher, this will all just be a bad memory. I hope that I can have a much better student teaching experience and, more importantly, a much better teaching job. Is this normal? Will admin truly be this uptight? Will you never be able to stand up for yourself? Thanks for reading!"

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in physics in the UK with class I (4.0 GPA). I originally planned to continue the path in academia but had decided otherwise. Given my background in physics, I thought I could look to become a quant.

So in an effort to get some exposure to the financial industry, I got into an internship at a small discretionary investment management firm. However, I feel like I am wasting my time, because I am assigned very mundane tasks such as transaction reporting and performance reports, and my training in mathematics and computation are not put in good use. (plus I am not being paid because it is contracted as a ""shadowing position""...) Also due to the coronavirus lockdown, I can't even learn from the investment manager that I shadow anymore. So while I am doing this internship, I am self-learning [portfolio theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-portfolio-construction-python/), [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) and [algorithmic trading](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures).

This interniship is coming to an end in about 2 months, so I will need to look for a job soon. I heard that quant positions can be fiercely competitive, someone with a Bachelors is very disadvantageous compared to those with PhDs. Also given that the companies are cutting costs and jobs due to the virus, I think I will have a very hard time kickstarting my career.

So what should I do in these 2 months, and what should I do afterwards? Do you think what I am self-learning atm are valuable for my future career?"

fso38i,1,2020-03-31,Intended CS (but only three semesters left),AirBears3,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fso38i/intended_cs_but_only_three_semesters_left/,"I took 61A this semester for fun, and Im really liking it, so I’m hoping to add a double major in CS. However, I only have till Fall ‘21 (was originally Spring ‘21, but I can be Fall’ 21 if I double in CS) to graduate (I’ve heard it’s nearly impossible to add a sixth semester since I’m over the unit cap). Because of this, I’ll have to take a crazy schedule every semester, and I’m wondering how I can soften that up a little.


This Summer:
61b + Ee16a + math 1b 

This Fall:
70 + 61c + ee16b + (what class should I take here? Thinking about 186)

Spring:
170 + 189 + 188 + primary major elective 

Summer:
161 + 168 (potentially internship in addition to that?)

Fall ‘21:
162 + 2 CS electives + 2 primary major electives



This schedule seems kinda tough—every semester seems to be borderline impossible, and I’m not sure if it’s doable. For context, most units in a semester I’ve taken was 26 **but with 0 techs**. This semester I’m taking 20 units with two techs, and it’s been quite doable so far. however, I haven’t taken more than two techs a sem, so I’m not sure if I can handle this workload listed above. Is there a way to make the above workload lighter?

Anyone has any suggestions?"

# Comments: 

The college process was a VERY VERY long one for me. It involved a lot of reflection and realization. I came into this process with tunnel vision and left it realizing what I really want in a school. I'm very very grateful to be accepted at the schools I was accepted to. I already chose where I will be heading to in the fall as well, and I'm super happy with my decision :)))) 

To those who are still reading, thanks for sticking this far lol. In the end of this entire process, please remember this: ***If it is meant to be, then it will be.*** This whole process is like a lottery. I know you might have gotten decisions you may or may not hoped for, but do know that ***one closed door can open hundreds of other doors.*** If you're a junior or senior or whatever, feel free to PM me with any questions about the app process or if you just want to chat. Best of luck to everyone out there :)"
