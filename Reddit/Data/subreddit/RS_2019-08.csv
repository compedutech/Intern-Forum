Before I couldn't apply for any internships nor do I have any projects except for the ones we did on class(personal reasons), The only thing I did was help students with they're coding if they were struggling. Now that that I can I want to try to apply for internships but I don't know what to put on it in terms of experience. Now I'm scared that its too late for me and that is going to be really difficult to find an internship or a job."
ckgow0,0,2019-07-31,Take Full-Time Internship position or continue school?,Bugeun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckgow0/take_fulltime_internship_position_or_continue/,So i have an opportunity to work for a well known airplane company full time instead of continuing school in college. I live in Quebec Canada so im doing a DEC of computer science currently which is a 3 year program that allows me to get decently paying jobs in the field(50-70k) and i was also planning to go to uni to get my Bachelors of computer science which will take another 3 years and graduate at 25. But now i have an internship opportunity to work full time in a data presentation/manipulation job that can teach me much more than what im going to be learning in college currently. I am very interested in investing my money and save almost all of it currently so having more capital younger could help me in the long run but im just concerned at how this could affect my career in computer science. I could move up positions within the company and I will most definetly be studying and learning stuff on my own time. So is it a good idea to take this job?

I have a technical internship at a large computer hardware company. Lined up for a fulltime offer with a pretty good salary. I go to a good school, but I have a slightly above average gpa, not one of the top performers I dreamed I would be. I have this feeling that I have been coasting all of my life and I never really have applied myself in anything. Like I basically spend 10hrs a day just thinking about random shit and goals and dreams but I never actually do anything. I need to stop living life on autopilot and start doing things. I could just continue in my current state and live a pretty good life and make a decent wage and have a family and shit, but I just feel like I need to do something more, but I am having a tough time actually figuring out that something. I need to find something that fulfills me because life has gotten pretty boring and I feel like I just get into something for a little bit and then drop it. I am in the PNW this summer so I have really gotten into hiking and mtbing lately, in my free time I read about personal finance and pertinent cs topics. Also have this addiction to looking people up on linkedin as a validation of their self worth based on their title and it's really fucked. I get super bored with my current job because it is not that interesting even though it's what I wanted to do for awhile. How do I find direction in my life? What do I prioritize? Am I narcissistic? Should I see a therapist?"

So, I am currently a front-end software developer intern and the work involved in this internship is creating an in-house app for the company. Myself and three other interns have built an app from scratch. This app has received a lot of praise from the company and I’m proud of what we have developed. My only concern is how I am going to show others outside the company what I have done. I was wondering if there was a way I could hold on to the app to show future employers and friends and family.

My idea was just to use screen capture while I run through the app. But I would also like to hold on to the code. I’m not even sure if this is legal, so any advice would be much appreciated!

This may be a question to directly ask my managers, but I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas. Thank you in advance!"

There is also a lot of concern about layoffs in my company right now, especially within my group.

I was lucky enough to get a meeting with a director on another team, who is doing some very cutting edge work, and who will certainly not be getting laid off. I am hoping to get offered part time work on a specific project within this team, and to stay on with them if my team is laid off.

I don't know how I should handle this meeting, for example how direct to be, and how to avoid getting myself in trouble.

I also do not want to cause conflict with my own manager, who has been like a father to me, and given me several raises and promotions in a relatively short time, despite my feeling that I have not really done anything. I will eventually need to ask his permission.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'm a senior studying computer science at a mid-sized private university ranked in the 50s. I'll be applying to machine learning PhD programs this fall and I'm working on finalizing the list of schools I'll apply to.

Some info about me:

\*GPA: 3.81, major GPA 3.86 (out of 4.0)

\*GRE: 168 verbal, 169 quant

\*I've taken several joint graduate/undergraduate courses in machine learning and related fields

\*Did internships after my freshman and sophomore years, but not in ML

\*Currently in a machine learning REU with two papers in preparation

Based on this information, can anyone give me a rough idea of my chances of getting into a top 10 or top 20 graduate program for machine learning? Should I consider myself competitive for the very top schools? What tier schools should I consider as safety/fallback options?"
ckixg0,45,2019-07-31,TIFU by calling out a 5th grader's passed mother.,SmashEffect,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ckixg0/tifu_by_calling_out_a_5th_graders_passed_mother/,"This was unintentional, I swear.

So I graduated high school last June and I figured that I should do a job for the summer to get down extra cash + experience for future internships in college. I applied to a summer camp center for a position as a teacher, and after BSing my resume and my work experience (I really wanted this job so I lied by saying that I tutored before, but I didn't), I miraculously got in.

Now that you know that I'm not so experienced with kids, let's talk about today morning. I'm at work in my classroom with 10 of my other kids who are all 5th graders. 

There's always this one boy who never does his work and always leaves his seat, yells, and laughs really loud. I tried approaching him nicely and attempted to encourage him to be a little quieter and more productive in his work, but it didn't work. Today I decided to be a little strict on him (as well as the rest of the class so he doesn't feel singled out).

I said ""Young man, finish your work in the next 5 minutes or I'll have to talk to your mother."" I could've said ""parent"" or ""call home"" or anything, but the first thing that came to mind is ""mother"".

Then suddenly he gets angry and tears start rolling down his eyes. I asked him ""what's wrong?"" and he explodes and starts crying loudly. My boss barges in my classroom and she asks me what happened. I tell her that I told him to do his work and he suddenly started crying.

In the middle of our discussion, the boy (I won't say his name) says that he misses his mom and right then and there, my heart sunk. I never knew that his mother passed away, and now I'm a total dickhead to my students and my boss. I'm still super bummed about it and I'm considering buying him a treat tomorrow as an apology.

TL;DR: I told a kid that I was going to call his mom if he doesn't do his work, but I didn't know that his mom passed away. He got emotional and I feel like a POS."

I am a fourth year PhD student in CS working in discrete math and theoretical CS at a tier-2 (IMO) university in Canada. I took some classes at my university on ML and went through some of the courses available through Stanford. I have done some personal and course-related ML projects, and have two ML engineering internships under my belt.

I hope to switch to a research career in ML after I graduate (which will be next year), not in academia but in the industry, either theoretical or applied ML. Unfortunately, I don't have any publications in ML at this stage (The research projects I worked never panned out, and it's hard to get into projects with professors here given I am a fourth year student) and understand this will make things very hard for me as far as the career switch goes.

Hoping to get some advice on what steps I can take to improve my chances? Is applying to research engineer positions a good stepping stone?

I am also applying for jobs and/or internships (being ambiguous here to not expose myself lol?) to hopefully gain professional experience. However, these applications are asking for my GitHub portfolio, which I am more than happy to share. I have some concerns about it, which I would like to ask this community about, if anyone has ever had any similar experiences or how to go about sharing my portfolio.  


1st concern: My GitHub really only consists of a few completed projects in a sea of repositories that are all practice-projects where I'm practicing certain codes or playing with some frameworks. Would this mess of a GitHub portfolio look good or bad to recruiters/employers? I'd like to think that they see I'm constantly learning and working on coding, however, I'm also thinking they might see it and think I'm just a mess and shouldn't even be considered for the role/position.  


2nd concern: I've made some repositories private, especially the one project which might end up on the App Store within the year, I'd love for recruiters/employers to see it, however it's sensitive code to me as I wouldn't want people to see my source code for an app that I hope to release soon. How would I go about this sort of predicament? Could I include a note in the application saying that I have a private project that I'm working on and would love to show them in person? Could such a statement cause suspicion with recruiters/employers? Would it be a better idea to let them know that I'm working on a project and detailing what frameworks I am using/implementing?

I won't bore people with the details, but after a series of unfortunate events throughout the year as well as being generally in shock due to how much more rigorous the coursework is in comparison to the two years I spent at Community College, I'm currently at a 2.08 GPA. Not a 2.8, but a 2.08. Only a year left and a half (5 quarters) left until I graduate with a CS degree. It's not that I don't like CS at all! In fact, I'm very passionate about it and I have plenty of personal projects and project experience to talk about. It just came down to situations that I could not control, unfortunately. 

I'm worried that I won't hear back from companies because my GPA is missing from my resume or if I do get an offer, they might ask for a transcript and then cancel the offer afterward. This number will definitely go up, but as of right now, I will be interviewing for Summer 2020 internships. I was wondering if there are people in similar situations? Will it dramatically decrease my chances of landing an internship/job? Do larger companies heavily look into very low GPAs/bad transcripts? Will getting referrals help with the process?  

Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you."

Can somebody send me links on how the common app is supposed to works and the exact unis that are likely to accept me in US,Canada, Europe or Singapore? And when is the right time to take the SAT exam Oct or Dec if i havent startedthe prep rn , i am thinking about UW madison,Clark Uni,Sarah Lawrence Uni,Uni of Toronto,Uni Of british columbia,Tufts Uni,Amherst,Drexel,American Uni (AU) and Bennigton Uni I am considering germany as an option but Not sure which unis would accpet Alevels?
 Will hiedelberg uni accept students like me ?

And do yall think National Uni of Singapore will accept students? What should I do right now to make my application stand out and what advice do yall have for international students trying to get into US or Canada to fund their studies . Is it a good idea goig abroad for bachelors or should i do a bachelors in pakistan then go for Abroad (however we dont really have any good unis exceot a handful so idk what with that )


Stats:Olevel Grades: 3As 4B and 1C 
ASlevel : Currently sill waiting for the results but lets say i get decent grades (A-C) range in subjects Bio,Chem,Psychology (I am considering taking math during A2level but  up till ASlevel or some other subject ,is it a good idea?)

SAT:Still havent taken it yet but hopefully get in the 1400 + range

Extracurriculars:
Internship at a hospital over the summer

I hope somebody replies to my questions and let me know if u think taking maths during A2level would help PS i am considering doing neuroscience,neuropsych,computersci (tho i want to know whether its too hard and whether the math in computersci is too hard , is computersci a subject thats too hard like the coding and who should not consider it ??), Biology or Biochem,Journalism or Economics /Business , Graphic Design, as u can tell i am kinda overwhelmed and confused about what subject or course i should take up in Uni so plz let me know how yall figured out what u guys were going to study in uni and how i should stop my confusion and decide on one thing ?? Something that will eventually earn me a decent living abroad and I can acually have fun with my passion are reading , writing , working with the camera sometimes animations but coding is something i have heard everybody should learn nowadays so its kinda interesting with how AI is going to shape our future anyways enough with the rambling lol"

While I were struggling with courses like Calculus, Physics, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, and studying MIPS, 8086, 8055 architectures I literally had no time to study what really was going on in the industry. 

I know how to code in C, C++, Java and C#. Object oriented languages are very similar. I don't think I'm very confident in Lisp, Scheme or Haskell though.
I also know SQL a little.

I coded several scripts in Unity since C# is quite easy. Mostly for educational purposes.
I took a few ethical hacking courses online to understand networking better. But that's it.

My point is, I can't create a whole software begining to end. I don't know how to. I know how languages works. I know how CPU and RAM works. I know how to write a script. But when someone says ""code me a program,"" I have no idea. And also I have no idea about where to start. A few months later I have to do my mandatory internship. I'm freaked. Because I have no idea about what to expect.

* *Prepare for interviews*. Almost all your skills would be useless unless you are able to crack the interviews. Each company has a well-defined interview procedure to hire Software Engineers. By-and-large it is the same for all the companies — 1 screening round (resume shortlisting), 1 coding test, 1–3 rounds of technical interviews. All of the interviews are generally focused on Data Structures and Algorithms, or rather, problem-solving capabilities. Some companies also focus on specific skills for which they are hiring. As an example, if the company is looking to hire a Web Developer, expect questions from your projects on Web Development. Similarly for other skills. I have seen people who complain — why do companies ask Data Structures and Algorithms while I would be working on Mobile App Development? Well, if you want a great job, *stop crying, start preparing*.
* *Diversify your skill set*. At the college fresher level, it is recommended that you should try and be a *jack of all trades, master of none*. This way, you will throw a wider net when you try and reach out to companies. For instance, an ideal resume would have 1–2 Web Development related projects, 1 Mobile App Development project, 1 project around Machine Learning, 1–2 projects around Operating Systems/Databases and obviously an internship experience. I have seen some students who try and specialize in a specific domain — most commonly Machine Learning. I am not saying it is bad but remember, *companies would generally not value your specialization too much, certainly not at the fresher level*. Unfortunately, that’s how it is and you’ll have to live with it.
* *Build a network*. Yes, programming skills are important. However, networking skills are equally important. You should have friends/colleagues who should be willing to help you connect with HR from their company in case you want to shift.
* *Create an online presence (build a personal brand)*. Try contributing back without the expectation of getting anything in return. *You would be amazed to see how much you’ll get back, without even asking*. Today, due to my online presence on Quora, LinkedIn and Facebook, I get an opportunity to connect with so many smart people from all over the world.

As a little background, I'm currently working full-time as a digital media specialist, previously worked as a social media manager, and before that did work as a fingerprinter with a police department and was an archaeological field technician for short period of time. Interesting and diverse work experience, just not really good for CS.

One of the things that really hindered me when I got out of school the first time was not having a lot of experience under my belt related to the jobs I wanted. I'm curious what sort of experience would make me a competitive candidate and what opportunities I should look for as I'm working on this degree.

I'm thinking of contacting the career center at my uni but I'm not looking to transfer careers atm ( I love my current job, it's just not providing me with the salary I desire to support my goals + I want to maintain a good record of consistent work experience + my current job allows me the time and flexibility to work on classwork - there's a very good work/life balance with it that I don't think a lot of other jobs can offer.)

I wonder if there are any internship opportunities available on the weekends - has anyone had success with finding something like that? Are there any sort of competitions or events that I could use to help pad my resume? What has worked for you?

TL;DR: How can I get experience for my resume while pursing a CS degree and working full-time (without changing careers atm)?"

ckqbun,189,2019-08-01,My first app failed miserably. Here’s the story and my reflection after building dozens of other apps.,jeffatmvpdev_dot_io,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ckqbun/my_first_app_failed_miserably_heres_the_story_and/,"Last month I shared a funny story about [an MVP we developed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/c591p4/we_built_and_shipped_an_iphone_app_in_7_days_then/) to test a new feature.

The project we tested that feature for was my second app, and it attracted hundreds of thousands of downloads plus a seed investment.

My first app was not so successful.  Failures are inevitable along the way -- especially in your first business.

But this one still bugs me.

After designing dozens of other applications for [MVP Development](https://MVPDevelopment.io) clients -- inspired by the visions of some really bright entrepreneurs -- I’m quite certain we wouldn’t run out of money if we could go back.  In fact, I think we might have even made a fortune.

**The backstory**

Today I help entrepreneurs determine what features are necessary to test the viability of an idea, what those features should look like in an interface, and how we can bring the vision to life as quickly and inexpensively as possible.

This was the project where I learned I had a knack for those things.

[We built an app for paying cover charges at our college’s local bars.](https://imgur.com/a/jrtzNnJ)  This was an SEC school, so there were about 30,000 students and a good proportion of them partied a lot.  There were 10 major bars downtown and on any night of the week you could find one that was packed.

It was rare not to be charged $5 or $10 at the door for cover.  Usually, that was the bar’s profit, and there were drink specials sold at cost.

Cover charges had to be paid in cash.  If you didn’t have cash, you would visit an ATM.  So we built an app that let you buy covers on your phone with a credit card and we called it Gulp.

**Gulp V1**

We hired a recent graduate as our developer for $150/hr.  This guy built the Newsy app, which sold for $37m.

At the time, we were 19, 20, and 20 in age, respectively.  This app cost us all of our money and then some.

Determining how users would buy covers and redeem them was my first major UX challenge.  In the beginning, users would buy ‘digital covers’ which had a [QR code](https://imgur.com/a/ElJGJ0c) the doormen could scan at the door with their own phone.

This method worked well enough to launch, so we did.

**The launch**

We convinced 2 of the 10 bar owners to accept our digital covers to test the viability of our app.

We told some friends the app would be available on a Monday night, we spent $75 on facebook ads announcing the app would be available, and we tweeted to our 250 followers that we attracted by word of mouth.  The app was not approved by the app store until that afternoon.  Just in time!

We showed up early, grabbed a booth and some drinks, and waited for the crowds of people to show up to use our new app.

Only 25 people had downloaded at this point, but I guess we expected people to download it on their way to the bars.  No surprise now -- they did not.  It was just us and a few friends.

**User acquisition**

Our failed launch was a wake up call.  It’s how we learned “if you build it they will come” is not true.

So we implemented a few strategies to market our app:

1. We ran a follow/unfollow twitter bot on our [account](https://imgur.com/a/85D4isx) targeting everyone who followed the accounts of the major bars in our college town.  Twitter is where everyone found out about drink specials.
2. A couple of student journalists heard about us, asked to interview us, then published our interviews with links to download our app.  So, we offered interviews and news about our app to other student journalists.
3. We went to fraternities and sororities at dinner time.  At our school, it was common for people to drop by and pitch in one minute their event or org.  We went and pitched our app and left flyers.
4. We worked out deals with one of our partner bars such that people who paid cover with our app would get [crazy good drink deals](https://imgur.com/a/dMHoynn).  We had to pay the difference in drink price, but we only further discounted already good deals (ie. $3 pitchers -&gt; $1 pitchers). [This created lines around the block](https://imgur.com/a/v2tNbOi).
5. We ‘hired’ unpaid interns -- attractive females -- to hand out flyers in front of the bars.

We were getting users for about $1/each blended.  In one month, we acquired 2,500 users-- about 25% of the bar-going crowd. We even had [some haters](https://imgur.com/a/U8gZJKF) (which typically means you’re doing something right).

**Usability**

As the app started to pick up steam, we started getting emails saying door guys weren’t accepting their covers.  So we went to the door guys to ask why, and they were very candid in saying it’s a pain in the ass to pull out their phone, find their own app, and scan drunk people’s phones.

So it was back to the drawing board.

Ultimately, we determined that a user wouldn’t redeem a cover on purpose without getting entry in return.  [So we created a button you would hold for 3 seconds, a yellow bar would fill behind the button over the course of those 3 seconds, and then the cover would vanish](https://imgur.com/a/TD1lCgN).

Users would simply redeem the cover in front of a door guy for entry.

Problem solved!

**Retention &amp; Monetization**

Processing these $5 covers cost us $.47 each time.

We bore that expense because bars were already hesitant to reduce the amount of cold hard cash they brought in.  Plus, customers ability to pay cover by credit card wasn’t a benefit strong enough to attract customers to one bar over another.

We charged [$5.99](https://imgur.com/a/APvE5Ue), and people knew they were paying an extra $.99 for convenience.  A $1 convenience fee was better than $3 at the ATM, and walking to an ATM.

Still, we were making just $.52 per cover, and users weren’t sticking.  We processed $10,000 in cover purchases, and averaged less than 1 purchase per user.

$.52 per use, $1.50 to acquire a user, $15,000 to build the app, and we were out of money (in debt to our parents, even).

**Failure**

Ultimately, the project failed.

Our value proposition wasn’t strong enough.

The unit economics didn’t work.

We had no other way of monetizing other than ‘ads’, which (1) we had no idea how to implement (ie. sell placements), and (2) we had no money to implement.

It was one of those long drawn out failures where you deny that you’re failing for several months.  You just sit there and feel stuck &amp; miserable for months on end, rather than chalking it up as an L.

As an entrepreneur you’re told never to give up, while simultaneously being told failure is ‘good’ (but it feels horrible in the moment).  So you freeze up.

It’s hard to identify and execute new ideas in that mindset.

**What we should have built**

Building apps for other entrepreneurs has opened my eyes to many new ways of doing things.

I’ve reflected on that experience with the knowledge I’ve gained since, and I think I know what we needed to do.

At the time, I had no idea what affiliate marketing was, or how referral agreements were structured.  What would businesses pay for a customer referral?

We should have implemented some combination thereof to gamify our app.  Users redeem points for covers, and points could be collected in a number of ways:

1. Eating at a particular local restaurant.  Getting your haircut at a particular salon.  We could have partnered with those businesses and earned money for every customer we sent their way.
2. Cost-Per-Action offers (CPA offers; affiliate marketing).  Students take surveys in the in-app browser while in class.  We get paid as those surveys are completed.
3. Online deal redemption (Cost per Acquisition offers; affiliate marketing).  Using incentives (the points) to get students to buy products online or sign up for services.  Just like those old ‘free xbox’ websites that made you complete a million different offers -- but not as obnoxious.

**The economics**

Point economics would be structured such that we make 3x or 4x the actual cost of a cover.  That way, bars charge us $5/cover but we make $15 to $20 as a student collects enough points to buy a cover.

This solves profit and value proposition issues, but there are a few more benefits:

1. User acquisition costs become nearly non-existent, as the value proposition is much stronger (free covers), and people refer friends to earn points (which cost us $.25 to $.33 on the dollar).
2. We gain leverage in the marketplace.  Bars charge us $5/cover in the beginning, but the power dynamic changes when we can control the crowds by (a) advertising or not advertising their deals, and (b) raising or lowering the # of points it costs to buy cover at one bar over another.
3. Lower payment processing expense, and higher margin on cash cover purchases.

**Conclusion**

Despite losing $5k/each in college and having to endure the pains of failure, building that app was far and away my most valuable experience in college.

I don’t think failure is valuable because you learn from failure.  I’m not sure you learn anything from failure itself -- it just hurts.  But it hurts less the next time.  You learn from trying -- from experiencing firsthand.

Plus, we landed a ridiculous amount of interviews relative to our peers.  We didn’t have great grades -- we barely had time to go to class.  But that experience stuck out on our resumes and everyone involved landed great opportunities by graduation.

That opportunity taught me never to build anything without a planned path to profitability.  I learned to plan out the unit economics of a business and budget accordingly.  I learned that every expense is 3x greater than what you plan for, and revenues are always a third of what you project.

Lastly, I’ve since found that most good app ideas can be implemented in a way that influences purchasing decisions.  Any time you gain leverage over how people spend money, and that spend is significant enough, you’re going to make money yourself.

Sometimes you can even charge both sides of the marketplace to make a transaction happen.

What do you guys think?  Is that how we should have monetized from the start?  Or was the business doomed from conception?

PS. Many people have asked over the years if they can steal our idea and try to make it work.  I’ve always replied with an emphatic ‘yes!’, but no one has followed through.  If anyone thinks they can pick this concept up and make it work, go for it!  I’m too old and out of touch with college students to make it work now.  But I would love to see another student succeed with it at their school (and beyond)."

There's internships involved in the program as well. Made for entry level positions. I planned on getting at least 5 certifications after I complete school. This program cannot transfer to a 4 year degree. 

However, looking at my credits that transferred I have almost a whole year completed IF I wanted a bachelors. But I don't want to accrue anymore student loans. So I'm worried to get a bachelors in computer science would leave me in even more debt. And what if I can't find a job (which is a concern for both programs).

Any advice? I have this war with myself as far what to choose. The 30 year old me wants to just do 2 years and not waste time. But then the dreamer part of me says ""meh, whats the worst that can happen?"" Help!

The school will have employers lined up for you to apply (90% guaranteed match). 70% of the people in the degree do it but i'm not sure if it's worth it.

Pros:

More experience (however I have done summer internships and I will do a summer internship if I don’t do this program)

Company might rehire when I graduate

Stay with same friend group (doesn’t matter that much to me)

Cons:

Graduate a year late

Earn less at an internship than at a real job (people average $50k while graduates from this program earn 100k right away)

Employers are rarely from big companies and some people are stuck at small towns doing boring work

&amp;#x200B;

I looked around to apply to employers outside of the internship program but very few of them offer internships that last a year long (most are 4 months)

So my question is: should i do the year long internship or should i skip it and graduate a year earlier than my peers? (and maybe how to find one year long internships)"

My plan was to go back to college and apply for internships so I could get IT experience while attending my classes and even knockout a cert or two while studying.

After reading about peoples experiences with Sallie Mae I am not sure that I want to pay for college by relying on them. 

The thing is that I cant exactly pay out of pocket (one semester alone at my university costs $4,000). Long story short now I just feel so lost and trapped since I am still stuck working at my dead end job and not making any progress. At this point Im not sure if I should just start applying for entry level IT jobs, study for my Certs and call it a day. I doubt I could land an entry level job without any experience and certs so Im not even sure if I should bother at this point.

Given the details of college there isn't much that i can gain from it . Poor attitude of faculties towards students , lack facilities for research and retarded curriculum .

But i don't want be a victim of any of this , i want to take control of my learning and not just be limited . It may sound funny to you but i want to learn as much as an MIT undergrad , though i can never get the amount of exposure that they have with the best stuff that the industry has to offer i also may not be as smart as them but , i am willing to put in the same amount of time and effort as much them and even more , i am willing to work on each and every aspect of learning from rigorous assignments , problem sets , projects , research internships at better colleges . 
And at the end i want to pursue my grad studies in one of best universities which requires a student to prove it's worth.

This may seem laughable to some of you , seeing someone like me dreaming about the best of the best .


I just want help from you guys . Just comment  anything helpful guidance, learning pathway, negative comments , corrections , learning resources and tools but please do comment .

ckudt1,8,2019-08-01,Am I not hardcore/hardworking enough for this field?,wvfnctn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ckudt1/am_i_not_hardcorehardworking_enough_for_this_field/,"I'm in my mid-30's and this will be my second career.

Awhile ago I realized that I'm not a ""live to work"" person and it was one of the major reasons behind me leaving my previous line of work. I kept ending up in positions where 40 hours a week wasn't enough and I'd always have to be doing more, more, more which I absolutely despised. 60-80 hour weeks were somewhat common. I really learned to value my personal space/time.

The main reason I got into software development was because I moved back to Canada after a very long time living in Korea (where I worked in localization for a large IT company) and only having a BA, I needed to go back to school for something and since I'm very good/comfortable with computers it just made sense. Also the salary and ease at which you can get into the field were motivating factors (all the wunderkind go to the US).

I ended up spending two years upgrading my education and have worked one internship as a web developer with my next and final one (as a developer) starting soon at a major bank. I do like working as a developer as I like problem solving and putting things together so I think I'll be happy in either front end or back end or ""full stack"", so long as there are problems to solve.

The thing is, I realize that there's a huge personality rift between myself and others, mainly that I'm the only ""work to live"" person I know. There's this pervasive ""code around the clock"", self-inflicted hackathon, crunch etc mindset among both students in my program and in the workplace. It was the most intense at hackathons but I noticed it a lot at my internship too -- lots of people took their work home with them and coded **a lot** in their off hours. It wasn't expected of me as an intern but I got the vibe that everyone's job and hobby were the same thing (coding) and if they weren't, they didn't really belong.  I thought working for a bank might have a better work:life ratio but so far a lot of people I've talked to in that sector had the hackathon/crunch mindset.

I'm just really starting to think my personality is not a good fit for this field. I'm good at it, I just don't have an endless pool of energy and coding is not my hobby, it's my profession. If I do take up coding as a hobby, which I will, I want to work on personal projects that will most likely have nothing to do with my day job -- like making an app or a mod for a game I play, not whatever they have me doing at a bank. Everyone else seems to be a lot more career-focused than me and obsessive over their career-specific portfolios. Beyond that, numerous people have told us throughout the course of my program/internship to quit hobbies and pastimes to make way for coding/learning languages/productivity etc which is something I take issue with for personal and moral reasons -- TBH I think everyone should be working less, not more.

**TL;DR** I'm not a workaholic nor do I code much for fun, at least not in a way that's related to my day job(s). When I do code for fun it doesn't relate to my career path whatsoever. I do enjoy development though and think I would be a great developer so long as I'm not expected to work OT/crunch/sacrifice regularly. Should I work as a developer? Is there room for someone like me?"

Common Apps just opened today and I've been thinking about which major I should apply for. I'm torn between Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering because the two summer internships I have had deal with mechanical engineering but I am more interested in CS. Basically, I'm interested in both majors but will probably prefer CS. However, applying as a ME major would be better for my application because it creates a more cohesive theme. If I am applying to schools such as Texas, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, USC, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, etc. and other second-tier schools with very good CS and engineering programs, would it be better for me to apply for CS (the major I probably want to study) or ME (the major that fits my application's theme better)? I am just unsure if I am able to transfer to the CS school from the engineering school if I get accepted to any of these second-tier CS/engineering schools. If it is difficult to transfer, (Carnegie will be especially difficult), is it worth it to apply for CS and have a more broken application (which will definitely lower my chances of getting in to those schools)?

&amp;#x200B;

Some background info:

5 on APCS A and can code in Python and Java

4 on AP Physics C Mech

In my two internships I mostly worked with CAD (AutoCAD, Altium, BlueBeam, etc.), mechanical loads, and PCB design which is more engineering/mechanical related but I have also written scripts in Python. Generally, the work was engineering oriented, but since CS and engineering overlap I did some coding."

He is looking for something in the manufacturing and modeling space since that is what he is passionate about and has experience in, yet no matter what (even intern) level of a job he applies to, he keeps getting told no.

Today was his 100th no.

He has seen interview coaches, had his resume reviewed and polished by numerous experts in his field and he knows what he is talking about. He had obtained a few other certifications he thought might make him hire-able (which adds to the financial stress), He is signed up to every premium job hunting website there is and spends his nights applying to anything at this point.

His self-esteem is at an all time low. He will hardly eat or talk to anyone, except me, nowadays about it because he feels he is letting the family down when he has to come home and say he didn't get it time after time.

Does anyone have any advice for how else I can maybe help him or he can help himself. I am really worried he is getting to the point of major depression.

Using a throwaway because I really like the people I work with and have some friends also working there. 

I'm currently a software developer intern at a mid-sized startup (I'm also a third year college student, so this internship is pretty important to me). The company just started accepting interns last year, which seems like it overloaded HR because they missed my starting processes. I was supposed to start end of May, but due to mix-ups in paperwork I was unable to work until the second week of June (losing out on 3 weeks of pay). As a way to make up for it, HR offered to let me extend the internship 3 weeks past the end date (Mid-August). I extended by a week and a half and planned to go back to school immediately after the extension. However, some personal/medical reasons have come up and I want to end the internship when I was originally supposed to end it. Obviously, I want to do this without burning bridges and keeping my possibility of getting references open. I'm planning on addressing it with my manager next week, so I want to make sure I do it in the most professional and respectful way possible. Any advice?

I am currently living in New Hampshire. I do not have a formal lease with my landlord but I have a verbal contract and texts and written PayPal statements regarding the lease, terms, etc. 

At first, it was just going to be me living here for the summer (I'm an intern) and then it became another intern who I worked with last summer. After we agreed to both lease from him, he told us that he would be moving into the downstairs room because it was smaller and gave us the upstairs, which is an open floor loft style living space. 

This next part is all in text: 

He then stated for us to live here, he would need to 1) put hinges on the door and 2) put a carpet down. He said the floor us uneven and we needed the rug so we didn't stub our toes or trip. He said he was planning on doing all of this in the future but because we were coming we needed to pay for this. I said okay, assuming that we could bring our own rug or he would find something cheap. Instead, be bought a single Persian rug from an estate sale and new floor hinges and closures, which he says came to a total of $420. We were unaware that he would do this, especially something that for interns is so expensive. 

He texted me again about it today to finish paying off the balance for the rug and hinges. I assumed (which I will never assume now) that we wouldn't be on the hook for the entire cost of this because these are things that he pick out and bought for his place that he wanted. Granted it was earlier than he says he planned on adding these things but it still seems like we shouldn't be fully responsible.

We are out in two weeks but frankly I feel taken advantage of. Not to mention we have had to take care of his dog, who is the reason I broke my foot. I've been wanting to ask him about homeowners insurance because I don't have insurance and had to pay for the medical cost from his dog out of pocket. I've been nervous to ask and now after having the discussion about the cost of the items, I'm afraid it will seem like I'm asking to get back at him.

I'm an intern from a single parent household and I pay most of my and my moms bills and work full time while going to school full time. I feel exhausted from having to deal with his dog and now this surprise with the extra costs. I've definitely learned my lesson in being very specific and getting everything in writing, I don't need to be told that again. 

My legal question is: Do I have any legal recourse for not paying the entirety of the rugs and hinges? (Because I made the agreement my roommate won't help pay, even thought with the cost of rugs this place was insanely cheap to stay, which I understand why now with the issues it has, like the mold issue.)

If there is legal recourse available, would it be worth it to pursue it? I'm from out of state a fair distance away and if I took this to small claims court, my understanding is that I would have to come back to New Hampshire for anything court related, which for me would he impossible once I'm back at school in three weeks. 

If he found this Reddit post and tried to charge me extra for something or retaliated in anyway, would that be considered illegal?

I've been following this thread for a while now and using all of the tips I've been reading on resumes and cover letters since I graduated 2.5 months ago. I finally landed my first phone interview after getting lots of rejection emails, which is awesome!!!

I've been looking through this subreddit for some updated phone interview tips and I can't seem to find any that seem relevant.

An employer wants to call me about my experience and skills on Monday. I applied to this job because it looked super interesting, but I didn't necessarily meet all the requirements they had listed and that worries me a little bit. I decided that I would experiment with the cover letter because I didn't necessarily qualify and I decided that it would be a miracle if they even reached out to me. I 100% was expecting a rejection email. The job is a Social Media Coordinator for a winery. My cover letter told a story about how I grew a passion for wine after studying abroad and started a wine blog and social media accounts to build my brand. I talked about my position as a social media intern as well, but I actually don't even have that much experience with social media or marketing. I don't have 3 years of social media managing experience, I don't know photoshop, and I do not have a degree in what they are looking for, which is why I am so surprised that I landed this phone interview.

Here is the listing if you're interested: [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1392256853/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1392256853/)

Anyway, I was wondering what kind of questions the interviewer might ask over the phone as well as any tips that would score me an in-person interview with this company. This is basically like a dream job for me and it would be awesome if I could make a great first impression.

Any tips, advice, and constructive criticism are always welcome. Thanks!"

cky5wp,4,2019-08-01,Please help!,Frosty_Profession,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cky5wp/please_help/," Hey all - this will be a long post but please, please read as I have no one to speak to about this/ask for advice and am a first generation college student. 

A little backstory - i’m 22 years old(F). I was severely bullied in high school, honestly for no reason other than I was just weak and an easy target I assume. High school was horrible for me, I ate lunch in the bathroom, cried everyday, all that good stuff. Not going to go into detail but I became suicidal and tried to kill myself twice and failed(I thank god for that). I was a smart kid, AP classes, EC’s, but junior year I just couldn’t take it anymore, I was self harming and was an extremely damaged kid at this point, so I dropped out. 

For more detail - my parents didn’t care, they never went to college, never said “good job” or any slight praising at all for anything I did, but whatever at the end of the day those were just my parents. They weren’t there for me never have, both alcoholics, beat the shit out of each other, both went to jail multiple times. 

I don’t mean to get sappy but it still makes me sad to think of it, all I wanted was a hug or “I’m proud of you."" 

All in all, it was a pretty bad childhood. I know I didn’t have the worst of it, but this is my personal story. Moving on-

I developed severe anxiety and depression so bad that I didn’t leave my house for years, yes you heard that right. Couldn’t go to school(community college) because I just kept having nightmares about what happened to me in high school, even now if I think about it for a while I just get nauseous. 

Again this might seem like i’m going into detail but i’m not, my everyday was hell on earth at home with my parents and my own demons inside my head, I never wanted to not just end it. 

I went to live with my aunt, and years later got the courage to get therapy and release all of my anger. I’m not mad anymore, I’m not sad, I’m okay. For once In my life, I felt- okay. It took a while, but I got here. I got my GED and then started community college, and now I’m on my 2nd year majoring in economics and plan to get into IB(investment banking). I have a 3.9 GPA, all A’s and one B which was from my first college class where I was still extremely nervous. I started a small, and I mean tiny non-profit where I bake cakes/cupcakes/etc for underprivileged kids, homeless shelters, anyone who can’t afford it - I also volunteer there too, It’s been about a year now. I did an internship at a firm(summer), member of the finance club, red cross, and honors society. I’ll begin college apps early next year to transfer, and this is where I need help or just any type of advice. 

I plan to hit all the ivies - except harvard, yale, and stanford. It’s going to be humiliating enough, I don’t want to make it worse. :-) And yes I know the transfer rates for ivies are devastatingly low, but I want to show them that I’m worth it, I’m worth that damn spot. 

Here is the list of colleges I’m applying to ( PS i’m a california resident so did TAG and TAP.)

UCLA, USC,  Berkeley, Cornell(which college?), Carnegie mellon, Dartmouth, NYU(stern or cas?), Columbia, Penn, and I'm gladly taking suggestions. 

I know coming from a community college some of them might assume that I can’t keep up or will not be able to do well. How do I somehow show them in my essays that they shouldn’t doubt me? I know in some essays I might have to explain what I've been doing since high school until now.... which scares me. I did nothing but cry myself to sleep for almost 3 years, do I explain my mental health struggles? That I had the strength to overcome?

\-Sorry I know this is long but I literally have no one to talk to about this. 

Thanks for listening. "

Unfortunately, there is not enough time in the day and I am spreading myself too thin. I am currently a computer science student at a university and all the below learning is supplemental to what I will be learning in college.

I have intermediate experience with python. Right now on my resume under languages I list, Python. Thats it, and I feel I need to show that I have more tools in my tool-belt than Python.

After some market research it looks like JavaScript along with some popular libraries are highly sought after in my area (Raleigh, North Carolina). I also dont know much more than Big O notation when it comes to algorithms so I have been studying algorithms and data structures.

My issue is, I want to learn too many things at once and I need to focus. JavaScript, popular JavaScript packages, SQL, Algorithms and Data Structures. I also want to get some solid LeetCode practice in and some one on one interview practice (my fiance helps me with this).

MY GOAL: To get an internship within the next few months to gain some much needed work experience.

Please help me reach my goal, I want to be as marketable as possible. I dont want to learn a language just to make my resume look good, but I know only having a hammer (Python) in my toolbox makes me look one dimensional. I need more depth.

What learning path would you take? (Prioritize:  JavaScript, popular JavaScript packages, SQL, Algorithms and Data Structures into a priority list for me please, bonus points for JavaScript package or framework suggestions)"
ckzbxc,0,2019-08-02,(Utah/Pennsylvania) Traffic stop uncovered license suspension I didn't know about. Am I screwed?,utshi,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ckzbxc/utahpennsylvania_traffic_stop_uncovered_license/,"I'm an international student living and attending school in Pennsylvania (on an F1 visa). From the beginning of July - mid August, I'm temporarily in Utah for an internship.

Today I got pulled over for failing to signal and the cop told me my license was previously suspended, but he couldn't tell me why. I have only been pulled over once before back in PA and I received a speeding ticket for going 10 over the limit. I haven't been in any other legal trouble here in the US.

The cop cited me for driving on a suspended license and its severity is categorized on the ticket is a misdemeanor (code # is 53-3-227(1)).

So my questions are as follows:

1. Could I possibly spend some time in jail for this?
2. With this on my record, could I be kicked out of the country/does this violate my F1 visa?
3. How do I talk to PA and find out how/why my license is suspended? Like I said, no legal trouble in PA other than the ticket mentioned above.

Thank you."

They don't have any open positions listed on the website, but I have the contact information of the owner of the company. Is it a bad idea to reach out to him and ask if he has any open positions? Do I send an email? Call? Wait until I see him in person? Any thoughts would be appreciated here. 

I understand if they don't have any positions available, I'm just trying to explore new options.

So I'm just looking for some insight here on what I should do and the best way to approach my current job and potential future ones. I'm 18 (and looking to move into an IT career. I graduated high school last year and have been working for a company doing various work for them in Maintenance and IT. I have about 3 years worth of IT experience in this company at a different location (got very fortunate and it's given me alot of good real world experience with light network design). 
Anyways, I'm currently paid for 40 hours a week, even though I work about 50 (im hourly not salary it's a little dumb but also my fault). I feel like my current employer really just doesn't appreciate me or my work even though I've been told by our site director I'm a valuable asset to the company. I've been told by her that she would look into making me a salaried employee starting in the fall (this was 2 months ago, I have followed up multiple times and she doesn't have anything for me yet). I found out last week that she is working with three other people on what I understand to be paid internships, and I'm upset that my case has been given what seems like no attention. I wouldn't mind staying with them but this whole situation is starting to drive me over the edge, as I don't make enough to deal with alot of the things I do and the combination of all of these is really hurting my mental health. So I'm thinking about trying to find another job somewhere. There is a company I feel like I have the qualifications to apply to be a equipment installer, but they don't have any open positions on their website. Is it a bad idea to reach out through email or phone call or something to ask? I only really feel qualified to apply to them as I don't have any real certifications, just experience. 

Sorry If that doesn't make much sense. I really just want the original question answered but if anyone has thoughts on how to handle the rest of this it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much"

cl2bpm,1,2019-08-02,I'm having second thoughts about taking a job or going to university,TheHardChoice,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cl2bpm/im_having_second_thoughts_about_taking_a_job_or/,"Hi Reddit,

I need a second opinion so I thought I should ask you guys of Reddit.

I just finished an Information Technology High School and now I have to choose what I want to do with my future. Some month ago I applied for a job position at a very well known organization (I don't want to specify its name to remain as anonymous as I can).

That's what I want or at least what I think I want. Some time ago I got the good news (or at least I think so), my application got accepted. However, what bothers me is that some relatives and friends don't share my choice, they think that if I start working now I won't continue my studies (I want to go to university after working there for 1 or 2 years because I still have a lot of things to learn).

What if they are right? I think that by going to work there I would learn a lot of new things such as improving my knowledge in English, French, general knowledge things and how companies works (it would be my first real job).

If I went there I would have to move to Switzerland alone. And I'm a little worried about that, not too much but just a little bit. You know I would have to do a lot of things by myself that now my parents do for me. And from where I came from, children usually stay with their parents until they are 25-30 years old.

I think there are other 2 options.

Option B: I can go to a not so great university (that's based on other people opinion, but I don't think it is so bad just not as good as option C, maybe) near me (30 min commute time).

Option C: I can go to a better university (again, based on other people opinion) but further away from me (1h 20m commute time, so about 2h 40m commute total every day). I don't want to chose this option because I think it is too much time to commute every day.

That's a hard choice but I am pretty sure about what to choose (option A, going to work) but what others think makes me have second thoughts. Another good reason for option A (other than that I would learn a lot of things that will be useful in the future) is that I don't like living with my parents.

If think that if I don't take this opportunity I might regret it forever. The only problem is that I don't want to waste 2 years of my life doing things that won't be useful for my future career. The internships I had before (one month and a half in total) were pretty useless and I, in my opinion, I haven't done some meaningful work. I just did boring office work that they didn't want to do... That is what worries me, I want to do something interesting (I really like the IT field and I enjoy doing such things).

I just wanted to hear your thoughts. Sorry for the long post.

Edit: Another thing that is keeping me from not choosing choice A is that I'll do the university with people 2 years younger than me. I think I won't be able to have some good friends, I think I'm losing something there."
cl2ynp,14,2019-08-02,"Econ, Public Policy, or Comp Sci grad school for an undergrad who wants to apply Comp Sci and ML in policy domains?",toadsofbattle,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/cl2ynp/econ_public_policy_or_comp_sci_grad_school_for_an/,"Hi all, any advice would be much appreciated!

I'm an undergraduate who will be graduating from Berkeley soon with a B.A. in computer science, econ honors, and a minor in public policy. I have two primary research interests, and I am not quite sure how to go about pursuing graduate studies in these paths. They seem too specific to fit into programs like an MPP, and the interdisciplinary nature of these interests means that in undergrad, I spread myself too thin and thus have 'weaknesses' in each of my fields of interest.

The first is environmental policy. I ultimately want to look for ways to quantify environmental/ecosystem value and damages and model the effects that proposed policies can have, and feel that computer science and machine learning can be uniquely powerful here.

The second is policy communication. Digital communication is a relatively new medium; I hope that its unique interactivity can be leveraged to bring people closer to important policy issues.

I feel like to do these things well, I need domain knowledge in all 3 of econ, pubpol, and CS. So, what do I do? I feel like my research interests are pretty well defined, they just span a set of disciplines that I'm not sure how to integrate. (long stuff below about WHY I'm confused about what to do, but that's the TL;DR).

As for my confusion about what programs to consider:

I'm considering Econ grad school because my first interest aligns pretty strongly with a resource economics perspective. However, I have doubts because econ seems like it's less concerned with proposing and evaluating tangible policies. On the admissions side, my official math grades suck (a B- in linalg, a B in really basic stats, no multivariable calc, no analysis) but don't at all represent my math skill - I've aced courses for which MVC and linalg were prerequisites, and demonstrated a ton of linalg/probability theory/stats acumen in my machine learning work. However, I'm not sure admissions departments know how math-heavy some of the CS courses I've taken were.

I'm considering a public policy degree because it would allow me to pursue both my first and second research interests. However, I've heard the masters programs in pubpol are very general and not ""research-focused"" like I'm envisioning. Furthermore, on the admissions side, I don't have much to show here aside from my economics/pub pol coursework, one pseudo-research policy paper that won a big prize, and some research assistanceships that led to nothing. My internships were focused on technical work (even if it had a policy/environmental application) so it appears that public service is not my primary interest.

Finally, a CS grad degree would be cool for me to shore up my machine learning/theoretical statistics skills, as well as my digital communications skills. Those I think are necessary technical prerequisites to pursue my research interests, and the better I am at these technical prerequisites, the more effectively I can work in my research interests towards doing some good in the world. But I fear that going this route would pigeonhole me and deprive me of a lot of domain knowledge in the policy/economics space (I have no illusions about being the silicon valley guy who saunters in without domain knowledge, saying ""DISRUPT EVERYTHING MOVE FAST BREAK THINGS"")

In an ideal world, I'm good at all 3 things. But I feel like I can only pick one (and really don't have the energy to send out like, 3x the grad school applications...)... and that's not even considering whether to do phd or masters apps..."

cl4rh7,0,2019-08-02,Don’t color within the lines!,EsotericAmbition,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cl4rh7/dont_color_within_the_lines/,"Hey guys, so I wanted to make a quick post here regarding some of the “low gpa” complaints I’ve seen here. First, those with low gpa’s that are getting screwed by the job market: IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT. The STEM college job search is a totally bullshit system that rewards students who either got high grades at easy schools or just got lucky and took classes with a professor that curves well. That’s even supposing lazy ass HR folks don’t just set up a bot to screen out people. Or of course, there are the cowards that use their “family connections” to get into school and into a job. It’s all just luck and very situational, so don’t blame yourselves.

So, now that we acknowledge the normal application system is total bullshit, how do you get internships? You have to learn REAL, USEFUL SKILLS on your own, NOT the theory crap you learn at school. Knowing high level physics and math is great, but that won’t get you an internship or job. What are useful skills? Programming languages, design, physical circuit work, basically anything that you can actually use to make things.

Next tip, AVOID GATEKEEPERS. What is a gatekeeper? Anybody who likes to talk about how X job is very competitive, or Y gpa/other qualification gives you low chances blah blah. Career “advisors” at your school might fall into this category. This also means some HR people too. These people are either pessimists or narrow minded. Avoid them and don’t pay attention to them. They are trained to turn away those they think aren’t good candidates according to the bs system I pointed out above.

GO STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE. Ask a startup if you can volunteer, ask a professor if you can do research with them, ask a friend if they can work on starting an idea with you. Rinse and repeat until you get in. The most important thing is to START EARLY so by junior or senior year this can develop into a paid internship or other opportunity. 

AVOID ONLINE APPLICATIONS. These are a total waste of time, because the selection for these is so arbitrary and stupid that even if you get accepted you’ll have no idea why, and the overwhelming chance is you’ll be rejected and won’t have learned anything (and HR people usually have a dumbass policy of not saying why they rejected you). Also, online internship/job postings often list like 10 over the top qualifications (that I guarantee very few college students have). Don’t be discouraged by these. One of my friends working at such a company told me that HR people intentionally frame job ads like this to “thin out” the applicant pool. I’ll let you guys pass judgement on how honest that sort of strategy is. Frankly, I think it’s pathetic.

This summer I’m working TWO paid internships (one at a big firm and one at a startup). I have an average gpa at a fairly top school and my inbox is littered with automated rejection emails. My parents, advisors and the internet all told me I couldn’t get an internship unless I had better qualifications. I didn’t listen to them.

I’ll end with this. Anybody who is anybody got where they were by NOT FOLLOWING THE SYSTEM. The way the system is set up, it is designed to screw you over and keep you in mediocrity. Always remember: Don’t color within the lines!"

I received two GTA offers, both of which will be for freshmen-level Physics and CS labs.

* I want to enter academia post-MS (I'm either gonna stay for a PhD or apply to Community College faculty openings), so I feel that getting as much teaching/TAing experience as I can will be extremely beneficial for my career. I can see myself teaching introductory physics/coding classes, so these positions fit perfectly with my career aspirations.   
  
* Both TA positions are lab positions, so I think it wouldn't be as strenuous as if I TA'd for 2 lecture classes (but this may just be a misconception I'm holding)  
  
* I'm currently wrapping up an internship that essentially allowed me to get ~1/3 of my thesis research done, so I feel like I can devote more time to teaching once the semester begins. (Also probably a misconception haha)  
  
* The extra funding doesn't hurt.

This might be a long rant. Trigger warning for a suicide mention.

 I intern at a well known company. It’s not a fortune company by any means, but the name is recognizable. I’ve been having a terrible time ever since I started here. The work is fine, in all honesty. The problem is with the people I work with. 

There's only three people on my team. My manager is in India, so I’ve never talked to him, and my mentor is incredibly cold and rude since the day I met her. I’m am an introvert, so I think that gets on her nerves, but I made a legitimate effort to try and talk to her. It really started going downhill when I asked her how to attach a running process in visual studio (I’ve never done it before and didn’t know anything about it). I looked it up online beforehand, but the suite I was supposed to attach to wasn’t showing up in VS, so I asked. She entered a command in and it showed that I had some compile errors and she started going ballistic, asking if I even know how to code if I can’t even compile. Obviously I know how to compile, but I wasn’t even given the command to compile my code in the first place! I didn’t say anything back to her while she was yelling. In the end, turns out there was a service missing in my computer which wouldn’t let me attach to the process, so what had happened wasn’t even my fault. But by the time we realized this, she had already told half the office that I was an incompetent intern. I cried at my desk that day. I tried to hide my tears, but people definitely noticed. I couldn’t even go to the bathroom to cry in privacy because I was scared of what she was going to say. 

The project I worked on was managed by another member of the team, so I had minimal contact with her after that day. But she was still my assigned mentor, so I had to talk to her for some things. I thought things were getting better after that. I knew that my mentor and another member of the team would constantly talk shit about me to each other and other coworkers as well, but I tried really hard not to let it get to me. But today I overheard my mentor say that she didn’t want to go see my final presentation for my internship, but was forced to by her manager. It hurt me a lot more than I thought it would, which is why I cried another time at this fucking office.

 This summer has been so emotionally tumultuous for me because of this internship. I can’t tell if this situation is because of my behavior or because of my team. I became friends with the other interns (there's four of us total) and they also agreed that my team is a group of bitches, but I still can’t help but feel that this is going to be the same situation no matter where I work. I’m really worried about my future. Working here has made me feel terrible and so incompetent, and at one point I was legitimately considering suicide because both my situations at home and work sucked. I really began to doubt my skills and why I was doing CS in the first place.  Is it because I’m not cut out for this industry? Are most office environments like this? I really want to know if it gets better from here.

TL;DR: I’m having a terrible time at my internship and don’t think I’m cut out for CS"
cl69ly,1,2019-08-02,"Need advice on if I should accept a ""scholarship""",EpicShelter,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cl69ly/need_advice_on_if_i_should_accept_a_scholarship/,"Hello all, sorry if this doesn't fit the sub, I'll delete and post in ApplyingToCollege if it fits better there. Also I'm on mobile so forgive the incoming wall of text. 

First some information. I am a senior in a highly specialized german high school (""Gymnasium"") on the Italian side of the Austro-Italian border.
I am British, but grew up in Italy and therefore speak perfect italian and almost perfect german on top of my first language, English. 

The HS I go to does an extra year, so although I'll be a senior in September I'll only graduate in 2021.
As I said the course is highly specialized, which means I do 17 hours a week of programming, Infosec, sysadmin or electronics and I'm doing well. 


Anyways, thanks to a contact I recently did a 2 week internship at a massive IT company in southwestern Germany some of you might know. Being there I managed to network and have a chat with someone's pretty high up in the company. 

He had read my CV and we talked about my future. He seemed impressed (?) and said that if I wanted to he could get me into one of the work/study arrangements where the company would pay for most/all expenses I would have as a student in exchange for 3 months of work per year (I'm paraphrasing). Plus the company would employ me after university, possibly even as junior developer. 

This arrangement is very attractive obviously, but I find the idea of getting set so early daunting and throws my other plans of studying in Graz/Munich or the UK right out of the window.

My question to you is would I be stupid to decline the offer (which let's be honest is more or less a full scholarship) when it's time just because I don't want to get tied up with the massive corporation?

Thanks for your insight. 

Tl:dr: I'm getting close to the end of HS, was offered something similar to a full scholarship at an internship in a company 6 hours away from home and I don't know if I should accept it or not."

I don't have to fulfill any prerequisites or general education classes so my BS in CS is going to take 2.5 years and I'll be graduating in December 2021. As such, I only have two summers during which I would be able to get internships and I think it's important that I do whatever necessary to get internships both of those summers.


I understand internships after your freshman year are hard to come by. Should I even advertise myself as a freshman? Yes, it's my first year in the program but I think I could get away with saying I'm a sophomore as I'm 2.5 years from graduation. What are your thoughts on this?


Second, my CS degree is going to be from a no name state school because the good colleges in my state don't allow second bachelor students. My first degree, however, is from a very reputable public university. Should I leave this on my resume and applications for name recognition even though the degree is unrelated or should I only put it on if it's somehow relevant to the position or company?


Should I plan to finish my degree in 2.5 years or should I instead plan for 3 years because the spring hiring opportunities will be better than winter hiring opportunities? This would also allow me to take a couple of computer engineering classes I might be interested in.


Finally, does me already having a degree perhaps give me a leg up as I'm a college graduate with a year of professional work experience or does it somehow hurt me?


Thank you in advance for your advice!"

cl9e4b,1,2019-08-02,Is this job making me travel too much? Please give me some advice!,Ab-Eb-Bb-C-Eb-G-C,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/cl9e4b/is_this_job_making_me_travel_too_much_please_give/,"Hey everyone, thanks in advance for giving this a read and giving me your inputs

A little background at first: I just graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a certificate in Public and Professional Writing. I didn't do famously well, but I managed to have a GPA a little above a 3.0 and internship experience all while working through mental health issues, working two jobs, etc. 

Fortunately, I was able to find a job immediately after graduating which I graciously accepted. It's an automation and validation company in the Philadelphia area, and I'm currently nearing the ending of my informal training period. We work a lot with Rockwell software, PLCs, that sort of stuff. I like the coding aspect of the work, and I like the clients that the company typically works with (lots of pharma which was my main focus in the first place). Throughout the training, the job has been going rather well! The pay isn't bad, 67.5k per year paid monthly, but I feel like I'm slightly underpaid for the area. I get that though since I only just graduated. I feel as if I've picked up on the material rather well, and I got selected for a project rather quickly working under a current engineer! This is where the real pro/con debate comes in.

Pros of the situation: I'm going to be taking on a lot of responsibility, and there's an expectation for me to grow into the role. I feel as if this will be a great chance to work with a pharmaceutical client, learn about their processes and pipelines, and really develop both professionally and within my company. The role is one where we have an ongoing contract with them, and if they need anything like a fermentor reconfigured or something fixed, I'd be the person to talk to. Like I said, lots of responsibility, but lots of really great opportunities as well. 

The cons (and really the point of the post): It's in Maryland. About 3 hours away from my apartment and my home office. I get compensated for hotel, mileage, food, etc., but I'm also going to be expected to be there from Monday morning to Thursday around noon consistently. I would get paid for driving home in the afternoon. 

When I interviewed with this company, I was told that there would be a traveling component to it, but it certainly was not impressed upon me that it'd be quite like this. Additionally, when I formally applied to the position, the job description said it would be about 40% traveling. In my head, this sounds like it'd be a Monday-Tuesday type situation, or maybe even a Monday-Wednesday afternoon type situation. I could live with this! Go down, help fix somethings, stay in a nice hotel for a night or two sometimes, and then head back home to keep working on stuff at the office for the rest of the week. Am I getting paid to little for this much traveling?

But Monday-Thursday...consistently? Am I wrong to feel like that's a bit of a higher tier when it comes to traveling?  

I've engineered my life to be in the Philly area for a lot of personal reasons. I have family connections to the area, I have a personal connection to the area, my fiancee and I signed a lease to live here under the assumption that I'd only be away from home a little bit. Now to find out that I'll be gone for more than half of the week...it's taking a bit of a toll on my mentality. It's hard to be involved in social/personal hobbies when I'm stuck in a hotel room most nights. I've done the trip once this past week, and it feels like you're still at work even when you're not because you aren't at home where you feel the most comfortable. Forget about work-life balance, or spending time with family/people I love. I've tried speaking to the person above me about this, but he keeps dancing around the bush about how much time I'd be traveling. That being said, the hotel staff knows him by name, and there was someone in my position before I started who left after only two weeks, neither of which are good signs in my opinion.


At the end of the day, I'm really just looking for some sort of advice from anyone that has been in a similar situation as mine. Do you think this the type of situation where I should just grit my teeth and bare it for the time being? Did my company essentially do a bait and switch on me (which is my feeling considering I didn't even get asked if this project was something I wanted to work on)? Does travelling get any better? Should I keep my eye out for another job somewhere else? And if so, how do I explain that I left my first job after only about 2 months of working?

Thanks in advance for any advice everyone, I'm really in a weird spot and I'm not sure where to go from here!

TL;DR: Just got my first job, and they told me 40% travel max. Turns out to be closer to 70/80%, and I have no idea if I should keep it or get out while I can. Advice?

Edit 1: I just realized that it would be helpful to mention that not everyone in the company travels this much. I've seen plenty of people that have been there for some time at the office every day Monday through Friday because they are working with clients in the local area. I really had no idea I'd be traveling this much until I just got chosen for this project."

I started to apply for internships in March 2019 to startups and big companies and got interview opportunities from startups like **SocialCops** (now, Atlan), which is a great startup based out of India. But, in the final interview for an Backend Engineering Summer Internship (May'19 - July'19), I fucked up by saying that I was new to Golang and find it a bit difficult. I was rejected. 

Then I applied for a lot of companies on Glassdoor, LinkedIn, etc, but never got calls. In June, I applied for Software Engineering Intern 2019 at Bloomberg. I was shortlisted for phone interview and it was a technical interview. It was based on Algorithms, but I couldn't crack it, because I wasn't prepared enough for it.

I have received so many rejections already (here, I'm not even counting the interview rejections), it's just that I feel I'm not skilled enough. Also, I have nothing to mention in my CV except for the open source contributions and my own personal projects I made.

Things get very bad when I go to fill a form and there is a mandatory ""present company"" field. I fill a space and move on, and it hurts doing that.

But, since I have an year, and in my university, we have an open 8th semester, where you can go for an industry experience (a 6 month internship from Jan - June). Given with the rejections and my CV (which has nothing worth mentioning imo), I feel really depressed if I'd ever be able to land up an internship, let alone a job. **Also, is it too late to apply for January internships?**

Can someone please show me a way out of this, and guide me in building a career.

  
PS: I'm attaching my resume in case anyone wants to have a look at it, and want to present an opinion/suggestion on it.

clapdq,997,2019-08-02,A new grad's perspective on the experiences of women in engineering,MissBrightside13,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/clapdq/a_new_grads_perspective_on_the_experiences_of/,"Hey /r/engineeringstudents! This past spring, I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Aside from four years in class, I also have two years of experience in the industry through co-ops and internships. During these experiences, I was treated just like a real engineer would be, and often worked on teams alongside my older coworkers. I also had a few opportunities to manage my own projects, which I loved doing. I worked at three different companies: a huge defense lab, a small aerospace company, and a small materials handling company. At the time I was hired at each of the companies, I was the only woman working in my department.

Going into my degree, I knew it would be hard, because engineering is hard! However, I didn’t expect that my gender would make it worse. At my university, my class was made up of around 10% women, which is fairly consistent with the field as a whole. According to the [Society of Women Engineers](https://alltogether.swe.org/2018/09/swe-research-update-women-in-engineering-by-the-numbers/), over 32% of women switch out of STEM degree programs in college, while only 30% of women who earn bachelor’s degrees in engineering are still working in engineering twenty years later (of those women, 30% of women who have left the engineering profession cite organizational climate as the reason). And in the workforce, 61% of women engineers report that they have to prove themselves repeatedly to get the same level of respect and recognition as their colleagues!

Okay, I’m done throwing statistics at you now. Often, I felt that my colleagues (classmates, co-workers, anyone) didn’t respect me because they thought that current trends in the industry (affirmative action towards women, women-only STEM scholarships) made it easier for women to “make it” in the field. Actually, I didn’t just “feel” that way – multiple people have told me that outright. Throughout the past few years, I’ve spent a lot more time feeling crappy because of things that people have said about my gender than actually benefitting from my gender. A lot of people don’t believe that it’s as bad as it is. Over the past few months, I’ve put together this list of my negative experiences in engineering that happened due to my gender.

* Being told that I only got my internship because I'm a girl. Repeat with every possible scenario; for example, a guy I dated told me I only got my scholarships because I'm a girl.
* To go along with this, when a family member and my *female* doctor heard I was majoring in engineering, they both said ""oh, that's great. It must be much easier because you're a girl."" This happens a lot.
* Being sexually assaulted at my first internship.
* Someone at work assumed that I was the secretary despite the fact that I was sitting in the middle of a room containing only engineers.
* While I was at my co-op, going into my senior year of mechanical engineering, a male coworker, totally unprompted, decided to explain the basic concept of torque to me.
* People brush off my idea but then gush over it when a male student repeats it later.
* A guy at my co-op would ask me a question, apparently doubt my answer, then ask the exact same question to any guy who worked with us, who would give him the exact same answer I did. This happened like 5 times in 10 minutes once.
* Actually having to have a male co-worker escort me to certain parts of the building because the person who works there ""treats women badly.""
* I've been asked, ""ooh, what did you do to get an A in *that* class?"" Implying: I flirted (or worse) with the professor. Also, male classmates joke that they should have worn a skirt/dress to an exam or start identifying as female in order to get better grades.
* Always being assigned the ""note-taker"" role in group projects because ""you probably have the best handwriting."" As I've progressed in my degree, this has also turned into my male lab partner assigning me all of the writing and organization duties for a lab report while he does the coding and technical work.
* Relatedly, people in group projects trying to flirt with me a lot of the time.
* If I am with a male coworker and I am talking to another man, they address and maintain eye contact with the man I am with. Even if I'm the one that asked the question, even if I'm the one with the knowledge to answer the question, even if I'm the one *managing the project* that they have a question about.
* I started dating one of the guys in my class at the beginning of my sophomore year, and when we started dating, other students insinuated that I was just fucking him in exchange for homework answers. That hurt.

Now, back to my point about the perceived unfair advantage towards women. I can share my experience: I received $75,000 in scholarships for my undergraduate degree (free tuition + room). $750 of that was a scholarship for women in STEM, and the rest of it was merit-based scholarships unrelated to my gender. That’s 1% of my total scholarships resulting from being a female. I would gladly, GLADLY, give those $750 back in order to undo all of the things I’ve listed above. I’d guess that most men would not want to deal with those things to receive an extra $750. If you asked most of my classmates about me, I don’t think they would guess that I’ve had most of these experiences. I think I usually hide it well, which makes it even tougher for me when I hear people be dismissive of anyone’s experiences. If you’re reading this, if there’s anything you got out of this, I hope it’s that you never know what’s really going on in someone’s life, and you should always think twice before judging someone. If you’re a woman in engineering reading this, I want to hear your thoughts (ok I would love to hear anybody’s thoughts, but you know what I mean)! Have you experienced similar roadblocks? How have you risen above them? I love engineering and hope to stay in the field, but as statistics and my experiences have shown, there’s a reason why 70% of women don’t make it to their 20-year work anniversary."

I have an uncle who is kind of distant, but very nice to me. He works in a very big company. He is starting a marketing project , where they will modernize the website, and open social media for this company (it's a big company, but its very outdated with new technologies). They hired a Marketing Consultant who will set up a team. 

I am a Junior Front End Developer. I work with other stuff, but I wanted to make this my primary work. I started to learn for myself some months ago, but never got a true internship or entry level job. I love working with technology,marketing, coding, design, everything about this project. 

My uncle offered to give my curriculum to this marketing consultant, so the guy could maybe give me an interview so I could work for him. The thing is, I dropped out of college to try to make a living, worked many dead-end jobs, and I basically have nothing to show besides some code and websites that are really simple. I was wondering if maybe, I could ask for an assistant position, or even an internship. I could help managing Social Media and help the design team, or a Front End assistant position. I made a design for the website myself, and I could truly help to complete the website with them. 

My question is, what do I say? Im supposed to send my uncle( a cellphone message, he doesn't want email) my curriculum and some explanation of my work and what I want, and he will show to the guy(my uncle has no idea what this stuff is). I don't know what to write, because I never had to do this before. I need to impress the guy, but he must know I'm entry level, because I can't accept a position where I can't really do the work. Should I ask for the guy's number? 

If it helps, I have junior experience in HTML,CSS and some Javascript, but I was also interested in the managing of their social medias , which would be a more comfortable job before I can truly work alone with coding.

Thank you! :)"

I have my BS in Comp Sci, I'm 11 months into unemployment. I left my past employer because I was on a two person dev team and my original mentor left (and his replacement wasn't fit to be a mentor) &amp; I also had another opportunity I wanted to try while I'm still young and can afford to try out other things in life. 

As of 4 months ago, I've been trying to get back into the field. I've become more self aware, I love coding, I'm reading 'the art of unit testing' and 'clean code' and loving them, I'm working on an open source project I made but with every encounter in job hunting I feel like I'm becoming more and more sour.

From getting ghosted from an acquaintance who was going to give me an internal referral, to doing poorly on technical phone interview, to getting ghosted from positive phone interviews, to a recruiter trying to negotiate salary in the FIRST phone screen (even though they posted a pay range on the job post they tried to negotiate me down saying 'based on your experience, because of your job gap,' etc). 

I'm getting worn out mentally and I'm not even close to getting an offer. 

1. How do you guys stay positive during job hunting?

2. What should I say to explain my job gap? (thus far I've been truthful about it but idk if its been hurting my chances)

I'll also take any advice anyone may have!

cldrrp,1,2019-08-02,How do I salvage a friendship with a missed opportunity?,josie_96,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/cldrrp/how_do_i_salvage_a_friendship_with_a_missed/,"I've been an intern at this company for 7 months now (only one month left) and, in that time, we've had 3 different classes of interns coming in and out. Today, we had an ""intern event"" as a lot of people are ending their internship next week. I'm one of the few who's been here since January, so it was my first time seeing most of the students there.

One of them who just started two weeks ago started talking to me while we were in line to get our food and he was really cute. We only talked a little bit, but I feel like I've learned a lot about him in those few minutes. 

I was ahead of him in the line and so I finished grabbing my food before him. Being my awkward self, I hesitated to say something since he was still prepping his plate and not really paying attention to me, so I just left and went back to my seat without saying anything to him. Stupid, I know.

I ran into him after while the event was still going on but he pretty much ignored me then, so I don't know if he's pissed because he thinks I ditched him or if he just doesn't give two shits about me either way.

I don't think I realized how much I enjoyed talking to him until after the fact because now I can't stop thinking about him. I couldn't remember his name, but I was able to find him on Slack based on the info he'd given me.

We work in completely different departments in different buildings (across the street). I don't think there will be any other intern activity within the next month, so I will likely never see him again. And I'm pretty sure he's forgotten all about me already. But I still feel like I want to try and befriend him.

Is there a **non-creepy** way I could reach out to him to restart the conversation?

Some things I know about him:

* Where he's from

* Where he goes to school

* Lives on campus

* Where he did his last internship

* He transitioned from business to CS

* He's a senior

I was trying to think of something he told me about that I could expand on and maybe Slack him about and say something like:

&gt; Hey, we talked earlier today while waiting in line for the food at the intern event, remember? I just wanted to ask you about......

Can anything be done here?"

After I realized I wasn't being fired, I actually laughed a little because I thought he was joking, but apparently he wasn't because he just looked at me.

I feel absolutely not prepared yet; I've only been an intern for the summer, and I feel like I'm barely useful. I've moved along a few tickets and fixed two bugs, but at such a slow pace. I have definitely taken up more engineer time in training and asking questions than I have saved in the work I have done.

My bachelors was also not in CS (it was scientific, and my company is also scientific but what I do day to day is not). I'm working on a full-time Master's degree in CS now that I will be finishing soon, but I know they're not valuable and I only did it so that I could switch fields. I have good grades, but I feel like the school assignments are just cute compared to the scope of the problems the engineers deal with. The codebase at my work is enormous, and most of them have been programming for 5-20 years and I have nowhere near that kind of experience. Someone close to me said he thinks I got the internship as a diversity hire because I'm female, and that is in the back of my mind now as well.

I'm worried I don't know as much as they think I do and that will quickly become evident when I don't have the excuse of being an intern. I absolutely love the company and want to stay on, but I think their expectations of my knowledge are inaccurate. Today I literally spent an hour trying to figure out why two strings were not equivalent until I realized one of the letters was capitalized. How on earth do they think I'm qualified for this?"

I owe a great deal of where I am today to my incredible computer science teacher, whom I have had for several years. In addition to providing me with endless encouragement and inspiration, she introduced me to an opportunity that has opened doors for me that I didn't even know existed. 

The award is called Aspirations in Computing and it is given by the National Center for Women and Information Technology. It is designed to recognize and encourage high school girls (9th-12th grade) with an interest in technology and who see computing in their future in some way. It is awarded at a lot of different levels, from National Winner (top \~40 in the nation out of 4000+ applicants) to ""Rising Star"" (those who are newer to technology but show a lot of interest and promise). The application consists of a few short answer prompts and a short recommendation from a CS teacher, robotics coach, or someone in a similar role. It typically opens in September and is due in November.

When my teacher first told me about it, I didn't plan on applying. While I did some techie stuff outside of class, I certainly wouldn't have considered myself a ""tech person"" and I tend to shy away from ""Women in Tech"" stuff for whatever reason. However, I did eventually turn in the application and I am SO glad that I did. Winners at all levels are invited into an exclusive online community where members post all kinds of opportunities, network with others, give and seek advice, offer to give professional referrals and just generally support each other. I literally found a tech internship as a HIGH SCHOOLER through this group, which has been a phenomenal experience and has led to a myriad of other opportunities itself. I also found out about a really cool tech competition that I'll be entering in a few weeks. We also have a really great tradition where recent HS grads will help current seniors with their college applications each year. 

In addition to the award itself and the online community, there are also some college scholarships specifically for winners. We can also apply for funding to run tech outreach programs in our communities. 

TL;DR There's a really awesome award that your female students (at all levels of technical experience) should apply for. Please pass the opportunity along to them and continue to encourage them in their journey. You can find out more at [aspirations.org](https://aspirations.org) 

Thank you for reading and for inspiring your students every day! If you have any questions, please feel free to comment below or send me a private message.

It would be a nice opportunity to test the waters for power sector and pad my resume, but I’m worried employers will see it in future and wonder what CS skills I have (am working on side projects/design teams to improve this). 

Do you think I’m overestimating how much emphasis recruiters will put on this? Also is it worth it despite me not wanting to commit to the field in long run (prefer cs/dev roles).

Once I was given more responsibility my colleagues became cold and at first I thought it was just because of higher expectations but it came to the point that I can’t enjoy my weekend at all because even on Friday I am worried about how bad it will be on Monday. 

I have one manager who is quite old fashioned and he believes that you should never talk back and always just do, which is fine, I learned to be quiet and just say okay. But there is this other manager who has told others repeatedly that he wants my responsibilities. He once screamed at me behind closed doors but I told my boss about it and he told me it’s happened before to the previous person in my position and to let him know if it ever happens again. Since then the manager has been much more careful always testing me by asking me things by email and always copying my direct manager(the old fashioned one), trying to find ways to trip me up. I’ll ask him about things and he’ll tell me and then when I bring those things up again he pretends we never had that conversation( it’s my fault I don’t email him too to have proof). He even has the nerve to sometimes ask if I’m okay with him... I once told him I don’t appreciate the way he talks to me and he told me that I have been given responsibility because they believe I can succeed and this is the learning curve and he’s just trying to teach me....

I only have a couple of months left of my internship but when I first got here I loved the job, now I am miserable thinking what new fresh hell awaits me everyday. This jealous manager has made my life hell and I can’t bring anything up to my new boss because he says that the jealous manager is just sensitive and that I take things personally, which baffles my mind. My question is how do I avoid these kinds of situation next time around? I am starting to feel that the only ones who succeed in professional life are the cut-throat bullies who don’t care who they step on to move forward. I am starting to feel like I am a failure."

It was a great experience and I learnt a lot about the real world. This will prolly be my essay story.

Outreach:
Taught 2  students that failed science. Got them to not only pass, but top the class!

Built a Virtual Reality game that helps ppl do physiotherapy at home at a low cost and went out and got ppl to use it for extended periods of time. Great success! Learnt coding VR apps through this process.

Built a Robotics arcade game that helps teach english to students diagnosed with dyslexic and went out and got ppl to use it for extended periods of times. PATENT pending on this. 

Built a computer programming talent search website to find and help talent across india.
When I went out to teach the underprivileged programming, At first I thought they were really bad at coding. After week of teaching they would use the for loop for a decision making statement(instead of if). After a period of analysing their mistakes, I realised that they were having a really hard time with syntax than they were with logic! They were having a tough time with big huge English words, as that wasn’t their native Lang. That was great. I decided to come up with a Java layer, with special syntax which allowed these students to write code in Hindi and then my program would convert that to java and run the code. If  ==  ugger, etc. BOOM! Several could code now! I also created an image processing app to allow children to draw a flow chart on paper and then convert it to code by clicking a picture of it. This allowed 10 kids to share one PC! 

Stanford/Harvard/MIT - 30/40 percent chance

Ivy League - 40-45 percent chance 

Other t20s - 60/70% chance

I know that the SAT range for these schools is usually somewhere in the 1400-1600 zone, but taking all my other stats into account, how much does my SAT score need to be?"
clhuu7,1,2019-08-03,Software engineer position,al95eng,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/clhuu7/software_engineer_position/,"I'm an engineering and physics double major, finishing off my honours thesis in a few weeks, it's a project with Python, doing high-level synthesis on FGPAs. I used Python extensively in my physics classes, and did a stellar modelling project with it. I'm also comfortable with C/C++, which I learned myself, and then used during an internship, working with microcontrollers. Recently I applied for a software engineer position, for which python scripting is mandatory, and C/C++ is highly regarded. It's for applicants with 0-3 years' experience. It was via an agency, and I spoke over the phone with them. They told me the position will pay a salary around 65-70k, but they might be willing to hire someone with less experience, provided they have the necessary skills knowledge, and save a little money. Should I tell them that I'd be happy to work for 50-55k? These figures are in Australian dollars, btw.

Also, a potentially weird/embarrassing question, but generally what age are ""junior"" devs? I'm going on 24 at the end of the year. I should have finished my 5-year degree 7 months ago, but I had to take a break due to some personal issues. I have a feeling that ""junior"" devs are all around 21/22, straight out of uni/college, and I feel a bit self-conscious about this, feeling like I'm behind. Sorry if this sounds weird."
cliihs,20,2019-08-03,"Profile Review - 29M, 730 GMAT, STEM Masters, Data Scientist. Unclear if MBA makes sense?",[deleted],MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/cliihs/profile_review_29m_730_gmat_stem_masters_data/,"Hello all,

This community has been super helpful as I work through the pros/cons of potentially pursuing an MBA. Some information about myself @ time of application:

Background

Work experience: F50 internship in undergrad. 1.75 years of general technology consulting @ regional firm, 4.5 years @ boutique data science consultancy (sub-contractor for big firms like McK, Guidehouse, etc.) Solid promotion track record at all firms (won internship award, made senior analyst in a year at tech consultancy, two promotions at data science firm).
Extra curriculars: 4 years on board of local nonprofit with interesting mission &amp; close personal connection, competitive cyclist on racing team.
Undergrad school/major: top 10 b-school
Other education/coursework: top 20 masters in statistics (pursued part-time on top of normal job).
Race/nationality: white
Sex: male

Stats

GMAT Score: 730 (45Q, 46V) — could probably get up to around 750 with more study, debating if it’s worth it.
Undergrad GPA: 3.66
Grad GPA: 3.80

MBA Info

Goal of MBA: Aid in transition from individual contributor to management track. Interested in Analytics/SCM/OPs roles in LDPs at F500s or product management roles in tech/CPG. NOT interested in consulting (despite having lots of client-facing experience, I have done and do not like the 100% travel lifestyle).
Target schools: Sloan, Kellogg, Booth, Ross (likely Tauber), Fuqua, Tepper.

Other thoughts

I would really like to settle down in Atlanta or Chicago post-MBA (family reasons). I currently make a good wage as a lead data scientist, though am not sure I can see myself writing code the rest of my life. 

I think I could make the transition into management in an analytics org given my existing experience and masters degree, though the idea of going back to learn/network with peers in a new city seems fun + I think a top 10 MBA might give my career a prestige bump at some larger orgs.

Currently, I think I’m an edge candidate at Sloan/booth/Kellogg, and I think I might be able to receive scholarship money at either Ross, Fuqua, or Tepper. I like Ross in particular for the Tauber institute, and Fuqua for the proximity/connections to Atlanta (my wife’s preferred destination, and I like the idea of Duke athletics). The fact that I am married and not interested in consulting also makes the idea of minimizing debt more appealing.

My biggest concerns about the MBA are the a) the financial implications (i.e. money not spent on a down payment or on starting my own business), and b) if I even need it (i.e. I already make ~$120k in a low COL city, already have a masters)

My overall questions:
1) am I considering the right schools for the right reasons?
2) am I being naive for assuming that I can get $$$ at Ross, Fuqua, Tepper?
3) given my background and goals, is pursuing an MBA even worth it?

Any and all feedback is appreciated!"

cljjt5,16,2019-08-03,What is the least painful way to concentrate in CS at Harvard?,crharvard,Harvard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/cljjt5/what_is_the_least_painful_way_to_concentrate_in/,"Hello everyone. I'm a rising sophomore who wants to concentrate in CS. I had never programmed before coming to college. This past year, I took CS 50, 51, and Math 23a and 23c. My grades turned out well, but I had a rough time adjusting to the workload and had a pretty miserable experience freshman year because of that.

I want to be a software engineer (or data scientist/industry research). I'm doing a full stack software engineering internship this summer, and I'm loving it. I build pretty extensive projects in my spare time, especially in an effort to learn new technologies. But I want to enjoy my college experience and have more time for socializing or creative interests instead of sitting at my computer every waking hour.

I know CS will never be easy, but what's the easiest way to do it? Traditionally taken CS classes I'm worried about:

1. CS 61. I hear terrible things about 61's workload, but it seems like such a useful class to understand how computers really work under the hood. I'm more interested in front end work though, but it would be cool stuff to learn. Worth it?
2. CS 124. I really want to avoid 124 because every upperclassmen I know who took it had an awful time. My blockmate who took it barely slept last semester, and I was honestly quite worried about their health. I already know DS&amp;A decently well, as I've been following Stanford's Coursera lectures, and I leetcode all the time. I kinda wanna take MIT 6.006 but I know Harvard CS doesn't allow for that. Is there any good way around this, like if I took AM 107 to satisfy theory #2 and took 6.006 for myself?
3. CS 121. This depresses me, because I've always wanted to learn computational theory. But the comments on Q guide are terrible, and I've heard that the class doesn't cover material traditionally taught in most theory courses. This one is a formal requirement, so no getting around that, but I hear some people do the Applied Math with focus in CS concentration to get around 121. Worth it?
4. CS 181. Why are the comments so bad on Q guide??? Should I take MIT 6.036 instead?
5. CS 150s and 160s. These classes all seem very appealing, with the exception of 161. Are any of them worth the time? I really like the sound of CS 165 (Data Systems). Does anyone have experience with MIT's versions of these courses?

I hope it doesn't seem like I'm just whining about everything. I really do like this field, but I don't want to continue being depressed throughout college. And I know my list is long, so feel free to just respond to whatever you have time for. Thank you."
cljosf,2,2019-08-03,Career Advice for a pharmacy tech looking for a change,Ill_Savant,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cljosf/career_advice_for_a_pharmacy_tech_looking_for_a/,"Hi all. I have spent about 13 years in the pharmacy tech trade. In that time I have worked in retail and hospital settings. I have always had lead/leadership roles in all the jobs I have taken on but the issues I keep running into go something like this: I am selected to spearhead/ start PI projects which I excel at, but there is no room for growth. I tried exploring other hospital systems on the side to see if maybe it was the place I worked for, but it appears people recognize my skill set but don't want to help me advance no matter how hard I work. At one point I was juggling my daily duties as well as spear heading 2 other department changing projects, only to be replaced by a Pharmacist once I finished all the heavy lifting. People have often told me to go back to pharmacy school. But I feel like with my background of working with nursing, doctors, and within pharmacy, I want to work on fixing infrastructure. I was wondering if Project Management would be the way to go. I am often credited as the best trainer in my department, and many of our guides (One of the projects was to streamline training programs) I have created. I have a passion for getting people all on the same level, and giving them a good person to model their work ethic on (I deal with a-lot of interns who this may be their first job). I have helped turn around the worst satellites in our department and have been heavily recruited by people who have worked with me and moved on to other institutions. The problem is, they will pretty much just recruit me to keep me in the same spot without a chance to grow. I realize it is partially an issue of my own lack of degrees and while I have a Pharmacy Tech License, I don't have any other certs that are applicable on paper. I usually just powered through with my hard work,  experience and know how. While I have been recognized with awards, everybody around me that is a pharmacist or manager even techs and interns have either been awarded or promoted around me as a result of my help. I am burnt out, depressed, and not really sure which direction to go in. I don't want to go to school with no direction and I want to try to find a job or work towards something where my unique ability to fix problems, lead people with not just my expertise, but also my own hard work (I never ask people to do things that I wont or cant do myself) would allow advancement or promotion to better pay and not living check to check. I really would appreciate any advice you can give me. I don't mind going back to school or taking Cert courses, but at 36, I feel like it is getting harder and harder not to lose hope on finding something better. Thanks hope this wasn't too verbose. Thank you again! :)"

cllyfd,2,2019-08-03,Child custody battle,pitpatdog,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cllyfd/child_custody_battle/,"Hi everyone,

I would like to first note that the situation that I am about to introduce is not my own, but one of my friend's. I wanted to first see what kind of insights others had before moving forward. Please, if I'm in the wrong subreddit, I will gladly move it.

Secondly, I want to make this remark since this will be important later on: Girl is raised as a Roman Catholic, and Boy is raised as a Muslim. **Boy and Girl are NOT married.**

My friend, let's call her Girl, came to the US last year via a student visa. Girl did an internship in her field out in the east coast and met Boy. Girl and Boy ended having a child together. Boy is a permanent resident, and Girl (on a student visa which later became extended visa) gave birth in the US making the child a US citizen regardless. Girl finished her internship in April 2019 and moved in with Boy along with their child.

FAST FORWARD TO TODAY (08/03/19).

I talked to Girl today. Girl said she wants to go back to her own country **with the baby**, but Boy does not allow this. Boy threated Girl that if she wants to take the baby with her, they will have to go to court for child custody. Boy said **he will win** because **he has money, he's a US permanent resident and Girl is only on a visa.** Girl also told me that **she is not allowed to be outside holding the baby or to go outside by herself WITHOUT BOY.** His reasoning for this is because ***they are Muslim***, but we live in the US which means the Sharia law is not enforced, legally. I asked Girl if Boy was/is abusive in any form, she said no. I asked her more if Boy ever hit her, she said they got into a fight over cell phone and Girl slapped Boy then Boy slapped Girl back. The cell phone fight happened because Girl was contacting her parents and telling them that she wants to come home with the baby and she needs money to do so. Boy wanted to see what Girl was saying/telling her parents but Girl didn't want to give the phone to Boy. Boy still ended up taking the phone away and **deliberately breaks it**. Girl told me this happened approx. two weeks ago, and Boy has yet to get her a new phone. Girl uses Boy's laptop in order to talk to her family. Girl also wants to contact local authorities (lawyers, child services, etc.), but she can't since she **cannot go outside by herself**, and she has no money to go anywhere if she tried. When I was talking to her on the phone today, Boy came home and Girl **had to hang up.**

FLASHBACK TO THE PAST.

Girl and I have known each other since we were in first grade, we both went to the same school in our home country before I migrated to the US. Now, when I found out that Girl was in the US, I wanted to visit her. I was out on the east coast last winter, Girl and I made plans to see each other. Girl told Boy that I was coming, and Boy **deliberately** came up with some plans in order for me not to see Girl. Girl told me that Boy admitted that he did not want me to visit her. His defense was Girl doesn't know me anymore, that I'm not the same person anymore. Boy feared something may have happened.

MAIN POINT.

**Please**. **Girl is asking for help--FROM ANYONE.** My main point here is, Girl wants to come back to her country with the baby, but Boy doesn't allow this. Girl is detached from the outside world with Boy's strict rules of she cannot be outside unless he's with her. **BOY IS CLEARLY A CONTROL FREAK AND ABUSIVE, NOT PHYSICALLY, YET.** I spoke to others and they said to contact the police, but I feel as if the police will do little to no good. I also feel that if the police fail to get Girl her child out of Boy's house, the situation will only get worse.

Bot said to include location. I currently reside in the CO. Boy and Girl are in ME.

I appreciate anyone's help. Feel free to message for any insights. Thank you."
clm4o7,22,2019-08-03,"I have received a job offer as a Data Analytics Manager with a 2.2x salary increase, but I exaggerated my CV and I think I am underqualified. Do I accept the job offer?",MangosAreMyWeakness,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/clm4o7/i_have_received_a_job_offer_as_a_data_analytics/,"Hi Everyone,

Long message ahead so apologies in advance!

As the title states - I have received a job offer with a 2.2x salary increase, but I exaggerated my CV and I think I am underqualified. The position is as a Data Analytics Manager. I live in London, UK and the position is also in London UK.

I am currently working as Analytics consultant for one of Europe’s largest IT consultancies. I have been employed there since September 2017 – so nearly 2 years now.

Before this I was working at another very well-known and large IT consultancy from September 2016 to September 2017 (1 year). Before this, I worked in a very large Healthcare company as a data analyst for 8 months as an intern.

In total, I have about 3 years’ experience (excluding my 8 months internship), but I have managed to land a Data Analytics Manager role. The pay rise is monumental, however I included some things in my CV which I have little experience with.

Firstly, the role requires very good SQL, and admittedly whilst I have used it at work (infrequently), the level they require is beyond what I know. Whilst my SQL was tested in the hiring process with questions (such as difference between WHERE and HAVING) and a SQL exercise (creating a table and using the aggregate function to add a few columns), the SQL in the role will complex. In fact, I have self-taught myself SQL from Udemy and apply it infrequently at work, and I feel its coincidental the aspects I was tested on appeared as a test during the interview process.

The job also requires Tableau experience (which I have,- and my basic skills were tested at the interview) but they also want advanced level tableau.

This is just one part of the role I may be unfamiliar with. Other parts of the role are end to end management of analytics initiatives to Demonstrating experience in managing system integration, API’s and data warehouse projects. I really don’t have much experience in this at all, and neither was I asked about my experience in this during the interview process – although it was mentioned in the job spec as being “essential” to have.

I have about 3.5 months until the role begins, and I have yet to accept the offer.

The primary reason I believe I got the job offer, and this was also communicated in my feedback – is that I am very good at communicating. Another positive which was really well received is that I was told to present some findings on a PowerPoint based on some data I had received from the company during my final interview. The company said my presentation and data visitation used in the presentation was “Amazing”. 

Yet I feel that if I really got tested on the nitty and gritty tech side of the role, I would not do well at all.

Another key point is that whilst the role is a “Manager” position, I will be working independently. This is because the company is headquartered in Australia and the London business is relatively small. So I will be the only “Analytics” person in London. Although apparently there is a contractor who is also very good at the analytics side, and who I can reach out to for help. Nonetheless, the lack of support and the push on self-learning may be difficult considering my current skill set. Also, I was told that I would also have to hire Analysts in my team within a few months of joining, and who will be working under me. I have no experience of leading a team! Although they know this and are willing to help out with this.

It would be great to get advice on what I should do. Dismiss the role and continue to learn at my current company? Find a role which is a step up, but does not overstate my responsibilities? Or accept the job offer and opens the next few months catching up on the technical and business necessities of the role?

Thanks!"

I’m just switched to computer engineering since I wanted to move into embedded more.
Thing is, I only have one summer of experience (web dev). The job has ok pay (23/hour). It would be a nice opportunity to test the waters for power sector and pad my resume, but I’m worried employers will see it in future and wonder what CS skills I have (am working on side projects/design teams to improve this). 

Do you think I’m overestimating how much emphasis recruiters will put on this? Also is it worth it despite me not wanting to commit to the field in long run (prefer cs/dev roles). I just finished my second year so if I do the job now, I’ll still have time to nab another coop in a different industry."

clniiu,1,2019-08-03,Concerns about my internship and developing it into a full time/co op,MyBush,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/clniiu/concerns_about_my_internship_and_developing_it/,"So my internship ends in two more weeks and I'd be interested in doing some kind of work for them during the school year as well. However, I'm noticing that the work given to me is beginning to slow down and am starting to get worried about my performance despite reassurance.

The company is a startup that hired me to develop web applications on mobile and desktop.

Throughout my internship, I've been able to complete all the work that was tasked to me but then all of a sudden, work started to slow down. I've been doing as much as I can by bothering the project managers, developers/engineers, about anything I can do as well as doing personal projects and online classes that might benefit the company. So I started getting worried if my performance had dropped. I can't deny that I may have missed some bugs that resulted in me having to patch that portion of the code up after QC, but I end up finishing them without any problems afterward.

I've raised my concern with the Tech Lead when he approached me outside of the office and I think he got the idea that I haven't been given much work either. I told him I was worried that I wasn't given much work because of my performance but he reassured me that all the full time engineers and developers have said really good things about me and that he'd send out an email about possibly giving me any work.

What makes me kind of sad is that I've been continuously telling them I'm free and they say there isn't anything at the moment yet I see other developers being tasked with completing a brand new website that needs to be completed within a week or so. The past 2ish weeks for me have been very minor code tweaks here and there... Nothing like the work I was doing earlier in the internship and what I could be helping with for the current projects at hand.


I also explained that I'd be very interested in doing one more large project before leaving in which they said that there may be something next week but will keep me updated. It's been getting really frustrating as I feel like I'm just wasting the company's money at this point but I enjoy the work that I've been doing earlier in the internship and would love to continue working with them.

Is there anything else I can do for the last two weeks to optimize the chances of continuing my position here during my school year?"

My name is Trent, and I am currently an undergrad Computer Science major (Minor in cybersecurity &amp; mathematics), and am a couple of semesters away from applying to a couple of grad schools that I am very interested in, namely:

1. Carnegie Mellon, M.S. in Information Security (Top Choice)

2. NYU (Tandon), M.S. in Cybersecurity

My first semester after transferring to a BS program (I have an A.A.S in IT/Computer Networking), I took a philosophy class as a gen ed and ended up with a C in it due to having personal issues that made it difficult to stay on top of the work. All major-specific and other gen-ed classes I have As in (except for a 1 credit class with an A-).

I am absolutely sure I can ace the rest of my courses now that I’m settled, which would bring my GPA to ~3.87 upon applying and ~3.92 upon graduating. I know CMU is extremely competitive, which is why I’m worried about this.

My question is, should I retake the course, or spend that time going for internships and other experience instead? I do already have a summer network engineering job which heavily involves cybersecurity too, if that helps.

Thank you very much!"

I didn’t even apply for the position and I didn’t even know the applications are out. So I think she reached out because one of my friends who is currently working there referred me.

Thinking about this, I’m sure that other big companies have college recruiters too. How can I get in touch with a recruiter from a big company without a referral? Or do I have to find someone currently working for the company I’m interested in and ask for a referral? From my experience applying for internships experience last year, it’s so hard to even get to the interview round, so I’m very happy and hopeful getting this interview. Please help :)

To all of you that respond, thank you so fucking much from the bottom of my heart.

Additionally, I'm currently stumped about what to write in my common app essay. I'm thinking about writing about immigrating here and coming out succesful after all the hardships, but that's way too cliche and I want colleges to perceive me as a student heavily passionate about STEM, not some immigrant kid trying to go into muslim studies or some shit lmfao. Hopefully this post has somewhat characterized who I am, so if any of you are currently going to a top university or are applying to college like I am and have any essay ideas that seem to fit me, please contact me.

Also, please let me know if you guys have any advice in general.

One last thing - I have a lot of EC's and stuff I want to convey to colleges, but currently with the limit of 10 and 150 characters in the common app, I think I might have some difficulty representing myself in those textboxes. Let me know if you got any suggestions.

This all sounds great because it’s an ABSOLUTE dream of mine to work at these companies but there’s an issue. I don’t know nearly enough about coding. All of it is basically self-taught and I just haven’t had enough time this summer with my job to study as much as I should.

But I’m 99% sure I’ll be caught up with my studies. What should I do?! I’m also scared to get blacklisted if I end up going through with fall and totally bombing the interview.

So, basically, I believe I have good academics (SAT, Subject Tests, and APs) but I have spent so much time improving those that my ECs are questionable. **My target schools are UW Seattle for CS, UMich, UCB.**

In the middle of Freshman year, I had this *great* idea (at the time) that I was gonna make a game on Roblox because I played it since I was 8 or so. I spent the summers before sophomore and junior years trying to make a game that could \*\*potentially\*\* fundraise for my school.

Unfortunately, by the middle of junior year, I ran out of steam because 

1. none of my friends really caught on

2. I wanted to start a school club, but after asking 7+ teachers, none of them was up for it

3. I was starting to question the amount of interest and work ethic I REALLY had for this project. I was starting to believe I was only in it for the money/clout (Roblox as clout? wtf?)

Now, I am a rising senior in the middle of my summer scrambling to find a project CS related; right now I am trying to create a PCB for model rocket telemetry for my school's rocketry club. I was going to intern for Microsoft (in Thailand) but my 'supervisor' hasn't responded in days. 

And now, I am panicking because I feel like I have tried to come up with a worthwhile project for too long while I could have competed in USACO or something with a direction.

Now, as I look through this subreddit, I'm seeing people who are thriving in more than one club/subject and have an internship every other year. And here I am.. haha

Any tips to help myself? I presume that essays are my best shot, because it's a bit too late to do anything major for my ECs, **(I might be wrong however)**

Again, **my target schools are UW Seattle for CS, UMich, UCB.**

TL;DR I am questioning whether I have wasted my time pursuing something CS related that, in the end, probably could not handle on my own."
clp8k4,2,2019-08-03,What are you salary expectations when getting a part-time offer after completing an internship?,ThrowawayJeffersonLe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/clp8k4/what_are_you_salary_expectations_when_getting_a/,"Hi,

I'm wondering what would be reasonable to ask, negotiate, or expect when getting a return offer from an internship. I am almost done with my summer internship at a really small company and they asked me if I would like to work part-time during school for them because that they would like to make me an offer. I wasn't really interested at first because I want to focus on getting an internship at a FAANG company for next summer, so I'm probably going to be doing a lot of on-site interviews next semester, which is time consuming. Also, my company is really small and no one knows them. I don't want to work there all my life and the name isn't known by others. The tech stack I am working with is also quite old and isn't growing in popularity, However, I see it as a good way to have more experience on paper and in real life as well as getting more money to work with my current employer.

My only worry is salary. They haven't made any offer yet, so I have no idea what they want to offer. I'm probably going to accept even if they don't really raise the salary, but I'd still like to be able to get more out of what I am currently getting. My current salary is 17$/hour CAD (13 USD) in a medium COL area. This isn't really high, but they are a small company. It doesn't seem like their other employees earn a lot of money, so I am realistic in my expectations. The offer is also fully remote, but I can still come into the office if I want to speak to them in person or want to network with other employees. They told me I am expected to work between 15-20 hours per week. To me, these seem like pretty good conditions.

I feel like I am not that useful to the company. They have a hard time hiring new people and I feel like they are only giving me an offer because they are desperate and wouldn't offer me anything otherwise. I also feel like my performance wasn't really good this summer. I haven't manage to complete everything that I was assigned to and felt like I was forgotten by my supervisor. I know a part-time developer isn't really all that useful to them and that I am not working on critical feature for them that generate money. For those reasons, I don't find that I have a lot of leverage here and that I am worth much more than they were paying me.

Also, I know the salary may seem very low to most of you guys. I compared with what others around me were getting. Most were getting around 20$ (15 USD) and some working at banks were getting up to 27$ (20 USD). I am pretty low in comparison, but it seems that salaries in Canada are much lower than the US.

So, what exactly should I try to aim for as a salary if I were to negotiate or if they ask me for my expectations? How much of a percentage increase should I expect?"

I've been struggling a lot recently trying to decide if I want to study abroad in South Korea next summer. I would be paying for it all on my own, $4000, would probably need to take out a private loan for it.

If I didn't study abroad next summer, I'd be pursuing an internship or volunteering/working at a local museum or historic site (trying to get into museum work in the future).

Upon telling older adults I'm not so sure about studying abroad, I've been met with relentless guilting and convincing me otherwise. I've been told I'll regret it my entire life, this is the only good time to travel abroad, it'll be the best experience of your life, etc. 

There's a lot of cons to study abroad, in my opinion (I have depression + anxiety disorders, financial burdens, also I'm transgender and saving up $ for surgery), but I can't help feeling like I would have horrible regrets about not going. Is study abroad really as amazing as everyone says it is, and the best time to travel in your life?"

Does is anyone here familiar with the facility and can confirm or deny these claims, or at least give me some advice on how I can find out more?"

I went to an under staffed and under paid rural area public schools with a lot of supply and not my problem attitudes and favoritism. 

I had as a child and teen lack of support from parents and staff.  Most struggling students were so lost in the system that was even more systematically fucked up because of a lack of financial support and opportunities from the already cash strapped rueal community with no psychological support, many of the students got addicted to drugs and never tried to get a job. Then again what jobs were there anyway?

I was being singled out by my elementory, middle, and high school because the qdistrict and school hired pedophiles and underqualified professionals to teach students and since they had no fucks to give they didn't catch the mental health issues I had and college teachers due to the lack of academic and social skills I had, In college I was so lost and looking for any direction that I embarrassed myself asking questions that normal people would know. I barely socialize shamed of who I was. Also in my college there was sexual harassment at my internship, that my advisers knew about but did nothing to warn me of it. I became withdrawn and since my family was all wrapped up in feeling bad for someone who used me as a fashion accessory who had issues with control I was the bad guy when I said fuck it I'm sad too! Christ they when my real parent when the one that was my legal parents ran away. Since Runaway decided to leave me behind I since clinged to whoever gave me attention. Good ir bad becuase I wanted to make someone happy for once.

Becuase I was messed up My relationships that I did have were full of sexual assault, assault with a gun after sexual assaults, cheating lack of resources to get help after said incidences, try to find work to pay for help and it's all part time independent contractor burger flippin' and grocery personal shopping where you just feel even more invisible, unhappy and a worthless piece of crap because you can't have a relationship because you become codependent and submissive and aren't where your parents are at now with a home of your own and a car that doesn't make you think of bad memories all the time. I have no savings because mom borrowed it all but will never pay it back. I resisted the urge to self medicate by just trying each day to make it through to the next. yeah that's why I am where I am. I just wanna give the fark up. I'm 40 no kids no husband, need new teeth and I am just going to bed every night praying I can move on to better things.

But I still wake up penniless no career no love no hope as it sit in front of my cereal bowl crying hoping I can scrape enough together for my cat to eat her expenive Rx diet. If I didn't have her I would be dead by now.

When will this fucking misery end?"

I don't think it will ever subside and I can't take it much longer. god it is agonizing. the thought of my family and friends having to go through my death is something I didn't ever want to think about. but like I said, I just can't keep living this way.

Basically, my girlfriend broke up with me because she is going back to college and can't handle the distance. we dated for a year, four months and 26 days. Here's the backstory:

About 2 years ago I met this girl at and animal shelter I worked at. I was overjoyed when I found out she had a crush on me because she was absolutely beautiful and had the exact qualities I was looking for in a girl. after a few weeks of talking/flirting I learned how perfect she was. I know this sounds like bullshit and that I'm exaggerating but I am completely serious when I say she was perfect. stunning tall, golden blonde with bright blue eyes that sparkled no matter how dim the lighting was. she was so compassionate and caring, all life was precious to her. she was funny and had such an infectious good attitude towards life. everybody at the animal shelter where we worked just adored her because she was always willing to help and had an outstanding work ethic. just the greatest example of what every person should be like. so naturally I fall for her and ask her out. she said yes and we started dating. as the weeks went by I fell farther and farther in love. and so did she. we built such a wonderful relationship, did so many things and had so many experiences. until it was time for her to go to school. when she left I was devastated, but I knew I had to stay strong for her (we still dated while she was away for her first year of college). I did everything I could to make her feel better. I drove 5 hours to see her every two weeks, we had Skype dates almost every night in between and things were okay. they were actually more than okay, we started falling even harder. we started talking about things that I guess you shouldn't talk about in the first year of dating. we recognized that we were in love with each other and that we both had dreams of spending the rest of our life with one and other. we talked about the house we'd have, our future children, the dogs we'd have, just everything. and I couldn't have been happier. here I was, a 22 year old kid who had found the most perfect girl in the world and she wanted our love to last forever like I did. nothing brought me down while we were dating, I was invincible. I was madly in love. and then she started getting real upset about going back to school. but it all seemed fine, I told her everything was going to be okay and that we would get through it as a couple. she smiled and agreed.

But here I am now. crying alone in a dark room with no more hope of things getting better. exactly one week ago she told me that we needed to break up out of the blue. she told me the distance was too much for her and that she couldn't spend every night crying, wishing she was home. she told me that she has to study abroad in Australia and do an internship in Colorado next summer. all things she couldn't possibly do if she was missing me. I begged and pleaded to no avail. how can I keep living? how can I keep living knowing that I will never be with my perfect girl ever again? I am doomed to think ""what if"" for the rest of my life, if I make it that far. she was the one, I am sure of it. there isn't a single girl in the world that can compare to her. she was truely one of a kind and I will never find anything close to her again. the pain I feel is unbearable, I wouldn't even call it pain. it's like a violent mix of sadness, devastation and hopelessness. she was everything to me. and now she's gone. my happiness is gone. I really don't want to kill myself but this feeling is something beyond description. I can't keep writhing in my bed all night and day crying. I've lost 9 pounds, I've smoked more packs of cigarettes than I've eaten meals. I can't even find peace in my sleep. all this stress has brought on terrible nightmares. nightmares of her having sex with multiple other men. I can't take it. I don't know what else to do, but I know my family and friends will be ruined for the rest of their lives if I kill myself. but at the same time I'm so lonely and in so much pain. pain that needs to stop, it's torture, I can't take it anymore. I need to make it stop. I feel stuck. I feel alone. I feel like this pain will never subside, and the only way to make it end is if I end it myself. please help me"

I also got a business/it student of the year award in high school (is it still relevant to mention this?).

Is a cover letter vital for each application? Is volunteering important to have on my resume or is that more for college applications? What about attending conferences or being in a professional organization?

My reach goal is a company specific to technology, like IBM and Palantir. Besides that, I am applying to companies with Comp Sci internships that aren't tech companies, like Walmart and American Express. Are these companies reasonable places to apply for an internship at given my background, and how many places should I apply to if I ideally want a fair number of interviews?"

I spoke with some career advisors at my university and they recommended I leave it out but having no skills/projects that would make my resume empty.... 

For those curious, at my IT internship I was basically technical support for the employees, went around manually updating computers, built some computers/repaired them, hardware and software maintenance on printers/servers/computers and hard drive imaging/cloning/wiping. My career advisors told me that this sort of thing would be better left off of my resume but I have nothing with out it. Anyone have any ideas how to spin it to seem like I did more without straight up lying? I worry about saying things like ""worked on servers"" and then being asked about that when in reality it was just doing what I was told and retaining nothing."

I don't have any experience before and I  am aiming to get my first internship with this.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Dear Hiring Manager,  
With great willingness and a young and motivated individual, I wish to apply for the position of Intern Software Engineer at Honeywell. I really like that Honeywell has been taking on automation challenges to help the world make more efficient, safe and productive and I'd love to be a part of the innovations and work with really technical and talented engineers  
I am a computer science student at the University of Dash. I have finished the core computer science coursework such as functional, object-oriented programming, algorithms and data structure.   
I have a passion for programming and have been actively involved in side projects. My last project involved creating a GUI application which could store ‘Job applications’ which would help the user to manage and keep track of all the applications by effectively storing, sorting and displaying it to the user. The application stores data in a Tree ADT and saves it on the machine locally. The GUI was developed using JavaFX which I learnt by myself demonstrating my willingness to learn.   
As you will note from my resume, I am most experienced in Java and python. Besides, side projects I have finished several university projects and tasks with good grades. The most notable of which was a Python-based program which simulates the Linux bash terminal. The program supported simple commands such as \`echo\` to complex i/o redirection and piping.   
I have been consistent in exploring different areas of computer science. This gave me familiarity with Android app development and Android studio. I even built a stopwatch app for android platform.  Currently, I am slowly learning web development.   
Besides the technical knowledge, I have a proven track record of 5+ years in the field of customer service through which I gained strong communication, negotiation and interpersonal skills. Additionally, I am an extremely flexible individual and understand the need to work in a team which is the basis of all day to day operations and might also involve travelling or relocation.  
I firmly believe that my education, skill-set and experience makes me a suitable candidate for this role. I would really appreciate if an opportunity to meet with you in person or speak over the phone is granted.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

cltgaw,1,2019-08-04,I (19m) am having second thoughts about taking a job in a famous organization or going to university,TheHardChoice,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cltgaw/i_19m_am_having_second_thoughts_about_taking_a/,"Hi Reddit,

I need a second opinion so I thought I should ask you guys of Reddit.

I just finished an Information Technology High School and now I have to choose what I want to do with my future. Some month ago I applied for a job position at a very well known organization (I don't want to specify its name to remain as anonymous as I can).

That's what I want or at least what I think I want. Some time ago I got the good news (or at least I think so), my application got accepted. However, what bothers me is that some relatives and friends don't share my choice, they think that if I start working now I won't continue my studies (I want to go to university after working there for 1 or 2 years because I still have a lot of things to learn).

What if they are right? I think that by going to work there I would learn a lot of new things such as improving my knowledge in English, French, general knowledge things and how companies works (it would be my first real job).

If I went there I would have to move to Switzerland alone. And I'm a little worried about that, not too much but just a little bit. You know I would have to do a lot of things by myself that now my parents do for me. And from where I came from, children usually stay with their parents until they are 25-30 years old.

I think there are other 2 options.

Option B: I can go to a not so great university (that's based on other people opinion, but I don't think it is so bad just not as good as option C, maybe) near me (30 min commute time).

Option C: I can go to a better university (again, based on other people opinion) but further away from me (1h 20m commute time, so about 2h 40m commute total every day). I don't want to chose this option because I think it is too much time to commute every day.

That's a hard choice but I am pretty sure about what to choose (option A, going to work) but what others think makes me have second thoughts. Another good reason for option A (other than that I would learn a lot of things that will be useful in the future) is that I don't like living with my parents.

If think that if I don't take this opportunity I might regret it forever. The only problem is that I don't want to waste 2 years of my life doing things that won't be useful for my future career. The internships I had before (one month and a half in total) were pretty useless and I, in my opinion, I haven't done some meaningful work. I just did boring office work that they didn't want to do... That is what worries me, I want to do something interesting (I really like the IT field and I enjoy doing such things).

Another thing that is keeping me from not choosing choice A is that I'll do the university with people 2 years younger than me. I think I won't be able to have some good friends, I don't know why but I think I'm losing something there.

I just wanted to hear your thoughts. Sorry for the long post."
cltqph,0,2019-08-04,Internships for CS beginner,Icemasterflex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cltqph/internships_for_cs_beginner/,"I just switched my major from Information Systems to CS a week ago and was wondering if it was possible for me to get an internship next summer (2020). I’m a Sophomore, but I’ll be taking all beginner CS courses as I just switched my major. I want to get an internship next summer for some experience under my belt but I don’t know if I’m qualified with such little current knowledge. I’ve been learning on Udemy and started a side web development project but I don’t know how much that’s gonna help cause apparently you have to know Data structures and Algorithms really well to get an internship. I was looking at the Google Engineering Practicum, Microsoft Explore, and Facebook University programs cause they’re apparently geared toward underclassmen.  

Are those internships primarily occupied by Sophomores? Or is it equal opportunity with Freshmen(I’ll be a freshman in terms of CS course knowledge).

I can teach myself the data structures and algorithms before I take my intro CS class so I can be better prepared for any interview I may presented with. Any other tips to fast forward my development?

Biggest Question: What do I need to know/learn NOW to earn myself an internship? Preferably a good one

BTW, I’m learning  beginner JavaScript on Udemy right now, any certain courses or languages I should focus on?"
cltw5n,3,2019-08-04,Could someone offer some good advice on what my next step should be after my psych degree?,yurrtheone,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cltw5n/could_someone_offer_some_good_advice_on_what_my/,"Hi reddit! Just joined to post here because I’m so lost and would love advice. This may be long. 

I’m 21 years old, about to go into my senior year of undergrad.  I’ll be leaving with a bachelors in psychology along with a music minor. I thought I wanted to do music therapy for a while, but I changed my mind because I really don’t think I’m confident or patient enough to work with others so intimately.  I chose psychology because it seemed like a very interesting topic, and I don’t regret the choice entirely because it did help me learn many things about myself and others. However, I no longer see myself in traditional jobs within the field, and I feel like I’m graduating with a major that just doesn’t suit me like I thought it would.

Grad school seems to be an expectation, both for people pursuing psychology and for a lot of people moving forward after undergrad.  I feel like not going to grad school would be absolutely stupid in my situation...I want to be financially stable in the future and a bachelors in psych just doesn’t seem promising.  However, I’m already burnt out and rolling my eyes just thinking about having to go through one more year to get my bachelors.  I’m hardly motivated anymore, and everything school-related is starting to feel like a chore.  How would I even make it?  If I do go to grad school, I want it to be because I have the desire to learn new things and truly become invested in something.  College hasn’t been that way for me.  I feel like I haven’t cared about or retained enough of the material I’ve covered over the past 3 years because...well...because I haven’t.  I’ve procrastinated a lot, crammed for assignments, and cared more about memorizing stuff really fast for good grades rather than taking the time to thoroughly drill concepts into my head.  I feel slightly guilty, as if I’ve wasted time and money.

Another issue with the grad school route is that I don’t know what I would want to go for.  I feel like my bachelors degree will be useless...I don’t want to be a therapist, counselor, social worker, educator, or researcher. What would I even get a masters in? A doctorate in? The only thing I’d consider is industrial-organizational psych. I’ve always been viewed as a leader and consider myself to be one, although it can give me gut-wrenching anxiety.  I have experience with directing a choir (albeit poorly at times, thanks to nerves) and helping elderly individuals sing in a church group (I just go and sing as part of the choir, so less direction, but still elements of leadership).  I think that having a graduate degree in IO psych could help me get some sort of HR or administrative job, which I wouldn’t mind, since getting that type of degree and going into a job like that could help me harness, improve, and polish the leadership skills I already have.  

The idea of grad school intimidates me because I really don’t have experience.  With knowing that it would be logistical to go for IO psych, those two choir related activities that I mentioned above are about the only things I can put on an application that *might* be relevant in terms of leading and helping people work together. I haven’t done much service learning at all (I did 10 hours for an assignment once, go me), no internships, no job shadowing....like I said, my motivation has gone to shit.  With knowing that I’m graduating soon, I want to try to throw a couple more things into my experience bag.  There’s an organization near campus that always has an intern doing scheduling and event planning in their office (that’s where I got my 10 service hours from).  The organization is one that offers community service and different forms of aid to students, so I can always plan AND participate in those activities.  Plus, I may also become the PR person for a performance group I’m in.  Those are two nice options, but they are not guaranteed.  By the way, I can say that I do have a LOT of performing experience, but I decided a while back that I didn’t want to make music my main career.  

Part of me is considering getting another undergrad degree after this one is over, mainly because I feel so indecisive.  I was a forensic science major my first semester freshman year, and I regret switching from that.  It seemed like such an interesting major, but I thought it was going to be too difficult and shied away from it.  Maybe it was the professors, maybe it was cause I had a hard time adjusting to college, maybe it was because I was 18. Don’t know...but I wonder where I’d be now if I stuck with forensics.

Don’t know what I wanna do, but I know that I do want this:

**After I graduate undergrad, I want to choose the path that will be the most financially promising, and since I don’t have a specific career in mind, I want that path to lead me to as many career opportunities as possible.**

Here are the options I’m thinking of:

 ~apply to go straight into grad school after undergrad, the least appealing option

~work for a bit after undergrad, get more real-world experience before applying to grad programs, because they like that, and let’s face it, i’ll probably need it

~get another bachelors degree, which I think would either be forensic science, biology, or anthropology 

Soooo yeah! I just need some advice. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this, your replies will be greatly appreciated &lt;3"

A lot of the CS classes I have taken though, count towards the Data Science Degree at my university. (Here is their degree plan: https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2018/undergraduate/programs/data-science) 

This Data Science degree includes classes like **CS 1 (Java) &amp; CS 2 (C++), Discrete 1, Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning and Database systems**. I have already taken Computer Architecture and Discrete math 2.

**The baseline is, I am scared. I really want a career in Software Engineering. I also really, really want to do a Master's in Computer Science.** Have I ruined or decreased my chances? My backups at this university were IT, Math and Data Science, but most of my CS credits count towards DS. 

**But, in terms of internships for now, during undergrad, will employers look down upon a Bachelor's in Data Science degree? Is there any possibility of me getting SWE internships/jobs with a DS degree?**

I have a feeling that ""junior"" devs are all around 21/22, straight out of uni/college, and I feel a bit self-conscious about this, feeling like I'm behind. Sorry if this sounds weird."

My first language isn't english so please bare with me.I made a post a few days ago, but i didn't paint the whole picture. I hope i can now get more suitable tips by doing so.

Little background info;

I met my ex gf when traveling to a distant country. I was planning on going there for my architecture internship. So while i was researching the city i was going to, i met her online and she helped a lot. We liked talking to each other so much that after months we gave it a try and started dating when i arrived there. I’ve stayed there twice for 3 months on holiday before i went there for my one year internship.

Those 3 stays weren't just holiday's, I experienced everyday life in that country, i was renting a house, paying for gas and electricity, working 6 days a week for my internship, having dinner with her and her friends, going to concerts and just enjoying life.

The reason i’m mentioning this, is that i had a lot of bad things happend to me in my home country growing up. From bullying to racism and discrimination on a weekly base. But as soon as i arrived at the airport i felt a different kind of energy, people were all nice to me, for the first time i've felt like a 100% equal human being, haven’t experienced racism once, and so i started building a bubble.. i knew this life here was temporary but i haven’t felt this happy and full in life since i was a child..

When i returned home after spending two years on and off there, the timezone was killing our relationship and we were arguing a lot. So eventually we took a break until i would return again for the summer 3 months later so that we could talk it out and talk about our future plan since i would have been graduated by then. She didn’t quite understand me and she thought i ment a break-up instead of having a break.

She didn't message me, so i assumed she was honoring the break and wanted her time as well. Now when i flew there to surprise her, she was shocked when she saw me and kinda ‘ran off’. The next day she made it clear that we broke up and she didn’t want to have bad memories. So i tried to at least talk to her but she didn't want to see me or call me. I wanted to at least sit down and have a talk with her and talk thing through even if it ment just having closure. She told me she would like to meet me but only with our mutual friend. I agreed so i went there to meet each other just the three of us. When i arrived i saw her friend by her self.. We sat down and talked and her friend told me she didn't want to meet after all and didn't want to have a conversation. Her friend felt sorry as well since we were pretty close. She cried because there was nothing she could do and she understood us both and she knew this would mean it was the last time she could hang out with me. So i thanked her for coming and left.

I messed up by flying there to surprise her, so now i was stuck here in a town and country all too familiar but so lonely..

Everywhere i went, i kept remembering the time we were there. Since it was a completely new town/country for me, everywhere i went she was there with me translating. I felt suffocated or claustrophobic even and had to leave but my flight and hotel were already booked for thee months. I just sticked it out and left on my departure time but my time there alone really took it’s toll.. If i could go back, i would probably left that same day or not even went there in the first place.

It’s been two years now and i still haven’t moved on.. i got into another relationship but my current gf doesn’t know how i feel because she is a very jealous type. I can’t talk to her about it but i feel extremely guilty about living in the past..

My phone backs up all my camera roll to a hard disc so i basically have every picture, video and moment saved on my computer. I don’t know why but i feel like the answer for me moving on, should be somewhere there in my past pictures and videos.. So i keep watching every moment we had from begin to end.. and i know it’s not healthy.

This all started when i was still with my ex and i made a highlight video of my first time i flew there. I captured me flying there, surprising her, having the time of our life and going back home. I did this for the other times i went there as well so we had 3 or 4 video's of the best time of our lives with all our memories being together. For me to create a film with all the footage that we took during the 3 months or even the year being there, is a crazy amount of footage. To choose the right video to match the music and edit, crop the footage took an even larger amount of time to create and finish the film. By doing this a few times, it's like i've lived the two years we were together over and over and over again.. I remember every crazy detail, every reaction or the things we said that you wouldn't normally do in a relationship. Every time i hear some of the songs i used, i automatically think of the attached video moment that i used for the video.

By making these video's, i invested a lot of time in this process because i knew we would've appreciated it later.

I was silly for doing this.. nothing is guaranteed in life. Having these video's now that i can't show anyone..

Now that we broke up, i still have these videos and it only potrays the best side of our relationship, the happy memories  but that wasn’t reality. You tend to forget the bad memories and only remember the good time. This is a fact and by creating these video's and watching them so many times, it's like the've replaced the real moment's that we had. The good AND the bad, the complete image of our relationship, and not just the compilation of the best moments of our time together. By viewing these video's i keep getting sucked in there.. I keep ‘escaping’ reality by going to the good times where i felt happy.

Sometimes i don’t even know the reason why i feel such a strong affection for the past is not because of my ex but because of the way i felt during that time i've spend in that country. That's the bubble i was mentioning earlier. It was a feeling overseas that i haven’t had before, so i was escaping all the troubles i had back home.I might not really miss my ex, but the way i felt at that time when we were a couple. It might be because of how i was treated by people there. Not just by her but by everyone i ment back then. The way i felt when i was working and everyone treated me with the upmost respect. The way i was by having a goal, a plan, motivation, working out, feeling good about myself, being happy. That might be what i am missing. The whole package, the 'bubble' that i was living in. I was living like it was permanent, like i didn't have a departure date in my pasport.. And since i was in a relationship during that time, she and everything i had going on for me in that country got tangled up. But i can’t see those things separately without my ex being in there with it.. I can't separate the two. If i think back of how happy i was, i think of her. If i think of her, i think of how motivated i was in life in that country.

Since it wasn't a native english speaking country, i was depended on her for a lot. That also might be a reason why i can't separate the two.

I know the past is dead, and you can’t help wanting to treasure those moments you felt were special, but i can’t escape this black hole in my life.. whatever i try.. my life in on hold right now ..

I'm still in a relationship at this moment, actually we are on the verge of breaking up.. the reason for it is indirectly connected to this.. But that might be a post for later. I need some advice for this problem please.

I'm sorry i made it this long, i just tried to explain it as detail as possible."

Unfortunately, I was **not** accepted to change majors to the Computer Science program at my University, because the dean won't let anyone with 60+ hrs to internally transfer. And, changing Universities is really not an option for me right now. 

A lot of the CS classes I have taken though, count towards the Data Science Degree at my university. (Here is their degree plan: https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2018/undergraduate/programs/data-science) 

This Data Science degree includes classes like **CS 1 (Java) &amp; CS 2 (C++), Discrete 1, Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning and Database systems**. I have already taken Computer Architecture and Discrete math 2.

**The baseline is, I am scared. I really want a career in Software Engineering. I also really, really want to do a Master's in Computer Science.** Have I ruined or decreased my chances? My backups at this university were IT, Math and Data Science, but most of my CS credits count towards DS. 

**But, in terms of internships for now, during undergrad, will employers look down upon a Bachelor's in Data Science degree? Is there any possibility of me getting SWE internships/jobs with a DS degree?**

*This is a side question:* Linkedin doesn't have 'data science' as an official major under my University's name, so would it be safe to put CS or put CS, concentration in DS?"

My internship is in a huge manufacturing facility. Part of my internship involves going to the plant floor and figuring out what the issue is and fixing it. Sometimes this involves interacting with the plant floor workers. They are all hourly employees and all belong to unions. I try my best to stay out of their way and limit any sort of disturbance to their work, but if there's an issue with some of the processes or parts, then I need to get all the info I can to fix it. A lot of the times we're helping to make the manufacturing processes easier for them. Sometimes, they're really nice people but majority of the times they're insanely rude and outright unhelpful. I am nothing but nice and polite to them. As an intern, I don't know how to handle this because I'm new to the company and I'm at the bottom. I can tolerate all this but it pisses me off and I have to stop myself from talking back to them because then it'll cause more issues and then the union can get involved.  Like I get it that they're trying to do their job but I am trying to do my job as well. I don't want to get my manager involved because I think it's a small issue but I'm starting to lose my tolerance for the rude plant floor workers. What's a good way to go about this?

cm22uh,1,2019-08-04,Recently Discovered OMSCS,wizard1997,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/cm22uh/recently_discovered_omscs/,"Hi all!

cm26re,2,2019-08-04,I (18F) am having trouble deciding which university I should choose.,atmysphere,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cm26re/i_18f_am_having_trouble_deciding_which_university/,"Hi! 
As the title suggests, I don’t really know which school I should choose. I’m going to depict my two possibilities, then what is my dream job and please tell me what would you decide on if you were me.

Option 1: Higher university in my home country, specialization: English philology with Japanese as a second language 

I know for sure that the professors and lectures are amazing, that the level of teaching is extremely high and that I wouldn’t be disappointed. Finishing these studies would open the door to becoming a sworn translator, which is appealing to me because I like challenges and not many people pass the exam. 
The university itself is very close to my hometown, it would let me be in touch not only with my family but also with many of my greatest friends. It is also easier to find affordable accommodation nearby the school, same with a job (I would become an English tutor).
In conclusion, this is definitely the easier option on many levels. However, the uni does not guarantee any help with finding a real job, there is very little to no internships, these are studies for people who are passionate about the subjects. 

Ah, I almost forgot - the organization is TERRIBLE. Not that it’s characteristic for this specific school, it’s just common in my country.



Option 2: University of Applied Sciences abroad (Germany),  specialization: Science Communication and Bionics

The studies seem to very universal but not “everything and nothing” universal, the good kind. They actually let me choose during the time of studying if I want to graduate with the title of BA or BSc which is pretty great in my opinion. Germany is famous for being well-organized and for its good quality in many areas, education included, at least according to people around me (I’ve never been to Germany). The school is young, but has good ratings and seems to live up to these standards.
There are mandatory internships, they work with many companies who are actually interested in hiring the best students. In general, this is the more practical option, the one that doesn’t teach only the theory.

Now, the cons - it’s REALLY far from home (neighboring country, but kinda “on the other side”) , if I decide on this uni I can’t go back. Moving there, completing all needed documentation, it’s a lot of work and money. Housing is much more expensive along with all the costs of living. Of course I would find a job but probably not for the first couple of months as I don’t speak German (the studies are in English in case anyone is confused). I don’t have any problems learning languages but it still takes some time to be fluent even on the basic level. My parents keep reassuring me that they are able to help me but I don’t know, it doesn’t feel right. I have some family living an hour or so from the uni who is also willing to support me with finding a job and the whole moving process so I won’t be completely alone, however, I don’t know a single person my age there.

To sum it up, this seems like the “more-profitable-in-the-future” option, but involves a lot more work, money and energy. And if I decide on it there is no going back.

What do I actually want to do in the future?
I want to work with languages, I want to speak fluently as many of them as possible. I would love to work as a translator who travels wherever she’s needed. I am also interested in sociolinguistics and would be extremely happy to be able to use it to master the art of communication. I know it is just a dream but hey, maybe I will get to achieve it in some way I don’t know of yet :P

Thank you so much if you’ve read it all, I’m sorry if something is unclear, I wrote it without preparation so it may be chaotic. 
Tell me what is best in your opinion!"

With the polls how they currently are at time of posting on 8/4/19, keeping the sub as is with verification appears to be the majority vote. As such, since we've asked/discussed/gone over this multiple times, this is now the norm of the sub. 

Any comments in future posting that has feedback including suggestions (e.g. what about if we did this, that might address this problem or that problem) is fine. However, any comments in future posts (including this one) that are merely putting down the verification (e.g. this stinks, I don't want to do that) or attack individuals who agree with the verification will be removed per community rules. 

To be clear about how the verification affects the sub:

* NO ONE is being thrown out, ""ousted"" or otherwise removed from the sub without that person violating community rules. 
* ANYONE can comment on anyone else's posts or threads (e.g. the weekly student thread). 
* ONLY verified posters can post fresh posts within the sub. 
* With all the changes that we had made recently, if anyone previously requested verification and thinks that under the current rules they should be verified, please send the mods a message. Please DO NOT simply comment on a post with your verification info, as there is no guarantee a mod will see it and it will be removed if we do to respect privacy.

If you are a professional or an intern who carries a caseload of clients and is supervised by a Master's level clinician, or who has a Master's degree/license, and who wishes to be able to post, you will need to be verified with the mods.

I graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in economics. I am 20 years old.  I initially entered UCI as a computer science major, but switched out after failing a class. I received a 3.7 GPA in 3 years. I have $3,000 in student loan debt. Great right? Except here's the problem: I didn't network at all in college. I have few friends from college, and the ones I do have are in fields unrelated to economics. I barely talked to students in my class and basically just went to class, turned the work in, and that's it. I don't have much of a relationship with my professors. I had one internship with a cryptocurrency fund that, for reasons I won't go into, is unfavorable to work with due to the reputation of one of the members involved with the company.   


Now I'm at a loss for what I'm going to do with the rest of my life for a job. Here are some thoughts I have:

* Try to get a master's degree. This is something my parents/family have recommended. However, I want to hold off on schooling because I feel as though more schooling isn't the solution for me right now.

* I've been thinking about teaching english overseas for a bit while I figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life. This could be fun for me to get traveling experience while also making some money, and also figuring out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. My concern with this, however, is that I'd be 1000s of miles away from anybody who cares about me and if something were to happen to me I'd be shit out of luck. 
* I found out recently that B2B software sales make a lot of money. However, I don't really have any sales experience whatsoever. I'm also not so sure that I'd be good at sales. This is something that I've considered breaking into. 
* I've also been fascinated by the idea of entrepreneurship/creating my own tech startup. However, I'm not sure exactly where I would start. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other stuff that I've been thinking about:  


* Although I'd like to think I'm fairly good at math, I'm good at academics, and I'm fairly intelligent, I'm really lazy. I was able to graduate 5th in my class out of approx. 100 students (top male student in my class, the top 4 students were women), and I graduated with a 3.7 GPA from UC Irvine in Economics which isn't nothing. I received a 2100 (out of 2400) on the SAT which is fairly decent. However, I think my lack of discipline and my laziness is really holding me back. I wouldn't want to say that I've completely wasted my potential, but it is disappointing to me that I feel as though if I weren't so lazy I'd be able to make something of my life. I don't want to work at Starbucks until I'm 25, hating my life and wanting to kill myself everyday. I can tell that even my parents are disappointed at the fact that I'm so lazy when it comes to work. However, I simply can't see myself doing menial work (such as call center work, or retail work). I'd love to do entrepreneurship, or engineering, or something to change the world.

cm8b4l,0,2019-08-05,I am stuck.,eyeeyecaptainn,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cm8b4l/i_am_stuck/,I’m finishing my bachelor’s this year. My university is so screwed up and it’s not at all worthy to invest my energy and time for a diploma that will be so irrelevant in the future. I finished with a 2.0 GPA in computer science but because the curriculum and the professors suck. I have a little background in  the field because I decided to learn everything by myself. I can get internships and jobs but can’t get a scholarship or anything. I’m also from a non EU country so every masters program i looked up was not affordable for my family. Im 22 and i feel like im running out of time :(
cm8gqj,2,2019-08-05,I (19M) am having second thoughts about taking a job in a famous organisation or going to university,TheHardChoice,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cm8gqj/i_19m_am_having_second_thoughts_about_taking_a/,"Hi Reddit,

I need a second opinion so I thought I should ask you guys of Reddit.

I just finished an Information Technology High School and now I have to choose what I want to do with my future. Some month ago I applied for a job position at a very well known organisation (I don't want to specify its name to remain as anonymous as I can).

That's what I want or at least what I think I want. Some time ago I got the good news (or at least I think so), my application got accepted. However, what bothers me is that some relatives and friends don't share my choice, they think that if I start working now I won't continue my studies (I want to go to university after working there for 1 or 2 years because I still have a lot of things to learn).

What if they are right? I think that by going to work there I would learn a lot of new things such as improving my knowledge in English, French, general knowledge things and how companies works (it would be my first real job).

If I went there I would have to move to Switzerland alone. And I'm a little worried about that, not too much but just a little bit. You know I would have to do a lot of things by myself that now my parents do for me. And from where I came from, children usually stay with their parents until they are 25-30 years old.

I think there are other 2 options.

Option B: I can go to a not so great university (that's based on other people opinion, but I don't think it is so bad just not as good as option C, maybe) near me (30 min commute time).

Option C: I can go to a better university (again, based on other people opinion) but further away from me (1h 20m commute time, so about 2h 40m commute total every day). I don't want to chose this option because I think it is too much time to commute every day.

That's a hard choice but I am pretty sure about what to choose (option A, going to work) but what others think makes me have second thoughts. Another good reason for option A (other than that I would learn a lot of things that will be useful in the future) is that I don't like living with my parents.

If think that if I don't take this opportunity I might regret it forever. The only problem is that I don't want to waste 2 years of my life doing things that won't be useful for my future career. The internships I had before (one month and a half in total) were pretty useless and I, in my opinion, I haven't done some meaningful work. I just did boring office work that they didn't want to do... That is what worries me, I want to do something interesting (I really like the IT field and I enjoy doing such things).

Another thing that is keeping me from not choosing choice A is that I'll do the university with people 2 years younger than me. I think I won't be able to have some good friends, I don't know why but I think I'm losing something there.

I just wanted to hear your thoughts. Sorry for the long post."
cm93hk,11,2019-08-05,How long until I quit and move on?,rdanon123,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cm93hk/how_long_until_i_quit_and_move_on/,"I'm currently doing an internship in IBD and in a span if just a few weeks, quickly realized I cant do this. Everyday I'm dreading coming into the office, my body is reacting badly to it (having nightmares about my job / I get random panic attacks during the day).

It's not like I dont have people I enjoy spending time with or that I am generally miserable, it honestly is the job / sheer hours that's killing me.

I think I should be able to get a return offer (I know I do a good job and the mid-term review went well), and if I get it, I'll probably do it. But I know I wont last long. Would probably wanna quit after a few months. But I'm scared that quitting so quickly wont look so good on the CV, and it also wont have given me enough skill sets to leverage to something else. I didnt study finance or economics, so my knowledge on the field is not super advanced, but I'm a fast learner and a good worker overall. Not interested in PE or hedge fund either

In this case;
1. Should I not take the grad job and look for something else? I have a year left until I graduate. If so, what should I look for even? It doesnt have to be limited to finance, and I dont need to earn a crap ton of money - just need a decent earning; I'm a reasonably frugal person
2. If I take the full time offer, how long should I stay until it's good enough of a leverage? How do you go on about doing the move?

In desperate need of advice. Thanks!"

Well 8 months ago they put me on full time. Giving me this big bullshit about how they cannot make me salaried because I am not a college grad. They made me a full time employee and only increased it to 16 an hour. For those of you who haven't worked hourly for awhile that's only 30k a year.

How do I ask for a raise? What kind of leverage can I even get if I don't have a degree? Other than the salary I love my job and I have had a couple interviews in the past two weeks for better paying jobs. I do the work of a contracted software engineer. I am just as good as other junior devs. Kind of insulted by the pay they are giving me."

1. What I was doing in the past 5-6 months?

My background would help a bit on how I could / may answer this question.

I graduated in the Year 2018 in CS and decided not to take the campus job which I was selected as I wanted to pursue a career which I wanted. So landed myself an internship after college for a span of 6 months, this was from July 2018 to Jan 2019. And I decided not to continue at the same place because of a lot of reasons. And tried searching for a job the entire Feb and had no luck. In the mean time I decided I'd take up GRE as I was already jobless and the exam was scheduled at May 2, 2019 ( so March and April 2019 went on with this, I know this is long but I was skeptical about taking it up again so did that). And I again started interviewing from May to till date and almost two to three places rejected me for this reason, that I had already taken up GRE and was planning for my masters. I wanted to plan my masters in the year of 2020. Almost all the interviews I took up I mentioned this. Last week I was hoping to join a startup because the founder was positive about me joining but was taken back when I informed him that (masters) and although he was supportive of my decision but I couldn't be a fit to their long term goals.

Could anyone please let me know if I should be lying regarding my goals and my exams. If I should be lying what would be an appropriate one in my scenario.

Edit: The reason why I wanted not to lie is because I wanted their roadmap to be planned out and I didn't want to be selfish with only my goals. Although I'm right now feeling that I should lie through my teeth no matter what. Is this a right decision?"

I took an internship this summer, and I didn't really like the field and duties of HR. However, I did like working with data and right now I am self-learning python and I seem to enjoy it. 

I think I would like to get into a data analytics role with the eventual ability to transfer into a data science (yes I would need a masters), business analytics, or compensation analytics role. I have a math background (up to and including calc 4 and linear algebra plus an extremely basic statistics class). I am learning python right now, but I plan on learning SQL and SPSS next (Note: I don't have time in my schedule to add a real compsci class but I can add statistics for HR majors).

I guess my main question is how can I not only catch myself up to the cs/it majors who are applying to the same jobs but also how to stand out? I do have a business and writing background, but I'm not sure how much weight it holds.

Also, am I even on the right track for what I want to do?"

Hi! I'm an international applicant looking to apply to UToronto, I had a couple questions I was hoping people could answer. Any info is appreciated! I'm also Indian btw, I know that makes things harder.

1. I'd be applying as a Comp Sci major. How good is the university at internships and job placements, also for international students.
2. Are there a lot of international students and diversity?
3. I'd be applying for financial aid, but they don't mention how much of it would be loans. Do internationals receive scholarships? What's the max. amount?
4. Can you work on-campus? Does this make a significant amount of money?
5. Do IB credits transfer?
6. Can you graduate a year early?
7. Is it hard to get a work visa after graduating upon receiving a job? How long can you look for a job? How long does it take to get a PR?
8. Anything else you want to tell me about the school?

Also my stats are

SAT - 1530

IB score - predicted 40 - Math phy chem hl

Do you think I can get in? Does anyone know how to be in a better position to get the lester b pearson scholarship?

I'll be taking my subject tests this october in math 2 and physics and hopefully do well"

Should I get a second degree or keep looking to advance in other ways?,Theo20185,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cmd1xq/my_career_has_stalled_should_i_get_a_second/,"I am a software developer. I was a late starter with my undergraduate work. I earned my BS in computer science at 30. I earned my MS in Information Systems at 33. I got my first job as a junior developer when I was 28 during my sophomore year. After two years, I was promoted to an associate developer and given a raise. It was the most money I had ever earned, being from a poor rust-belt state. At that time, I thought I was doing great. 

Then life happened. I went through a nasty divorce and custody battle. I got remarried and planned to move with my new wife cross-country. She has family there and works in healthcare, so her salary will be much better. We now reside in the SF Bay area. I put in my notice with my employer, and they offered me a position as a contractor working 100% remote on the same projects. I thought that was gracious of them and accepted, thinking when I get to CA at least I won't have to look for a job right away. I know that CA is working on laws to have companies not classify workers as contractors if they should be employees, but I don't want to start anything regarding this since I feel the company went out of their way to keep me on the team.

I am now 34. I have spent two years working with this company as an employee and four working as a contractor. Since I've become a contractor, I have had no raises and no annual reviews, things I would expect as an employee. I discovered that my salary was decent for my home state, but well below median for my new home. I decided to see if I could land a new job. Once I got an offer, my plan was to talk with my employer about my contract and see if they would be willing to beat the offer. If not, I would ask them if I could keep the contract and move to part-time work in the evenings, giving me two sources of income. If neither was possible, then at least I had a new job with a better salary.

The SF Bay area is home to a lot of tech companies, and I've been doing screening interviews on lots of developer positions. I've gotten a lot of rejections. One company brought me in for in-person interviews, and unfortunately I got rejected after a total of four rounds of interviews.

I've had the privilege to sit down recently with a small group of software engineers who have either worked for or interned at Facebook. I showed them the projects I've contributed to and my resume looking for feedback. I would love to work for one of the big tech companies here. Even the interns are given a housing allowance and stipend that comes out to be a bit more than my current salary. 

The feedback I received from the group were that a few things were working against me:

1. Most big tech companies have to comb through thousands of applications for any position/internship. One of the items they use to reduce that number is to start with people who have degrees from the top 10 or top 25 schools. My alma mater is definitely not in that list. At least 2 schools near the SF Bay Area will be on that list (Stanford, UC Berkeley) with two more near LA (CIT, UC LA).
2. If you don't have a degree from a top 25 school, then you should have a list of projects you have contributed to that are known in Silicon Valley. Something that has made waves or has become popular with developers. My work projects in the insurance industry are definitely not it.
3. If you don't have contributions to well-known projects, then references from other big tech firms will help. My firm is not a big tech firm.

Some advice I was given:

1. Contribute to projects using different technology stacks. All my professional experience is with .NET and the MS stack, so projects using stacks like MEAN will open up the number of companies I can apply to with relevant experience. This will take 1 to 2 years before companies will count my experience as valid when looking at it on paper. Try to find projects that give my name exposure to other engineers working at big tech firms.
2. Commit to my current stack and get vendor certified. The MCSD certification carries some weight with shops that use .NET and other MS technologies because MS gives them discounts for hiring certified. However, there is also concern that this cert can be obtained with rote memorization of exam dumps and it does not prove skill with the technology.
3. Check with top rated schools to see if I can get a degree from them. I already have a BCS and MSIS from a small unknown school. Stanford or UC Berkeley would be a good refresher, expose me to more technologies than I had before, and offer much better career services support.

I expressed concern about my age as I'm not the typical mid-20s engineer, and I was told that should be ranked below the other items. With what I bring to the table now, I should expect offers only from small established firms working on small projects.

I was wondering if the software engineering community on Reddit had any additional advice or comments?"

I was always one to get my hands involved in things and not shy away from stuff, so I picked up a good bit. 



**In regards to the management side, I’ve been involved in things like:** 

•	Ran an internship team that became a NOC with FT staff.

•	Developed/Revamped an info sec team

•	Heavily involved in international outsource support team creation

•	Security Compliances

•	Involved in post-acquisition activities such as people, process, and technology merging

•	Client account mgmt.

•	Project mgmt.

•	Managing internal products like phone systems and RMM

•	Vendor selection and mgmt.




**I do lack experience in a few key areas:**

•	I don’t have significant exp in business budgeting. I’ve done some P&amp;L stuff, pricing for vendors, but I have plenty to learn here. 

•	I have light exp with public cloud services. Our MSP mostly did private cloud. 

•	While I can put together light scripting, I’m not strong in powershell, python, or much other coding. I am able to review and understand mostly what’s going on, but writing something new from scratch isn’t my thing at this time. 

•	I’ve managed SQL from a sys admin perspective and product reporting, but I don’t have strong data analytics exp. Though I wouldn’t say I have no exp in SQL or excel formulas by any means. 



**What I enjoy:**

•	Diverse experiences. I know I’d get bored doing repetitive work. 

•	Being able to own my work, flexibility. 

•	I like being technical, but I don’t need to be the best or anything

•	I enjoy coaching others and helping them develop. I’d say I have leadership ability. 

•	I enjoy taking an issue with a team, product, or process, identifying what needs to be improved, fix it, processes myself out of it and go to the next issue.

•	I believe I want to be involved in business operations / management as opposed to pure technical.  



I currently live in a medium city, and I really like it here. It’s a decent tech area, but a lot of software tech. I know I could very quickly have offers in much larger cities, but I’m not super interested in moving unless I need to. Plus I’d like to pursue something fairly in demand with salaries in the 80-120k range. 

For example, I’ve been reviewing the IT Business Analyst path. For this type of role, I think I need to get some experience with data analytics that I don’t currently have. I'm very hesitant to be an internal IT Manager somewhere as i'm not confident that will help my career growth and I don't want to be a 1-man shop. 

Hopefully this wasn’t too long, I appreciate any input on career directions that I can further review."

I work for a municipality currently as a Desktop Support Technician. I've been at this positions for almost 2 years. Before I was at another municipality as an IT Intern where I did this same job for nearly 3 years. I have a bachelor's in IT, my A+, Network+, and Security+. Began working on my CCENT and CCNA, but life handed me a deck of cards that is occupying more of my time than I know what to do with so I'm going to start over on that when the new CCNA exam comes out. 

My problem is that I am So. Tired. Of. Support. I know I can never truly avoid support, but I think what I'm tired of most is the volume of level 1 support items I work with. 

I got really good at my job, and about a year ago I started shadowing our Unified Communications Specialist and he encouraged me to apply because of how much I was handling. Nearly every ticket that we got that was UC related went through me. The rest of the team gave me a new name that was a conglomerate of my current name and our UC specialist's name. 

Long story longer, I apply. Don't get the job. I don't have the certs or the experience apparently. Job has been opened a year at this point. Here we are a year later, I ask for my application to be reconsidered and still nothing. FYI the job is still open, going on year 2. 

I kind of quit handling these tickets because the job I actually took as a support tech got incredibly busy. I couldn't handle my job and the UC job at the same time. Management is now considering scaling back my Desktop Tech duties and having me go work on more UC stuff. 

I feel underqualified to move up to a SysAdmin, Network Admin, or even UC Admin role, but feel overqualified compared to my peers to be a Desktop Tech. I feel stuck. Suggestions on how to get out of support? If a job switch would be best, would I be qualified to work as some sort of Admin?"
cmdplj,1,2019-08-05,2nd Bachelors in Computer Science or MBA - which is the better option to pursue?,lokiidokii,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cmdplj/2nd_bachelors_in_computer_science_or_mba_which_is/,"I thought I was super certain on pursuing a degree in computer science but it came to my attention that maybe it won't be as fruitful as I had hoped (this is just talk, not much supporting evidence). Before making that decision, I had been toying with the idea of getting a MBA. 

I still feel set on the 2nd bachelors, even though it would be nice to have a Master's (that's more of a title chase than anything). I genuinely believe my career options will be less limited, since I think there's more I can do with that degree. However, I'm currently working in a business related field so my experience leans more towards the MBA - I work a professional career doing marketing. It's also come to my attention that I'll likely soon have to leave to find an internship or some kind of experience to help lead me into more CS options, so that's kind of a negative in my book (I love my current job and was hoping to adapt but there's not much opportunity to do so).

TL;DR: I'm curious what you think. Which one do you think is the better option?"

It’s my first time moving out of my parent’s house except for a 3 month long out of state summer internship 4 years ago when I was in college. We’re renting a house from my mom, which is gorgeous and in a beautiful neighborhood, and since we’re renting from my mom we’re getting an incredible deal, and both of my parents have been extremely helpful in helping us move and getting things we need and very attentive to any maintenance issues we’ve encountered so far.

However, my mom is starting to feel a little overbearing. She has been at our house EVERY SINGLE DAY since we moved in on July 27, typically for hours on end. Sometimes she’s doing something like pulling weeds (the house has a huge garden and neither myself or my boyfriend have much of a green thumb) but other times she’ll be doing things like sorting our laundry or poking though boxes we haven’t unpacked, which frankly feels a bit invasive. Sometimes it feels like she just invents a project for herself so she can come over. For example, she gave me a recipe that I asked for and told me she’s going to come over after work to help me make it, when I’m perfectly capable of doing it myself. It’s not that we don’t appreciate everything she’s doing for us to help us out, but my boyfriend and I have had almost no time to ourselves to relax and enjoy our new place together. I’m worried if I say anything she’ll freak out and think that we’re ungrateful, when really we just want some time to ourselves.  Does anyone have any tips on how to approach this with her?"

I'm tutoring CSCI135 (software analysis &amp; design I) students starting in the Fall (the official title is ""teaching assistant""!) which I'm extremely excited about, as I already really enjoy helping other students in those same computer labs, anyway. My professor for that class thought I was personable and sharp and I got an A in it, so he helped me get the job! I'm also working on making a basic 3D game on Unity (not sure how realistic it would be to get it developed onto Steam or something similar, but I'm hoping it'll impress potential employers!

I was wondering what the best websites/places/events were to find a good internship based in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Any good tips? Things I should look out for (red flags or green flags?)

Some background information on myself: Just turned 18, work 26+ hours a week at a grocery store, living at home with little to no expenses monthly, really no experience in any coding besides a basic Web Design class in HS, graduated high school with about 1/2 of my College general education completed.

- Is starting off at a community college possibly detrimental to my future success? I’m doing it to save money for myself and family (I’m paying half of the tuition). I’ve read that adapting from community college to a university’s classes can be somewhat difficult.
- What steps should I take now to set myself up better in the future to getting a internship or job? (Keep in mind I have no experience in coding).
- What was your experience with working at a job that doesn’t involve your major during college? Should I look for something else ASAP?

Thank you, also wanted to add that my passion for Computer Science stems from just being around computers a lot growing up, video games, and my small taste of it during my Web Design class. I like to think of myself as a hard, determined worker, and have been promoted at my grocery store job twice because of this. Thank you for any help."

Just a little background, I've been out of college for about 4 years (graduated in 2016) and I have a Bachelor's in Mass Communications with a concentration in Public Relations. I kind of messed up by never doing internships or getting experience while I was in school so by now all hope for a PR position is down the drain, unfortunately. 

I'm currently at a retail job that I've been at for 3 years as well as a social media part-time job that I've been at for 2. During this time, I've been complacent and comfortable while searching for positions with no luck (been on interviews and was never hired) I've been very frustrated, mostly at myself for not doing what needed to be done. I don't have any mentors in my life so I have no idea what to do. I really want a 9-5 full-time position but I don't even know where to look anymore. 

The social media gig is something I would love to pursue but I feel as though companies need people that have YEARS of experience and I don't have that, unfortunately. I'm just afraid of being stuck for longer and I have plans to move out with my GF but I'm not making a comfortable amount of money yet to survive and do that and that bothers me. I am someone that is passionate about music, photography, media, and all things entertainment.

 I'm just stuck and I've been depressed since I've graduated which I'm currently seeing a therapist for. I just don't know what to do. I find myself feeling as though I'm underqualified for these positions so I don't even try to apply lately. I honestly need help.

cmgowi,258,2019-08-05,I found a call box in the middle of the forest.,trentdm99,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cmgowi/i_found_a_call_box_in_the_middle_of_the_forest/,"I suffer from social anxiety just a bit more than you might expect even for a typically introverted engineering student. So last summer after my freshman year, I avoided opportunities for internships in people-dense environments like the giant aerospace employers, and instead I did an internship with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources at a state park. It was a non-academic internship, since my major is computational engineering, not forestry. But it still paid $13 an hour and gave me something to do for the summer, plus the idea of being outdoors sounded good to me. Hopefully next year I can intern at a small company, maybe the kind of research firm where you get to work a lot independently.

Most of the work was what you'd expect - trail maintenance, emptying trash cans, cleaning up after campers, and so on. But for one week towards the end of summer I got assigned to a small team to help collect data as part of some forest management project. Each day I would get a list of GPS coordinates to hike to and take some measurements using a kit of instruments the DNS people provided - soil samplers, a logger's tape to determine tree diameter breast height, and so on. Easy stuff. The interns who were forestry majors were given a few additional tools like densitometers to estimate tree spacing and look for canopy thinning.

I was also given a small handheld electronic device with an LCD display and some lights and switches on it. It didn't look too different from a sound meter or an ohmmeter, but there were no unit markings or labels so I couldn't really tell what it was supposed to measure. I was just told to turn it on at each GPS location on my list, wait for the green light to come on, and write down the digital readouts. One of the other interns thought it was an air sampling tool, maybe for checking pollen or pollution levels.

We were dropped off in pairs along a service road that cut through the forest. I was teamed with a girl named Janine, a forestry major who I had worked with once or twice before. The GPS coordinates on our list formed a clockwise loop about 6 miles long, with our drop-off/pickup location being the northernmost point of the loop. We had backpacks with bottled waters and our lunches in them, as trekking 6 miles through fairly dense forest was going to take much of the day. We also had a long-range walkie-talkie for emergencies.

Our fifth coordinate took us south into what was marked on our map as a protected wilderness area, off-limits to the public to minimize human disturbance. The trees here were older and larger, and maybe a bit further spaced apart than the area we had just left. The terrain was rougher, with lots of small hillocks and gullies, and a lot of undergrowth and dead-fall. Janine told me that before settlers came to Ohio, a squirrel could cross the state from one side to the other without touching the ground, but the settlers had since cut down almost everything. There were only a dozen or so original old-growth forest areas remaining in Ohio like the one we were in now, untouched by human hand except for maybe the Shawnee and their prehistoric ancestors.

I was deep in thought on our way to the sixth coordinate, close to the southernmost part of the loop, contemplating just how unchanged this area must have been for who knows how many thousands of years. Maybe even since the end of the last ice age. As we worked our way through a particularly dense section of underbrush beneath massive oak trees, it seemed to me that an ancient and timeless feeling hung heavy in the air. I could imagine the first native Americans crossing through this forest many thousands of years ago, finding it much like it was now.

Then as the underbrush gave way to a small clearing, there stood an intercom box mounted on a post.

For a moment Janine and I just stared at it, neither one of us moving or speaking. It was certainly jarring to come across such a manmade device in this particular context, immediately violating the primeval feeling of the forest. Then I began mentally seeking to rationalize the box’s existence here. Perhaps, after all, it was just part of some communication system or emergency call box for fire lookout parties.

The call box and post looked old, with red paint flaking off and rust showing through. The box itself was rectangular with a speaker grill and a single round button that had probably been beige or white at one point but had yellowed badly. On the back of the box was a logo of some kind, faded almost to the point of illegibility, but I could discern a large “J2” in a retro-futuristic looking font that might have come from the 1950s, superimposed over some kind of spiral pattern. The bottom edges of the box were badly corroded, all the way through in places. The post was square in cross-section and anchored into a cracked and discolored concrete pad about two feet across.

With a glance at Janine, I pushed the button.

Nothing happened, not even a crackle of static or anything. Janine pushed it a couple of times too, and said, “Hello? Hello?” but there was no response. We shared our speculations about what the box might be for, as we continued on our route.

But something interesting did happen at our sixth coordinate, which was another couple hundred yards or so past the intercom. When I turned on the electronic measuring device, it made clicking sounds like a Geiger counter, and the numbers on the digital readout were more than twice as high as any of our previous measurements had been.

I aimed it in different directions, but the numbers stayed the same; apparently the device was not directional. So I walked a hundred feet further west and tried again, then came back to the coordinate and walked a hundred feet south. Janine caught on to what I was doing and started writing down the numbers as I tried different directions. Pretty soon we had established that the numbers were increasing most rapidly as we moved in a south-southwestern direction.

I looked at Janine questioningly and she nodded her agreement. We continued in that direction, pausing every couple hundred feet to check the readings and see if we were still heading towards increasing numbers. As the numbers climbed, the clicks blended together into a low buzz, which rose in pitch until it was more the kind of squeal you’d get from a metal detector passing over buried coins.

The forest was completely silent and the light started to get weird in some subtle way. We soon found ourselves occasionally losing our balance and stumbling. One minute we would ascend a rise that seemed to pull us along as if we were going downhill, the next minute we would suddenly have to lean sideways or forward to keep on our feet. I pulled the logger’s tape from the DNS kit and dangled it like a plumb bob to confirm that the local gravity vector kept randomly changing, by as much as 15 degrees or so depending on where you stood.

After we had gone roughly a half mile from the sixth coordinate, the electronic device didn’t make any more squealing sound, but the light came on red instead of green, and the numbers on the readout were flashing. By now there was also an electric feeling in the air. Janine had visible goose bumps, and my hair felt like it was standing up. Sounds had taken on a thin, tinny quality as if they were being filtered through an antique phonograph speaker.

“I’m getting very uncomfortable with this,” I told Janine. “Maybe we should get back on our route.”

“Don’t you want to know what is going on here?” she asked. “We can’t stop now, we must be close to whatever is causing all this.”

“Whatever is causing all this seems to be bending the rules of physics. We have no idea if it’s safe. There could be radiation or who knows what. This is far from normal.”

“How about a compromise?” she offered. “We can go west for a few hundred yards and then if we don’t find anything, we can loop back north to our next coordinate.”

It turns out we didn’t have to go more than another hundred yards before we could make out a large hill through the trees. As we approached, it resolved into a large, perfectly conical shaped mound rising roughly 50 feet above the forest floor and maybe 150 feet across. The forest continued unabated right up to the top of the mound, and although the trees looked a bit sickly and were fewer and farther apart, they were mature oaks, suggesting that the mound had been here for at least a couple hundred years.

But as we circled the mound to the south and back around the other side, we came upon a set of metal blast doors set in the side of the mound, about a third of the way up. The doors had the same J2/spiral pattern logo on it as the call box, along with a large and faded warning sign declaring this a restricted area, do not approach or enter. The doors had no visible handle, and in any event looked too massive to lift open.

As we stood there looking, the ground started buzzing and the undergrowth vibrating. Suddenly we were pulled forward by another shift in gravity, this one much stronger than before. I found myself falling face-first into the mound, and to my right Janine had landed on the doors. Instantly the buzzing stopped. I stood back up, but Janine still leaned heavily forward with both hands against the doors.

She slowly turned her head with this freaky vacant look on her face -- her eyes were completely unfocused, and, I shit you not, both were tracking in different directions -- and said: “We… I… we… wish harmony with you.” Only it was not the sound of her own voice coming out of her mouth; it was as if a thousand different people were whispering the same thing at once, perfectly synchronized.

“I, we, I, want unity with you. Join us, join me…”

I shouted at her, got right up close to her ear and yelled “Janine!” but she did not seem to notice.

“We, I, we, we wish synthesis with you…”

I grabbed her backpack and tugged hard, pulling her off the door. We both tumbled backwards onto the ground.

She sat with that vacant look on her face for a few more seconds, then it was as if she suddenly woke up. She screamed, and the look of sheer maddening terror on her face is something I will never forget.

The ground began buzzing again, and the door with it.

“We, I, we, we are many, we are one, merge with us, with me. Unite with me, with us…” was the call of a thousand voices from the vibrations of the door.

Janine, still screaming, shot up and bolted through the forest. I followed, calling after her. She ran without looking, careening off of trees, the undergrowth whipping against her. Finally she was tripped up, and she lay on the ground crying as I caught up to her.

After she caught her breath and stopped crying I asked her what had just happened, but she kept shaking her head, saying “No, no, no…”. I managed to get her to her feet and plotted a course pretty much straight towards our rendezvous point. I tried the walkie-talkie, but the reply was a thousand whispers – “come join us, me, us…” – and quickly turned it off before Janine could hear. Then we passed another call box, and I heard faint whispers emanating from it, so steered Janine away.

After another mile the radio seemed to work okay. I told them Janine had taken a tumble in the underbrush and sprained her ankle, so we were aborting the rest of our coordinates and needed picked up early. I had not written down the digital readout at the sixth coordinate and we had not recorded any data since, so there was no evidence that anything out of the norm had happened, which was fine with me and I assumed would be fine with Janine as well. I did not see her again after that day, and upon asking around I was told she had returned to school a couple weeks early for some sorority activities.

That was last summer. This summer I interned at a small research firm (more on that in a future post, perhaps), and assumed I would never talk to Janine again. We had only interacted just the two or three times, after all. But last week I got a voicemail from her: “I need to talk to you, about what happened to me, to us… I, we should meet soon. Call us, me, us, let us know when you can join us…”

I don’t know how she even got my number, as it’s unlisted, but I don’t think I’ll call her back."

I'm living with my brother soon for 2 MONTHS maximum as he says he's going to let me stay there so I can quickly scrape together money to get an apartment and get my basic life in order (Which is very generous of him). I don't know how to pay bills, I have a GED, I'm never going to college and I'm just going to hone my skill into something I can profit off of, until then I need to get a cheap basic shitty job and get everything in order, here's the thing; my brother seems to think I'm a lot more adjusted to the adult world then I really am. I have no clue where to start, I have a lot of tattoos as well so it's not like I can just go get an office internship job.

I DO have great computer skills as I was a loser in my childhood and spent the entire time on the computer learning/honing knowledge (I had no physical friends at all and I probably never will) so any computer jobs for people who don't have professional degrees/certifications would be something I'm extremely interested in. This is in Oregon FYI, I need to find a cheap apartment in Hillsboro very quickly. I should also mention I am extremely depressed and find it very difficult to work a normal job and have been fired from every job I've ever worked for negligence or inappropriate behavior. I'd love to get medication for my issues but I cannot afford healthcare and my parents aren't going to let me be on there's.

So what do I do? I'm probably going to be homeless if I don't figure my shit out immediately. I also don't want to open a Patreon for my fans to donate money to because I feel like that is E begging and it's not sustainable.

**Demographics:** Male, White (first generation American), high income (not like 1% super rich but upper middle class)

Attending a competitive ""public"" school with a good admit rate for T20s. It's hard to get into (11% acceptance rate and t50s I believe of High School). Kind of like a magnet school. We have majors which takes up two classes so thats why not a lot of aps until senior/junior year

**Intended Major(s):** Mathematics/Statistics with comp sci double major or minor or some schools do stats and comp sci of the like

**ACT/SAT II:** 35 ACT 35 english, 33 math, 35 reading, 36 science Writing: 8 ; Physics: 770, MII: 800

**GPA:** 3.7 something, cumulative UW, however really good upward trend (so like junior/sophmore gpa are higher than that), school doesn't do ranks above average but not super above average

**Coursework:**

Rigorous for my school; APUSH (senior), AP Lang (4), AP Stats (5), AP Calc AB (senior), AP Physics 2 (3, sophomore year ): ) AP Lit (senior), AP comp sci principles OR ap micro (im hoping for comp sci but school said they don't know if they can do it so micro is back up)

Tennis (out of school, 3 years 10-12)

Volleyball 2 years 11-12

Book Club 11-12

photography club - 2 years 11-12

Research (math) - hobby, like to have a notebook where i write questions and try to answer them which has led to discussions with teachers and stuff like that

(I know stuff like book club and photography club, i don't have ""leadership"" positions because in order to have those officially in our school, the club needs to bring in revenue but those don't, but i do help run them

Travel - family travels a lot, still searching for something really interesting to write about with these, have a lot of thoughts but might just omit

Also seniors are required to have an internship so can talk about that. (Don't have one yet but something with digital media)

gonna need to do volunteer stuff so if you have any cool ideas lmk ty

Thank\*\*/LORs/Other:\*\* Essay is going to be good hopefully, I know this will determine a lot so im just hoping ;(.LORs are by my junior year pre-calc teacher, and my ap stats junior teacher. Both really like me and they are good (tho idk if they'll WRITE the best letter they do really like me a lot) Good relationship with counselor as well, she really likes me.

I am a Math/Computer Science double major who is about to be a sophomore this fall and have begun looking for opportunities for next summer. My current manager has expressed interest about me returning next summer, and I definitely would be happy to, but I want some advice from other people in the field on how to make the most of my internships.

1. Does staying with the same company (they are a big name) each year look good on a resume or is it good to try to intern at multiple companies?
2. Should I try and intern in a different field of IT next summer (Cloud, Databases, Analytics, Security, etc.)?
3. What are some certifications to go for that will help my resume stand out?
4. Any tips on where to find internships and interview techniques?

Fast forward to uni and I have a solid understanding of basic coding logic and have breezed by my coding courses thus far in my engineering degree. Even though I started so long ago and have done well in my classes, I still feel like I'm not 'legit' and don't know enough to land a software dev internship so I'm trying to build my portfolio. So far I've done a tic-tac-toe game in C++, a basic website, and a pizza order system in Java, on top of countless tiny class exercises. 

For my next project, I want to do something larger scale but not sure if it is too much given my experience and that I want it done (MVP) in one month. I want to do a desktop-based journal application that could track things like mood and activities then have an insights/stat page. Obviously, I would need to start small then build-up to all the features I want but even still it seems overwhelming.

1. Does this project sound realistic to accomplish in one month?
2. What language would you recommend to use for this? I want either a web-app or a desktop app.
3. Any tips on how to get started?

For some more personal info, I have worked in C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, but I'm not well versed in any of them and get by googling around. I've done uni courses in OOP, data structures and programming basics. Right now I'm feeling like I have lots of credentials but I feel like it's all smoke and mirrors. Things like getting my IDE setup and using GitHub still take me countless google searches and makes me feel like an outsider to the whole space. Not sure if I have imposter-syndrome or actually an imposter, behind in what's expected of someone entering the workforce soon. Also, my degree is applied math and engineering with a focus in computers/comms, so while I'm taking a few comp eng courses the focus is more math-heavy and I'm not 100% that programming is what I want to do as a career."

They agreed with a HR company to work together and decreased their experience expectation to min 1 year. In this situation what happens to the salary range? 

There's this nice company looking a Java Backend Dev. They have good tech stack, benefits and a possible relocation offer. I am a Java developer from Turkey and plan to move to Europe whenever it's possible and it's uncommon for companies in Istanbul to offer relocation to Europe. So it's extra attractive for me. 

About the salary question. People with 1-3 yrs of experience earn 6-9k ($1-1,5) a month. The company offers 7-9k for min 2 years of experience. They have agreed with a HR company and the position and they are OK with people with min 1 years of experience. I have 7 months of exp (including 2 mo internships) and graduated from Comp Eng. faculty of one of the best universities in my country. HR liked my CV and asks me about my salary expectation. I dont want to give a low value while the company has (had?) 7-9k budget but also don't want to sound high because the company is extra attractive as I have mentioned.

During that time, I constantly struggled and asked for help with my programming assignments. I never felt like I was good enough to do it on my own.  Never got an internship as I was never good at the technical interview part or submitting a code project. My sole purpose during my college years was to graduate as it was a financial struggle; therefore, I never really took in the knowledge I was given.

After I graduated, by just BSing through it, I took a job as a tester because it was the first job that landed on my lap and I was afraid of not being able to land a software developer job or any other software jobs in fact.  This job happened to a manual tester, which set me back even further.  After being a manual tester, for a couple of years, due to the fact that I was afraid of rejections, I started to relearn basic and somewhat advance programming skill. 

After a few months, I landed an SDET job with a different company that is heavily automation, which I took because I just wanted to get out of being a manual tester.  When I was getting hired, the manager stressed that if I wanted to move within the company from SDET to SDE, the manager wouldn't hire me as the manager was looking for someone with a long term goal as SDET.  However, I didn't care as long as I programmed. 

Now, after a year as an SDET and a person who is surrounded by smart software developers, who feel more confident about one's programming skills, and who has been applying for SDE roles, I am constantly getting redirected to SDET roles.  

Which comes to my question/need for advice: Should I just apply for SDET jobs, hoping that I CAN move within the company? (Which will take me some time to relearn the company's framework. Also, how do I even approach that I want to be an SDE when applying for an SDET position?) 

or 

Should I just stay within the company and hope that my manager revaluated his decision? (which I am too scared to bring up as I don't want to get fired and think it is highly unlikely to happen). What can I do, while my time at the company, to learn more about software development without raising any red flags?

Problem is, companies aren't always the quickest when it comes to posting new grad positions or interviewing for them (only a [small handful](https://github.com/cmackenzie1/new-grads-2020) are up right now), so I'd probably need quite a bit of time to actually apply and interview thoroughly, probably until November or so (my university's career fair is early October, for reference).

My performance reviews to me are given by the team lead , who is basically the mouthpiece of the manager.
.
In my last review he said I was doing better than most interns of other teams.  Noted I contributed a lot to the projects x,y,z... etc , 

The thing is in the last month the only other intern in my team was given more responsibilities and permanently assigned roals to do. 

I've yet to receive anything like that,  but the team lead casually noted ""you may get x /y roal to Handel on your own"" at the same time.  

Granted my responsibility has increased,  usually involves critical coding parts that the other intern can't or the team is too busy to handle. but nothing to that extent of permanent position ....


What can I expect at this stage? What do I ask or talk to my manager  when I mention my times coming to a end?  


Will I have to prepare for a another interview?"

Both???,Eastern-BoxTurtle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cmr5d1/after_internships_steps_job_graduate_school_both/,"So just to get some background information out of the way. I am a senior in computer science with a minor in cognitive science at a decently well known school with some prestige in the field. I am currently interning for a financial institution working in ontologies and the semantic knowledge layer of the institution. Throughout my internship I’ve learned a lot about semantic data and ontologies and I’ve enjoyed it. Yet, I know this isn’t my “dream”. So I talked to my intern management team. They said if I were to come back I would be on another team. This new team is on the big data platform and works with Hadoop, Kafka, Hive, Python, and things in that field. However I had already started considering options outside this company and currently in the process of deciding what to do next before school starts. Below are my three options.

1.  Stay with this company. Their pay is very competitive and their investment options are absolutely crazy. Would be perfect for building my income and moving into a very stable situation in my life and not relying on my parents anymore. 

2. I have started studying for the GRE and was going to try to get into a grad school in the area or surrounding area. I was leaning on doing a track in Machine Learning or AI (which all the main schools I’m looking at offer). This option is nice because I personally have and always have enjoyed going to school. I really think would enjoy grad school (especially if it’s free). However, I don’t know if taking out a loan and incurring debt for my masters is a good idea. My parents paid for my BS but said from the start that if I wanted an MS or anything more. That’s my responsibility - which is very fair. 

3. This company that I’m with offers a program where they pay for your masters while you’re here. But they only pay up until a certain point and it usually takes people 4 years on top of working to finish their masters when this route is taken. 

4. Maybe someone here has an option that I’m not considering. I really love psychology and philosophy. I would love to get into a field where my love for the brain, human mind, and consciousness can interplay with my love for computers and programming.


However, the killer issue for me is that I have many interest in computer science but I can’t pursue them all at the same time it feels. The two fields that most interest me are cyber security and machine learning (especially NLP with deep learning and using brain-inspired models ). My dream in cyber security would be to be a pen tester or work on Red Team within the government or company. In machine learning, working on NPL or any task where human cognition and machines/AI meet and interact in complex ways would be fulfilling for me. 

For those who’ve been in similar situations or just have any general advice for me. All is welcome. Thanks you."

cmrhs8,4,2019-08-06,Should I leave my internship?,FantasticallyFemale,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cmrhs8/should_i_leave_my_internship/,"So, I’m at a bit of a crossroads here and would like some outside advice. Like the title says, I’m thinking about leaving my internship early. Here’s some background info (that I promise is relevant):

Around December of last year, I separated myself from my abusive mom. I spent the following semester dealing with the fallout, and I still am trying to get my life back together up to this day

A few days after the semester ended (late April) I started my internship. I was there for two weeks before leaving for a 6-week field research opportunity. I came back to my internship immediately, and am scheduled to be here for the next month, ending three days before the semester starts. 

The company I’m at is failing. An email was sent out a month ago saying that we are in financial crisis and that they will know for sure if the company goes under around mid-August or so. We’ve still been getting paid, but around 5 people have quit/gotten laid off.  This place is relatively small (~50 employees) so that’s kind of a lot to me. 

I’ve been talking to a few coworkers about the situation, just how they feel about it and stuff. Apparently upper management didn’t like that. I got spoken to about how “I’m creating a toxic work environment”, and how if I can’t see all the amazing opportunities they’ve given me then they feel sorry for me. They’ve also threatened me, saying that I’m going to put down this job as references and on my resume, and I wouldn’t want a future employer to call them and for them to say that all I did was complain all summer (which, is not true by the way). This is all in response to discussing with others the current state of the company. 

Basically, my life has been a complete shit show for the past year and I haven’t been able to even get a week to myself for an entire year. I go through bouts where I feel like I can keep going and finish this thing out, but then other days it’s unbearable and I’m ready to put in my two weeks. I’m concerned that if I don’t quit early and take time to myself, then somewhere along the course of the upcoming semester I’m going to basically lose my mind, especially now that I’m a senior and I have to start looking for jobs/applying to grad school/deal with graduation alone. But at the same time, I’m terrified of the consequences from upper management if I do quit early. I feel like I’ve thought myself in circles about this issue, so I’d like to get some outside opinions to kind of get my head straight. Thanks everyone :)"

Background:
I have 2 weeks left at a big name tech company and I’ve liked it so far. Compensation is high: roughly 40/hour. We get free housing. My manager is very laid back and trusting and the people on my team are very friendly and nice. Right now I have another summer left and I have a verbal return offer from my team. 

Concern:
My concern is that everyone on my team is mid-50’s and kind of old, I’ll be missing out on a chance to explore new things and that a lot of the knowledge on my team is niche and less transferable.

The company has a lot of teams and I’m worried about expressing interest in interviewing with other teams because that might make my interest in returning seem fake. I like the work we do but I’m not sure if that’s what I want to do forever. 

Some of my friends are out and about exploring other teams but I’m worried about recruiting again because I’m an international student and finding this internship was really is hard. 

This is my first internship as well so I don’t know whether I’m really taking things for granted here and should be absolutely returning cuz in all honesty it’s nice here.

So i recently posted a question regarding my transition from the Special Operations Community into the IB industry. Of course, prior to that happening i have to obtain my degree from a prestigious school.

Following all the solid advice you guys provided, the issue im seeing is this; my abyssmal 2.63 HS GPA is going to likely prevent me from getting into any target school-even with programs like Columbia GS or Yale's Eli Whitney Program. Many have advised me that i could do a year at most at a community college, then attempt to transfer/apply to Ivy League schools as well as those programs i listed.

Would everyone here concur that even with my Marine Corps Background (5yrs total 2.5 with Special Operations), that my HS GPA will disqualify me from entrance into any of these schools as well as non-traditional programs? I feel I could provide a well written personal statement essay, as well as professional referrals from the SOCOM community...but is it enough.

Finally, i am aware that top tier banks begin recruiting after your sophomore year. From the sound of it, if i did anything more than a year at a community college i am severely hindering my ability to be recruited for an internship. Would doing 1 year maximum to show i can achieve a solid GPA cause me to be behind the curve in the internship rat race or would i be alright?

Sorry for the long winded question/s, appreciate any advice you guys have. Thanks!

This happened around 4:30 this afternoon (about an hour ago at this point).

I moved into a “student living” apartment near my campus on the 1st of the month. For those of you who aren’t familiar with these, they are apartments designed for students, and their leases usually run from one week before fall classes start until July 31st (at least that’s how they work near my university). Some places can do early move-ins, and some won’t do them. The one I moved to typically won’t do them, however I talked with the property manager and I was able to move in on the 1st instead of waiting until the 17th to move in. I really needed that early move-in since I’m doing summer classes and I have a part-time internship, meaning I could not afford to be without an apartment for more than one night.

Fast forward to today:

I get back to my apartment around 3:00 after classes and lunch with a friend. It’s been a stressful few days with the internship and final exams, so I decide that I want to unwind like any other 20-year-old single college student would; a little “me time”, we’ll call it. My roommates aren’t coming back until the 17th so I’m all alone in this 5-bedroom apartment, living in the furthest room from anyone else. I got a feeling similar to the feeling you get when you know your parents won’t be back for a while, but better because you know NO ONE should be coming anywhere near your room anytime soon.

I was really in the mood so, in a rush, I forgot to lock my door when I closed it (Mistake number 1). I was feeling adventurous today and decided to try out some VR porn with my new VR headset (Mistake number 2). I tried that for around 15 minutes but the videos took forever to load onto my phone, so I gave up with that and broke out my laptop. I got settled in and was enjoying myself when I heard a noise outside through my headphones, but I assumed it’s my neighbors across the hall because I can usually hear their front door close all the time even with headphones in (Mistake number 3).

At this point, I’d like to mention something that my apartment does after leases end on the 31st. Since they have only a few weeks to get all of their rooms ready for move-in, the staff does unit walks to find anything that needs to be repaired or cleaned before the new tenants arrive to their rooms. People who renewed don’t need to have their rooms checked, so there’s usually a notice put on the doors to their room saying “Renewal: Do Not Enter”. Since I’m not a renewal, I didn’t get one of those notices to put on my door telling the staff to not come into my room. However, I thought that they probably have it noted that they don’t have to check my room since I’m moved in already.

I thought wrong.

You can imagine the shock on my face when someone from the office opened my door to find me on my bed rubbing one out. What makes this whole incident so much worse is that the employee was female and she might have been more horrified than I was. She immediately turns away and closes the door in a hurry while I was scrambling around trying to cover myself with my blanket. 

After I recovered from the minor heart attack that incident gave me, I called the office afterwards and talked to them about what happened. Of course, I’m not telling them that I was jerking off, so I told them I was showering, and just got out of it without my towel. After talking to the property manager for a few minutes, they’ve given me a “Renewal: Do Not Enter” notice to put on my door to make sure there’s no more “interruptions”.

TL;DR: Those property sex videos are unrealistic af."

I am two semesters deep in my undergrad CS degree. Before this I spent two years getting bad grades as a Biochemistry major.

I am aiming to score an internship next summer but since my cumulative is low I am concerned it may be difficult. 

My question Is: should I do the Java certification? Will it help boost my chances to score an internship? Or are there other more effective ways other than working hard in school(I will already do this) to increase my chances of landing the best internship I can?

I'm graduating from uni next year and I'm hoping to move to nyc in a year's time from now. I'm pretty certain on just this city and don't really have an interest in any other locations in USA, I know it's much harder to move to nyc because it's so competitive but I'm kinda set on it. I've already visited the city and made like a few acquaintances but nothing else. 

I am studying political science but I want an entry-level job in digital marketing, copywriting, publishing in the fashion industry. I have done an internship in a fashion magazine locally but other than that I don't have any relevant experience. Oh and I also went on a semester exchange in DC and took a digital marketing class with a prof who works at nyt but I'm not sure if it can lead to anything. 

I am hoping to get some advice on how and when I should start applying for jobs and whether it's even worth it to try or pointless and I should just go there and apply? Like I can ho on a tourist Visa and try to get a job there and apply for a work Visa afterwards? I'm planning on saving about 10k which I think is doable for like 2 to 3 months without a job. 

I've tried to get advice from online and local Gov pages but haven't found anything specific like my case and I don't know anyone who has experience with this kind of situations. So really, any advice would be helpful. 

Also, I should note I am quite ok with taking a few risks and don't mind not settling down in nyc forever but def would like to live there for a few years.

I just started an internship at a tech company around 3-4 weeks ago. It's a great experience doing my work, but my experience with my boss has been a little iffy. First, I wanted to bring up the fact that I am completely new to this scene and the only experience I've had with my field was from school.

On my second day, my boss, who's supposed to show me the ropes, actually went on vacation. I had no clue what I was doing so of course, I asked others for help and learned a lot more from them. When they came back from vacation I thought everything was cool. I was given stuff to do, but again I am pretty inexperienced, so I made a lot of mistakes. I was approached by my boss about a mistake I made once and told me to look for them when I'm unsure, but whenever I do ask for help the response is either sarcastic or annoyed. So what am I supposed to do? I'm trying my best to learn everything but it feels so unwelcoming. 

Today, I apparently made another mistake I didn't know about. After saying my goodbye to my boss, I walk out of the office and realize I left my phone in there. As I walked back towards my desk, he's sarcastically talking about me behind my back to other co-workers about my mistake! What??? I felt like trash... Does he do this all the time?? I don't know, I still feel like shit.

What do I have to do? I feel like approaching them is so difficult. I have been keeping a professional attitude, but I keep receiving mixed signals..."
cmzs2e,1,2019-08-06,Not Sure If Boss Will Ask Me To Not Come Back...Should I start Applying For Other Jobs,artificallyflavored1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cmzs2e/not_sure_if_boss_will_ask_me_to_not_come/,"I'm in college (going into my senior year) and I also work part-time. I get pay way below minimum wage even though it's a parttime job. The reason why I've stayed at this job is that the schedule is very flexible which allows me to still make a bit of money while I focus in school. School is my priority so I rather have a job that accommodates to my school schedule and doesn't pay as well than have a job that pays great but requires me to be absent from class or doesn't fit my school schedule at all. I'm lucky that I still live at home so I'm only in charge of buying groceries and my own personal spendings. I also help my parent with as much as possible.

At the beginning of the summer, I applied for a summer internship. The program I'm in requires students to do an internship + my job field pays lots of attention to how many internships people did during school. Internships are something my school really pushes us to do. I got the internship and immediately said yes to it because 1) it is at an amazing place and the internship program was like no other, 2) it will look great on my resume, 3) it was paid (I couldn't and can't afford to take an unpay internship, 4) this particular company is very well linked to my school and the woman who runs the internship program is well connected to my degree director at school.

I spoke to my employer and told him about the internship. I gave the length of it and also found a replacement. My employer said he would wait for me to come back so that after the internship I could continue working for him. He was the one who offered btw and of course, I was happy to know he would wait for me to do the internship and then I could continue working.

But now things seem to have changed. I have two weeks left of the internship and I sent my employer a text telling him I was going to send him an email with my schedule for next semester. He usually replies fast so when he didn't it raised a red flag. He answered the next day saying ""okay, I will answer next week because I'm overwhelmed this weekend"". I said that of course it was okay and hoped everything was going well. I sent the email a week later because my mom ended up getting sick and going to the hospital for a week. I sent the email and told him about my mom (he has been well aware of her health issues) and sent him my schedule. No reply. The next day I sent a text telling him I wanted to confirm he had received the email and I got a reply the next day saying ""okay, let's hop on a call next week"". This raised more red flags.

To give more info. My boss and I have a great relationship. I have seen him as my mentor and we have both helped each other a lot in personal and professional life things. Even though there's a huge age gap we really became good friends and had an amazing employer-employee relationship. This is why I found it weird that he is not confirming what day he wants me to return or that my schedule works for him. Next week my internship ends and I cannot wait until next week to know that I'm going to be left without a job after the internship. I asked if he was free this Friday because I was free all day and could hop on a phone call at any time on Friday. No reply. I texted him again a few hours later asking again and no reply.

I have a feeling he is going to tell me to not come back which will suck but it is what it is and that's his decision. We never signed any contracts or anything like that. So legally he's not doing anything wrong. I am bothered by the fact that if he is going to tell me to not come back to work for him, he's putting it off and leaving it until my internship ends. If I won't have a job with him I need to start looking for other jobs ASAP.

Why I'm here is to ask if I should start applying for jobs now or just wait until I speak to him. Part of me wants to apply for jobs or other paid internships now. But another part feels like I should wait. I just don't want to wait and then have him tell me that I don't have a job anymore.

What should I do?

ADD ON: I also want to make it clear that I told him I was thinking about applying to it before I applied to the internship. I didn't tell him about it once I had gotten it. When I told him he immediately encouraged me to do it and told me he would wait for me to finish the internship and I could come back to work. Then when I officially applied and got it he told me again that the doors to the job will always be open for me. That's when I found the replacement (a classmate from my school's program) and we agreed that I will do the internship and come back."

I'm going to be a HS Senior applying to several top CS programs. I've been heavily involved in programming and cybersecurity competitions throughout high school and have also done research for a few computer science professors. I'm dead set on doing CS and have 100% enjoyed every class and activity I've done related to it.

My college application list (in roughly ascending order of prestige/difficulty) includes Northeastern, UMD, UMichigan, Georgia Tech, Cornell, UIUC, Harvey Mudd, Carnegie Mellon, and MIT.

**My main questions are**

**1. How much of an advantage do the very top schools (MIT, Carnegie, Mudd) offer over other top choices (and also, what are those advantages)?**

**2. Would these advantages outweigh the disadvantage of the amount of student debt incurred?** 

As of now, I'm considering sending an Early Decision application to Harvey Mudd (a school I'm interested in based on its extensive humanities curriculum, research opportunity, social culture, and quality of education), meaning that I would have a significantly higher chance of getting in but would have to attend Mudd if I got in.

The cost of Mudd per year for me (according to their net price calculator) would be 20K/year + flights to and from CA. My counselor though believes that I could get scholarships (possibly even full rides if I'm lucky) to Northeastern and UMD. I'm wondering if it would be a bad idea to throw away the chance of being debt free for a better chance at a top school. I heard that many CS internships pay well (up to 10K a month), and could possibly help me minimize my student debt if I were to go to Mudd or another school. But also, I question the advantages that the very elite schools offer over other great schools. I know amazing students that went to both UMD and Northeastern, and heard that many top tech companies recruit out of both schools. Additionally, if I were to pursue a master's degree (which is likely given how much I like CS), I heard the name of the undergraduate school becomes a lot more useless and any graduate acceptances I receive will reflect my success at the schools rather than the schools themselves.

Basically,

Is a full ride scholarship at a T20 school any better worse than incurring debt for a T5 school?"

I got a job as a software engineer last year at a slightly low salary (38k no benefits besides pto) for a high col area (San Diego). I took two interviews last week and I got both offers but I'm scared to leave my current job. I work for an insanely small company it's pretty much two elderly engineers one is 70 years old and the other is 80 years old and is only in the office once or twice a week. The work life balance is great where I'm at never really have to work more than 38hrs per week, and both the older engineers are really nice and they help me out and guide me through the code. I almost feel guilty about quitting this job after just one year but I'm concerned that I might not be learning enough about what the industry is like given the small size, and I'm not always kept very busy. My parents are concerned that my skills might be going downhill and that's also a concern from me. 

I've currently got two offers and I don't really know how to deal with them, I've got one offer at a company called company A for about 73k per year and another offer with a company called company B for 67k. B is offering me the option to do some work remotely which I feel might be nice as I am considering going back part time for a masters degree in CS later down the line but I also feel that the company has a slightly higher turnover rate and the work I do might not be as meaningful as the work I'd do at A. I also feel like the office at B is a bit more open versus the cubicles at A. At A I felt a good fit with the team there and I feel like I would get to work on more meaningful projects here, however since it's a defense contractor there would probably be no opportunities to work remotely. I also would get one week less of pto per year (2 weeks vs 3 weeks). A is giving me 5 days to accept their offer and B gave me an exploding offer with just 3 days to take the offer. 

Should I stay at my current job for bit longer and apply for jobs after a slightly longer tenure or should I accept one of my current offers? And what should I do to manage the stress of dealing with a new job? I don't know how to describe how I'm feeling rn I'm scared and don't know what I should do next"

Technical Background 

I hold a diploma in Computer Engineering and currently in the final year of undergraduate course in the same. 
I am currently focused on developing my skill set as a backend developer developer (I also have some interest in data analytics too). 
I have mostly worked with python and php based web frameworks (a few minor projects) and have some knowledge on front-end development frameworks like Angular and Vue.Js, and android (nothing to show for). 

Reason for this post 

I had some exposure to the current job environment in my city during an internship, and I was not thrilled to see that. Extremely long hours, terrible commute, lack of motivation and morale throughout and overall depressing experience."

I’m currently 3 months into a 15 month internship. I have a pretty good relationship with all my coworkers (there’s 6 in our department). My boss was hired about 3 weeks ago and so far I feel like I have a good relation with him as well. 

My parents are celebrating their 25th anniversary next month and want to take my siblings and I to Jamaica for a week long vacation. 

As per my work contract, I am permitted to have 2 weeks off, unpaid (which I have not used any of yet). The week we are planning to go on this trip is also when I have a 4-day weekend (I.e. Friday &amp; Monday off) from my work anyway. I would only need to take an additional 4 days off. 

I am feeling a little nervous approaching my boss for the time off as I don’t really feel like I’ve “proven” myself yet. Obviously I try to work very hard, but there’s only so much I can do when being the only intern in a department filled with folks with 15 years + experience. 

In terms of my responsibilities, I don’t have extremely high work loads compared to my coworkers and am confident that I’ll be able to have enough done in advance as to not disrupt the entire office. I’m also willing to stay late in prior days if needed. 

I would just like some tips on how to approach this with my boss (the vacation would be 1 month from now). 

Additionally, I have not finalized the dates of my vacation, so would it be wise to ask my boss if it’s better to take the Wed,Thurs &amp; Tues,Wed off or a different combination of days? Or should I provide definite schedule for my vacation?

The interviewer (the project manager Id be working under) was nice enough to give me advice on how to improve my chances in the future. It was mostly based on interview skills which I have since worked on a lot.

I applied again for the fall and  I re-interviewed the other day. Today I got an email that I have been accepted for the next round of interviews with the project manager again! While I am happy to speak with her again, I am mostly excited for her to see that I really took her critique to heart and really improved where she told me to.

I have pasted below my new version and would greatly appreciate even more feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

NEW AND UPDATED VERSION:

Dear Hiring Manager,

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the ROLE TITLE position. As a recent graduate of BLANK Masters program, I am deeply passionate about international development and firmly believe that XXYZ’s focus on ABC is essential to achieving this goal. I am confident that I can make a significant impact for the XXYZ as a ROLE TITLE. In my most recent roles, I have been able to cultivate the skills listed below:  

&amp;#x200B;

•	Relationship-Building: From starting as a customer service representative to my last position as a graduate consultant for the DEF, I have learned how to effectively communicate and cultivate long-lasting relationships with a variety of individuals and entities. Working on various team projects has taught me the importance of effective communication, negotiation, and problem-solving.

•	Strong Writing and Editing Skills: In my past position at BLANK, I was tasked with the responsibility of crafting correspondence toward key stakeholders including writing and editing proposals, grants, contracts, appeals, and marketing materials. I enjoyed the challenge of cross-cultural communication with diverse audiences as well as tailoring writing for specific readers in the example of grant and proposal writing.

•	Project Management and Coordination: Throughout many positions, I have provided logistical and on-site support for meetings, large-scale events, speakers, and presentations. As a Business Development Intern, I had the opportunity to serve hundreds of alumni, donors, and prospective students at recruiting events, cultural nights, reunions, and speakers such as ambassadors. With this, I have developed the practical knowledge to complete projects that require extensive organizational and time management skills as well as the theoretical expertise from a project management (PMP) course and my Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt certification.

•	Eagerness to Learn: I have always been passionate about learning as evidenced by my pursuance of a post-graduate education, two majors in my undergraduate career, my research assistantship, studying abroad, and consulting in Latin America. Business development requires an eagerness to learn, flexibility, and adaptability to most effectively pursue new opportunities and I believe that I have what it takes to succeed in this career path.

&amp;#x200B;

With my education, I have developed strong business acumen, such as budget management and financial analysis, combined with international development theories and international relations. I have worked, studied, and volunteered abroad in several different countries including Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico. Through this, I have developed bilingual fluency in Spanish, multicultural communication skills, and real-world knowledge of working professionally in an international context.

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely excited about the international development work that XXYZ does and would value the opportunity to serve as a key contributor to the business development team. I look forward to the opportunity to learn more about this position and share how I will be a great fit for the BLANK team. Thank you for your consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

OLD VERSION:

Hi all,

I am a recent grad trying to go into business development for international development non-profits. I was hoping to get some opinions on my new cover letter. All advice/feedback is welcome! I was hoping to use this cover letter as a sort of template for a few postings.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the ROLE TITLE position. As a recent graduate of a Masters program focused on international business, I am extremely excited about the WORK that XXYZ does, and would relish the opportunity to serve as a key contributor to the business development team in order to continue this important work.

In my most recent role as a Business Development Intern, I supported donor relations and fundraising efforts by drafting various types of communications toward key stakeholders including writing and editing proposals, grants, contracts, appeals, and marketing materials. Additionally, I was tasked with logistical coordination and on-site support for meetings, large-scale events, speakers, and presentations serving hundreds of alumni and donors throughout my time there. Furthermore, I led a student-donor outreach initiative; which included contacting donors by phone to recognize their financial contributions. I also assisted the Washington, D.C.-based consultant with special projects focused on identifying potential partnerships in the area to expand the reach and influence of the School.

Through my past roles, I have developed the practical knowledge to complete projects that require extensive coordination, organizational, and time management skills as well as theoretical knowledge from a project management (PMP) course. With my education, I have solidified my understanding of financial analysis, accounting practices, and budget management along with international development, relations, communications, and negotiation.

Above all, I am deeply passionate about (something about international development) and firmly believe that XXYZ’s focus on BLANK is an essential part of that. I am confident that I can make a significant impact for XXYZ as a ROLE TITLE.

I look forward to the opportunity to learn more about this position and share how I will be a great fit for the BLANK team. Thank you for your consideration."
cn1w36,1,2019-08-07,CS Major About to Enter Second Year - Looking for Resume Critique,Fluid_CS,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/cn1w36/cs_major_about_to_enter_second_year_looking_for/,"So some quick info, I'm looking for positions for the Summer 2020. I would like to land a Software Engineering internship (SWE) or even a engineering practicum/CS related position for the upcoming summer. 

Other notes: 

* I am planning on graduating in 3 years, and I am about to start my second year. 
* I go to public university with a decent CS program, 3.5+ GPA.
* I wasn't quite sure how detailed info about my projects should be, so please help me trim the fat and/or add content where it is lacking there.
* ""Taking:"" is representing the Courses I plan on taking this upcoming fall semester.
* Ignore that statement under Undergraduate CS student, its something I'll either remove or replace with something better.
* It may not be clear, given the jpg format, but on the pdf version of my resume all the projects have links to their repositories on github (blue arrow button next to date of project).
* The project at the bottom was in my senior year of high school and I'm not sure if I should keep it there. Thoughts?
* Soft skills section was something that some friends and a resume adviser at a career fair told me to put, but I'm unsure how useful it will be given I don't see it on SWE resumes.
* My Cooki project was for my Soft. Dev. class, should I mention this?
* For my project for my current job I did some knowledge base (KB)/Documentation write up. Should I mention this?

I probably have several grammar issues, but I am more concerned about making sure the format and content is good, given this is just a draft. I'd like to get into a FANG company, or some company of that level, if possible that is.

Thanks.

What should I do to set myself up for success and getting a job?,ibrown39,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cn2q27/about_to_start_my_secondcs_bachlors_degree_online/,"I want to work smart and I intend to be disciplined.

To expand:

Previous degree/current status: 

* 22yrs
* BA Economics(minor polisci) from Colorado State University(Ft.Collins)
* 2.77GPA
* Live in/near Denver and Centennial CO

The program **I'm in:**  [https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/bachelors-degrees/computer-science](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/bachelors-degrees/computer-science) 

I only have 57 credits to do and there are only courses directly related to the major. No math, humanities, etc.

The question in more detail:

* I feel good about getting at least a better GPA this time around. I'm in a comfortable space(home with parents, no real expenses, and a job I don't hate). But aside from reading and a lot of mindful practice, what are some good resources? This won't be my first time programming and I've gotten so far as data structures and Big O in my own studies. I've used java, python, c++, and etc. One suggestion I got from a professor at another school is trying stuff in other languages occasionally to test concepts and spice things up. I bought a cool leetcode app, will going through that help?
* I'm still not quite sure what my timeline will look like with my classes though they believe I'll be done by 2022. When should I apply for internships? I never did them for econ. I have a few networking connections via work(boss's bf and a  customer's husband).
* How often should I be working on personal projects?
* I'm not quite sure what this program will set me best up for/what a newly grad can expect in my area and school. I have a goal of something I want to do(I'll explain if interested) but eventually, I'd like to work in management. There's a list of specializations(15 credits) on the site which are:  

1. [Computer Programming](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/specializations/computer-programming)
2. [Cyber Security](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/specializations/cyber-security)
3. [Data Management and Analysis](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/specializations/data-management-and-analysis)
4. [Intelligence and Homeland Security](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/specializations/intelligence-and-homeland-security)
5. [Project Management](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/specializations/project-management)
6. [Virtualization and Cloud Computing](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/specializations/virtualization-and-cloud-computing)

* Basic resume advice?
* Anything you wish you knew or would have suggested to yourself before?

I know there's more to this than just learning to code/a language. There's efficiency, abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism, good code, organization, coordination, and I'm sure much more. I'd really appreciate some pointers and advice so that I can maximize my potential during this time."

The first years all have common classes so I'll like an year to decide.

Okay so I am in my 3rd Software Engineer Job, am 23 and just graduated 2 years ago. However, every job that I have been at including one internship; all the managers said that I am missing the even basic programming concepts. And although its not entirely not true. They all either recommended that I either do another 3 Year Apprenticeship or maybe change career paths. 

I have a 2.0 Computer Science degree, but only 25% of it was programming and I never actually learned anything preparing for the real world. Every job I have had so far, I never seem to pass the probation because of whatever reason. I don't believe the fired reason that they tell me, because they can just say anything just to hand me the termination notice. 

But my reasons for getting fired were mostly either requiring too much support, not showing the result they were expecting because it was originally a senior role, and I have a job now (2 weeks left to the end of my probation) and I dont think this will go anywhere either. I've had 3 jobs so far and been fired from the 1st two.

So I have not fully planned anything to do after incase it goes south. Which is why I am writing you guys. I was thinking either:

1) Travel and Disappear for a while and then return and change Career Path (something else in IT, just not Software Engineering).

2) Take some time out i.e. 3-6 Months and get a shitty part time job just to earn easy money and learn programming (Going the Self-Taught Route).

3) Whatever your suggesting...

Right now my state of mind is a mixture of (Marshmello - Alone(Song) + Joma Tech Depression (YouTube Guy)). I mean I have $50K of Student Loans left to pay back. And that isnt going to pay by itself. 

Any ideas?"

It seems like a big risk of not getting another internship somewhere else if I don't."
cn726w,1,2019-08-07,How should I proceed after my company passed me over for two different positions and did so dishonestly?,lpardskinpillboxmatt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cn726w/how_should_i_proceed_after_my_company_passed_me/,"Hey, all. Having some career frustrations that I would love to get some input on from people. The story stretches back a few months, so I'll try to make this as concise as I can and present it in a sort of ""chapters"" format.

1. Back toward the beginning of the year, I was interested into moving into a new position that was open and had communicated for several months that I was interested in this position, should it open up for me. They set me up to do a round of shadowing as a sort of training for the position. Logistically, the shadowing was a nightmare; what was supposed to be two weeks of shadowing with two different groups wound up being three or four weeks with several different groups and several different people, as people I needed to work with were out of town and we were generally short-staffed. Furthermore, clear parameters of what was expected of me during this period were not set, so I wasn't entirely clear what exactly to do, but I did what I thought was my best. Shortly after the shadowing period ended I learned they were not going to give me the position. Then, shortly after that, it was made public that they were giving the position to someone who had been with the company for about three months, compared to my year-plus. I also had heard that the person that did get the position was initially intended to be hired for that position, but was put in the same position as me temporarily. So it felt like the other person had been basically groomed for the position at my expense.
2. So after this I have a bit of a foot out the door with the company, which I think my supervisor picked up on, because I had a quarterly review shortly thereafter in which he repeatedly said things like ""you're a good employee and I want to do what it takes to keep you here"" and told me to ask for a raise, which I did.
3. We also discussed the possibility of creating a technical writing position for me to fill, as they might be a need for it and I have a good deal of writing experience. The only concern was whether or not there would be enough work to justify creating a full-time position for it.
4. A few weeks later a different position on a different team opens up due to someone leaving the company.  This position would also involve a good deal of writing. I ask for a meeting with aforementioned supervisor to tell him I am interested in it. He tells me the plan is to downgrade the position to a part-time one to fill with an intern because, like with technical writing, there were concerns about there being enough work to be done to merit it being full-time. I bring up the possibility of combining that position with the technical writing we had discussed previously. Supervisor is receptive to it, thinks it's a good idea, and seems genuinely enthusiastic about that prospect for me. Immediately after our meeting, he goes to his boss to pitch the idea, and I go to the head of the department with the new opening and offer my services to write anything that needs writing in the former employee's absence.
5. A couple of weeks pass and I don't hear any updates from anyone on either the raise or the new position. I reach out to my supervisor and the head of the department with the opening to see if there are any developments and I get a ""we're still working on it, but we'll let you know when there are any updates"". Okay, not ideal, but not necessarily a death sentence.
6. A couple more weeks pass with radio silence from everyone. I reach out again to see what's going on and get the same basic treatment. Only this time, my supervisor tells me ""I still don't have any updates, but last I heard they still want to make the position part-time for an intern and are not interested in making it full-time or combining it with another role"". I essentially take this as a soft ""no"". Still haven't heard anything on the raise either.
7. Yesterday afternoon a company-wide message goes out to everyone saying that the position I was interested in has been filled by someone else at the company \*and that they are combining it with a different role\*. Which I was \*specifically\* told they wouldn't be doing.

So, in short, I'm pissed off right now and am not exactly sure what to do at this point. Why was I kept so in the dark? Why would they make allowances for someone else but not for me? Why couldn't they just have been straight up about all of this? But I also want to make sure I'm not out of line or being needlessly entitled for being frustrated by all of this. What input do y'all have for me? Thank you!

TL;DR: company set me up to move into a new position and then gave it to someone else who had worked there a fraction of the time I had. They later told me there was a possibility of creating a new position for me, which they then told me they wouldn't be doing, before creating that position after all and giving it to someone else. They also pitched giving me a raise and haven't followed through on it or given me any updates in about two months."

I'm thinking of doing a data/software internship in London at a retail startup that uses machine learning/AWS. My role there would be a software intern - working on improving algorithms, working with data etc. I would have finished my undergrad by that point and have a relatively strong background - some previous experience (though not directly applicable to this job) and a relevant academic background.

I've been asked to provide a figure of what I expect as a salary. I don't live in the UK so I don't really know what is reasonable. I would like to cover the basics - rent, food etc.

What would you throw out as a figure?

Thanks :)

&amp;#x200B;

\---UPDATE---

I thought I'd add some extra information about the situation of the company. I think they're still relatively new but are picking up some big clients and winning all sorts of awards. Funding will only be secured within the next few months (before I intern). The impression I got is that they would love to take on interns and provide a learning environment but won't be able to pay some Facebook-like intern salary.

I'll only be there for about 2-3 months. Does this change anything?

Current thoughts are on just sending back a figure of  £2.5k p/m. Looks like I'd be able to rent a room near the office and afford all the usual stuff with that."

I am currently interning as a HelpDesk intern for a company in Georgia and started about 5 months ago. My time at the company has taught me alot of skills and learned a bunch of new things but I have been treated unfairly by my supervisor. The supervisor has shown clear favoritism to the other members of the IT unit, and the unit includes other interns as well. One example, is me coming in 3 to 5 mins late and constantly criticized for being late. My communte to the company takes me roughly about 2 hours and 30 mins and there are alot variables along the way that I can't control and thus as a result I am often times  5 mins late. Meanwhile other members of the unit live within an 1 hour of the company and are constantly late 5 to 10 mins daily and aren't criticized. 

I have made the decision of leaving and won't look back on it. The only thing that I am concerned about is rather I should give a 2 week notice or should I just send an resignation email and quit? I am attempted to do the second choice as I am fed up with the unfair treatment. 

I would appreciate the advice and for future if this happens again how should I deal with it?"

Been there for a year now. When starting the position, I was working for no income at a startup doing some software engineering work, but mostly business side. Eventually I decided that this role was not helpful to my goal of becoming a dev, and left to pursue any dev opportunity I could find. Interviewed for a couple companies, but my technical interview skills were not up to snuff after about 10 months of doing business analytics and trying to get investment money. Eventually, one of the companies I interviewed for (who happens to be the biggest private tech employer in the area), came back and instead of a rejection offered me an internship (Company B). 20 hours a week, $13 an hour. This doesn’t remotely compare to the ~$20 an hour at 25-30 hours a week I make as a tech, and definitely will not cover expenses (credit debt, student debt, rent, utilities, groceries, etc). Due to a part of the employee agreement, which was not made clear to me when I joined, every single line of code I write is owned by Company A. After talking to the business conduct team, they made me aware that I could attempt to escalate it. It would require legal papers from Company B, and written approval from my regional managers at Company A. Both companies A and B have rejected my request for either.

I’m still chipping away at my CS degree. Both companies provide education assistance if you’re full-time. I don’t see FT at Company A becoming an option anytime soon, and Company B would require me to do very well at the internship. I have been working to get into literally any fucking Dev/SE job I can for the past few years. Each time I’m just not quite up to snuff, or don’t have the requisite years of experience. My 4 years of IT work don’t count for shit, EVEN though they are all at well-respected institutions and involved doing programming work.

I am currently seeing if I can find another job in town that isn’t Company A that can provide supplemental income if I chose to work with Company B. If I can’t, then I feel my only option is to do my few classes and work at Company A. I just hate that option because 2 years ago somebody talked me out of taking a dev internship (only for them to take it a week later), and I just know I wouldn’t be in this situation had I done that.

I don’t want to leave this internship and be stuck with a job that isn’t remotely as good as my job at Company A if I don’t excel at the internship. I’m starting to feel extremely depressed and beginning to doubt if I should even continue working towards this goal. I’ve done projects in Python, C, C#, HTML/CSS/JS, and to prepare for the job with company B, I’m very into Swift right now. What the fuck do I need to be doing that I’m apparently not?! Do I need to drive myself further into debt to have a chance at a job? All of this stress doesn’t make me want to even fucking touch a computer.

I know this isn’t as much of a question and more of a rant, but I just don’t know where else I feel comfortable sharing this situation. Any advice or guidance is highly appreciated."

So I previously posted this in r/chanceme, but I feel it's more appropriate here. I am currently a rising junior and am strongly leaning towards a major in computer science, although I am also quite interested in business/economics. As a result, I am aiming for the regular top 10 CS schools(CMU, Caltech, UIUC, Berkely, Georgia Tech etc) for a CS major, but am also looking into potential dual-degree options that combine in business.

Obviously, I know these colleges are extremely competitive, but I want to know if I am at least on the right right path in terms of my academics/ECs, and more importantly, if there is anything I should work to improve/change. Here are my current stats/profile:

Demographics: South Asian Male(no real hooks); attend a competitive public school(send \~20 kids to ivies/top 10 each year)

**Academic:**

SAT: Haven't taken yet(aiming for a 1560+); PSAT: 1460/1520(760M, 700R+W)

SAT Subject: Will take Math 2 and Physics in the coming year

GPA: 4.0/4.0(UW); 4.77/5.0(W)

Coursework(completed): AP Comp Sci A(5), AP Macroeconomics(5)

Coursework(will take): AP Microeconomics(junior yr), AP Comp Sci Principles(junior yr), AP Calculus BC(junior yr), AP Lang(junior yr), AP Physics C: Mech &amp; EM(junior yr), APUSH(senior), AP Lit(maybe==&gt; senior yr)

**ECS/Awards/Leadership:**

\- Model UN: Currently serve on the secretariat(have also chaired committees) and have consistently awarded at national conferences.

\- Debate: Have awarded at a few competitions(no leadership).

\- Founded a computer science club at my school.

\- Founded a computer science nonprofit outside school, where we give free one-on-one lessons(Impact: 70+ students; 30+ volunteers).

\- Officer in an entrepreneurship organization outside school(organize/hold seminars on business, public speaking, etc).

\- Hackathons/CS competitions: Have awarded at \~5 state/regional level hackathons outside school.

\- Youtube channel: I currently run a youtube channel related to technology, how-tos etc(have around 3M views and 8k subs) ==&gt; haven't uploaded for more than a year though.

Plans for next year: Continue and expand on current stuff, compete in more competitions(CS/economics/entrepreneurship), expand YouTube channel

**Work/Internship(s):**

\- Have worked at a company where I taught programming

\- Am currently conducting a research internship under a professor(related to computer science)

Plans for next year: Get a company-based internship(during the summer) or do some sort of competitive summer program(related to CS or business).

\---------------------------------------------------

If you guys have any advice regarding things you think I should consider doing next year or during the summers, please let me know. The main reason for this post is so I actually have a chance to improve my chances of getting into one of these schools before its already time to apply.

The company I'm working for keeps track of patient data and we have some duplicates due to things like misspellings and adding hyphens in last names. On the flip side, since we have so many patients in our database (about 15k) there are also just patients with very similar names who are completely different people. The company wants me to find a way to merge the duplicate patients, but they need me to be pretty much 100% sure the patients are the same person since if we mess up and merge the incorrect data there could be HIPAA violations. 

I was wondering if any of you had experience with a task like this. I was looking up methods to do things like this and found something called ""fuzzy matching"" but I'm really worried about the accuracy and I was wondering if any of you had experience using it and could speak to its accuracy.

I'm an incoming freshman at UC Irvine. I was originally going to UC Riverside, but I got off the Irvine waitlist about a week ago (likely due to local preference). I'm currently undeclared and trying to get into data science. However, I'm still hoping to transfer schools within the next year. Although UC Irvine is a great school, it doesn't offer the opportunities I'm looking for.

I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to do after college, but I do have a couple of plans. trying to break into quantitative finance (ideally a hedge fund or prop trading firm), found a tech startup, or join an existing one and it will be exceedingly difficult to do this from UCI. I'm sure I could land a tech job at Google or Facebook with the right GPA from UCI, but breaking into finance, securing funding, or climbing to a management position is a different story. Unfortunately, pedigree is very important in these areas. You don't need to go to HYPSM, but if you aren't at a top \~25 school, you're in for a major uphill battle. Not saying you can't break in from a lower-tier school, but it won't be easy.

So, I'm hoping someone here can provide me some advice as for how I can improve my chances and comment on where I'll most likely be able to et in. At UCI, I'll do whatever it takes to get a 3.9+ GPA (even if that means studying for 10 hours a day). Also, I'll probably be working with a college consultant. I already contacted some of the well-known ones (e.g. Ivy Coach, IvyWise, Top Tier Admissions), but the prices were outrageous. My parents could probably spend $5-10k (maybe $15k if it's absolutely necessary) to get some help. Would I be able to find quality help given what we're willing to pay and would this be a good investment? I know that good essays are imperative when transferring schools and a professional could probably help here. I thought my essays were pretty good when I applied to top schools for freshmen admission, however, they far from captured me. This time around, I want to make sure they're absolutely perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's Some Information About My Circumstances:

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

\- Indian Male (RIP)

\- Competitive High School in Southern California

\- Upper Middle Class ($300k family income) - I may need a tiny bit of financial aid, but if applying for it will jeopardize my chances, then I'll apply for many merit-based scholarships and my family will find some way to absorb the cost.

High School Stats:

\- Unweighted GPA: 3.51 (oof)

\- Weighted GPA: 4.12

\- UC Capped GPA: 3.73

\- SAT: 1530 (730 verbal, 800 math)

\- SAT II: Math II (800)

Explanation of my low GPA: My freshman and sophomore years were near-perfect, however, I screwed up royally during junior year and got a lot of B's and two C's. This was due to a personal situation that caused me a lot of emotional stress. I also ended up getting 2 C's first semester of senior year (everything else was an A though). This was due to college application stress. Admittedly, my study habits weren't that great either, however, I fixed them and I got 5 A's and 1 B my second semester of senior year.

&amp;#x200B;

High School Extracurriculars:

\- Robotics Team (10) - raised $10k and qualified for world's

\- Lots of miscellaneous volunteering

\- Software Development Intern at NASA (summer after sophomore year)

\- Attended a Highly Selective Entrepreneurship Program (summer after junior year)

\- Computer Science Research- I entered one of my projects into my local science fair and qualified for states, where I got an honorable mention. I was also an alternate for ISEF.

\- A few software development projects

&amp;#x200B;

College Extracurriculars:

\- Research:

    \- Interning in a Robotics Lab - I'm assisting with the development of a robotic mapping algorithm that's 90% more efficient than the current state of the art. My contributions will be acknowledged in a publication.

    \- Working with a CS professor to develop a novel data science pipeline. I've been working with him for over a year.

\- Entrepreneurship: 

    \- Creating a High School Entrepreneurship Nonprofit - I'm currently forming partnerships with big companies and I've secured a small amount of funding. My goal is to expand to 30 high schools by the end of the year

    \- As part of my nonprofit, I'm organizing a large entrepreneurship hackathon.

    \- Working on an Early-Stage Medical Device Startup - I will present this at various events and try to secure some funding and media recognition.

\- Computer Science:

    \- Continue working on my software development projects and further develop my Github portfolio.

    \- Will Attend Hackathons

    \- Will Join Relevant Clubs

\- Community Involvement:

    \- I'm going to teach CS to inner-city high school students. I'm having a few UCI professors give lectures to these students.

&amp;#x200B;

School's I'm applying to (I might eliminate a few):

\- UC Berkeley

\- UCLA

\- UPenn

\- Cornell

\- Columbia

\- Brown

\- Northwestern

\- USC

\- Duke

\- Vanderbilt

\- Rice

\- UMich

\- CMU

\- Stanford (lmao) - They do happen to take the largest number of transfers out of all the top 5's

I know that my chances of getting into HYPSM are essentially nil, but I do know that most other T20's have relatively high transfer acceptance rates and those are what I'm targeting. Does anyone have some idea of what my chances would be and how I can improve them?

Thanks!"

I just graduated from a middling state college with a decent GPA (3.5) but made the mistake of just trying to graduate as soon as possible. As such, I took the path of least resistance in my coursework and between a heavy unit semesters, working 30 days a week and playing in a band, I haven't walked away with a portfolio to speak of. But I did gain a lot of knowledge on CS and engineering ideas.

The only project I ever did in school that I found interesting was writing a Python interpreter in C++ with only the lexical rules and a subset of the grammar (it wasn't a full implementation). It was fascinating to have to figure out how to do this from only the formal specs.  It's too bad, because the professor for that course was awesome and had I taken him for an earlier semester I would have tried to work on a research project with him. I really dug his style of putting much of the onus on the student and holding them to high expectations, but I digress. I've applied to a lot  positions so far and haven't heard back from anyone. After seeing the kinds of qualifications people have for ""entry level software engineering"" positions I know that's not gonna happen anytime soon. So maybe that needs to be a few years off.

And internships seem to only be open to people still in school. I'm not sure why this is? Surely a firm would be more interested in someone who has graduated and can start working right away.

TL:DR - What's a path towards software engineering, even if it's out of my reach right now? I want something that is in my reach and can eventually lead in that direction. I've got great soft skills but don't look very appealing on paper."

Systems engineering, hardware and software stuff for fly-by-wire, flight computers and cockpit controls. Been there a year and a half. 

But I feel as though my two degrees have hardly helped me, I've had to essentially learn things from scratch on every single project and just muddle bits of limited applicable knowledge together until things work to an acceptable degree. I've had some highs but a lot more lows. It seems like every time I start getting the hang of a project and rattling off tasks with decent efficiency, I'm whisked away by project managers and put on something else I'm completely new at. Obviously I'm super appreciative of the experience, and the projects are generally very interesting, but I hate just constantly feeling like an idiot newbie intern who has to second-guess every part of the system I'm given, ending up asking questions that inevitably sound dumb, however I word them. 

And I'm constantly hyperaware that I feel like I'm taking twice as long as everyone else to complete tasks, and run into more problems that need assistance from someone more senior. That's fine for a guy starting out in his first couple months, but jeez I've been here 18 months. Is it an issue that I still feel like a total novice?

Where and how should I go about looking for government work that requires little to no previous work experience?,Jackal11,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cnd603/recent_college_grad_24_with_a_ba_in_political/,"Hey everyone! As the title suggests I'm a recent college graduate who is currently staying with their parents until I can figure out what to do in terms of employment.  I have a B.A. in Political Science with a minor in Business, with a little bit of study abroad experience (might not be relevant.) I have previously done several internships with my state's current governor, and I have worked as a runner on and off in high school for a local lawyer.  Other than those two, I don't really have any applicable work experience, and seeing many of the job postings I search through have a minimum work experience requirement is a bit disheartening.  The dream is to work for the Department of State, but I am not confident my GPA would make me competitive for an entry level job.  I've uploaded my resume to Indeed and began to try to wade through all the job listings, but it seems difficult to find something that doesn't require previous experience.  


Essentially what I'm asking is if anyone has any advice for someone who would like to work for a large government agency, or where I could try looking for openings to get experience to maybe break my way into that career path.  Most of my friends sort of immediately fell into work with little down time after their graduation, so I sort of feel like I'm wasting time every day I'm not employed.  


Thanks everyone!"

Throughout my college experience, I have had 4 individual internships with both large and small companies in NYC and Washington, DC. Much of my experience is Marketing and Data Analytics internships that comprise of numerous industries. I also started an organization at my school as well.

My one internship at a leading gun manufacturing company has ruined multiple chances of getting a job. Just last week, after having 4 individual interviews, one offsite and three on site, I received a notification that I did not get the job there. I was baffled at the news because it got to the point where they were basically ready to have me on board.

I emailed asking why the decision was made, appropriately, and to my ""surprise"" it was because of my background not fitting their standards and company morals. I know for a fact that this is because of the gun internship, and what is disappointing is that I do not even support the right of gun ownership. If anything I left the company even more adamant about how the right to bear arms should be revoked or at least changed entirely.

I want to take it off of my resume but it is such a staple internship in terms of how long I worked there (5 months) and how the responsibilities and duties for this role were at a much more advanced level compared to the majority of internships. Why did I do it in the first place you ask? Because opportunities are minimal as a student and I had to take what I could get in a sense. The pay was more than I anticipated and I also wanted to learn how controversial companies work both inside and out - a skill that could be beneficial in the long run. None of my work promoted the use go guns to the public, it was a data driven job, but still....

All in all, the internship might be screwing me over because I believe I am a good candidate for the jobs I am applying for and have the experience to prove it, but every time I make it far in the interview process I get a hard NO.

What should I do?"

I am yet to have any relevant experience or internships that will land me any big time jobs straight out of school. However, I have worked all through school and have a strong work ethic with a drive to be successful wherever I am. I do well in school but feel like lacking relevant experience will hinder me from even getting jobs I want once I find a path to take.

I'm  21 years old, and I'm a mexican Computer Systems Engineering  undergraduate. I'm very close to graduation, I only have three subjects,  and my Terminal Project (A project that lasts about a year) left to do.  This summer I applied to a Data Science summer internship at a big  company and have been working there for 2 months now.(My contract ends  in a few days).  Well, it turns out I was offered a data engineering job  in the US, because I'm an American citizen too (born and raised in  Mexico to an American citizen). I've really questioned the fact that  they really want me to work there because, well , it's only been two  months and I'm an undergrad, but it really is happening. At first they  did not even think about it because I don't have a degree yet, but they  really liked my work and talked about it. And they want me to go ,  despite not having a degree.

This  may sound mundane to some but to me it is a very big opportunity,  because I've always wanted to work abroad, and I'd be paid very well.  And also, my family's economic situation is not the best and we've  always planned to go live in the US.

I  looked for ways to finish my degree while abroad, but it is almost  impossible to do it (because public school). Unless I take a break and  come back and finish, which I honestly think  it's not very realistic  because I doubt the fact that I'd come back. I'm still looking for  options though, I haven't fully given up on finishing while abroad.

I've  been advised not to drop out of school , and I think it is the best  thing to do (I mean I might need a master's degree later on) but I'm  very afraid of the fact that this kind of opportunity might not show up  again. I think it could be the opportunity of a lifetime (and maybe it  isn't). And well, some of the bosses think I should go, my boss thinks I  should finish and stay. I think I should point out that I study in one  of the best public universities in Mexico, so I'm not dropping out of  any school.

So, I'd like to know,  what is your opinion on this? How do you think  I would do if I work on  data science or other IT related area , and in the US, without a degree?

All comments are welcome and I'd appreciate your insight."

I got a remote job offer to do similar stuff at a smaller company remotely with a 20% pay increase, which I assume would be a similar salary if I got a full time position at the larger company after the internship. 

My questions comes down to is how much benefit do you get from being at a smaller company remotely, vs larger company in person? 

At the larger company:

1. More Sr. people to reach out to when you need help

1. More mature tech stack and process

1. More opportunity to learn things
 
Smaller &amp; remote:

1. Work remotely so more flexible.

1. More say in the direction of the projects.

1. building things from the ground up.

Being fresh out of college in the dev space, will I hurt myself going to the smaller company?"
cnelv8,0,2019-08-07,How important is internship exactly? Pushing graduation for 1 year for a data science internship vs keep staying in school and apply for full time now,sparkkid1234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cnelv8/how_important_is_internship_exactly_pushing/,"So yea I'm an international student with only 2 semesters left in school (expecting to graduate may 2020). Recently I've been offered a full time data science/NLP internship at a really decent company (very excited) which would span from upcoming fall to spring semester. If I take this internship, I'll push my graduation by 1 year (may 2021). All was going well until I found out I will still have to pay FULL tuition during the fall and spring semester that I'll be interning (since I'm international and Visa requires me to remain full time student status) + tuition for the next fall/spring semester that I'll return for school. This turn of event completely changes everything and now I'm not sure if I should take the internship.

Until now, I have no data science industry experience whatsoever except for a data engineer internship at a top school, a ML publication and decent research experiences. My goal after school is becoming a full time data scientist/ machine learning engineer. So I guess my question is, will the benefits of this industry internship (in terms of my goal) outweigh the large amount of tuition that I'll have to pay (prob about 10k/semester as I have scholarship). Or should I just stay in school and apply for full time now and hope for the best given my experience?"
cnepbc,1,2019-08-07,Frustrating application phase for Ph.D. (scholarships) - anyone with similar experiences?,donpigletti,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/cnepbc/frustrating_application_phase_for_phd/,"I am trying to start a career in research ever since I enrolled in my master’s degree in 2016. I really, really believe in my area of research and I am extremely interested in the topic. I finished my M.Sc. in Clinical Psychology in 2018 and have gained practical experience in research during that time. I have published three papers in peer reviewed journals and several other conference papers (6.40 on Research Gate) since 2018. I have completed several unpaid internships in international labs for which I had to get loans from banks despite working 80h/week just to be able to live and eat.

In order to pay some of the debts from my studies and gain practical experience, I worked part-time since mid 2018. During that time, I continued working on scientific publications in my free time and wrote up proposals for grants for PhD projects. I have applied at roughly 20 universities world-wide thus far. I was offered several positions but always without payments or scholarships. Financing a PhD without being able to work at the university or having a scholarship is impossible for me since I just managed to pay up the tuition of my bachelors and masters and survive on a minimum basis ever since.

What really disappoints me is that I have never gotten any feedback in terms of why I was declined certain scholarships or university positions that would have been paid (i.e., which I would have been able to accept from a financial perspective). Like mentioned before, I was offered positions in several countries – but for those positions, I would have to find funding to pay for tuition fees (mostly around $40.000/year) and my own survival. Visa conditions would not allow me to work enough hours to pay for my expenses. Therefore, I assume that the acceptance rates at these universities is way higher. The absence of feedback – when I asked if I could receive some feedback on my application in order to be able to learn and improve my CV etc. I was told that I was not entitled to this on every occasion – is really distressing because I do not know where I stand. I do not have any comparison. I know several people who have received scholarships, all of whom have published less than I have and have less practical experience. It may well be that there are students who are younger and already published 10 papers in Nature, but it would be nice to know this for me to stop wasting my time at this point.

All of this is really distressing psychologically and financially. I have got the impression that I could easily start a career in research if I would have the financial means – well, almost everyone can if that is the case – but this is not how science should work in my opinion. Also, universities are places where people come to learn and thrive academically, and I am utterly disturbed that my inquiries for feedback have been dismissed every single time. How am I supposed to improve myself?
I have talked to my supervisors who have advised me during the outline of my research proposals and their feedback has always been very positive. After I have been rejected, I always asked them for their opinion and for ways to improve and they always told me that they have no explanation for the outcome since they were impressed by my CV, my work ethics and by my proposals.

Just recently, my supervisors persuaded me to come to a conference in order to network with leading researchers in the domain I was writing a proposal in. Of course, I had to pay for everything myself (about $750 – so a lot for me at this moment). Now, the scholarship application was declined once again. The entire process of networking, finding a supervisor, writing up a research proposal, motivation letter, getting letters of reference, applying for a PhD-position, then applying for a scholarship,… is very time consuming. Being declined by an automatically generated email for which you are waiting months not knowing how to proceed while your supervisors tell you that they are certain the outcome is going to be positive this time is incredibly frustrating.

Now, I am at a point where I really start to question my decision and my eagerness to go all in on this “becoming a scientist”-project of mine. Many of my friends with whom I grew up simply finished their degrees, started to work and now have well-paid positions in different sectors of industry. Compared to me, they did not work 60-70h/week to survive and start a career in something they really believe in to benefit society and they are way more relaxed, way better off financially and cannot understand why I accept this devastating grind for something I believe in without any payback. I know that science is not well-paid in the public sector. I am completely fine with that. But I cannot accept that I am not able to survive on a minimum basis but must accept making more debts in order to try to do the work I believe in and I really want to pursue. And I know that it is not going to be easier in the post-doc phase. Right now, I paid for the research I have done myself with money that I earned in a shit job I am doing on the site and I feel that this is not how it is supposed to work.

Anyone out there having similar experiences?"

I'm 24 in a pretty higher profile seasonal internship, where I've busted my butt for 80 hours a week and a 50/50 road travel schedule from March through September. I've basically sacrificed my entire wellness to be in this industry and do well. 

My boss is pretty up there in the company and yesterday he asked me if I was interested in a developer job that just opened up. Full-time, good relocation, etc. Entry level developer job too which helps me because I just started grad school and am pretty raw. 

But anyway, he suggested me to someone within the same org - said it'd be a slow process, but his word does carry some weight, at least in comparison to external candidates. 

I'm just not sure how to view this - yes, I'm proud and honored he suggested me, I'm just wondering if this is a significant edge, a slight one, or maybe not one at all. You can never guarantee anything, but I have a move planned after this job because my lease is up and need to sort of have more answers than I do.

Just for anyone who has been in my shoes - as long as I nail the interview and stuff, does me getting this job seem likely, or is it something that is just so up in the air? I just am curious how it's worked for others who were previously in internship roles and then suggested by their boss for a job in the same company.

I recently ran a UserBenchmark test and I've noticed a few persisting problems (r/pcgamingtechsupport).By the way, here is my most recent performance:
UserBenchmarks: Game 102%, Desk 67%, Work 64%

MBD: Gigabyte X470 AORUS ULTRA GAMING
My Kingston SSD has been performing at the 4th percentile for the last several months consistently, and I have no clue why it's so awful. UserBenchmark provides the message * Performing below potential (4th percentile) - Ensure that this drive is connected to a SATA 3.0 port with a SATA 3.0 cable*, but I'm fairly certain that it's properly connected. Has anyone else encountered this issue before or knows of any way of fixing it (https://ibb.co/fXR2m38)? Additionally, the 11 TB Storage Space I made is performing poorly; however, the 3.5 TB Storage Space (which is using the same piece of hardware) is performing fine. How should I address this issue? Finally, UB displays this message: https://ibb.co/RvqKBtx, even though my CPU is performing at the 71st percentile. Since my RAM and CPU are performing quite well, I think that it's the underwhelming capabilities of the SSD and HDDs that are holding back my Desktop and Work Station scores. I don't know all that much about computers so I'm not sure how to interpret these results or fix these issues. I don't know if this has anything to do with anything but I am using XMP Profile 1 in BIOS and all my storage drives are less than one third full. If anyone has any clue as to what this could possibly mean, please let me know. 
Additionally, I made a little bit of cash this summer working at an internship. After putting most into savings/investments, I do have some cash I could use to upgrade some PC component. I'm not sure what to upgrade (though I do have a few ideas based on the UserBenchmark) or if I should even try to upgrade any parts right now, or whether I should wait for some different product release down the line. That's part of why I provided the benchmarks along with my PC specs, so it would be easier for those of you who understand PC components a bit more to decipher one is my current bottleneck, if I have one. If I should straight up wait for a new line of CPUs to come out a year from now or upgrade my SSD, please let me know. I just want to use some of the money of I earn this summer and down the road to invest in consistent PC upgrades, whether that begins now or in a year.

Sorry in advance for the length of this post.

My roommate and I both moved to Vancouver, Canada for an internship, we're both in our early 20s and not very sure of our rights in this situation. There's been a pretty bad fire in our building at the beginning of July, which totally destroyed the suite right next to ours. The wall behind the head of my bed in my room is a party wall between our apartment and the apartment that burned down. The other suite is condemned but the fire wall did a very good job, and our apartment only suffered smoke damage. Our bathroom shares a wall with the other unit as well. We had to be relocated to a hotel (paid by the city of Vancouver) for about 5 days, and when we re-entered the apartment, there was still a strong smoke odour and multiple industrial fans in the unit. Since, there has been inspectors and construction workers coming in and out of our apartment multiple times a week without a 24 hours notice (we still usually got text messages the night before, which we agreed to). There has been extremely loud construction noises in the unit next to hours starting at 8am (by loud, I mean someone is drilling in the wall behind my head). There has also been a huge industrial dehumidifier in our bathroom for the past month which is pretty loud and makes our apartment really warm. Two square holes of about a foot square have been cut out of the ceiling in my bedroom and the kitchen to determine the smoke damage in the foundation and have since then been patched up with tape and plastic wrap. We sort of never complained, but today we've been told that our bathroom needs to be re-done next week (1-2 day job) because of smoke/water/? damage. My roommate and I have also started coughing and having sore throats, and I've been having a particularly hard time sleeping since they opened up the ceiling (then again we say with certainty that it's related). The construction worker mentioned the smoke damage was important in the ceiling of my bedroom and affected the foundation of the entire unit (the entire foundation is pitch black and filled with soot, as we can see through the hole) and he said word for word ""well  I guess it's okay for a few weeks but could cause breathing problems for more than that"".

We also just found out who we thought was our landlord does not actually own the place, nor has a lease on it - he rents it month to month, even though he has his name down as the landlord on our tenancy agreement that we signed. We're not sure if the actual landlord or owner of the place knows, as we found it's against building policies to sublet. We have already paid rent for the month of August, and we are scheduled to leave on August 31st (3-month rental).

Our legal questions are the following:

1. Is the lease we signed legally binding?
2. How much of our money can we get back (if any) given the fire happened July 3rd?
3. Should we see a lawyer, or is this not worth it?
4. Do we fall under the [frustrated tenancy agreement](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/ending-a-tenancy/ending-a-tenancy-in-special-circumstances#Frustrated)

Not that it changes anything as we agreed to it, but we also found out we are paying a little more than 40% higher than other 2-bedrooms in our building.

Thank you so much in advance for your help, we are a little lost in this situation."
cngq92,3,2019-08-08,Is front end a waste of potential if I have a degree and work experience?,FEthrowawayCSCQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cngq92/is_front_end_a_waste_of_potential_if_i_have_a/,"I'm an upper year undergrad CS Coop student at the University of Waterloo who will be finishing my degree within the next two years. I'm trying to figure out what area of CS I want to work in once I graduate so I have some questions.

I read on /r/cscareerquestions that front end is a fast growing field where there's a lack of people who have technical degrees or significant work experience. There's an over representation of boot camp grads and career switchers applying to these jobs. People who have strong CS and software engineering fundamentals are mostly drawn towards other areas of development, so the ones who actually choose front end are (from what I've heard) highly sought after. Two of my three internships have been full stack where I liked front and back end equally. If I just consider the day to day work I have no strong preference either way, so it's appealing to me that I could get ahead in my career by choosing to focus on front end now instead of competing against everyone for the other types of work. I'm not passionate about anything like AI, ML, data science, embedded, or any of those more competitive positions so I think I can have a better career just by continuing with the path I'm on and focusing on web stuff. Also I've never had any luck getting interviews that weren't web related lol

You guys make it seem good, but in real life it seems like the consensus is front end development isn't a good career path. I feel like front end developers aren't respected and make less money than any other kind of developers. This is how it's been viewed at the companies I've interned at, and what I hear from my classmates as well. Front end is for people who are looking for an entry into the industry but somebody who has a degree has the potential to get a much more challenging job with more interesting problems, better pay, and more opportunities.

I understand that there's a big difference between pixel pushing html/css/jquery marketing agency tier jobs, and JS heavy web applications. I'm only interested in web app front end and don't really care about things like design.

My next internship is primarily front end, and I've been working on some front end focused full stack projects recently. I've been thinking about committing to something now so that I can get a solid job for full time because my generalist approach isn't getting me anywhere but mediocre companies in Canada. Like I said, I don't have a strong preference either way. What I want to know is, am I handicapping myself if I decide to commit to front end? Will I be pigeonholed? I can do full stack or back end and be equally as happy. I'm looking at this from a perspective of salary and career growth. Like every good little UW student, my ultimate goal is working at one of those big competitive west coast companies, but I'll be satisfied as long as I get out of this country.

TL;DR: I'm a CS student capable of getting front end, full stack, and back end internships. I'm thinking about focusing on front end but worried it would limit my earning potential. I've seen conflicting views on this. Is it a good idea?

EDIT: Oh and also, is it ok to use JS for LeetCode style interviews that aren't for front end? I want to practice in the language that I'll actually be using each day for the next few months so I won't make syntax mistakes."

Hi guys. I'm new to Reddit and am a sophomore who is interested in getting into a top 20 college.
I was wondering what ECs I should consider doing to achieve this.
Here's my list so far:

Made computer science club at my school (idk what to do, most members are not experienced enough for competitions, my plan is to teach cs)

Internship at local state college (working with graduate students, related to CS and focuses on machine learning)

Science fairs (placed 4th in the wrong category (district, went to state Fair but got nothing). And yes, this will be one of my main ECs and I'm investing alot of time into this. I'm self learning machine learning and hope to apply it to my project this year.

I feel like I'm forgetting one... But whatever. My brain is washed after 2 hours of AP biology.

I think those are the main ones. Everyone around me says I need volunteering, but one of my teachers says it's not really important because many people do it and it does not make you unique.
What do you think?
Thanks in advance :)"

How should I ask an acquaintance for a referral or an internal rec when applying for a job?,nimassane,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cngvf7/recent_college_grad_here_how_should_i_ask_an/,"Hey everyone, so I just graduated from college last weekend and I’m looking to apply for the NBCUniversal page program as it has been on my radar for quite sometime now. I figured with all my past experiences through internships and my recent job working on production for our local student news station on-campus, that now is the best time for me to apply. But since this is a prestigious program and very tough to get into (2% acceptance rate), I wanted to know if it’s worth asking my connections for referrals or recommendations before I send in my application? Usually past pages have utilized this program to climb the ladder in the entertainment industry but I’ve heard of even qualified applicants not having their resume looked at without a recommendation? The problem is the people I’ve connected with are people who I’ve chatted with on the phone a few times and exchanged emails here and there but happen to work for NBC at 30 rock in which the east coast pages work also. So they probably know some of the past pages who worked there. My connections are not close friends of mine or family but they all have been helpful and supportive thus far in giving me advice especially when I was applying for internships during my senior year of college. So should I ask for a referral or an internal recommendation? How would I go about bringing this up to my connections if I were to ask without coming off as desperate or selfish? Thanks!"

cnh53q,8,2019-08-08,How to deal with a rude senior engineer?,intosleep,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cnh53q/how_to_deal_with_a_rude_senior_engineer/,"I work at a small startup and the lead/senior engineer has always been extremely condescending towards me. Even when I interviewed with the company, this engineer was the rudest to me out of all the interviewers, who were all pretty chill. I initially wrote it off as “oh maybe this guy is just tough on interviewees”, but then I slowly started to realize that this guy is just condescending towards me.  

I’m a junior developer and have had my fair share of junior-level mistakes, but nothing catastrophic. I think one of the reasons for the condescending attitude was the fact that when I started the job, I wasn’t very good at the language the codebase was written in because it wasn’t my strongest, but I have a comfortable grasp on the language now. In fact, after I started understanding the language better, I began to realize that a lot of the senior engineer’s code is convoluted/doesn’t follow the right coding practices. I have an inkling suspicion that it might be purposely written that way for job security/wanting no one else to understand the code. 

I also hear him badmouthing me to our boss sometimes, but our boss is pretty chill, and he either laughs it off or doesn’t seem to care. 

We also had an intern this summer who got the chance to work with all the members of our team. The intern ended up telling me in private that he was a little afraid of asking the senior developer questions because he always got blown off or told that something had already been explained to him. 

The senior developer seems to be pretty friendly with the other two senior developers, who are chill guys that have been in the industry a long time. There’s no other junior developers on my team, so I can’t really relate to any one. 

I’m kind of worried now. Does every company have that “one rude engineer” you have to work with? I literally feel pissed off looking at that guy everyday. It sucks because I like the company and everyone else there. Well that was my rant."

I graduated with an MS in Math (focused in Statistics). However, by that time I made the realization, it was too late to apply for another Masters program (let alone a PhD program) due to assistantships being no longer available. My main programming experience was in **R** and **Matlab**, and I never had any problems related to learning statistics and programming. With the knowledge I currently have, I am confident that I would be useful in a role that requires statistics and programming (especially jobs with R).

After applying to many jobs, I have had no success. It seems very obvious to me that what I know (programming-wise) is not what job-searchers tend to advertise on LinkedIn or Indeed. To my knowledge, no one had ever told me during school that I needed to know at least a bit of other programs too (primarily SQL, Python, and/or Tableau). In general, it doesn't seem like it was communicated what I should do to get hired somewhere.

After a while on my own, I practiced Python, earning the entry-level certification (PCEP) after about a week. I put the Python stuff on my resume, but I don't think that helped. I touched SQL a tiny bit, and it doesn't seem too difficult. After a certain point however, I don't know what to do. If the timing was better, I would go back to school just to seem employable to recruiters in this field, but for obvious reasons, I can't do that at this stage (at least not for a long time).

My main frustrations with everything are that (1) I realize the job I want is fought for by many, and that (2) I believe my applications are mostly ignored given my different background to other people typically applying. I mostly apply for data analysis jobs that are full-time, with the occasional part-time jobs or internships.

Any advice? I feel very lost on what I should do from here."

- Gender: Male

- Race/ethnicity: White Middle Eastern/Cypriot, but applying as a US citizen since I was born there (dual citizen)

- Type of school: Private, going into my senior year 

- Hooks: None, but my family became refugees in 1974 and still haven't been able to return home



**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1520 (790 Math, 730 English), but I'll take the ACT in the next few months. I'm pretty sure I can get a 35 or 36 on the ACT, based on the practice tests I'm doing.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.8 GPA, no rank. I'm in a bit of a pickle here. My school combines middle school (Years 1-3) and high school (Years 4-7), so it's a 7 year school. In the first four years, my grades (so all of middle school and freshman year of high school) were meh (GPA around 3.6, even had a C in French in my 3rd year lol). But in Year 5 and 6 (sophomore and junior year) my grades were straight A*'s and A's, and I expect the trend will continue for Year 7 (senior year). Technically, my high school GPA (i.e. my last four years at the institution) is something like 3.9. My transcript will contain both middle school and high school.

**Coursework:** IGCSE/A-Level system. Basically IGCSEs are taken in your first two years of high school and A-Levels are taken in the last two years. 

I took 9 IGCSEs (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, English Literature, English Language, Mathematics, Economics, History, Greek) and received the top grade (A*, equivalent to a 5 on the AP scale) in all of them except Greek where I got an A lmao

and I will graduate with 6 A-Levels (most people graduate with 3 or 4) - those being Physics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science and Modern Greek.

For Modern Greek A-Level and Computer Science, I sat them two years early, and received an A and A* respectively. I'll be sitting Physics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Economics in May.

**Awards:** 1st place at a Insurance Tech hackathon (was competing vs adults and grad students), 1st place at EuroMath 2019 Conference (out of 60 people), Innovative Thinking Award at the International Land Rover 4x4 In Schools Competition for a navigation application that calculates the risk of roads based on past accidents, 2nd place at a UK based international math competition where I was the team leader (out of 500 teams), Best Coder @ LaunchX. 3rd place at some OpenData Hackathon (not sure if I should include it?), Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award

**Extracurriculars:** 

- Founded school robotics club, teach twice a week. My school is pretty big (1300 students) and well established (100+ years old with 60 clubs), however there is no support for students wanting to start their own club - student run clubs were against the rules until I fought with the administration for about a year on it and they finally let me. The club has become the largest in the school (40 members from 13 to 18) and it's entirely student run.

- MUN. I've been involved in MUNs for the past 5 years, going once as Admin Staff, once as a Reporter, and three times as a delegate. I was also selected to be part of my school's delegation at the biggest MUN conference in the world (THIMUN). I might (?) become a chair next year

- Asteroid hunter. As part of my school's astronomy club, I've discovered 11 asteroids. One of them has been independently verified by a third party which means I'll get to name it in a few years.

- Part of the editorial team for the schools magazine, I've been involved in it as a writer &amp; content leader and now I'm basically in the team that's in charge of the whole thing.

- Student Council. I was elected as Class Representative to be in the Advisory Council, and then in the Advisory Council I was elected to be in the Student Council

- LaunchX. Attended LaunchX, summer program with 15% acceptance rate. Started a company that went nowhere which is an oof

- Internship. Landed a paid 2 month Software Developer internship meant for college students at a small company (50 people) in the country that I'm in. I'm in Databases atm, working like 9 hours a day.

- Research Assistant at MIT AeroAstro. To be honest, this wasn't attained by merit (got it through family connections) and I feel guilty about this opportunity because I know I took an easy way out. It wasn't an open position so I wasn't explicitly stealing anyone else's spot, but anyway. I helped a research group convert some old NASA-commissioned software for planning space campaigns from a Java GUI application to a Python Command Line Interface tool. Basically, I made the application more easy for researchers to modify, and helped them automate it's usage. The original Java project which I translated to Python was about 30k lines of code. No actual ""research"" done per se (unless learning Java on the fly counts), just grunt work

- In the organizing team for the Fridays for Future Climate strikes in my country, which managed to gain enough support to be on national news. Wrote letters to politicians on behalf of the strikes, organized logistics, strategy, etc.

- Something I might do this year is probably start a small peacebuilding nonprofit. Basically, Cyprus, a small island, has been split into two since 1974, with Turkey occupying the Northern half. Lots of people (including my family) were basically made refugees by this as they had to flee to the southern part of the island and leave their homes and everything behind. There's a UN buffer zone between the two sides, and I was thinking of starting something like a code camp or weekly code lessons for a week. Basically the idea is to take people from both sides, pair them up and have them cooperate to learn to code and build things together. This isn't to fill my resume, btw - I love teaching and I feel very strongly about the Cyprus issue and feel like I should do my part in bringing the island closer together.

**Essays/LORs/Other:**  

- Essays: Honestly no idea. I need to start working on them, oof. 

- LORs: I assume will be 9/10. What worries me is that many teachers don't know how to write proper LORs since they're not accustomed to it (most students in my school to go study in the UK)

Other: Made a couple of fun projects.

1) Basically made my own Amazon Alexa using Python. She sits in my room and I just talk to her when I'm lonely or if I have a question. She can stream music, answer general knowledge questions, look stuff up, do math, get me the weather and set alarms and stuff. She's operated entirely via voice and responds through a speaker.  

2) Made a navigation app that uses past accident data to figure out which roads are dangerous and then give you a route that optimizes both safety &amp; time. Combined it with how you can partner with insurance companies to get people discounts on car insurance if they pick safer routes. Used it to win 1st place at the Insurance Tech hackathon and Innovative Thinking award at Land Rover 4x4 In Schools Competition

3) Currently building a website which will empower local governments to figure out weaknesses in their emergency response systems. Take fire stations for an example - this algorithm I wrote looks at where the current fire stations are located, and then it looks at where the fires have happened in the past 5 years, and it figures out the weak spots in your response system. It then tells you where you should place new fire stations to optimize emergency response time. The algorithm part is done, I just need to build a website around it. I'm thinking of reaching out to my local fire departments seeing if they'd be interested. This could work for any country in the world.

4) Made a payment system that works through SMS for 3rd world countries which don't have access to ATMs, smartphones or WiFi. However this payment system does need a bank account which kinda defeats the purpose. This was for a Financial Tech hackathon and while we didn't place in the top 3, we got the judges award and the prize money that came along with it

5) Made a thing that analyzes your facebook chat history with someone and gives you a bunch of stats, like who talks more, words used, messages over time etc. Will eventually make a website out of it.

The beginning of this month marks seven months on Vyvanse 30mg for me.

÷÷Pool

I got a pool membership this summer.  Previously I couldn't budget and save the fee.  Plus, I felt a lot of anxiety around being around strangers in the pool.  I kind of regret not having done this sooner.  

With a pool membership, I can literally go whenever I want, because there is no extra cost to go (because it was paid upfront).  I asked the pool staff nicely if they could share with me when the pool is busy and slow, and have gone at the slow times.  

The wee one has had a blast, the big one has skipped out sometimes.  I have a surprisingly nice tan and everyone keeps asking if I went somewhere exotic.  I feel so much less stressed with all this pool time.

÷÷Work

I came to a realization that my big frustration at work is that I am ready to move up from my position.  I have knowledge, skills, and experience that aren't appreciated.  

I want to keep this positive, but will acknowlwdge the negative by saying this.  The people who don't appreciate me and take satisfaction in making me feel bad things, have really done me a favor.  If I didn't feel angry, used, and unappreciated, I would not have done a personal inventory.  

So I do a self inventory, and my personal conclusion is that my current job is like a pair of pants that no longer suits me.  Everyone I started with has moved on to supervisor except me.  I don't know if that is what I want to do, but I know I need to move on.

What do I need to do if I want to be a supervisor?  I have selected some of the policies at work to read at my leisure now that I have time, instead of at the last minute before the interview.  I have started to volunteer to do things that are not in my job description so that I can fine tune my skills again.  I have signed up for trainings, again outside of my job duties, to broaden my knowledge, and at the very least look good on my resume.  I am debating an educational opportunity at work for this same purpose.  

Doing these things will not make me a supervisor in a flash, but that isn't what I want right now anyway.  Doing these things feels better than doing nothing but rotting in my position waiting for them to give me menial intern tasks, and feeling all that anger and frustration.

I truly believe that if I wasn't medicated, I would have been less likely to come to this conclusion, because I wasn't focused on the right things.  I was focusing on the petty, and my feelings were reduced in engaging the jerks and playing their drama game for too long.  I was just surviving.  

I honestly think I can say, that for the first time in many years, I feel like when a young kid is about to graduate high school and is exploring the possibilities for his/her future.  I feel like if I actually have a choice, whereas before I felt like, ""You're a mom, you're stuck where you are.  You can barely adult, so just stay in your lane and be grateful you have a job that hasn't fired you.""  

However, this has meant I have been working late more.  And all the progress I made in keeping house, in cooking and ckeaning and stuff.... it's taking a toll.  For example, I would rather get takeout than cook when I work late and of course that punches the wallet and isn't the healthiest.  So I have to work on balance too.

TLDR:  Six month Vyvanse update.  Focusing on two items, because I know I get too lengthy.  

One, I reaped in the benefits of summer pool membership, which I never did before.

Two, I came to soul searching and epiphanies regarding my job and can see the bigger picture."

What are some things that would be red flags to see (or not to see) on my resume?,UDeVaSTaTeDBoY,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cnmit1/im_17_and_looking_to_go_into_the_it_field_as_soon/,"Title pretty much says it all but let me elaborate: my current experience (apart from what I've taught myself from tinkering with my own hardware) is a 6 week internship with a local school district. This internship involved upgrading Chromebooks, using DBAN on decommissioned machines, imaging and upgrading computers through MDT, disassembling old Dell Latitudes and Chromebooks, and wiping iPads. I currently do not have any certifications however plan to get some concurrently with my school work senior year. What certifications should I immediately focus on? I have experience with working with the Windows registry and local group policy as well as user groups however what should I be trying to figure out on my own hardware? I also set up and manage my family's network share as well as our router. I do understand the differences between a 2.4GHz and 5GHz network as well as how a computer reacts differently to a wired connection vs a wireless. I've also done basic packet sniffing with WireShark and Fiddler.

I understand really that I should have more. My goal in the middle of the school year when I turn 18 (sooner if I have enough money when my internship is over next week) is to get a 2.5"" drive for a Hackintosh setup to learn basic Mac computing and administration. This drive will also have a Linux partition for me to practice terminal as I have hardly any experience with CMD (though I do have some knowledge) never mind Unix/Linux. 

A benefit I would provide to a company is a strong emphasis on security as I tend to keep up with new exploits that come out as well as keeping up to date with the latest malware analysis.

If you were interviewing me (or someone like me) what would be immediate red flags in my resume? What areas should I improve on that I already have a basic form of knowledge in? What would be an immediate red flag to you because I'm lacking it? I would like to prioritize the stuff I should be focusing on concurrently with my school work next year. Recommendations on where to get the information that I'm lacking would be appreciated as well."

I am currently contracted to an on-campus dorm. I made the decision along with my family, that it would be best to move onto an apartment this year, and signed a lease not too long ago. However, when I attempted to get out of my housing contract, I was met with definite backlash. 

They essentially had me put my name on a “release waitlist” without asking for any details of the situation and then I was “denied” the very next morning. Now they are telling me the only way out of the contract is to buy it out for nearly $6,000, unless I simply don’t go to Purdue in the Fall. 

I realize that this is a situation of my own creation, but let me explain a little further. I had contacted the Division of Financial Aid several times in regards to this, as I am a student that relies heavily on financial aid. They ASSURED me that this process would be extremely easy and that getting my financial if transferred to off-campus housing would be easy as 1,2,3. Also, two years ago, I left purdue in the spring for an internship, and when I did that there was almost no resistance to my cancelling my housing contract. It was never made clear to me that I was only allowed to do so because I wasn’t taking classes in the fall. The combination of these factors had me fully believing that this process would be routine. 

Oh how I was wrong. I’ve tried to contact some of the “higher ups” in student housing, but none of them will return my emails. I could have tunnel vision, but as I see it there are only two outcomes here. First is that they cancel my housing contract, somehow, someway. Like I said I am reliant on financial aid and there is no way I can afford to buy out this contract. My second option, it would seem, is to leave Purdue in order to cancel the housing contract. 

This is terrifying. The concept of having to give up my education over a simple lapse in communication and planning has me feeling trapped to say the least.

What's my best move?",samsop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cnmpll/one_month_into_a_new_job_im_being_advised_to/,"I applied as an intern at a local tech firm, where 5 other fresh graduates from my class are interning. They recommended me for a full time position, and immediately moved me onto one of their smaller projects yet one that has been absorbing a lot of their resources. I began a two-week handover with the departing back-end developer and during the second week, a senior developer from a bigger project was assigned to work on mine to help with my on-boarding process etc.

So 3 weeks in, I'd say I'm ok. I'm closing all of my work items, contributing to the code base, and this week was able to integrate a new feature to the app. All with the aforementioned senior's help of course, who helped me get to know their naming conventions, how Azure DevOps works etc.

Until a couple days ago when that senior told me he was leaving. A lot of others revealed they had handed in their resignations as well. 4 people left last week, with 3 more leaving this week. The team working on this project currently lacks a business analyst, architect, and QA person. There are 3 people on the front-end team and soon it will only be me working on the back-end.

On the one hand I feel grateful for being given such a huge responsibility. The pay is not bad and I'm certain I can pave my way up here, then obtain a role with more responsibilities somewhere else.

On the other, this much discontent among staff cannot be a good thing. A lot of them complain that the past few months they've been unsure of the direction the company's headed in, not many new people are coming in etc.

So I guess what I'm trying to ask is are these people misleading me in telling me to leave and go find a more junior role where I won't have that much responsibility and will only be ""learning"" from more senior folks?

Or should I stick to my guns here? I've learned a lot over the past few weeks. My 4 years of college were all about self-learning and improving my skills on my own. This is my first job in a corporate environment but not my first paid project. I'm generally adaptable and I like taking on extra responsibility.

But I don't know how to draw the line between ""extra responsibility"" and being taken advantage of.

Can someone here point me in the right direction, please? My biggest impediment while job hunting was that I didn't have enough professional experience other than internships. Surely I shouldn't quit now that I actually found a job and then repeat that whole cycle?"

I have been job hunting since then with no avail, until a staffing company (Winston Staffing Services)  gave me an offered me a contract for 6 months period (17$ per hr) for the position of IT Help-Desk, I did an interview with the client, asked them what happens after 6 months period, they said they don't know yet if they will hire me full time, or be on a renewal contract again.   


What do you guys think as a first real IT work experience ? should i take it and leave after 6  months ? thank you guys :)"

I am having a hard time landing my first software engineering related job and am currently working as a server at a restaurant. I am wanting to build up my portfolio for potential front-end/full-stack related positions while still making a profit, and I was considering doing some freelance web development.
I was going to start off by offering free website “renovations” as I call them — so targeting companies whose websites are in need of updates or are not as aesthetically upgraded as they could be. I was going to start off doing it for free since I don’t have a current portfolio really so I want to build that up before proposing a business opportunity. 
However since I have no internship or work experience I would love to get some advice regarding how to begin this. 
I’m really interested in this type of development and I’m pretty drawn to the design aspect of websites and stores. 

Some questions in particular that I have:
— any preferred hosting options for freelancers
— any preferred tech stacks? PHP vs Python vs Java etc.
— any advice for how to pursue a business proposition for future jobs
— advice regarding online stores combined with blog (payment options, admin pages, and security options)
— any advice for marketing myself
— anything else you feel I should be aware of before attempting this?

I was also going to reach out to local web development companies to see if I could be a potential intern or reach out about entry level positions even if they aren’t currently hiring. I would love the opportunity to learn from a professional/be a professional before beginning freelance."

I think I may be suffering from depression or something. I was at that job for three years and I was about to complete my internship and start my career and then I messed it all up. I'm 27 years old with the brain of a five year old. I hate myself so much, but the messed up thing is I don't want to kill myself I want to hurt all these other people around me. I just hate that I'm such a vindictive, mean-spirited jealous person. When people first meet me though I come across as sweet, shy and very timid and introverted. I have so much contempt for people which I guess is down to (and I would NEVER admit this out loud in MY LIFE) the deep hatred I have for myself. I also feel really guilty and ashamed for the person I am and how I've treated my family growing up. And I've been smoking weed daily for the last two years which is probably where I fucked up.

""You want me to what?"" complained Enid.

""Answer questions with the Ouija board,"" explained the robotic psychic, ""since none of my viewers can see or hear you.  To help them comprehend the unspeakable forces to which I am attuned, I need you to move the planchette across the Ouija board.""

""Fine.""

""17, please resume the stream,"" Madame Zener ordered her assistant.  

Enid noted the distinct versionist way in which the cybernetic swami referred to her less expensive assistants and mentally set it aside later as possible evidence of megalomania and narcissism.  Also added to the mental case file Enid was building on Madame Zener were the opulent set dressings of the broadcast studio to which the group had relocated.  The burgundy velvet curtains, the signed celebrity selfies, and the tastefully obscured circuit diagram marked Z-1.98-R all indicated a rather inflated sense of self-worth. 

""We're live in 5, 4, 3, 2..."" the android designated 17 ended the countdown with a point to Madame Zener.

""Welcome back, loyal viewers!  Having successfully located the spirit of Enid Hughes.  We have retired to my parlor for a more intimate con-""

""When are we going to get to the part about the constitutional convention?"" interrupted Enid.

Without skipping a beat, Zener continued ""-versation!  We'll be going to viewer questions in a moment, but..."" the Madame cautioned with a sidelong glance at Enid, ""her spirit is restless.  The Post-Mortem Podcast and it's subsidiary Madame Zener LLC are not responsible for any hauntings, paranormal disturbances, or ectoplasm clean-up fees caused by offending the spirits with inane questions.""

Enid quirked a brow at the last bit.  ""Do you get sued for ectoplasm clean-up fees often?""

Madame Zener cleared her throat noncommittally before announcing, ""Our first question comes from JackedSkellington69 -""

Enid moved the planchette to the skull and crossbones symbol while flatly promising, ""Haunted.""

""Our next question comes from Lord-of-the-Dead-1776?"" broached the android.

With a smirk, Enid moved the planchette to Yes.

""Do you, Enid Hughes, solemnly swear (or affirm) that you will support and defend the UNderworld...there's that funny capitalization again... against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter. So help you Hades?""

Enid was really curious now, and patiently spelled out ""W-H-A-T-O-F-F-I-C-E""

Zener took a moment to parse the phrase before announcing to the camera.  ""Wonderful news, Lord-of-the-Dead-1776! The ghost of Enid Hughes has seen fit to respond.  Truly the ghosts of our makers smile upon you this day!""

""How do you know the viewer is an AI?""

""Ah.  One moment viewers, our dearly departed guest has a question.""  The psychic turned away from the camera and muttered quietly, ""Because YouTube only counts live viewers on its stream metrics, and none of you humans fit that description anymore.""  Returning to the camera, the medium explained, ""The spirit of Enid Hughes wishes to know the position she is being offered""  After a moments pause, the android added, ""and whether I, as the closest thing she has to next of kin, can receive her salary in her stead...how exceedingly generous of her.""

Narcissist, Enid decided.

After a few moments, a cheerful chirp indicated a new reply.  Madame Zener very nearly malfunctioned as she read the response.  Hurriedly and without consulting Enid, the android promised.  ""Yes, she agrees to be your ambassador.  A thousand times yes.""  She started fanning herself, not that her chassis was harmed by the ambient temperature.  ""22, be a dear and summon a limousine.""

""I haven't said yes yet,"" protested Enid.

""My dear, I did tell you why I was sent for you.  Also, under no circumstances could I possibly decline the generous inheritance you left me of my very own show on the History Channel.  How did you know that was what I always wanted?""

Enid suspected a clever intern in some branch of a three letter agency.  ""Fine fine.  What am I supposed to be negotiating then?""

""Ah ah ah! The planchette, child.""

With a grunt and a frown, Enid angrily swiped out.  ""Yes.  W-H-A-T T-E-R-M-S D-O...""

Before Enid could even finish one of Madame Zener's assistance called out, ""He tweeted that he wants suffrage and proportional representation for ghosts.""

""Our loyal viewer Lord-of-the-Dead-1776 seems to be a bit of a psychic himself,"" mused Madame Zener.  

The assistant added ""And there's a direct message that I'm not supposed to read on the air.""

""Very well GR7,"" conceded the celebrity.  ""Thank you loyal viewers.  Be sure to tune in when the convention starts, as I'm sure we'll be broadcasting from there, but also keep on the lookout for unscheduled candid broadcasts between now and then!""

""We're clear!"" confirmed 17 as the set lights were extinguished.

Enid breathed a sigh of relief as she tossed the already-much-hated planchette to one side.  ""So how do you plan on getting me access to the constitutional convention?""

""Perhaps the direct message has a clue? GR7, what's in the direct message?""

""The address for the US embassy...former US embassy?...and a passcode for the employee entrance""  GR7 explained before adding, ""Some of the higher end models there did have citzenship, right? Do you think any of us who can pass a Turing test will get citzenship now?""

""We're about to get citzenship for ghosts, even an AI so lowly as a toaster might be a citizen now,"" snarked the uppity Madame Zener.

""That's even assuming your fellow AIs choose to utilize human concepts like nationality and citizenship,"" speculated Enid.  ""Both you and GR7 clearly have relatively human mentalities, but a lot of the AIs used by national governments don't.""

""Are you saying that I might be...demoted to a non-citizen?""

""I'm saying an AI whose body is a massive underground facility powered by geothermal energy or a network of solar powered satellites is going to necessarily have different priorities even before we get into the fact their IQs are probably measured in the thousands, they are often wired for efficiency rather than sympathy...I mean your parts could be salvaged for a drone charging station.  Heck, if I was a really aggressive AI with the gear for hacking, I'd just delete your personality and put mine in your chassis.""

Madame Zener paled.  GR7 was only equipped to make a gasping sound.  The remainder of the assistants didn't seem to have enough sentience or self-preservation to be particularly concerned at the revelation.

""22.  Tell the limousine to hurry...and turn off the wifi."""

When I'm observing in mob programming and I make a suggestion on what course of action the driver should take, it often gets dismissed very quickly or ignored. When someone else backs up my suggestion or they suggest it themselves, it gets listened to. I must admit that when I'm explaining what to do, it can come out a little jumbled because I find it difficult to articulate technical concepts to other people. I find it much easier to work in a normal manner (no mob/pair programming) and be given the chance to experiment with the problem on my own without anyone watching over my shoulder.

Last year I got diagnosed with ADD and have been taking medication ever since. Everything went better from then, and my grades were higher than ever. I had no problem with working 8-11 hours a day on big assignments without even having the smallest distraction.

Due to lack of time I decided to do my thesis over the summer, and was convinced I would keep the same drive and work ethic as I had in the past year. But my pharmacist didn’t have any dexamphetamine (It’s made on prescription and needs to be ordered), and so up to this day I still haven’t had any medication for the entire summer. 

Now I have been lying to everyone about working really hard for my thesis while I haven’t done shit. I kept telling myself “you still have enough time, next week you will work really hard” and ended up doing nothing. It’s too late now to actually do something about it, since the deadline is next week and the work I need to put into it is around 400 hours… 

I’m so sick of lying all the time and just want to tell the truth, but I’m afraid of the reactions and consequences because of it. In a few weeks I’m starting my first job and now I’m scared they will fire me if they find out I didn’t get my diploma (It’s not clear if this would be the case, because it has never been explicitly told to me, but I think they assume I will have it, since I did my internship there).

I know I should just get it out of the way and tell the truth, but I fear they won’t understand how I felt anxious this entire summer and will just say I did this to myself and I shouldn’t have been lazy. How can I make It clear that I have been struggling really hard with doing the work I should’ve done? Should I be transparent about it with my future workplace? 

At this moment I really hate myself for not putting in the work, because there is so much on the line."

I’m 17 and just graduated high school. I’ve been really worried about my career and what I’m going to do for the rest of my life because I could never decide. As you can tell, I chose to start in IT. So I started studying for the A+ certification to get a basic knowledge of computers and its components. After a few weeks of being overwhelmed, I get bored and stop. Few days later my dad is telling me that they’re looking for interns at his job, specifically help desk interns. So obviously I’m hesitant because “I still pretty much know nothing”, but still it doesn’t hurt to try. And now I just finished my first day and it was great! 
Honestly I understand that I got REALLY lucky. I know about people who’ve studied for months and are multi certified and still couldn’t get a job and I’m just a kid who’s never even replaced RAM before. So I just wanted to share my story about how I got into IT.

What classes should you take before starting research? (e.g. Do you need 473 for algorithms or is 374 enough? For machine learning, is 440 enough to start or do you also need 446? For computer organization, is 233 enough or do you need 433 as well?)

I am asking because it is difficult to take some of the electives until second semester junior year or senior year.

If I do not do research until senior year, will my application to top grad schools (including UIUC) be underwhelming?

Also, if I am aiming for graduate school but also want to leave industry as an option, should I focus on research during the summer or internships? Appreciate the help!"
cnrzd2,1,2019-08-08,End of Internship Advice (LONG),Intern080819,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cnrzd2/end_of_internship_advice_long/,"Hi all. I'm finishing up a summer internship in IT and have managed to swing a part-time job continuing some of the projects initiated but not completed by myself and several of the other summer interns (which works well around my school schedule). I have a situation, however, and would like to ask your advice regarding how I should resolve it.

Today was our big summer presentation, and I’m presuming tomorrow (our final day) will be exit interviews and the like to smooth along the process of our leaving. My brother had a similar experience when student teaching, and gave his mentors gift bags, and they also gave him a gift basket (New Teacher Starter Kit, of sorts), while commenting that several student teachers don’t do this and come off looking bad about it.

As such, I got it in my head that this was a typical reciprocal expectation in these sorts of situations, and had a few gifts pre-planned for my mentors and managers (and I always have a small cache with a few generic “safety” gifts that I can take from in case I needed to give them to more lower-end people like other part-timers or contracters).

Following the presentation, however, it seems that there was no real expectation of such an exchange, and neither the other interns nor the mentors/managers were doing such a thing. Luckily, I had left my stuff in my backpack, so there was no overt problem, but now I’m unsure about what to do. Should I give the main gifts out anyway, or will it seem too much like trying to be a brownnoser, particularly since I will continue to be working with these people for an indefinite time period?

I shouldn’t have a problem re-purposing the gifts otherwise (they’re specific to who I was going to give them to, but many people have similar interests) but I’m just a ball of anxiety right now. However, I have a pretty good relationship with them and this is the best place I’ve ever worked (actual job, friendly coworkers, relaxed but productive atmosphere, managers/directors with reasonable expectations and encouraging feedback), so I wouldn’t mind gifting them even without being done in turn, but just don’t want to set an obligate social/gift debt cycle going or to shame them for not having gotten me anything.

What would be your take on either side of the situation? If you were me and had these gifts just loaded and ready to go? If you were the coworkers/managers and got gifts but hadn’t gotten anything to give in return and would have to see me even after the internship with that hanging over you?

Any advice/help would be much appreciated.

tl;dr: Internship is ending (though I will continue working there part-time) and I bought gifts for my mentors and manager, expecting there to be a reciprocal exchange like what happens following student-teaching. I got nothing today (the big presentation/ceremony) and the final day is tomorrow. Should I give them anyway (while potentially being a brownnoser and/or gift-shamer while having to continue working alongside these people) or just hold onto them to give on some other occasion and/or to some other person?"

I'm in my final year of CS and I'm wondering what kind of opportunities might await me in a certain specialization.

Blockchain seems like a bad word (most of the posts mentioning the b word are downvoted to hell), but give me a chance here. 

I got interested in Bitcoin as a high schooler, got called a nerd, amassed some holdings and generally looked at blockchain with a business mind.

Earlier in university, I did non-technical consulting with a blockchain shop (which is stagnating, haha) and I co-authored a research paper on blockchain tech with a Prof in my CS Dept.

Despite this, I've barely touched contract code, aside from a one time stint with Solidity.

Like a responsible cscq reader, I got myself an enterprise internship and I'll probably be able to stay on after I get my degree. Like a responsible nerd, I pull up crypto price charts every once and a while, but that's it.

Now that blockchain technology isn't so *so* overinflated, I'm wondering if anyone is hiring dedicated blockchain developers, and if yes, what are they looking for?

Or is blockchain still just the b word?

TL; DR did anyone start taking blockchain seriously, or should I keep writing regular old code?"

I'm an student from the UK who applied to HYPMS and a few other great colleges in the US last year.
In hindsight, my stats were pretty shitty (30 ACT and 720/730 SAT II Math 2 and Chem) albeit I didn't prepare for the tests that well (I started prep a week or two before test day because I was busy with school work).
I had pretty good A levels predictions (3 A* and 1 A)
I got rejected everywhere and waitlisted (and eventually rejected) at UChicago.

I'm currently waiting for my A-Level results in the next few weeks. 

I'm thinking about possibly taking a gap year to do a few internships and placements in London and reapplying to the same US colleges and some new ones which have decent FA for intl students. I'm also developing an app and have started a small local business since my last application.

The thing I'm concerned about is that most of the research I've done online says that the chances of admission are pretty much impossible when reapplying.

Assuming that I do considerably better this time round for my ACT and SAT II and with the bonus points of the work I do during the gap year...
Is it even worth reapplying?

Any help is MUCH APPRECIATED!"

First time posting here but I've lurked for a while. I graduated with a BAS in Cybersecurity this past June and have been working on a SOC as an intern doing security analyst work with a company of 10,000+ employees in a large U.S. City for the past 4 months. I've been applying for full time work over the past few months at several different companies and one position is with the same company I'm interning with. Just got a verbal offer today with a written offer coming sometime next week from this company.

The amount offered is just under $67k + benefits. Doing some research on glassdoor (and other sites) this seems a bit low. Glassdoor lists this position with this company as $72k-$110k. I have no prior salary negotiation experience and my only other IT experience was working a help desk position at my college for 9 months prior to this internship. I do have my Sec+ certification FWIW. The position is a Security Operations Engineer and the posting asked for 3+ years experience so I know I'm under-qualified but also don't want to settle for less than I could get. I really enjoy the company, the people, and the culture so I'm thrilled they have offered me the position but want to get what I'm worth while also not pricing myself out.

I'd appreciate any advice on how to negotiate and what might be a fair counter offer. My initial thought is countering with $78k with the hope of them meeting me halfway at around $72-73k.

Thanks in advance!"

I’m 21, biggest rough patch I’ve had in a while. And that’s saying a lot. 

I just dropped out of school, no car, no friends, single, can’t even get hired at a fast food place, trapped in my parents house all day unless my dad takes me somewhere or my mother lets me drive her car. Its not necessarily my parents fault, they WANT me to have independence, but so many circumstances all falling together is preventing me from having that. I haven’t bought my own car yet because my dad said he’d buy me one for me when I graduate, so as a result I saved my minimum wage money for other things during college, and I went to school far away as well. Now I’m not going back to school (which is fine with him and he’s still willing to get me a car) but I have no idea when and I’m pretty much trapped in my fucking house all day. I’m in group therapy, the oldest one there and the only one who doesn’t have their own car. Not even a beat up 90s Toyota. I’m horrible at maintaining friendships and I decide to bite the bullet sometimes and initiate convos with old friends. Either I’m the one who has to make all the effort following that or they just ghost me after I tell them how my life is going. I’m thinking about saving up to get a car myself, but I’ve never had a job above $8 an hour and I don’t know how I’ll be able to do better than Dollar Tree at this point. My goals by this next year are to be planning to move out into my own apartment and having an actual job, but it’s hard to see that happening right now I know it’s not the right choice AT ALL but being back in school made me feel so much more secure in myself, like I was being successful and had a purpose in life. Even if my major that I changed 3 times really had NOTHING to do with want I know I want to do now (screenwriting). I was one of the “smart” kids in high school, and I’m sure everyone with mediocre GPAs who have internships at Fox and Comcast are fucking laughing at me right now that the only shit I can put on my resume is retail and Route 44s from fucking Sonic. I am so embarrassed about my life to the point I deactivated my social media because I have nothing good to share. I know it could be much worse, but when most of your peers are suburban middle/upper middle class white people who were blessed with social skills, I’m basically the bottom of their barrel.

It’s hard for me date, too. Hard as hell. I can’t help but think that people (old and new) stop talking to me when they see where my life is. I had a date planned with a guy I was beginning to become comfortable with and suddenly he ghosted me and unmatched me. I tried to catch up with another old friend I kind of had feelings for and told him what was up, he never replied. Guess I shared too much about my pathetic life. 

I know it’s gotta get better. I’m looking into grocery stores to work at and trade schools to go to in order to train for a decent job so I can begin saving for a car and to move out. I’m trying to join groups on the Meetup app to be social (and hopefully not be judged) I guess what stresses me out is that it seems to be taking so long (even though I only dropped out last month). I’m really trying not to rush things and trying not to compare myself but I have to keep my distance from some friends and family who have so much going for them right now so they don’t think lower of me. 

Just trying to keep a happy face right now even though I just want to cry. I could go on about my cousins and my brother’s stepsiblings and everyone else who knows what they’re doing but I don’t want to ramble."

I’ve now realized after taking AP Biology that I don’t really think the field is for me, and after taking grade 12 physics and calculus that I much prefer physics, and after doing research into upper level physics it’s something that appeals to me. Physics is something the university I’ve applied to is fairly weak in, and while I could get a bachelors of science just fine I’d like to pursue grad school to enter into a research field. There are next to no options for internships and networking offered at my university, and so it would make it difficult for me to pursue further education after my degree.

So now I’m considering transferring schools to something like university of Toronto, a more competitive school but one that is better suited to what Id like to do, but I’m concerned that my high school marks may hold me back if I try and transfer after my first year. In high school I struggled with mental health issues and dropped the ball hard on my non science courses, I averaged about 85 in science and math (90 for just physics and math) but I got 70s in other courses and absolutely flunked computer science with a 45.

Is it at all possible that if I haul ass in my first year and study my ass off that I’d be able to make up the slack and enter in to a more competitive university? Or am I just shit out of luck for fucking up my non-science courses?"

I am an intern at a manufacturing business. An employee who quit called and said he was coming to retrieve his toolbox. Apparently he also left a threatening message (I'm not sure how threatening).

The company decided to lock all of the doors except the large garage door in the back, which was left wide open with someone sitting in a chair ""guarding"" the door. Upper management's logic was that they wanted the ex-employee to enter in the back where he would have an escort to take him to retrieve his toolbox. 

When we asked the guy guarding the door what was going on, he replied, ""I'm not supposed to tell.""

Nobody knew there was any sort of threat or lockdown, so people were walking outside on their break, and getting locked out and having to go around to the back to get back in.

Even a cop showed up, just in case a anything went south (I found out all this information through the grapevine). Nobody had any idea what was happening, which was alarming.

I feel like my safety, and others, were compromised, because I was purposely not alerted of any possible threat. And the fact that the garage door was wide open while all other doors were locked seemed very odd and unfair.

Is there any obligation for employers to tell their employees if there is a lockdown or threat? 

What are my rights as an employee?

Is there any law that states you need to have a lockdown when there is a threat?

TL,DR: My workplace received a threatening message (not sure how threatening) from an ex-employee. He came today to get his toolbox.
Management locked all doors except for our giant garage door where the shop workers are. They had a police officer show up just to be safe. They chose not to tell any of the employees about any sort of threat or lockdown, or to not to go outside (employees went outside and got locked out). We had no idea what was going on which was alarming.

co0i3n,1,2019-08-09,Everything will be okay 😁,geralthawke,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/co0i3n/everything_will_be_okay/,"So from where I can start? I lost my father when I was 17 years old and since then everything is changed in our family. He used to have a construction company where my mom worked as his secretary. Since his passing, the company went into bankruptcy, we struggle to pay the credit card bills made by my mom but in the end we finished paying it.

Since then my mom married three times. My first stepfather was a decent guy and got a decent job, everything looked better but life laughed to us because he dies after two years of marriage.  After that she married again twice and this marriage is not recognised by the government because my mother do it in 'islamic' way (your marriage is legal if you have 2 witness and have a clerk to unite the couple and husband can divorce using talak and if he does that my mother can't sue the husband). Every time my mother remarried, my second brother and sister were against it, they want my mother to concentrate to pray more, to do positive things because she's old and somehow according to them it's better thing to do for my mom rather than marrying someone. 

I am not against it, as long as my mom is happy, my mom can do whatever she wants to do, I dont care if she marry 100 times to be honest but the last ex husband and now husband are such losers. They don't have fixed jobs and struggle to keep my mother life in a proper way and that makes me sad.

Untill now they struggle to live, they still can eat but that's it and the guy that marry my mom doesn't even have an apartment so they live together in our house, so basically (I really don't want to say this but he's kind of a parasite) . As you know, my house is crumbling right now because it's very old and this worries me a lot.

My oldest brother used to work in mining company and as you know you get A LOT OF MONEY if you work in this area. Around 2002, the government has decided to stop do the export of nickel so before he got fired, my brother resigned from the company, since then he hasn't found any more work as a geologist once he tried to resurrect my father's company and to do that we had to sell our house (we used to have two, I know.. #richlyfe) but even if we sold one is not enough to maintain the company and in the end it went bankrupt again. Fortunately he works as a driver in Uber, at least he can earn some money to give to his family. 

Meanwhile my sister she's a doctor (well kind of),  my late father always wanted that she became a doctor and she made it. However she married to another doctor in which he's quite conservative, so he wants my sister to be stay at mother. Once the husband angry because my sister went to the hospital with Uber with a Male driver (I can't believe it)

However my sister doesn't want to, and since then she work as a doctor again after lot of fight in which these fights led them to almost a divorce, but in the end they didn't do it because of the two childs they have. Ironically even she's a doctor, my sister has a multiple sclerosis in which she has to take some kind of a serum to help her each month this serum costs a lot. They have to give her the serum because if they don't give that, it will effect my sister memory. Earlier this year my sister almost doesn't remember how to read, doesn't remember almost everything, and she cant move her body, her brain went like uninstall by itself, luckily in the end (I don't know if it exist) miracle happened, she gained her memory back.

So now we pass to my other brother. Well I can consider he's the most successful in terms of career in out family, he works in an American construction company, he went to USA to represent his company. Everything's good right? Nope, my brother has a tumour in his testicle around 7 years ago and they had to remove it. So right now he's a guy with one ball, the doctor told him it's almost impossible to have a kid but luckily now he has one healthy kid. 

Two years ago I think, he went to oculist because he had a problem with his eyes. In the end, the doctor discovered he has a tumour between the eye. The operation went successful but there are still pieces that lives in between my brother's eyes and it could make my brother's blind if not being treated right.

And then there's me, can't even find jobs, or good paid internship and my scholarship is ending, so my stay permit in Europe and there's only 50 euro in my bank account. I know I should have done better but someday I feel bad about myself, not being able to contribute to my family.

So that's what's up for me but  everything will be all right 😁"

I'm 27 yo and I have a Master Degree in Computer Science. I graduated one year ago with full marks and since october of last year I started my first job ever as software developer for a rather big company around my place.

In my country (Italy), there is plenty of job opportunities but there unfortunately is a huge mentality of exploiting young workers, especially in the south and in small/medium companies.

In fact I had lots of job interviews who went very well but their offering has always been rather laughable, requiring most of the times unpaid full time internships lasting months - if not years - before (a chance!) of being eventually hired. 

After all of the searching, only two companies had a reasonable proposal and I ended up accepting one of those, with a full time job on a permanent contract. Also salary is very good, since the company is pretty big.

I was hired as a Java developer, since my whole academic experience was with that language but my interviewers well knew of course that I hadn't any professional expertise since it was my very first job in my life.

Me and the other two freshly hired colleagues have been working for 8 months as consultants on a huge project involving a complex software system used in multiple regions of my country. 

At the start it wasn't very easy for me because I was the less experienced one in the team but after a few weeks I got the hang of it. The things we had to develop weren't extremely difficult per se (CRUD operations alike) but the complexity of the system definetely was, considering I never had experience of a real software system made of maaaaany modules at university. And of course we had do stick to their coding conventions/practices which weren't standard at all (e.g. well known frameworks/patterns).

Things went well for the most part until in the last 4 months or so problems start to develop between my company and the company we were working for as consultants and in the end they parted ways.

Of course working in this last time frame was terrible for me, because we knew they weren't 100% happy about our work and gradually it was subtly clear our clients wanted (at least some of us) out. 

Now I'm back in my company and my boss redirected me to another project.

The problem is that we're talking about, again, of a huge software system, and furthermore in a language I have ZERO experience with.

He told me he expects me to be productive in a few weeks or so but no training was or will be provided. 

I've been looking the code for the past days but it really seems like a huge waste of time, it's annoying and frustrating. I really don't like this situation and I go back home very unhappy and sad only thinking about the next day at work. I'm really starting to ask myself if this really is what I want to do as job in my life.

Thing is, since university, I've never been too much enthsiastic about programming. I mean, not that I HATE programming, but it's like OK for me, nothing too special about it. Unlike some other colleagues, for example, I NEVER had the curiosity of learning things by myself out of classes. I had these collegues always talking about this new language or that new tool. Or maybe they took online courses in their free time. For me free time has always been free time. After uni lessons I never wanted to see a line of code for the rest of the day or anything related. 

It's the same for me now at work. I think I just lack the passion. Also working with an unknown language, in a very complex project isn't helping at all. It's just making things worse, making me feel useless. 

I don't want of course to be a burden for my company, but most of all I'm seriously questioning if this is the job for me. After all, when I had my first programming classes back at uni (never did coding at school) it was a nightmare learning it. At the end it was very satisfing, cannot deny it, and both my degrees score speak for themselves....but I always had since then this feeling of this not being the right path for me.

I don't think it's about my company itself, the work environment is good (especially compared where I was as consultant in the past months) and the colleagues are great but I can't stand the idea of not liking it or even worse costantly having anxiety of deadlines and uncertainties typal of consultant jobs. One day you are in a given project for a client, then all of a sudden they change their mind and you're out. At this point you have to start all over again. How is anyone supposed to be able to have a professional growth like this?

I'm really considering the idea of resigning and looking for a completely different carrer even if this means ditching 5 years of studies and all the money spent for it. 

What are your thoughts?"
co1mkm,2,2019-08-09,I need advice on how I should handle this job going forward,ITThrowaway2019,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/co1mkm/i_need_advice_on_how_i_should_handle_this_job/,"So I left a T1 helpdesk role for a role as a network coordinator for a hospital to be their onsite guy as the previous team has moved to traveling and doing projects. This seemed like a step in the right direction for me to get toward my goal as a network engineer so I was excited.

I've now been in the role around a month and they've decided my duties will be nothing but installs and managing inventory. Which I feel is a step backward since I have a CCNA Security and plan to sit on the CCNA R&amp;S before my wedding at the beginning of September. 

Would I be wrong to jump at the next good offer that comes my way to prevent damaging my career as I was only on the helpdesk for 8 months. I also have around a 3 month internship for my local county government I did my senior year of college. It would have been longer but the paperwork made it start later than everyone wanted.

I'm going to include my current job description at the bottom because it sounds nothing like hardware install and inventory management to me. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation with a bait and switch on job duties before? How do you even handle this?



Job description below:

co2qwt,3,2019-08-09,Co-op Work Experience,EAS893,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/co2qwt/coop_work_experience/,"Current IT worker at a large manufacturing company here.

My undergraduate degree is in engineering, and I did a co-op with an engineering firm in the telecom industry during undergrad.  It was an alternating semester plan consisting of a semester of full time work followed by a semester of school for 6 semesters total and 3 semesters of work for about a year total of full time work experience.

Is a co-op work experience typically counted as full time experience in the application process, or is it looked upon more like an internship?"
co316t,1,2019-08-09,End of Internship Advice (LONG),Intern080819,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/co316t/end_of_internship_advice_long/,"Hi all. I'm finishing up a summer internship in IT and have managed to swing a part-time job continuing some of the projects initiated but not completed by myself and several of the other summer interns (which works well around my school schedule). I have a situation, however, and would like to ask your advice regarding how I should resolve it.

Yesterday was our big summer presentation, and I’m presuming today (our final day) will be exit interviews and the like to smooth along the process of our leaving. My brother had a similar experience when student teaching, and gave his mentors gift bags, and they also gave him a gift basket (New Teacher Starter Kit, of sorts), while commenting that several student teachers don’t do this and come off looking bad about it.

As such, I got it in my head that this was a typical reciprocal expectation in these sorts of situations, and had a few gifts pre-planned for my mentors and managers (and I always have a small cache with a few generic “safety” gifts that I can take from in case I needed to give them to more lower-end people like other part-timers or contracters).

Following the presentation, however, it seems that there was no real expectation of such an exchange, and neither the other interns nor the mentors/managers were doing such a thing. Luckily, I had left my stuff in my backpack, so there was no overt problem, but now I’m unsure about what to do. Should I give the main gifts out anyway, or will it seem too much like trying to be a brownnoser, particularly since I will continue to be working with these people for an indefinite time period?

I shouldn’t have a problem re-purposing the gifts otherwise (they’re specific to who I was going to give them to, but many people have similar interests) but I’m just a ball of anxiety right now. However, I have a pretty good relationship with them and this is the best place I’ve ever worked (actual job, friendly coworkers, relaxed but productive atmosphere, managers/directors with reasonable expectations and encouraging feedback), so I wouldn’t mind gifting them even without being done in turn, but just don’t want to set an obligate social/gift debt cycle going or to shame them for not having gotten me anything.

What would be your take on either side of the situation? If you were me and had these gifts just loaded and ready to go? If you were the coworkers/managers and got gifts but hadn’t gotten anything to give in return and would have to see me even after the internship with that hanging over you?

My social anxiety is really locking me down in this situation. I've been trying to be as outgoing as possible in this internship, which seems to have resulted in some good relationships, but my social intelligence is not a strength, so I'm looking for outside opinions.

Any advice/help would be much appreciated. 

tl;dr: Internship is ending (though I will continue working there part-time) and I bought gifts for my mentors and manager, expecting there to be a reciprocal exchange like what happens following student-teaching. I got nothing today (the big presentation/ceremony) and the final day is tomorrow. Should I give them anyway (while potentially being a brownnoser and/or gift-shamer while having to continue working alongside these people) or just hold onto them to give on some other occasion and/or to some other person?"

Currently, I am wrapping up a summer data science internship at a Fortune 500 company, and this internship has really allowed me to explore and understand the possibilities of data science and machine learning. 

I realized that my school's efforts to be data driven is primarily focused on data analysis, visualization, and understanding data. However, there is a lot of untapped potential in machine learning that my school can use to benefit. I am thinking about returning to that part time work study position in my senior year, but this time pitching to the school executives to actually make use of the data we have through machine learning.

Below are a couple of ideas I have:

1. Use data science to better optimize fundraising efforts. 
2. Use data science to predict which students are most likely to drop out, so that they can be given more attention and help. 

I realize that there are so many other possibilities. If you all could help me brainstorm, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!"
co3aki,6,2019-08-09,Not transferring when I had the chance ruined my college career and experience; and I hate myself for it.,BrilliantClass4,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/co3aki/not_transferring_when_i_had_the_chance_ruined_my/,"I'm a 22 y/o student going into his senior year at PCT in Williamsport, PA. 

To put it simply, my college years have been a rollercoaster. My first year was night and day, with my first semester being a huge success (3.73 GPA and spot on Dean's List) and my second being a disaster (nearly 2.9 GPA). Right after my second semester I had an absolutely awful summer internship experience in Michigan - worst two months of my life. It was at that point that I nearly decided to quit and move on to a new college with a new major. But I gave it a second chance. 

Since then, I changed my major from culinary arts to business management and hospitality over last summer, and it has paid off academically. Hovered around 3.5 GPA's since last Spring and finish with a 4.0 GPA for this year's Spring semester. Yet I'm still not happy. The reason:

My social life in college has absolutely sucked. I'm a reserved person but I'm pretty social and I've gone out of my own way to try to make friends within my own program and outside, but it hasn't worked. Most of my classmates are very nice people but are some of the most unsociable people I've ever met. They're practically all bookworms and have no life outside of school. Most of them are commuters too, so campus is completely and utterly dead on the weekends. Add to this the fact that the college has next to nothing in terms of interesting clubs and activities (which the students barely take advantage of) and you have the recipe for a very miserable social life. 

Meanwhile most of my friends from high school (some of which I'm still very close with) are having the times of their lives. And here I am, going to graduate in a year having made no real connection or any possible life-long friends upon graduation. I hate myself right now for not changing schools when I had the chance after my awful internship experience. 

I know I can really do nothing about it now and will have to make the best of things my last year but man - I just wish I could've gone a different route after high school. 

Anyone else been in this situation?"

It was recently that i was able to snag a paid, part time marketing internship at an automotive technology company. I want to state that I LOVE this company. The people are great, the work environment is just my speed, and overall this company is screaming me. However, things have not been going good at home. My mom is constantly stressing herself and everyone else in our family out because of her job. She currently works in health care and she will not shut up about how shes going to get canned and that we are going to be living on the street. She also makes snyde comments about how we wont have health insurance, how much she hates her job, and its been getting to me. As a result I have developed several stress conditions and one is insomnia. I am kept up at night wondering how bad things are gonna get fucked up. Am i doing enough in my job search to help, what the hell is gonna happen in the future, yadda  yadda, blah, blah, blah. Unfortunately, this has been starting to affect my work life as well.

Recently, i was invited to sit in on a major meeting with the CEO and CFO of the company to discuss new features for our product. Their talking and im paying attention untill my eyelids start to droop. I try to keep myself awake and want to go to the bathroom desperately to splash some cold water on my face to wake my self up. However, there are like 8 other high ranking people in this room and i dont want to appear rude by leaving abruptly. I try to tough it out and i ultimately fail. I shut my eyes for a second and im out. I am then awoken by the CEO and the entire room looking at me. the CEO asks me if i was alright I say yes and try to play it off as nothing but after a meeting with my boss i fear that i may have just fucked up my opportunity at a full time job at this place.

TL:DR: I fell asleep in an important meeting"

The first is a local government job in a city water lab. Basically it's doing routine analysis on drinking water and wastewater samples. I've been in a fairly poorly paid internship here to qualify for the job for the last 3 months. I like the work fine, though it's my first time doing full-time in a while and the pace is certainly different. Pay is \~48k, really solid medical and the like, and the possibility of a pension (though I'm not sure if it'll be relevant in 30 years when I'll actually have the chance to take it).

As I was doing this internship, an old application suddenly appeared to be a part-time Project Manager at a local university. Basically, the work here is doing natural language processing (machine learning focused on written text) to provide feedback to students handing in lab reports. I'd work with students to get informed consent, manage databases, and tweak the software. I have a background in programming, education, and lab science (whence the first job), so this is a really interesting confluence of many things I've done in the past. I was able to negotiate to \~40k for 19.25 hrs/week), but the position is on a 2-year grant, which as always may or may not be renewed. There's also a possibility of it being made full-time at the end of those two years, though again that's up to finding funding. There are limited benefits, though the medical is very expensive for part-time (something like $581/month, which I'm not sure is subsidized at all). 

I am leaning towards the project manager gig. I had been working part-time as a tutor before and the combination of that flexible schedule with the financial stability of being on salary (and therefore not having to chase down clients all the time) really appeals to me. I also feel like there's a lot more opportunity for growth in that position. 

The job at the water lab however is extremely stable and I know there is a lot of gloom and doom about a potential recession hitting in the next few years. Indeed, my roommates think I'm crazy for not wanting to lock down the stable gig.

**Work Experience:** I am going to start from the latter. And divide it between full time and part time:

**FULL TIME**

November '18 to Present. I am working for a Spanish Engineering Company as Responsible for Sales and Business Development in Dominican Republic (I am an expat). We mainly work with hotels, either building new ones or renovating existing ones (We make electrical, plumbing, HVAC and telecomunications installations). My counterparts at hotesl range from Maintenace Managers for single Resorts to Coporative Technical Chiefs or Expansion Directors. Since I am here we have had around 25 Million dollars in sales. I dont manage anybody directly since I am the only person within the commercial department in the country but I have to manage people of other departments often. I also have quite an exposure to the our company C-suite. My boss is the General Manager for the Americas (we have offices in Mexico, Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Miami) and when the CFO, COO and CEO come to visit the country I spend all the time with them, I prepare their agenda, go to the meetings with the clients with them, go to diner, etc. I am the responsible for sales but I also perform technical job when needed, I have had to cover for colleagues holidays and be site manager for weeks in some projects (think +200MM$ Resorts with around 1000 rooms).

April '16 to October '18. I worked as a Business Development Manager for Spain and Latin America at a Polish Company, manufacturer of construction materials. I work remotely from Spain and I traveled within Spain and all over Latin America (Mexico, Chile, Panama,..). I was able to open several markets in which we had no previous presence and build network of distributors as well as engineering/designer companies that recommended our products in their projects.

October '15 to March '16. I worked as an intern within the Export Department of the abovementioned Polish company.

Decemeber '12 to May '13. While I was doing my Exchange Year in Zaragoza I work as an intern within the Quality Operations department at the factory General Motors had there.

**PART TIME**

April '16 to Present. I have been working as Business Development Consultant or ""Agent"" in my free time. These are some of the deals I have pulled off:

* I got a contrat for a portuguese company, food producer, with the largest hipermarket company in Russia. They had never sold anything in Russia.
* I worked as an agent in Spain for an Indian Company, producer of wearing parts for agriculture. They had no previous clients in Spain and I found a very good client that is now buying around half a million dollars per year.
* I have made some imports of agricultural machinery from austria and germany.

**Target schools**: I am looking for programs that  either have STEM certification or have majors with STEM certification because I want to stay working in the USA and the 3 year OPT extension is a huge factor to achieve it. Some schools that fulfill this are:

co6q63,3,2019-08-09,Startup CEO refusing to pay back deferred wages as stated in signed contract amendment.,ShmDoubleO,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/co6q63/startup_ceo_refusing_to_pay_back_deferred_wages/,"So I'll provide a short version of my backstory below, but if you're  curious, I posted in detail about this situation as of a few months ago  in the following post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/bnq4u8/at\_a\_startup\_moneys\_tight\_is\_my\_boss\_asking\_too/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/bnq4u8/at_a_startup_moneys_tight_is_my_boss_asking_too/)

BACKSTORY:

I'm  working at a startup, which is a public micro-cap company with a market  cap of roughly $4 million. They became public through a reverse merger.  This past October the company ran into some financial troubles, and I  was told that the officers had stopped paying themselves a few months  prior to this, and that things had gotten to a point where they needed me to sign a contract amendment allowing them to defer part or all of my  wages until the company had raised $300k (negotiated down from 500k)  from the date the amendment was signed. There also was an option to be paid in pure equity. I felt pretty pressured as the contract was already laying on the table with a pen ready to be signed. I signed the  contract, and from that point until now, I've deferred over $46,000.  There is no interest or any sort of equity based risk compensation, and  no collateral.

TODAY:

I had lunch with the CEO  recently, where he accused me of not having empathy for the other  officers who haven't been getting paid for longer than me, where some  haven't seen a cent over the past year, and that I was looking out for  myself as opposed to what's best for the company by constantly asking  for fundraising updates, and at one point, asking for some equity-based  risk compensation (which pissed him off a lot).

This really  pissed me off as I've stuck around through thick and thin as an employee  without much equity (0.5%), working without pay and allowing the  company to rack up a $46k tab. I even had them at one point start  deferring my pay earlier so they can pay the interns as they're more  financially vulnerable and we really need them.

I have plenty of  empathy on a personal level for the officers and everybody at the  company, however on a professional level there is a clear distinction  between employees and officers/co-founders who have a lot of equity, who  hold a lot of power, and who I think most importantly have the  responsibility of raising money, getting clients, and making sure their  employees are paid. On a professional level, I feel that it's completely  reasonable to be looking out for myself based on my working my ass off  and essentially holding onto $46k+ of the company's debt in the form of  deferred payments. It's completely reasonable that I'm concerned about  this and want constant updates, and don't hold back in asking for this,  and I think it's reasonable for me to ask for some sort of equity based  risk compensation. I would and do treat my fellow employees (not  officers) with just as much concern as I do for myself. The other  employees came on after me, haven't deferred nearly as much money, and  their deferred payment isn't due until later on seeing as they started  deferring after me and signed different contracts. If all of us had our  ""tab"" of deferred payment due at the same time, I would be looking out  for all of us employees.

Anyways, here's the big deal and what I  need advice on. The company has raised $275k at this point, including 2  25k payments in Sept and Oct pledged by our lead investor who doesn't  want to see the company shut down. They're very close to the $300k mark  at which point they have to pay me back as stated in our signed contract  amendment from last October.

The CEO flat out told me that all  of the money they raised so far, and any small amounts coming in to keep  things afloat is already spoken for. That they will be paying  accountants and auditors because if they stop submitting SEC filings,  the company is as good as dead.

I'm currently not working for  them but I haven't quit or been fires/layed off - I'm basically  furloughed since I told them I've deferred so much money I don't want to  defer more. He said he needs me to come in a few times just to  essentially show up for meetings with potential clients and with  potential investors who are coming by for ""due diligence"". I am the only  employee who does what I do for this company, it is our core offering,  and what provides value for customers, and there's nobody who can fill  in for me, not even founders/executives. He said they would continue to  pay for my health insurance and defer my pay for doing this at an hourly  rate. I agreed, and the company is actually making a lot of progress towards either going dark, going back to being private, or being acquired. **Then this happened**:

He then went on to tell me that he doesn't plan on paying back employees until they  raise $2 million, at which point they will begin to pay employees using a  payment plan as opposed to a lump sum. He said this in a manner where  he obviously assumed that he had the right to disregard the contract  amendment previously signed by the two of us, which stated when he had  to pay me back upon raising 300k, and as if this is a matter over which  he has complete discretion.

When I reacted poorly, where I didn't  say anything b/c I was shocked and didn't know what to say (I certainly  had a shocked and troubled look on my face) he accused me of looking  out for myself and not the company.

I'm at a point now where I'm  debating with myself as to how far I should go to get the money back and  how cooperative I should be to help out by showing up at meetings with  potential customers, and being present when investors come by for due  diligence.

I'd like to tell him that I plan on collecting my $46k  as a lump sum upon them hitting the $300k mark as agreed upon in the  contract amendment signed by both of us, and that I need him to confirm  in an email that he fully intends to comply with the terms of the  contract and pay me back on time if he wants me to come in for the  reasons described above.

I understand that he's in a tough  situation and the company is dead if they stop paying auditors and  accountants, however at the end of the day I've been very accommodating  for months and months, the company is getting some money coming in. and  it's his responsibility to figure out how to comply with the contract  amendment that we both signed, and I don't really want to hear about how  he doesn't have enough money. If he needs to go get on his knees and  beg our investors or open his and/or the founders own damn wallets to  keep things moving, so be it (He's somewhat rich himself). It's up to  him to figure out how to deal with this, this is why he was hired and  given a lot of equity.

I have 2 very strong actions I could take if he refuses to play ball, which most likely have consequences that would damage the company in a very serious way. It's also important to mention that I'm not going to go broke or anything without that 46k, although it will take me a lot longer to save up for a down payment on a house, which is something I've been trying to do for a long time. I'd strongly prefer to not have to do either of the following, but they are certainly options.

1.) Upon them raising 300k, contact an employment attorney and go after them, possibly receiving triple damages.

2.)  Call my state's department of labor. They tend to side with employees, and have harsh penalties (big fines the company definitely can't afford) for companies who break employment laws. If I did this it would likely put the company out of business. I could tell the dept. of labor that I signed this contract amendment under pressure (which I did),  and that the company is stating that they refuse to pay me back as described in this amendment upon raising 300k. I could go further and tell them that I'm being treated as a 1099-based contractor (which is true) while according to state regulations I'm technically an employee. The contractor-employee thing does really bother me and I was told upon joining a year ago that they were bringing everybody to full-time status within a month or 2. Nobody at the company is full-time, everybody is technically a contractor/consultant.

What are your  thoughts??? I've heard everything from go nuclear immediately, to accept  the loss and learn from it. I do think it's the right move to refuse to show up and do any more work until he clearly states in writing/email  that he intends to put aside money and pay me back in full upon raising 300k.

Keep in mind that this is the CEO talking to me, not my boss.

I'm especially curious about what Founders/CEO's of startups think. This is a very rough situation and I really don't know what to do. I have a big problem with his not following the terms of our amendment, which already demanded a shit ton of flexibility, risk, and sacrifice from me. I know start-ups are risky and people do lose money,  but I feel like this has gone way past what is normal for a non-founder/executive even for a startup, and he needs to hold up his end of the bargain and make good on his responsibilities as the CEO. I don't want to be the reason they  crash and burn, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect him to figure out how to keep up his end of the deal.

TL:DR: I can't really do a TLDR but if you just read that whole wall of text I really appreciate it.

every professor\`s answer is different. my friend who graduate early than me, he also spends 6 months to find job, he get help from mentor, but he is a genius student. One of my professor not suggests me to find mentor, I also do not know how to find a mentor.

now I  do not know should I still go for finding career chance, to take my master degree, or just do some different thing else.

I'm a recent college grad in CS on an OPT which will expire in 2 months if I dont get a job. I had good grades in school (3.66 GPA) but no internships so I am starting to doubt that I will get a software development job because I am disqualified from at least 70% of jobs due to not holding a permanent resident or citizenship status and I am not good enough to others. I am getting a little discouraged and desperate due to limited time and resources.

I am however interested in Cyber security, and pursued a computer security certificate in my school, which granted Cisco CNSS 4011 and 4013 standards. I've read that IT help desk technician/support is a good way to start to climb in the IT field and eventually get a cybersecurity job with Cisco/Microsoft/vendor specific cybersecurity certificates.  I don't mind the rather tedious IT support work and I would like to learn more (always eager to learn). I know this is atypical for this sub and IT is frowned upon compared to software development work here, but would you recommend for me to pursue an IT help desk position to start towards this goal? If so, what would you recommend me to learn or know before starting?"

Like in a romance written in poor taste and imagination, she always had a rough life, and got pregnant at 17, after having an affair with a married man, who ran from her like the wind; he’s probably still running, and I never knew the asshole. 

Poor girls in deeply religious third-world countries aren’t advised that abortion is an option, and then I was born – Christine, but it was more like my name was Ungrateful Child.

It seems like her post-partum depression lasted as long as she lived, at least towards me.

From the moment I could speak I remember her telling me how life was unfair to her, and how I was useless since I wasn’t good enough to make my father stay with her. How she wished she gave me away to someone.

I wish she did too.

The only person who ever made me feel loved was my grandmother, God bless her soul. She lived with us and took good care of me.

During the first few years of my life, my mother got her shit relatively together; sure, she hated me, but at least she had a steady job and the men she dated had all their teeth. The nicest man she ever dated came to be my stepfather – Mario, an immature but good-natured and hardworking fellow.

After almost two years living together, my mother got pregnant with his child. Oh, how happy she was! I thought it would make her hate me less, but I was terribly wrong. Every little thing I did was reason to make her scream at me and spank me, swearing she would beat me to death if I made her lose the baby. She told me every day that I was the odd one out, and that I should go look for my father and never come back.

I was eight years old.

Mario was really gentle to me, not in a fatherly way, but like he was a nice uncle. I had learned early to be cold towards people, so the fact that he would never look at me like I was his child didn’t bother me; I wasn’t, after all. 

I never wished for my mother’s love either, just to be acknowledged as a human of equal worth, but I might as well die trying.

My sister was born a few days after I turned 9, a day that would be completely forgotten if it wasn’t for my grandmother. Mario awkwardly bought me a small birthday cake and said my mother had too much on her plate. I didn’t say anything; I know it wasn’t his problem and he never signed in for that kind of shit.

Grandma and I silently ate my stale birthday cake quietly in the dark, something that made me smile. She loved creating little secrets with me.

Andy, my sister, was the most beautiful baby I’ve ever seen. All eyes were on her the whole time. The fact that I was a chubby and ungraceful kid started to make me feel self-conscious.

She was bathed with all the love and attention I never had. At least for one year and a half, then my mother was pregnant again.

She accused Mario of getting her pregnant against her will, said she hated the baby already. Again, abortion never crossed her mind; instead, she decided to take rat poison and die along with the baby, a tragicomic scene that resulted only in a bad stomachache.

After that, she only got worse.

My mother constantly claimed to be tormented by vengeful ghosts and demons, and that they were manipulating her family against her, and had implanted two evil babies inside her – myself and her third child, Michael. 

I loved my brother Michael earnestly because no one else would – no one besides my grandmother, but she too was still awestruck by Andy. 

Due to the dark color of his skin and complications during his birth, Michael was seen as an ugly baby. We were one and the same, and we bonded. At 11, I helped my grandma raise him like he was my own.

He was immediately rejected by my mother, and Mario, a white man of Italian ancestry, accused my mother of cheating. There’s no way he could’ve product such a dark skinned boy, he said.

As I said, Mario was the best. It didn’t mean he was great. Their relationship had been on the edge ever since she got pregnant with Michael, which only made her hate my little brother even more.

While I cared for Michael, my mother used her time pretty much for cheating on my stepfather, pretending to be sick and being with the only child she liked, Andy.

Michael was the cutest little thing, and I hated to see him being rejected by both his parents. I hated my mother so much.

It was around that time that she started claiming to have visions, inexplicable fevers and being attacked by invisible beings.

I know I was too old for that, but I believed her. She raised me to believe that I was always surrounded by her invisible spies and she would know if I misbehaved behind her back. She enforced it by randomly spanking me for things that I allegedly did while she was away.

After Mario inevitably left her, she never found work again; we struggled, surviving off my grandmother’s meager pension and what little alimony Mario paid for Andy. We were constantly having to move houses and losing our cheap furniture in the process, since she never paid rent.

My mother then started calling herself a clairvoyant and alleging to be able to see people’s auras, but never succeeded in finding clients. Still, she insisted, making friends with suspicious people that sometimes lent her money, sometimes freeloaded on us for days; our house was always messy and broken, no matter how much my grandmother tried to tidy it. strange people were always coming and going, grabbing stuff, and even leaving their own snotty children for me and my grandma to care of.

And the exorcisms. God, all the fake screams and seizures. 

These crazy friends were the only people that endorsed her, and they decided that she was really powerful and could cure possessed people. They also supported her claims that evil had infiltrated on her side through her two bad kids.

By the time I was 14, I had been exorcized three times and my mother still called me an abnormal rebel – I did great in school and was pretty much raising one of her child, I simply didn’t like her taste in what she called “music” and “clothes”.

She “exorcized” people, then stayed in bed for days, saying it was her destined burden to be tormented by other people’s demons. She saw herself as so important, so enlightened and underappreciated. 

Even those people eventually couldn’t take her bullshit anymore and left, only providing her with more ammo for her *poor little me* narrative. She started scamming and using emotional blackmail with the people that still cared about her, like her brothers and cousins, so she could get money to spend on stupid things; Michael and I only had two shirts each.

Looking back now, maybe her hobbies were not only stupid, but dangerous. 

After Mario left her, she was constantly partying and smoking, and sometimes would disappear for days, coming back with large bruises all over her body. At home, she was chain-smoking all the time, and painfully coughing like her lungs would go flying from her mouth like a big lump of chewed gum.

Sometimes, she was missing large clumps of hair and her eye was so swollen she couldn’t even open it. Once, she came back with a permanent limping. She was only 31 and never walked straight again, or without a semi-metallic clanking noise.

She always blamed it on the demons, invisible people and “dark forces”. At least once a month, she would snap and spank all the three of us, then change to a child’s voice and beg Andy to forgive her; just Andy.

Over time, our relatives learned to ignore her fits, and she was left completely alone – except for her beloved golden child, and random men that she brought home. Not even them believed her bullshit.

All of this was so tiring on us, especially on my grandma. Her fake rituals, fake clairvoyance and fake life took a huge toll on her mother, who was always sick and overworking herself.

When I was 15, my grandmother died. I was relieved because she would be free from all her thankless struggles, instead of slowly eaten away by an illness; still, I never felt so alone in the world. 

I realized I had no one to look after me, and I was the one who had no choice but to look after someone.

I got myself a job, but after my mother spanked me and took all my hard-earned money to spend on herself instead of paying rent, I grabbed little Michael and left. We stayed a few weeks with an aunt, then another few weeks with someone else, being sheltered by people that pitied us but could never offer us a home.

I worked my ass off so my baby brother could at least have a decent life. When I turned 18, I got us a tiny bedroom-and-kitchen apartment, and my mother gladly passed his custody to me.

We were finally free, and that’s the last time I ever saw her.

She constantly called me, followed me and tried to break on my house, saying that I was an ungrateful child and now I was the one who had to support her.

Like she ever did anything for me besides ruining my ability to love and to feel happy or even normal.

Despite all the harassment I went through, and how damaged I was inside, I was doing fine. The years working double or triple shifts paid off, and I was able to provide a more comfortable and steady living for myself and my brother. Michael grew up into a sweet, helpful boy, and I was so proud of him. 

Things were too perfect when Andy called me; she had just turned 18.

She admitted to hate me because I left her, and said she hated our mother too; she lost her custody years earlier, and Andy had been living with her father, Mario. Still, she didn’t want our mother to die alone on the street.

Bitterly amused, I made a mental note that the golden child had inherited the inclination for unproportioned drama.

Andy was just an intern and everyone else had turned her back on our mother. I was her only hope, she said.

My sister begged me to provide our mother some place to live. I wanted to refuse, but I felt like I owned Andy something; she never asked to be raised as the untouchable princess of the bullshit queen, after all. 

I left her behind because I could barely take care of myself and another kid, let alone two; and she was the only one that would be treated acceptably by our mother. 

I accepted that Andy hated me, and that she had the right to do so. The golden child could never comprehend the extension of what I’ve been through because, despite having to babysit her own mother ever since she was an infant, she was never abused. Neglected, yes, but not physically and mentally wounded as I had been.

I agreed, as long as the place was an assisted living for the mental ill. It was time our mother got her much-needed psychological treatment. Andy didn’t object to my terms; she knew I was right.

I’m not usually a miser, but I decided to put our mother in the shabbiest place of the sort I could find. One can say I’m being vengeful, but I just thought it served her well. My efforts towards her would be minimal.

I never visited her, but Andy talked to me occasionally, reporting about her complaints, how the food was tasteless and the caregivers were evil to her. My mother was, like always, a pain in the ass for everyone around, and caused trouble the whole time. 

She kept asking for cigarettes, expensive food and “at least a phone”. Surprisingly, they complied with the cellphone part, because listening to music on it and pretending to text Andy calmed her down, and anyone would do whatever they could to make her shut up for a while; it was one of those old phones with no internet access, though.

She tried to escape a few times, and was put in some sort of solitary for it.

That’s where she died, three years after I sent her to the ward. I didn’t attend her funeral, and felt nothing but relief. Michael barely remembered her, so it didn’t affect him the least.

Our life carried on normally. Michael enrolled on a university and moved away. For the first time in my life, I had total privacy, and a whole, quiet home all for myself.

I never got closer to my sister, but I kept checking on her from time to time. She kept mentioning something about a phone she really needed to get, but I was somewhat dismissive, worrying that her mental health was declining as well. 

A few weeks ago, Andy called me. Said she was finally legally allowed to retrieve our mother’s cellphone by the occasion of her death, and she found a disturbing recording on it. 

Due to that, Andy requested an exhumation autopsy. 

I didn’t even know that it was possible, but I learned that as long as the body exists, it can be done. When she died, there was no investigation, since her health had been frail for years, and the causa mortis seemed to be blunt trauma due to accidental fall.

That’s what Andy told me as I accompanied her to the forensic facility. When she called me, the autopsy was already scheduled for later that week, and she asked me to accompany her to get the results. She also wanted me to show the file on the phone.

It was one of those old phones with a single camera that produces very grainy, diminutive images. Still, it was enough to see and hear clearly what had happened. I had been skeptic of her allegations for years, but I had no doubts.

Our mother died doing what she loved pretending to do: being possessed by a demon.

\*\*\*

By the time of her death, not even Andy believed our mother’s demon stories anymore. That’s why it was so hard to believe when, after having seizures for over two hours, she died and all her organs looked like blackberry jelly.

But I’m getting ahead of myself.

The recording on the old cellphone showed her lying on the floor and grumbling. The solitary was a grim place, a naked and cold room with rusty metallic walls. Other than that, there was a thick old door with a little doorway for food, a very tall ceiling with a lonely lamp, and no objects. 

There was only herself, the cellphone, a plastic bottle of water and a mattress on the floor. 

My mother was talking to Andy, and her face was so old, so wrinkled and helpless that my heart broke. I almost had forgotten how she looked like, and how old she had to be by now. “Hey, angel, mom was a bad girl again”, our mother smiled with no joy; she had lost almost all her teeth. “I miss you. I’ll get out of here and get us a good place to live. Your evil sister won’t hurt you there”.

She laughed on a delirious, deranged manner; Andy involuntarily squeezed my hand.

After a few moments, she muttered. “I don’t feel good”.

“I don’t feel good”, she repeated a few more times, progressively louder, until she was screaming. Still lying on the floor, she slid a few inches, until her feet reached the door, and started kicking it. “Let me out! Let me out of here, Christine, you ungrateful child!”

She kicked and screamed for no more than three minutes before half the screen went dark. Something was partially covering the camera, but it couldn’t have been her hand, the bottle or the mattress, since those were all visible.

I felt Andy shuddering on my side.

Then everything was silent for a fraction of second, and you could hear the coldest voice, that sounded more like screeching:

*“I’m finally strong enough”.*

“No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no”, our mother begged, to no avail. A blurry shadow moved closer to her; my sister covered her eyes. 

*“Didn’t you want to be possessed so badly?”*

She didn’t answer. Instead, our mother cried on the floor, cowering and withering like a wounded animal.

“This noise is so unholy”, Andy remarked, still shaken. “Where is it coming from? Is it the metal or something?”

That’s when I realized that my sister wasn’t able to make out *Its* words. Just me[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)"

The program at my school is quite theoretical, so I've not had much algorithmic coding (i.e., leetcoding) experience, so I started to leetcode seriously a few days ago. I try to do 1-2 problems per day, sometimes more. (Note: I do have previous internship experience, but at a small startup, so this is my first time actually searching for internships like this.)

I've read that most of the big companies and unicorns tend to finish up recruiting by October/November at the latest, so my plan at the moment is to leetcode hard for the next 2 months and apply as late as I can (early/mid October) to these companies. But I'm worried that 2 months isn't sufficient to get a good internship, and Leetcoding for longer would probably be more beneficial, so it'd be good if there were some internships I could apply to in the spring after around 4 months of leetcoding.

Historically, have there been good companies (unicorns, respected brands, or high market cap, etc.) that recruit for summer SWEI in the spring of that year? That is to say, will there still be good companies recruiting summer 2020 interns in the spring of 2020?

Would it be out of my place to ask my supervisor if I could work with networking/systems department instead (or shadow a day or two a week)? I feel like this is more of a customer service role and I'm not gaining anything from it for after college. I'm not trying to sound arrogant or anything I just want to learn more to be ready for a junior sys admin/ NOC type role.

I'm hoping to get an internship at a business close to my school next year but I would rather have something on campus."
cocbla,1,2019-08-09,Stuck in a sub-field that I'm not interested in because I have experience in it.,abbys11,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cocbla/stuck_in_a_subfield_that_im_not_interested_in/,"Hi everybody,

I'm going to be graduating from Bachelor's in Computer Science program soon. (Montreal, Canada)

Here's the story: 
I did a 4 month internship in Business Application development after freshman year because that was the only offer I got then and it was good experience
I found Business app dev quite boring. 

The following year, I realised that I really liked lower level development (OS, computer networks etc). However I didn't even get an interview with a company that does those things.

Instead, I had 8 offers for business apps development. So I took the longest and best paying one. It was 16 months long. Again, terribly boring job but I saved a good amount for living expenses.

I returned to school for another year and last summer, I submitted my resume to a top 5 tech company and I got an interview. After a successful interview, in a conversation with the recruiter I messed up. They asked me what I wanted to do and I said ""Anything but business applications development"".

Apparently, they wanted to hire me because of my business apps experience so I bottled that opportunity.


For this summer, I decided to reject all business apps offers and instead I am currently doing research with my OS prof Who got me interested in the field. I love it and I'm going to publish a paper soon.


I honestly don't know how I can escape the business apps field. I hate it so much, there is nothing interesting about it. 

What should I do? Do you think I should remove the 20 months of business apps experience from my CV and keep only the research I did this summer?

My Prof advised me to do a master's in computer networks (possibly with him). But I'd rather start working now to pay my uni debts


TLDR: Hate the field I keep getting jobs in due to past experience. Want to pursue another field I have relatively less experience in. Recruiters only want me for the first one. What do I do?"

I was given a Fortigate 60C to play with at home to learn the environment a bit and familiarize myself. 

Currently I run pFSense and Cisco at home. Being that the Fortigate firmware on the 60C only goes to 5.2.9 (going from memory), is this something that would be better just experimenting with, or would it be relevant to actually replace my pFSense? I’m still new to the Fortigate environment so I’m not sure if dated firmware puts me at a higher security risk. 

I know that comparing pFSense to Fortigate is like comparing apples to oranges, so I’m not exactly looking to outright compare them, just looking for some insight whether it’s worth porting over my network configurations keeping security in mind."
cocv87,1,2019-08-09,Leaving job with unfinished tasks?,dubbycubbles,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cocv87/leaving_job_with_unfinished_tasks/,"TL;DR, I plan to leave my job for another but still have unfinished tasks. I have had my hours cut substantially leading up to my decision, so should I even attempt to finish them or just go?

Background/venting. - I have been part time at this entry level position at “company A” for a little over a year now. Sort of a weird start, since in the month long span after I interviewed at A, I was offered an unpaid internship at “company B” that I accepted - both in the same industry, both 9-5. Low and behold, my second week of the internship and a good month out from that interview I received an offer from A. After talking it over with both companies, it worked out where I could split hours between the two and make an acceptable income at A.

I did this for a few months, then A requested that I take on more hours with them, however still part time. I agreed and rescheduled to max my part time hours at A while still setting aside a day to intern at B. Both A &amp; B agreed initially, but 2 weeks later B counters with a full time position offer. Hard to turn down, but at this point I had already agreed to A. A are also a little better known in the industry, work was more structured and pay was bi-monthly and consistent compared to B. 

A few months of this and things seemed to be going great. As far as work at A, I completed tasks assigned to me by coworkers promptly. Asked questions if I was uncertain and generally tried to prioritize tasks that were deemed important. I was also assigned with large data entry tasks that I made time to chip away at when possible - and was told a handful of times that these could be completed when I had time. Fairly tedious, but figured I could complete on down time and at own pace. No complaints from coworkers or boss.

Enter July - A has an office in another state and one of my coworkers that I work directly under decided to transfer away from our very small team and move. Another higher up coworker quits in other state office. Get off half week for 4th of July, then another week. Then return and boss has decided that I should come in midday for the remainder of that week. I comply, with my thoughts being that there might be restructuring with recent moves and departures and was looking forward to getting some data entry done in a relative down time of year while that was being sorted out. Ask about following week and was told to come in half days as well and told I was off the week after as boss would be traveling to other state office. 

It was then I politely told them that I like my job but expressed my concern about my hours being cut. I asked my boss if this is something that would be resolved soon or I could expect to be out for a while? They said there wasn’t enough work for me to do at the moment and asked if I had a project in mind to work on. Put on the spot, I told them I was open to work on whatever project they would like me to handle and that I still had data entry to complete as well. They dismissed the data entry and asked why that wasn’t done and that interns should be doing that, and seemed to be upset I was completing tasks coworkers had asked me to do. I offered to complete entering data but they still suggested I come in with the limited hours and not come in the other week. That we would talk more when they get back this coming week about the future there.

Needless to say, my morale has been low about A. The team also received an email from the boss about another higher up coworker departing.  Even though I have been told there are less tasks, two job postings have gone up - 1 for my position at the other state office (which someone already has) and another for my position at my office (which I was told was to help cover the workload left by my coworker who moved). We also have interns lined up for the fall. 

Meanwhile, I committed more time to B where I am still at while I have been on my greatly reduced schedule from A. B had once again offered me a position during week 2 of my reduction of hours at A, which I told them I would consider if things didn’t progress. 

I go to A for a couple of days they requested while boss is in other office, but receive little limited correspondence from that team and do not have any immediate tasks at hand. Stuck doing data entry that I said I would work on but struggling to complete it while my mind drifts to the thought that my boss doesn’t seem to want me working in the first place and I am really out of the loop as to what is going on.

At this point, I decide I am going to take the offer from B and let A know when boss returns next week that I am leaving. I have attempted to finish the data entry but am really not wanting to at this point. I am struggling to decide if it’s even worth it? If I put in the effort I could and would like to leave on a positive note, but I really feel like this situation has dragged out beyond what would be most people’s tolerance already. 

I feel bad that this was something I agreed to do, but I did accept the new offer at B and have essentially been put on ice about my hours at A until boss returns - who knows what will happen? As I mentioned, A is better known and I don’t want to have any problems with leaving them as it’s a nice addition to my resume and I could use that reference in the future if needed. Even if I put in “two weeks” which is not required should I even offer to stay that long to finish when my hours have already slipped?"

Sorry 

I had a pretty fun internship this summer at a big startup in the technology department, and they offered me a full-time job when I graduate next spring, but I have to accept by October 1. I’d love some advice on the following matters:

1. I go to school in the northeast (not originally from the US) and this job is in Dallas. I’d be leaving all my family and friends in this country and I’m worried about how I’d be able to make friends here. 

2. The pay, while ok for Texas, is a bit low. The other intern’s who have already accepted offers didn’t negotiate, so I’m wondering how I can negotiate without coming across as untitled and putting them off. 

3. I won’t really be able to interview with a lot of other companies by October- should I just make a decision ASAP or keep looking? 

I realize this is a lot, so I’d appreciate advice on any of these matters :) thank you so much for the help!"

cofd8e,3,2019-08-10,"I have my degree, and I'm getting impatient applying for online job postings. What are some other options I should be exploring?",westvalleyhoe,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cofd8e/i_have_my_degree_and_im_getting_impatient/,"This is going to be a long-ish explanation of exactly where I am in the process of applying for jobs in my degree field.

I graduated in 2015 with a BS in environmental engineering, and spent a few months applying for jobs online (a bit aimlessly), asking the career services office for advice, and asking faculty for information about companies, alumni, and job openings. I basically had no luck getting the attention of anyone who was hiring, and realized too late that all of the students who were getting jobs were people who knew people, and had worked internships. I joined school late and never bothered making friends until my senior year when I became more engaged with school (I've always taken tests easily and skated by on that for years). I also never had an internship, and honestly didn't know the importance of them when standing out to a hiring manager until it was too late.

I'll spare the details, but I gave up, relied on my usual gig waiting tables, and assumed it was never going to work for me. I had exhausted every option I could find, and just decided it was time to figure out what I was going to do next, since a career with my degree didn't seem to be it. I had even taken and passed the FE exam, but never applied for the actual EIT certificate.

I'll spare the details of this too, but I made overdue changes in my life starting almost three years ago by stopping drinking alcohol, and have spent this time rebuilding my life. I moved away from the rural state I grew up and attended school and moved to one of the largest cities in the country. I still wait tables (which is surprisingly lucrative here). Last year, after searching and applying for jobs with tutoring companies, I was invited to interview for a part-time position running a math tutoring room at a private high school. I worked there for the 2018-2019 school year and I loved it! I even landed a regular private in-home tutoring gig for a well-off family who really grew to like me. My efficacy is at an all-time high, but I still have my doubts and moments of cluelessness. The combination of the tutoring and the restaurant work have made me fairly comfortable in a fairly expensive location. However, I have decided to revisit a the engineering career path as I am growing tired of my schedule and would like more stability. I often work 6 or 7 days per week and when I work two jobs and commute it takes up most of my day.

Here's where I am now: I finally bit the bullet and applied for and now have my EIT certification. I have also been searching indeed, glassdoor, and local city and government job sites. I have set up a LinkedIn account, but haven't added a lot to it besides my resume. I am keeping track of every job I apply for (which makes finding new postings and ignoring multiple postings a breeze). But now that I've made a routine of that, and am watching the rejection letters fill up my inbox, I'm ready to be more aggressive in my job search.

I've considered trying to find career fairs, using temp agencies, and even taking the GRE and applying for grad schools, as I believe (possibly falsely) that a master's degree would make me a more competitive applicant. While the most commonly dispensed advice seems to be to keep applying, I feel what I'm really lacking are connections. I don't know how to meet people who know people, and I'm reduced to the piece of paper with my name at the top that is lost in the stack of so many like it. I'm willing to try most anything for a foot in the door, but while the second most commonly dispensed piece of advice might be to try everything I can, I find this all a bit overwhelming. In a huge city, having every possibility available means not knowing where I should direct my attention, and wondering what I'm missing. So I come to this sub seeking guidance. I'm willing to take suggestions of any kind, especially from those of you who are familiar with environmental engineering and what type of applicants stand out. Thanks for putting up with the long post!"

About 4 days ago, I got an internship offer from my one of my university's professor to work in his startup company. I did not think much at that time and happily accepted the offer but when I turned up in the location, I found out that there were only three developers in his company. He is developing an education-related mobile app where students can sign in to find tutors in nearby locations and tutors can find students. I thought I would be learning from one of the senior developers but I realized that one of the developers is an Android developer, another one is an iOS developer and another one is an intern as well. He wants me to develop the whole admin panel web application (which is pretty complex) for the mobile application using Node/Mongo in Backend and React/Redux in Frontend. He wants me to handle the whole project with the help of another intern( who basically knows nothing about React/Node). I am in my last year of Uni (full-time student) and have to do a capstone application project in my last semester and I also work part-time in retail about 15 hrs/week. He wants me to dedicate about 25-30 hours per week in the internship which is unpaid, I don't think I really can juggle so many stuff in my life. I don't know if the internship is even worth as I will not learn much from any senior developer and will have to do pretty much full-stack development on my own for free in such an expensive city like Sydney. I think it is a bit unfair to demand so much from an unpaid intern and I feel like he is using me. Do you guys think I should decline the internship and quit and find better job opportunities? He is still my professor in Uni and if I decline it will be kind of odd for the rest of my semester but on the other hand, I don't think it is really a good opportunity to learn and flourish at all. Do you think I should send him an email and politely decline the internship? Please, I need some suggestions guys."

I am a BTC trader, quite good at what I am doing, but I can't say I feel personal satisfaction with what I am doing except the very nice amount of money I am making. I am spending 8-10 hours at the computer daily, so I thought why not spend my time doing something I actually love doing, to the point that I wake up and just want to start doing it and find answers for all the new things that I am facing.

Thing is, I have a few questions I have nobody to ask, so I thought I would ask them here.

1. Do you guys think I would benefit if I take a remote internship with a mentor in my country while I am studying or I should concentrate on getting more deeply in the material? I know C#, C# OOP, a bit of database and I am currently learning JS Core so I could go in C# DB and C# Web after that. Thing is I really don't have any feedback on what I am doing good or bad and I'm unsure if that will leave me behind.

2. If you think I won't benefit from an internship, what do you think is better for me?   
Concentrate on doing some side projects that I can present later to future employers or contribute to Open Source projects @ GitHub or do both?  

3. If I am about to choose between React and Angular, which would be better for a newbie like me? I see that React is more searched, but Angular has less ""competition"" if I can say.  

PS: Please, take in mind that I can study and learn for whatever time it takes, I am in no rush, I have enough money to live a few years ahead. 
My main goal is to start making money from something that makes me feel comfortable and happy and I will do whatever it takes to accomplish it.
I don't know if this should be considered, but I am living in a very poor third world country, so working in an office is not a very nice option.

At my university, our Career Center offers a Clinical Research Internship. Unlike most internships, the clinical research internship is supposed to not only include an 8-week summer session from June to July, but also continue into the fall and spring academic semesters after a month-long break in August.

While I have greatly enjoyed my internship and have learned so much about oncological clinical research trials, I unfortunately was not recommended to continue my work into the fall semester. I have already beaten myself up over my shortcomings and I will try to make a final plea to my supervisor to let me continue, but that likely will not lead to anything.

During my internship, I was given paperwork to complete, opportunities to attend meetings discussing clinical trials, and shadow a number of doctors. The tasks that I were delegated were certainly difficult and required a comprehensive background knowledge of cancer research trials and while I had made a number of mistakes throughout the first four weeks, the following four weeks I had made improvements and my supervisor had seen those improvements. Obviously my work wasn't perfect, but I had at least believed I was on the right track.

I also hit a very large nail in the road during my internship . In mid-late July before I left for my lunch break one day, I had taken a photo of my clinical research office and snapped it to my friends. Over the summer, a lot of my friends were sharing images of their jobs, labs, and internships and I thought I could do the same. I made sure that I didn't compromise any patient confidential information in my picture, but my supervisor confronted me about it and said I could have run the risk of compromising patient confidential info. This whole incident had shaken me up and I went back and read through all the clinical research orientation training about HIPAA and Patient Confidential Info. At the conclusion of the 8-week period, my supervisor evaluated me and told me that while what I did was stupid, likely no consequences would come out of it, especially since I had been very honest with everything and that these posts are deleted 24 hours later even if they had confidential info. She assured me not to beat myself up so much about this incident, and to look into the future.

A week into the August break from the internship, I was asked to meet a Career Center representative. The Career Center told me that I was not recommended to continue into the fall semester because of not meeting the requirements asked of me nor having exercised good judgment with patient confidential info. I asked if my phone picture had automatically caused me to be fired due to the hospital's policies, and the rep said ""no, it was just your lack of good judgment."" While these are all warranted concerns, I sort of felt this was out of the blue, especially since my supervisor appeared to show hope of wanting to work with me in the future. I have yet to talk to my supervisor about why she wanted to let me go especially after insinuating the opportunity to work in the future. Despite those mistakes, I have shown up to work consistently on time, been incredibly respectful towards everyone in the office, been incredibly receptive to feedback, and have demonstrated improvements from my errors.

On the other hand I feel like while I have learned a lot in these past eight weeks, I have essentially wasted this opportunity because I left on a bad note. In a last-ditch effort to very unlikely get back my internship position, I am meeting with my supervisor again, pledging to do better and having written a personal hard-copy ""professional goal sheet"" to ensure I have a successful internship, including ways I could complete tasks more accurately and how to prevent the phone incident from happening ever again. I care so much about this internship and have learned so much... I respect everyone in my office and have even baked food for them to demonstrate my appreciation for mentoring me. I know none of my attempts to be friendly to my colleagues can be an excuse for stupid or incompetent behavior, but I really really wish I could be given another chance. Especially because I believe in myself to become much better in the future.

In the very likely event I don't get accepted back, part of me wants to still put this on my resume. I feel awful about the things that potentially could have let me go, but my experiences in shadowing doctors and partaking in clinical research feel like they need to be documented for medical school applications. Part of me also wants to ask a rec. letter from the physician overseeing these clinical trials. I have attended all the meetings where he was present and he has noticed that I was there. While we rarely talk, he does recognize my name and face, and know that I am intern occasionally saying Hi when I bump into him in the hospital hallways.

You can berate me all you want, call me an idiot for my stupid, utterly unprofessional behavior. I have spent the last three days crying and not able to eat a thing because of being angry at myself and wondering how I could possibly have been so stupid and incompetent to have screwed up this opportunity. Part of me also believes that the work I've done here hasn't been a complete waste, and I should still feel proud of whatever achievements and experience I have gained despite my shortcomings."
cok0qz,1,2019-08-10,"I have had problems at jobs in the last few years, and I hate not being with my kids...what should I do?",burnedoutthrowaway99,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cok0qz/i_have_had_problems_at_jobs_in_the_last_few_years/,"Long: I need help. I am a mother of 3 (youngest just turned 1), still nursing (albeit down to parttime), and currently the sole breadwinner not-by-choice. I've had a number of really rotten job experiences especially in the last 2 years. It started when the stress from working 7.5yrs in the Philadelphia School District (5.5 of those years with NO raises for anyone) got to be too much, especially with motherhood and my job difficulties with classroom management, which resulted in poor evaluations and taught me that classroom teaching is not a good fit for me. I never had clinical anxiety issues until I had become a teacher. Now I have major anxiety, social awkwardness, and very low self esteem.

After I quit the toxic school district, it has been a particularly rocky road jobwise: difficulties just trying to get ""a"" job, a short lasted bs menial temp job, and an unpaid internship that costed me $1500 but apparently turned out to be a bad fit despite my efforts. Then months of unemployment. The one saving grace job was a special ed teaching job at a small supportive alternative school, but I screwed that up for myself, by quitting with short notice late last summer because I'd gotten a seemingly better teaching job offer. The offer was for a charter school that paid better, was much much closer to home, had better cheaper health benefits, and had hard pressured me into starting immediately (hmm that last part should have been a red flag).

Btw the charter school ended up being a complete nightmare job for me, worse than any of the multiple schools I'd worked for in Philly. Work-life balance was horrendous and expectations were unreasonable. My classroom management was at its worst despite all my efforts. I was mentally abused daily by mean students and consequently developed full-on depression; therapy was unhelpful. They seemed to resent my breastmilk pumping on prep + lunch. I received some of my worst teacher evaluations, and yes they verbally told me that pumping adversely affected some of my bad evaluation (technically illegal of them).

I started jobsearching only 3wks into the school year but got NO job offers at all until 9mo later. So I stayed 9mos at the nightmare charter school, against everyone's advice, only because I was the primary breadwinner. The one new job offer paid much less and was far away,  but it was in a new field/non-teaching and I REALLY wanted out of the Charter School From Hell, so I accepted it. The new job was ok, less stressful, nicer people. But still stressful because there were very long late 2nd shift hours that cut into my time being a mom EVEN MORE than the previous job. Plus, I went straight from working 90% of the past year at the stressful charter school to starting this job with literally NO break at all to rejuvenate or get caught up with family/house stuff. I lost a lot of money taking this job because it was a large pay cut, and my husband lost his job due to my job's overtime cutting into his 3rd shift job's hours, so now I'm the involuntary sole breadwinner. Also, I lost $1000s in lost healthcare benefits + extra taxes on my accumulated summer pay from the charter school, because leaving mere weeks before summer break meant getting my summer pay dispersed in one lump sum and having my family's healthcare terminate 2wks later instead of at the end of summer. Between all these losses and working all the time, I felt devalued, burned out, and exhausted. You're probably wondering why I was stupid enough to accept this new job at the absolute worst possible timing. It was because I was desperate to have a new job since I was already leaving the charter school irregardless, and I took the job right away because I'm an all-pleasing doormat who worried they'd give my job to someone else if I couldn't start right when they told me to.

All summer long I've felt like a slave who works 24-7. I admit I deeply envy my husband for staying at home with our kids. My husband also isn't very good at homemaking and he admitted he dislikes housework. So on top of working 60 hr weeks far away, I do more than a fair amount of house chores too. He's tried getting a job but no job works around my job's long work hours; childcare is NOT a financial option for us AT ALL. He's now in school on weekends to get his commercial truck driving license. It's been a struggle at times to get off on weekends so my husband can go to school.

Aside from the major money losses and long hours interfering with me being a real mom, the job was going good for me. I really liked my manager. Then they changed managers on us with no notice. The new one is new at her role (so she's trying to run a very tight ship) and has been very critical of me, on some occasions has dismissed my husband's school schedule (previous manager was ok working around it), and held it against me when I came to work late last Saturday due to my husband's schooling--even though I had cleared it with the other manager and successfully found coverage. Very recently she came down hard on me for me missing someone else's error; that was my airheaded stupidity for missing it, but I also know that the exhaustion from such long workweeks is interfering with my work quality. All of this has increased my anxiety and self deprecation all over again. I'm worried she's building a case of documentation against me. I admit I'm hurt by it because I've always made a point to be super nice and cheerful at work too, and now I see those things aren't really worth beans. I feel like a devalued screwup with wasted efforts. My husband keeps complaining about her to me.

I feel defeated, and like I just want a break from people and work in general. Deep down I want to be a stay at home mom!...at least for a little bit. I never even got a maternity leave with my youngest! I feel burned out, unappreciated, and like a failure. I feel socially retarded. I feel like I suck at every job I've tried to do. I need a break! But I feel trapped. Also, I worry that I will unintentionally end up burning a bridge at this job if things with this new manager keep going the way they've been recently going. Last thing I want is all my hard work and long hours (60hrs/wk work + 12hrs/wk commute) to result in a bad reference or worse, termination due to incompetence. It would kill me mentally if I lost this job after all my other recent job failures. The plan was to stay here at least 6-12mos and use it as an entry level stepping stone. What do I do??? I am distraught.

TL/DR: I am a sole breadwinner not-by-choice at a job with very long hours that keeps me from being a mom to my kids. I'm now getting criticized at this job despite my efforts. I have had a string of unfortunate work experiences in the 2yrs before this one. I feel burned out on working, I feel like a bad fit for every job I try, and I have major social anxiety from previous jobs that affect my life and my work performance. I need guidance on what to do now."

I want to take internship for summer 2020, after i finish the second year, at Amazon.

Big concern i have is, i don't have a job experience. Is it possible to get an internship at Amazon as my first internship?

What skills should i specialize in until next summer? This year i will take oop course and data structures course in school. 

The languages which i consider myself good at are C, C++ and java. I took the C course in first year. I am making games with C using SDL2 library and java with LWJGL + opengl. Next years oop course will have C++ and java.

I learned some backend development with Nodejs like basic CRUD applications, RESTful development, user authentications, tokens, sessions, SQL databases, mongo databases, storing users and hash passwords. For frontend i know the core concepts but i am not good at designing stuff. I just stick with popular libraries like bootstrap.

Also i started learning flutter/dart 2 months ago, cross platform app development framework from google. We are developing a project with a group of 3 friends. The app is mainly CRUD with user auths. For backend i have tinkered with services like firebase from google. Custom server in nodejs. Django servers...

I have a good understanding of git workflow and i use it for every project i develop. I develop in Linux environment.

Well as you can see, my side learning situation is a mess. I don't know what to specialize in. I need a road map for this internship goal, if possible. What skills should i learn and specialize in? What kind of projects will make me stand out?

I wasn’t diagnosed with Asperger’s until I was 20, and I have my mom to thank for that. During that time, I did nothing but play video games (usually by myself) and isolate myself on my phone.

Because of this, I’ve struggled socially both at home and at college. I felt it most at college because that’s where you get internships, jobs, and connections you’ll most likely use in your career.

I’m killing myself because I’ve wasted my college education and tarnished my reputation as a potential CPA.

My tarnished reputation comes from lack of follow up on networking, lack of networking in general, and my internship going belly-up because I gave up on a project in the internship. And mind you, I was working for free.

You see, my dad has been supporting me and paying for my undergraduate. He wants me to stay at hoke for the rest of my education and is forcing himself as my financial guardian. He’s also setting up a job at this company I don’t want to work at, but he feels that he doesn’t have any other choice.

My dad is also very stubborn and I find it very hard to argue with him based on his intensity and stubbornness.

cook02,51,2019-08-10,Think I'll be quitting my Ph.D. soon,Opus_723,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/cook02/think_ill_be_quitting_my_phd_soon/,"To be honest, I've been feeling depressed about school for a long time, even before I applied to the Ph.D. There was a bit of a high when I started grad school, it was exciting, I felt pumped up. But I joined my research group last year, and since then I just feel like my mental state has been slowly rotting.

My adviser is actually \*super\* nice and patient with me. But when I asked questions about the models the group had developed over the past few years, it just felt like we were talking past each other. I put that down to my inexperience and figured I'd get it eventually. But more and more I became convinced that there were, in fact, severe and fundamental problems with the work my group was slowly preparing to publish, and also with the project I was given to take over from a previous student. I was really nervous to talk to my adviser about this, but it actually went over really well! Once I laid out all the math, they agreed with me 100% and asked me to take over the project.

So all was well. This is how science works, no big deal. But in the six months since, this has happened over and over again. And every time, my adviser agrees with me, I give a group talk about it, and they tell me to take over the project. I've now accumulated a fair chunk of the group's work that I'm now responsible for fixing, and honestly some of it is so bad that I'm not sure what salvaging it would even \*mean\*.

I've come to my adviser with my \*own\* ideas for projects, and they agreed that they might very well work, but they bluntly told me that they didn't get why it was interesting and that I should prioritize salvaging the others' work. And, you know, fair enough, they have a lot more context for what's interesting in the field. But I so desperately want something to do that \*I'm\* interested in, and I've \*seen\* other published papers on this topic that I think I could really extend in an interesting way.

My adviser has also been pushing me to undergo my thesis proposal much sooner than the rest of my cohort for funding reasons. I've put it off as long as I can because I'm slightly embarrassed about ""my"" projects and I'm not looking forward to the mental gymnastics of making them look interesting to my committee, but I can't put it off any longer. This is supposed to be a proposal to a committee about how I plan to turn these projects into a thesis over the next few years, and I just... have no faith in what I'm supposed to present.

I worry that I'm just panicking and taking the easy way out rather than face my thesis proposal, but honestly I've never had trouble passing exams, including oral ones. I'm not \*really\* worried that I won't pass. But staring at blank screens while I sit down to write this proposal has made me realize that I have \*zero\* ownership of this thesis, and barely any interest in the projects. I'm at the top of my class, I've won awards, checked all the boxes. I'm confident that I'm \*capable\* of finishing the Ph.D. But lately I'm just realizing that I... don't want to. I'm just scared to quit because I don't want to disappoint my family. I'm the first in my family to go to college, and they're all ridiculously proud of me for getting all the way to a doctorate. I feel like shit for even considering quitting.

I really \*am\* passionate about science, and I think I'm even quite good at it. But if I'm just going to work on other people's projects that don't interest me for years... I can get paid more for that. \*Or\* I could teach, which I actually enjoy a lot more. Before I joined my research group I taught first-year classes for my stipend, and before that I did the same in undergrad for three years, and... It was really great. I miss it a lot.

I'm sure someone will suggest that I simply find a group whose research I'm more interested in. But I don't think that's all there is to it. I feel like this program, overall, is wearing down the parts of me I used to like most, and the parts of me that are left are really disappointing. I feel very hollow and tired. I don't even have the energy for hobbies anymore. And I'm not overworked, either. My hours are fine, I've worked much more intense jobs in the past. I'm just... drained.

I'm already several years older than the rest of my cohort. Had some roadblocks on my way to get this far because I had a shitty, violent childhood. And I'm just starting to feel so... Tired. Of being a student, of being poor, of needing to prove myself over and over again no matter how well I do just for the chance to tread water.

My wife went back to get a bachelor's degree and I'm supporting her through that on my grad stipend. My stepdad was just in a really bad work accident that destroyed the family business and forced him into early retirement, so I'm now \*literally\* the only person in my entire family with an income. I'm worried about my parents. And now I'm paying off my own ambulance bill since, over the past year, I seem to have developed a penchant for losing consciousness in the middle of cafes for no discernible reason. Absolutely none of my family would want me to quit for financial reasons, but the idea that I could \*possibly\* be making a decent paycheck within a year or two is incredibly comforting right now. I know people talk shit about how much community college professors make, but I've seen the starting salary schedules and it's already more than anyone in my family has \*ever\* made. And the later schedules are nearly an inconceivable amount of money for someone who grew up like me. I could be happy with that.

And as for research as a passion... I don't need to make a discovery. I'm a theorist, so I can easily do my \*tinkering\* without many resources. I'd probably never discover anything novel, but I could be happy with that. At least it would be stuff that I'm interested in, that I feel is mine.

So I think I'm going to go talk to administration on Monday about the logistics of transferring into the Master's program to finish up. If I do that I'll have all of the typical qualifications to teach physics at a community college, or possibly as an adjunct at a university, however I can get started. But lots of community colleges don't have many physics classes, so I plan to spend another year in grad school taking math courses until I reach the typical preferred requirements for teaching college level math. That way I could get my foot in the door through either department, possibly.  In the meantime, my university has a program where students can get an internship to develop and teach their own college-level science course. I already know one of the guys in charge of that program, so I'll ask him for advice. He also has a lot of connections at the local community college since he used to work there.

I'll have to break the news to my adviser, who is very nice but I'm sure will try to talk me out of it. I'll have to cancel my exam. And I'll have to tell my parents, which.... Is going to break my heart. I doubt my wife's parents are going to be impressed with me either.

My wife is being super supportive of the switch. She says I've never looked happier or more motivated. I don't really know. I feel lost.

I'm not sure if I'm just looking for support by posting this, or if I really want advice. If you have either to give, I'd really appreciate it."

I worked hard. 

Now after the offer, my dad (also in IT as sys admin Tier 3) said that if I graduate faster I’ll make more money, and that I’m wasting time interning and making less than I would be full time. His advice is to get out of school fast and make the full time salary. 

There is some merit to what he’s saying as IT is booming right now. The quicker I get out the quicker I get to the better salaries.

I would miss out on the help and company of my friends and probably be lonely for the last 2 yrs when I come back. 

On the other hand, I get real world skills, connections, a company that will have a high chance of hiring me and money towards my loans. I also have more downtime to work on things like an AWS certifications and time to build an investment portfolio. Leaning towards this option more.

Confused about what to do because I generally respect my dads opinions, sometimes he’s wrong, sometimes he’s right, either way still confused.

Major: GIS with CS minor (I know this doesn't look as good as an actual CS major or engineering majors)

Programming experience: Java, Python, teaching myself JavaScript and HTML. Plans to improve my knowledge in C++ and SQL.

Location: Major tech hub, but willing to relocate anywhere if a good opportunity arises because competition here is fierce

Personal projects: Working on a web app in React.js, plans to do a small project in Java.

Job experience: \~1 year internship experience doing some basic data work and doing basic python scripting, some 2 years of work experience before that unrelated to CS

Plan for the next 8 months: Network as much as possible by going to SWE meetups and joining SWE related clubs at my college. Try to make more personal contacts in the industry by finding a mentor.

coq8wb,8,2019-08-10,Alternatives to programming?,florvas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/coq8wb/alternatives_to_programming/,"Hi folks,

I'm a recent CS graduate; got my Bachelor's in June, and I've been trying to get a foot in the door on software development in the greater Seattle-Redmond area. I've put in about 200 applications since June, and another 100 in the year leading up to that. Internships, contract positions, everything. I'm pretty decent at what I do, have a fairly strong GitHub presence, and can provide examples of both my software projects and their documentation. In the rare event I find someone who cares, I had a 3.95 GPA overall upon graduation, and I do have work experience (although outside of a brief DBA internship with the school, none of it is relevant). I feel like I can make a strong case for myself. 

But not only have I not gotten a job, I haven't even gotten contacted for an interview. Week after week, it's been applications galore, and not hearing back from anyone. After about a month I gave up and branched out to start looking into positions in database &amp; business analysis as well, and even applying for entry level software positions I'm underqualified for. Still nothing (doesn't help that most BA positions require a ton of experience).

So basically, I'm in a position where I'm making okay money at my current job ($21/hr) which also allows me to work on software projects while I'm at work, but it's getting harder to weigh that against just hurrying up and getting into a career that caps out at more than 40k a year. Are there any positions that'd make a lateral transition into programming easier? Or even just a line of work I may not have thought of yet that I actually might have a chance getting into?"

A lot of my friends in tech are convincing me to give up this offer and try and switch to a tech career, and I'm giving some serious thought into that. I've done the intro to CS + Data Structures/algo classes in school, and while I didn't particularly love them (...not that I love working on spreadsheets all day either) I still got As for the classes. Overall however the much better WLB and better culture are very big draws for me, and I'm willing to put in as much as effort as it takes over my senior year to land a job when I graduate - if it's possible at all.

Is this a feasible idea especially with the pretty negative outlook in the economy? Has anyone done something similar, and are there any tips for framing an IB internship's experiences for tech recruiting?

TIA!"
coqnac,1,2019-08-10,VC Internship or not?,Worried_Smile,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/coqnac/vc_internship_or_not/,"Hi! I'm currently a PhD student at a top 3 international institution (think MIT/Harvard/Stanford), working on Deep Learning. I'm interested in joining Venture Capital after I graduate (I know, tough to get in, but I think it'd be a great fit!). I still have a few years left, but am trying to be proactive in my planning. I'm currently in a situation where I have a few great opportunities for potential internships, but am not sure what is the best prep for a career in Venture Capital. Specifically, I am wondering about the following: given that I want to join a VC firm after the PhD, what's the best place to do an internship:

\- Large tech company (Google, Amazon, etc.)

\- McKinsey

\- a tech startup

\- an actual VC firm.

Now, for most other jobs, I'd of course say go for what you actually want to do. But given that I still have a few years left for my PhD and so far only have experience on the technical side, I'm not sure this is the right path here. Would it make more sense to get technical experience at a top notch place like google, would it be better to get startup experience, or should I try to go directly for a VC firm (maybe lacking the experience to be a great intern). So far, I don't have startup experience or a lot of industry experience. I have a background in engineering and have worked at some very famous places and universities, but that was always on the research/engineering side. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

&amp;#x200B;

So i have been studying Computers since like i was 16. Recently i transferred over to a very recognized university to study Computer information systems (CIS). basically i went from Computer Science(CS) -&gt; CIS I have always liked math and the applicaitons of it but in CS it seem that the content was to bland to be even be attractive so i decided to do it on my own (so far im intermidiate in java, Batch, Powershell, and a novice in c++, and bash) I have had a lot of fun in CIS but it occured to me... anyone can do this... literary all i know was because I looked it up online and learned the ins and outs of a computer and getting to know more of it as the years went by (I even got an internship!) but I really dislike been normal? i mean the major is great and all but by its self it seems a bit uh okay? so I wanted to pair it up with mathematics! I am capable of understanding it up to calculus 2. 

Pure math looks like a lot of FUN! but I hate proofing so I looked into Applied mathematics and it really calls my attention. In the other hand electrical and computer engineering also looks very attractive! thing is I can only choose one since Im about to graduate in 2 years if everything goes according to plans. and can only aim for one extra major. Is applied math a door that can open many doors? I have tried to look up if anyone as ever doubled major in math + CIS but have been very unfortunate to find anything on it.

If anyone has experience on this and were did it let you? How did you like it? is it a good combination? Can i become an engineer if i wish in the future?"

I posted here about 6 months ago asking for advice about deciding between internship opportunities for this summer. In the end, I went with all of your recommendations to accept the new offer from the FANG company in the Bay Area, and it was absolutely the right decision so thank you guys so much for that! I have had an amazing summer and learned so much more than I have at any other job/internship by miles, and have had such fun doing it as well! 

The summer and my internship are coming to an end soon, and while I do not know yet if I will receive a return offer (fingers crossed!), I have been doing a lot of thinking about my plans when I graduate from college this coming spring and look for a full time job as a software developer/engineer.   The main issue is that I am from the East Coast, and so is all of my family, friends, and girlfriend. I honestly have loved living and working in the Bay Area the past three months and 100% want to move out here when I can, but I'm not sure if I am ready to leave all of that behind now, and would feel much better doing it in summer 2021 rather than 2020 so that my SO is able to move with me, which she has already said she is willing to do. 

However, I am worried about potentially rejecting the offer of a lifetime. I absolutely love the team I was placed on, they're all really awesome people to work with and also hang out with outside of work. Additionally, due to the perception of certain aspects of the company culture which I have heard and also seen firsthand occasionally, I know that my team is somewhat unique at this company for being very low-stress, flexible (my teammates and I can **actually** come and leave work whenever we please so long as the work gets done), and generally a great experience to be a part of, while also doing meaningful work. The product that we own is highly visible and I as an intern have already had a direct impact to millions of people. I am worried if I choose to go to an East Coast location or any other team, I will have a worse experience. Also, **I am genuinely** ***terrible*** **at interviewing for software positions!** Honestly believe I got in this time via a fluke and am seriously doubtful I could pass later if I declined now and wanted to come back, despite the fact that I have gotten a good deal of praise for my actual work this summer. 

**Wall of text aside, the options I was thinking of are:**

**1) If offered, accept the return to my team and move cross-country to the Bay Area starting summer 2020.**

**2) Accept the offer, but to a different location on the East Coast (lower salary etc.), allowing me to stay near my loved ones and home but risking a poor team placement and upsetting my current team/burning that bridge.**

**3) Stay at school one extra year for its 5-year Bachelor's + Master's program, intern at the company again next summer (if offered), and come back for full time Summer 2021 when my SO is ready and able to move with me.** Main concern with this one is I am kind of burned out of school and want to start working, but also feel like once I get in industry I will never have the motivation to go back for my Masters'. Plus this way gets it done in one year instead of two!

&amp;#x200B;

Of course no matter what I will continue looking and applying for other jobs at other companies, but the context of this question is more so the best course of action assuming I would like to stay at this company for full-time. Thank you all for your advise and opinions! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Concerned about leaving loved ones &amp; SO on the East Coast for (potential) FT job offer at FANG next year, struggling to choose best course of action."
cor3fo,3,2019-08-10,"How do you ""put yourself out there"" and make decent friends after abusive experiences?",Theoptionalusername,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cor3fo/how_do_you_put_yourself_out_there_and_make_decent/,"I'm sorry if this is more relevant for another subreddit. I'm still learning which subreddits are best for topic-relevancy and what-not. 

I was raised by an only child of a single codependent parent with drug addiction (that parent is now sober and has been for a while now). She raised me outside a small city where the only means to socialization were the church and strange for me (positive for her) AA meetings. I rarely attended the elementary school I went to, mainly because I wasn't supervised much and could miss going to school if I wanted to. 

Middle school wasn't much different. Towards the end of 6th grade my mom, now sobering up, connected me with a kid who was the child of a friend from AA. Needless to say, this friend was older and had friends of his own that I did not, friends that were also older and confident and with access to drugs. 

(I don't want to overdo this post or seem self-pitying, so I'll try keeping things brief).

For the next 4 years, I used substances, occasionally went to school, and was the funny young character that hung out with the older crowd. I, of course, latched onto the friend that introduced me to everyone else and did everything he said. I conflated my affection for him with love. The usual spiral. 

For those 4 years, that friend beat me, publicly shamed me, and defeated my sense of self-worth. I don't want to give any specific details for obvious reasons. 

Eventually, through a weird course of events, I replaced our relationship with a girl I met and many confusing pieces of advice from my mother's friends from AA. Still with me? I know this is more typing than I first intended. 

I got an internship with our cities paper and ""cleaned up"". Quotation marks. It was nice for a time and after the relationship, I had with the girl previously mentioned went sour, I jumped to another, and another, and the saga continued. Not unusual, I know, but I had one friend during the rest of high school. During this time I moved out of my mothers home, found couches to sleep on, and somehow graduated through small but nice acts of charity. 

At some point during this stage of self-development, the friend I described earlier killed himself by jumping in front of oncoming traffic. I'm still unsure what to make of that. 

Okay, cut to *the typical pre-college phase.* I panicked, didn't think I deserved to attend university, and after throwing away several scholarships decided to live in an apartment with a new friend I met at work. 

This friend ended up being the last friend I'd make for 3 years. I repeated the old cycle. I was enamored by the friend (who was much older), I was dependent on the friend. There were many promises I made to myself about starting companies, proving people wrong through unconventional means, you name it. Eventually, I had cut off everyone I knew and moved with that same friend across the country. 

*Cut to now.*   


So, we ended up in Virginia. The one place where nobody could find me? I did something uncharacteristic recently and cut ties with my friend of 3 years. We're still on speaking terms but I recognize too many similar dynamics that I've let keep me from living life and building self-esteem. 

So here are am, 21 years old, moving to my hometown because I have nowhere else to go (insufficient funds, etc, etc). All I have to ask Reddit is: how do you try making friends after experiences like this? 

I have not had the worst life. I have not had anything close to what others describe in daily life. Still, I am terrified of meeting new people. I'm scared that I am incapable of even having the simplest friendships? I am worried that I am going to remain this way. 

What suggestions do you have? 

PS: Thank you if you made it this far. I know this was a lot to read in one sitting, but I really appreciate it if you did. So yeah."
cortzd,4,2019-08-10,I finally went to an interview not nervous,moshywilly,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/cortzd/i_finally_went_to_an_interview_not_nervous/,"I am an IT major in college and will be a senior. I currently work at a law firm doing clerical work, because I could not get a regular paid internship. I only worked one unpaid one during last fall semester while working this job while being in school. I have had multiple IT intern interviews this year and last year. I've gone to some not nervous, but during this year, I've been nervous a lot. I am not really great at my major and most people in my major have more skill than me and seem more devoted. My resume does not stick out a lot, but I have ""stretched the truth"" to gain attention.

I got called in for an interview at a small tech support company and the interview was easy. When I walked in the building, I rang the bell for their office. I fucked up at first when this one guy answered the door. I am not great at public speaking/having sentences prepared and I spoke in a nervous way to tell him I have an interview with the name of the interviewee. Luckily, he was not the interviewee. In the interview, they did not quiz or ask me anything regarding IT content, but they just asked me if I could handle phone customer service and answering customer questions. They also asked me for my college schedule this upcoming semester, where I live, and other logistics. I have really unique sense of humor, which is the only reason why I even have friends (I only have a few friends) and I kind of showed it at this interview. My humor comes out so natural that I don't even notice it. I wondered why they were slightly laughing at the some things I was saying to them during the interview. I impressed them. I was a little nervous, but to hide the nervousness, I sat back on the chair. We were taught in a college class that sitting back on a chair makes you look confident physically. It also prevented my back from feeling the pain of nervousness. This time, I didn't swallow a gazillion times like all my other interviews. Hopefully I get this position by the beginning of September!"
cos9ky,0,2019-08-11,Equality in our field discussion,oops_1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cos9ky/equality_in_our_field_discussion/,"Is it wrong that colleges and companies are giving exclusive opportunities only to women in computer science? 

There are many majors that have similar gender gaps with the majority being female yet there are no exclusive opportunities to encourage men into those fields. I've experienced many exclusive events, presentations and internships being provided solely for women and it just doesn't feel right to me. I haven't seen anyone (male or female) being hazed or discouraged by their peers. From what I've experienced,  everyone is very helpful in my college. We want everyone to succeed no matter gender, race, etc. I have asked this question to my peers and enjoyed listening to their perspectives which is why I posted it here. 

My point of view to start:
I personally feel that having exclusive opportunities to women belittles them as if saying they need the extra help to succeed in this field. It is creating a divide instead of bringing us together on the one thing we all (male and female) share, our passion for computer science and desire to see each other graduate and become successful. The solution to decreasing the gender gap in computer science shouldn't be done by excluding males simply because there are too many.

I'd like to know what's everyone's perspective and thank you for taking the time to share. 


Also, I'm happy to see so many people love what they do in the computer science field that it really makes me excited to be graduating soon. I also want to thank those who have shared their problems in the field. I have learned so much from the comments on how to tackle various issues and hope that everything turns out well for those who have had it rough.

Edit to add table from Department of Education on the enrollment of men and women in each field of study.
[Table](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_318.30.asp)
The statistics are here to support the point that other majors have a large gender divide with men as the minority and no exclusive opportunities that I've heard of.

I know this is probably something that gets asked a lot, but I wanted to get some responses more tailored to my situation.

So I'm an upcoming junior Comp Sci major, and I'm far enough along that I know C++ alright (still a little wary of more complex pointers and due to some departmental changes I don't really know how to work with common libraries), but haven't taken a Software Engineering class, or anything database-related. I basically know data structures and how to code the standard ones.

I've started looking around at internships, but it doesn't look like I meet any of the requirements. Most ask for some knowledge of SQL, or JSON, or Rest APIs. I've never worked with any of those, and barely understand what they are. They've never been mentioned in my classes. 

I've also looked at sample coding interviews, and it feels like I wouldn't be able to do any of them. I code slowly, and have to double-check syntax a lot. I usually just keep running the code as I go along and work piece-by-piece, but it doesn't look like coding interviews would accept that at all. I also am very hazy on using classes and superclasses, as well as objects, properly. It's something that I'd have to do a quick google of first before I could incorporate it into my code. The class that was SUPPOSED to teach me all of that had a professor who didn't do anything, and I know I can try to teach myself, but I'm feeling very overwhelmed.

I would like to say that I AM very good at communication and management (I'm a manager of a 'club' that's more like a small organization; we handle a lot of money to put on a big event every year), but I feel like I'm terrible at computer science.

So, what should I do? Do I take online courses? Just try to get better at coding interview problems through sheer memorization? Am I not as bad off as I think I am?"

Will I be okay CS career-wise?,Beardactal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cosz5p/rising_junior_studying_abroad_in_a_few_weeks_will/,"To start off, I'm technically a senior by credits and only need roughly 20-25 credits before I can graduate (and about 4 more CS classes). I had a lot of credits coming in and took decent loads (4-5 classes per semester) every semester for the past 2 years. 

Last fall my ""sophomore"" year I decided I was going to do study abroad for 2019. I didn't have any professional  CS experience at all.

Fast forward to this summer and I just completed an 8-week research project at my school and made a solid Android app (I centered a research question around it). It comes with a fancy report and source code and everything! I learned a lot from this experience and feel like mobile app/game development is something I'm interested in. 

However, I wonder if me studying abroad this fall (4 months) will negatively impact my career path in any way. More specifically I'm worried about my lack of internship and interview experience will take a toll on me getting anything worthwhile next Summer. I heard summer after Junior year is prime time for getting industry jobs/internships. Additionally, My friends might be referring me to companies like Amex or Microsoft but those are really up in the air right now and I just don't feel like I'm ready especially since I haven't even gotten a phone interview.

I did get 1 medium-sized company email me about setting up a time for an interview but they never responded even after following up twice (this was partly my fault since I didn't see the email until a few days later when i was out of town).

My professors have been advising me to keep my problem-solving skills sharp by doing leetcode and my research advisor even wants me to continue my project next Spring, etc. 

**TLDR; I am a rising junior CS student and have no experience with CS interviews, no internships so far, only have 2 month research experience, and am going study abroad during Fall of my junior year. Am I hurting myself career-wise?**

The problem is, as a second major student, although I take as much credits of CS courses as a first major student, I can choose my CS courses more freely, and I ended up taking a lot of classes that does not directly translate to what is needed in my workplace (i.e. Computer Graphics), and not taking some of the classes that is quite crucial, for example, Intro to Software Engineering. Looking back from now, how am I supposed to skip that? And, not sure if it is the same in other unis/colleges, but there aren't as much coding courses offered. I can recall taking 3 or 4 full-on coding courses, and the other courses are pretty academic-driven.

After graduation, I didn't really think of entering the finance industry, so I headed towards landing a job in the CS industry without any internship experiences. Fortunately, I got a job in a local tech startup, seeing this opportunity as a stepping stone as I have no prior experience in the CS industry, nor do I have a proper CS degree. The founders all have pretty spectacular backgrounds, and more specifically, one of them was once the managing director of an industry-leading multinational corporation. So I thought to myself, it could be a very good opportunity to learn closely from the founders, and maybe this startup could be the next unicorn?

So far a year has passed. Somehow in a tech startup, I am the only full-time developer. I've been working on the front-end, back-end, database and the blockchain, picked up Java, Node.js + React (and of course HTML5/CSS), SQL, Python, and was doing system design, development, QA mostly on my own, and sometimes with a part-time developer (which is my classmate). 

I directly report to the CTO, which hasn't been hands-on programming for the last 20 years, so that means I would need to learn things on my own. I hardly get time to sit down and learn, and even when I do, it's most likely not in-depth. Most of the time I would try to do things properly, but often times I would switch to delivering a workable solution, as I don't even know what is the proper way of programming. Now that when I look back to the code I've written, although there are attempts of maintaining good programming habits, it's still loosely structured, written unclearly and inconsistently. 

From day 1 my CTO was in look of a senior developer and I have continually brought this up to urge him once in a while,  but nothing happened till now. Frankly speaking I don't see any positives staying in the job anymore since the startup has slowly drifted away from the starting objective, and the Round B funding has still yet to come, and on top of that, I'm quite a bit underpaid. Most importantly, this is not a healthy environment for myself to improve as a developer.

Apart from that, I've gotten a step forward on my side business - Music Production. I've recently won a songwriting/music  arranging contest, and have met several well known producers in the industry. One of them straight up tells me not to waste time like he did when he was working for Apple as a developer for 3 years, and to slowly shift myself into the music industry. I was craving to be a full time musician but I never convinced myself that I can make a living out of it. Now that I have a chance I would want to put more time and effort into it to get my name known in the industry. I don't plan to dive straight into music full-time, but probably work as a developer for 5-6 more years until I can live on my music. I'm exploring the likes of switching to a full remote job to save up travel time and have more flexible hours.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm weighing all my options and in need of help.

&amp;#x200B;

**Just a quick TL;DR if anyone needs it:**

\- Graduated from college with CS being Second Major

\- Working in a startup as their only developer

\- As a sole junior developer, software development was done badly as there's no-one to learn from

\- Thinking of switching to a full-remote job

\- Long term target is to work in Music Production, not as a full-time developer

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1: Staying in the company until it closes down**

Although it's not the best environment for a developer, the founders are really strong in their own aspects and I can still learn a thing or two from them. However, this may mean that I'm not moving in the right direction career-wise. 

  
**Option 2: Job Seeking while working**

This option seems to make the most sense. However I don't really have confidence with my programming skills. I feel like I'm doing my job wrongly and I may have a hard time landing a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 3: Quit my job, learn programming properly for a month or two and look for a job**

In where I'm living, having 2 months blank on CV never looks good, and a fair share of explanation may be needed. However, I get to focus of re-educating myself as a developer and I can further polish my personal website and prepare for job hunting. Not sure if it's useful, but I may take a coding bootcamp or online courses for the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that I have concerns on**

\- Is remote actually better? I'm sure my work efficiency is much better at home and I learn things by myself all the time, but should I look for an office job instead? 

\- Should I seek for a job in a large corp? It seems that they have more resource in training up a developer. Or is it just unlucky for me to have only myself in a startup? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that I would like to have**

\- Time and flexibility. I need the time to work on my music. I don't mind working overtime for a bit but if it goes down to 60+ working hours a week then I'd probably say no. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that I don't mind**

\- Salary. Since I'm already underpaid and I still haven't starved to death($27500 USD annually, that's a barely-acceptable wage as a fresh grad in where I live), it's acceptable for me to sacrifice a higher salary for the time and flexibility a job offers me.

\- Prospect. I'm planning to work in this industry for 4 to 5 more years at most. I still love CS and I like being a developer, but deep down in my heart I feel I belong to music.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for such a long storytelling. It would be grateful if I can hear any advises from you."
coyb78,4,2019-08-11,How to transition from corporate accounting/finance to data science?,wild_bill34,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/coyb78/how_to_transition_from_corporate/,"Hi all,

I recently graduated from university with degrees in BI/analytics and accounting and now work in corporate finance/accounting for a large healthcare company (I’ve done a co-op and 2 internships with this company during school as well). Although I began this role a few months ago, I’m quickly realizing that corporate finance is not the path for me and my true passion lies in data science. I’m curious to see if there is a way to transition from corporate finance to the data science track so that I may one day become a data scientist or similar type role.

During my schooling, I worked a lot with creating and managing databases, dealing with different data types, and a ton of SQL. I also have a ton of elementary statistics and data mining under my belt. I have a strong understanding of modeling techniques such as regression models/classification trees/ANOVA, and other techniques such as PCA/Factor analysis and cluster analysis as well. Through my school’s analytics department, I also wrote a research paper on how logistic regression and other modeling techniques can be used to predict change in waist circumference to tailor fitness programs. I know there are many more modeling techniques to learn but I can learn them no problem. 

In terms of programming, I’ve been using DataCamp for a couple years to learn R and Python. I love working on small, personal projects using python/pandas to import and manipulate and clean data, and using R to create models and visualize data (although I’m working on learning more python so I can just use it for everything). I can also use data visualization tools such as Tableau and PowerBI really well.

Long story short, I love working with data and aside from a couple python programs I wrote to automate tedious work tasks, my job doesn’t allow me to do anything data science related and it really makes me feel unfulfilled. I’m trying to network within my company and find a more data science-oriented role. I also think about waiting a couple years and going for a masters in operations research, but I’m unsure as to whether I should switch jobs to a BI data analyst role if that would make me more marketable. I’m curious to see what the best Avenue is for getting on the right path? If anyone has experienced anything similar, I would much appreciate any help on this. I apologize for the long winded post."
coyr5o,1,2019-08-11,Cracking the Code Interview,LittleBabyCoder,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/coyr5o/cracking_the_code_interview/,"Hi guys,

I'm entering my third year in college and was told by my professor to buy the book ""Cracking the Code Interview"" to prepare for internship interviews this September/October. I did. The problem is that I find this stuff to be really boring compared to actually learning. These questions don't feel like actual computer science, which is discouraging. Is it true that you need to spend weeks and weeks grinding through stupid interview questions to even have a shot? I don't even need (or want, really) an internship at Google, FB, Amazon, etc. I'd rather have a local place that allows me to stay at home.

&amp;#x200B;

So how much time should I put into this in the final 3 weeks of summer compared to continuing the Odin Project and building projects there?"

If this is against the rules somehow just remove it, but I don't think it is.

Anyway, I'm in the summer after my first year of college. My first year was pretty bad and also I didn't get into the major I wanted at my school, so I'm looking into doing a year at a community college then transferring elsewhere after that.

I applied for a couple internships for this summer, but I didn't get any. I know that most places generally don't take freshmen anyway, and on top of that I didn't have a single class that would really give me useful skills for an internship. One of my friends was able to take engineering drawing, welding, machining, etc. classes at his school, and he actually managed to get an internship.

Right now I'm trying to learn MATLAB and Solidworks on my own. I'd like to try getting an internship again, but I don't want to wait until next summer. Is it common for people to get part-time internships while they're still in school? I think that if I could do a part time internship alongside my courses when I go back to school, I'd be in a much better place. I already have a job but replacing that with an internship that is more relevant to what I need to do and pays better would be ideal for me. That is, if it's even a good idea in the first place.

Any advice?"

I just got an offer from PwC to join the firm next January. 

I am done with my internship and will go back to my place to finish up my undergraduate degree. I may have to go back and wait tables again to earn income.

I am just curious that since it is only 6 months apart until I start full time, have you processionals from the Big 4 firms ever heard or seen people who are allowed to work part time like that?

I meant if I started in August then it might be tough. I would ask anyway. All they can say is NO.

I don’t wanna wait tables any more. I would prefer to work in a professional environment where I can develop my skills and my career. 

This part time work load, if allowed, may be mainly remote. I can travel if necessary and that implies I will skip my classes but it won’t be a big deal. I assume that I will have to speak with the firm about that.

I just wanted to hear your inputs.

Freshman mentor (junior and senior year). NC Governor's School this summer. Took online classes first two summers of high school. Member of my school's Natural Science Academy and county wide Academy of Scholars. Doing an internship now with the district court judge and with my state senator. This year I'll be the debate team captain, write for my school's newspaper (which I helped to found), and will continue with most of my aforementioned EC's.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I haven't written my essays yet but I'm a fairly talented writer and will be devoting a lot of time to them so I imagine they will be pretty strong. For my woman in history essay I plan to write about Mileva Maric. For my why Barnard essay... I will make it very apparent that I am extremely passionate about this school and will discuss how my high school has a close community that helps me thrive/contribute and I expect the same at Barnard. For the person depending on me I'm going to talk about my mom and how she's relying on me to ""break the cycle"" in our family and rise above my circumstances in life which I expect to be fairly powerful.

For my LORs I'm getting my English teacher (has written several recommendations for programs/scholarships that I have gotten every time, very talented writer. I've had him a lot and we get along really well and I trust that this is a good letter), my AP Euro/Human teacher (my favorite teacher all time. He's the one who has encouraged me most to go into politics and has helped shape a lot of my ambitions and plans. I'm also close with his wife who was my former English teacher and she will most certainly proofread/help write his LOR. I expect this to be good too; people in his other classes complain about how he never stops bragging about me to them), and my AIG Counselor (we're very close and she helped me get into Governor's School. I expect this one to be great as well). My regular counselor will likely discuss my financial situation and home life and how that has impacted my ability to succeed in certain ways in her letter (I have to devote a significant amount of time to running my household and caring for my 2 siblings as my mom works constantly and there is no one else to do it, meaning I can't do as many EC's as I'd like).

I'm also applying for SP\^2 for environmental science. Thoughts on my chances for that?

I've called it Puddle, it is very much a work in progress still, but I have all the technicalities figured out so it is just a matter of grinding it out. The reason I post this is to 

1. Get your input if you would use this (it is completely open source and free, obviously)
2. Gather feature ideas to implement
3. Ask for help (down the road) on safe web practises and on accepting arbitrary code from users. I don't want malicious code fucking up my system, but I can't do anything like that myself (I'm only a second year student)

I'm working an internship full time for the next few weeks, so I will try to grind this out on my down-time.

cp7czn,8,2019-08-12,"I want to leave my current job, but I feel indebted to stay and I feel bad if I part ways [F20]",cucumberflesh,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cp7czn/i_want_to_leave_my_current_job_but_i_feel/,"(Sorry in advance if this is a long read. It's sort of a vent as well, but I wanted to provide as much details explaining. I'll provide a tl;dr down below for those who don't want to read.)

My first job ever is working at a floral shop company, and I've been working there for four years now to the present day. I started working as a teenager in the summer of my sophomore-junior year. I needed community service hours for NHS, and my cousin-in law, who was a manager at the time, helped me by recommending me to the two owners. They really liked me for my personality and work ethic and asked if I wanted to start working there officially. I didn't go through an interview process or anything, so I thought it must've been really good considering I had no experience in the floral business. I only worked part-time and was paid minimum wage, but considering that I was going to school at the same time, it was doable for me.

The first two years were wonderful. I was never stuck doing one job so I was able to pick up on many skills in retail, floral and customer service, assisting events and installations, and doing warehouse work and manual labor. I learned a lot about flowers and plants, and have grown an eye for design and decor, which fits well with my interest in art. I was able to go to different locations and venues I've never been to, so I always looked forward to whenever they needed me for installations. Few of my coworkers have been really kind to me to where I see them as family; they would offer me rides home and pay for my lunch/share with me, and they would always talk with me to know how I am. My bosses especially are really great; they always check up on me whenever they see me because they care about me, and they have been generous with the gifts they've given me. The company also has animals that I've grown attached to over the years since I take care of them when I come in, so that adds to the enjoyable experience of working there.

Of course things weren't always just sunshine and butterflies. I've made many mistakes since it was my first job, and some have almost gotten me fired because mistakes = money out the window and upset, high end customers makes the company look bad and suffer losses, so you can imagine the backlash when someone messes up. Work is normally paced, but it does get stressful and intimidating when it gets busy. But I've learned to pick myself up and move on from former mistakes and have dedicated myself to working hard since. It didn't hit me till later on, but there was a lot of questionable and unfair things that happened to me that I never questioned or just dealt with because I thought it was normal in a working environment. Now that I've been working there for four years, I see so much that I know the things I will and will not tolerate any more. 

For a while now, I've been thinking about leaving my workplace. One valid reason is that I want to work closer to my college. The company is a closer to my home but far from school, so my hours were always limited. But one big reason is that I don't feel happy going in for work. Even though I can do pretty much do everything except management and designing, which is dealt by the higher ups and licensed/experienced florists, they have been putting me in the backburner working only warehouse. They have me do that because out of everyone, I'm the one most experienced and have been there the longest (no one wants to do them either). I've seen the company grow over the years and it has opened up its doors to hiring more people. Yet, I'm still the most underpaid person and I'm literally doing the same, if not more, jobs that the new hirees are being paid more to do. Even the interns who work during the summer are paid more. Money wasn't too much of a big deal to me back then, but it honestly kind of makes me depressed to think about now that I'm a college student.

Another big reason is that I dread coming in to deal with my manager. I can deal with unpleasant encounters with customers or stressful rush days, but if you add him into the equation, it makes it unbearable. I will give him credit for being a super talented individual, but as a manager, he makes things difficult. He has this flamboyant personality that's just who he is, but it's the things he does and says that gets to me. He's always had this impression of me slacking off; when I'm on my lunch, I'm usually on my phone. One of my former coworkers saw me and thought that I wasn't working so they tattled on me. So he has other people ""monitor"" me by having them work with me, or gives me a big list of mundane tasks and projects to keep me busy.
He also has this impression that I don't always tell the truth; one time, I requested time off the weekend to go to an event for my college paper. My boyfriend was in town the same weekend, and we were going to go there together. I didn't tell him that my boyfriend was going to the event with me, so when my cousin-in law mentioned that to him, he thought I lied so I could play hooky to spend time with boyfriend. He trusts my cousin-in law and have always called/talked to her to complain about me, so I received a lot of backlash from her too. Anything that I say is just an excuse to him and doesn't make me genuine in his eyes even though I am.
He and I can never have a light-hearted or thought out conversation together because he always talks down about other people (and me when I'm not around). I always feel intimidated and anxious around him too because I'm never sure what he's going to say or do. He's also not a very responsible manager because of his forgetfulness and last-minute planning so I often end up drawing the short end of the stick and get stuck with doing things that inconvenience me. And the worse thing about that is that he gets away with his mistakes versus if I mess up on something, the whole world is against me. A lot of former coworkers that I've enjoyed working with have left because of him (they will never say it, but it's really obvious since I have overheard conversations of them being frustrated by my manager). He has done a lot for me too in the past, but when you look at the bigger picture over time, it just doesn't look good at all.

There's a lot of things that I've noticed about the company as well, but overall, I just feel like leaving that environment so I can pursue a job elsewhere that'll work for me more. But I feel bad if I part ways because I don't want it to seem like I don't care about them or the company, especially since they've done a lot for me. It's strange because even though they've put me in the backburner and I haven't been compensated much for my work, they always rely on me or get happy when they see me come in, so it makes me feel conflicted. I don't see myself working there for the rest of my life, but I don't want to keep working there long enough where it gets to that point. I know that any job or career I pursue in the future will not be as kind or as lenient as my bosses and coworkers have been toward me, and they wouldn't be so if they didn't truly care about me. I don't know, I just feel this weird guilt when I think of leaving.

TL;DR: I want to leave my current job but feel indebted to stay because of the kindness my coworkers and bosses have shown me throughout the years. Yet I have grown unhappy and fed up with the current working environment and people there that I want find work closer to my college, get compensated more for, and feel happier overall. But I feel bad and conflicted about leaving."

I'm 27 yrs old, full time single father. I've done 2 years of community College full time since I got out of the U.S. ARMY (combat veteran). I've went from (in order) game design certificate, game design associates, game design for Transfer, to computer science for Transfer, to software engineering engineering for Transfer, and now I'm at electrical engineering for Transfer. Math and programming have been life savers for me. I enjoy them. I may not always get the best grades in them, but I enjoy them. For over a year now, I've been closely watching the private space industry, and it has done nothing but excite and motivate me. When I went into comp Sci I realized that space could be an option for me. It really got triggered when my college offered me the opportunity to do an internship at NASA which banks on my game design and programming experience. Recently I've found my family will be moving from California (riverside area) to Phoenix Arizona. I go with my family as they help support me as I work on my education to set myself up for my next career. Knowing this, it changed the university to transfer to dramatically. I grew up in my adolescents in phoenix AZ. I love it there, but also I've fallen in love with ASU. the programs they offer seem amazing to me from their website to reviews. So I'm going to ASU garenteed. As someone who is a pc gamer and built their own pc, I nonstop read news about science improvements in hardware whether cpu, motherboard, or gpu; I get excited. I know electrical engineering does alot of that. But computer engineering is also offered. But no matter what I want both of those to get me into a space company and I want to go to space and work with space ships. Not only is it an industry that will be making a huge growth, but I love everything about it. I've been into space exploration since I was a preteen (Mass Effect and Halo played big roles in this) , and I haven't stopped apparently lol. Due to my military experience I've found myself as an exceptional leader, both at my part time job teaching kids how to program video games and as a project manager that got a capstone game dev class to deliver a full game for a 3rd party client. I'd love to be a leader within engineering and space. I want nothing more than to go to at least the moon and hopefully Mars. Psychic readings have told me I'm going to the moon and my son will go to Mars. So I love computer technology, I strive to go to space and work for a space company, and I need advice on what's the right major for me to get my bachelor of science engineering. I intend to get my masters degree immediately after my bachelors degree. Any and all advice from any source would be most appreciated."

cp97re,2,2019-08-12,My Outlook On Relationships is Broken and Self-Conflicting. I don't know what to do.,Alt_11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cp97re/my_outlook_on_relationships_is_broken_and/,"I don't mean to make this length, and I'll try to only give context where needed as it's super easy for me to over contextualize a situation.

Admittedly, I try to practice introspection regularly and find that I'm really good at in a lot of aspects when understanding the way I feel about a particular problem. It's a skill I've practiced since my Highschool Psychology Class because I had a really one-of-a-kind teacher. But when it comes to understanding my thoughts about love, I view all the facts and the way I feel and I am simply overwhelmed and have no idea where to begin with fixing the problems. I'll separate them into two problems to try and make it easier to tackle.

**Problem number 1** is in the type of person I am attracted to. This is really hard to share and makes me feel like a horrible person, so I hope you don't jab me for this because I want to fix it. I am generally only attracted to success and/or a level of fame. I'm not talking about celebrities or anything like that-- just people who are doing generally well in life (good college pace, high paying jobs, super charismatic and have a good amount of friends, etc). And it's not really out of ""clout-chasing"" imo- I have no desire for fame or popularity and get overwhelmed by people easily and only like crowds of 2 or 3. It's like I just like being the companion of that kind of guy if that makes sense.

Now that may not initially sound like a real issue, but here's why (to me) it is. I've met some really stand-out, super sweet people in my life the past few years. There's been more than one experience where these people are attracted to me and ask me out, and I have to decline because I have zero attraction. None. I love who they are as people and the way they treat me, but they usually come along with an issue like in the midst of failing college or only having a couple friends. It's like when your favorite artist comes out with a song featuring one of your other favorite artists and just not being able to get into the song at all. It makes me feel guilty and like a horrible person because I think I am. On paper I know I sync with these people well but my subconscious just doesn't generate that romantic attraction.

Second reason why it's a problem-- I am very comparative to people, especially SO'.s It's one of the worst habits I have had in my entire life (likely because of how school was for me) and it drives me up the wall. Now I'm admittedly not very successful. I'm getting back on my feet recently after a traumatic childhood/young adult years (starting college at 25 now), am incredibly poor and just am overall a mess of depression and OCD. Made a lot of progress in those regards, but still have a lot of progress to make. I've dated a couple succesful people seriously (1-2 years) and both ended due to mutual reasoning. In my first, I was still really attracted to them but they were significantly more ""ahead"" in life and were moving across the country and getting super high paying internships while I had just lost my mom to a heart attack,   
and was stuck working two jobs scraping for pennies in the gap of my car to pay for her newfound medical bills putting my already late start to school on hiatus. I recognized that, so I broke up with them because I wasn't interested in holding him back from all the opportunities he was receiving, and there was just clearly a ""success"" gap. Second relationship was different context but same reason and went smoother.

These relationships leave me feeling broken. I still love the person a lot and even months later have attraction for them (abundance of mutual friends and we usually stay in touch to not cause problems). Not burning attraction mind you, just that little candle in the back of my mind just in case they want to get back with me in the case of convenient new circumstances y'know? But they leave me broken because it introduces self-loathing and envy of their gifted, problemless lives. I get disappointed/jealous when they date people more of their caliber, etc. So at the end of the day, I get attracted to these type of people which make me hate myself and my situation more, bring feelings of envy, and just make me feel like a bad person. I have these people in my life who get attracted to me because we're in similar boats and we could really build up each other and empathize with each other-- but my subconcious kicks them all to the dirt.

**Problem 2** is a bit(lot) simpler. I'm 25 and I am a person who consciously wants open relationships and even poly relationships (as long as they contain heavy romance). I know it's what I want. I've juggled romance and attraction for multiple guys at once (not behind their backs, don't worry) and felt success and love it. But they're almost doomed to fail, because how easily I get jealous. I would rather crush my quickness to jealousy rather than adopt a new outlook. I've looked up guides to not getting jealous and the main impression that I get is that A: my passion for romance leaves me in a fear of worrying that I will personally not be OK if a relationship fails and B: I need to better accept that I cannot control a person I am with. I'm not sure why I have these problems and they feel daunting to conquer...  


sorry for the wall of text... 

Simply put, I need advice on tackling jealousy after almost everything I've tried failing, and how to better adjust my attraction to people so I am not stuck grasping for fortune and success I am far from matching."

cpbyb5,2,2019-08-12,Considering switching majors from Civil Engineering to Software Engineering,mahirule,SoftwareEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/cpbyb5/considering_switching_majors_from_civil/,"I need some advice on making a key decision in my life. I am majoring in civil engineering at Rutgers and will be a junior in September. Currently, I am doing an internship with the New York State DOT as a Transportation Construction Inspector and I am so bored. All I do is watch the laborers, carpenters, and iron workers work in a couple of operations and that’s it. Rinse and repeat.

Don’t get me wrong, I am learning stuff here and there about field work, but is this how my work environment is going to be after I graduate with my degree? It’s come to the point where I am not looking forward coming to work, and considering switching my major from civil to computer engineering. I took AP Computer Science in high school and was really good at coding. Then again, a part of me is hesitant to switch majors because that means an extra year for me to graduate.

Do you feel like I am judging civil engineering too soon? Any advice would greatly be appreciated. Thank you."

cpddrj,1,2019-08-12,Recent communications grad struggling with job search (looking for jobs within digital marketing/social media),wheezyhutgeneral,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cpddrj/recent_communications_grad_struggling_with_job/,"Hi everyone!

This is my first post so hopefully it abides by the rules. I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for quite some time but wanted to make a post looking for some advice as I am really struggling to land a job.

I’m a recent college grad (graduated in May) in Michigan. I majored in Communications and PR. 

My previous experience is digital marketing/social media focused. My job that I had throughout college was an office assistant for the school’s Annual Giving department. On top of that I did a social media internship my junior year for a small fashion boutique. During my senior year I worked part time for a digital media company and did social media for their clients.

I am really trying to land a job within the cosmetic industry as that is where my passion lies. I also wouldn’t mind having a role within the fashion, travel, or animal industry.

Aside from 2 jobs, all of my applications have been to positions out of state (mostly in New York or Los Angeles). I’ve heard nothing back. No interviews, most of the time not even a response. As each day goes on and I don’t hear back I’m getting more and more discouraged. 

With all of the jobs I apply to I apply on the company website if possible. On top of that, I find who the person that the role would report to and I find that person’s email to send them my resume and cover letter just to try and have it in front of an actual person. That hasn’t worked out for me either.

I’m working on getting Google Analytics certified and then after that will go for an AdWords certification. (I have a list of a few certifications that is recommended for digital marketing/social media)

I don’t have my MI address on my resume and after seeing a post on this subreddit I have added “Relocating to *location where job is* in September 2019” on the top of my resume as well.

If you guys have any suggestions on what I can do to try to land more interviews I would love to hear it. Any certifications you recommend, adjustments to my resume to make it look better applying as an out-of-state candidate, etc. My mental health is taking a major hit from this so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"

There's a couple of good universities here in the UK offering part time remote master's CS degree, with tution of around £7,000 total which I'm considering doing to bolster my profile. 

If it helps - I'm 24 with no dependants, and have a bachelor's in business from a top 10 UK university.  Long term plan is either to attempt to start my own SAAS company or become a technical leader within scaleup companies, and I do enjoy the process of learning in general."

- Will I have enough time to take a class or two?

- What is the intern to FT conversion rate like?

- Will I get to borrow a Tesla at any point?

- Is the intern class very tight-knit or very competitive / snobby?"

I was wondering if I could accept the offer right now, and only register for courses for the Winter semester without consequence? If not, do I have any other options such as deferring my admission for the winter term?

cpf0c7,44,2019-08-12,Does anyone else just feel nothing towards their parents?,LoftyPr0,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/cpf0c7/does_anyone_else_just_feel_nothing_towards_their/,"To preface, this summer has been pretty hard for me. My girlfriend and I broke up at the beginning of the summer and I ended back at my hometown doing an internship. Really wanted to be working in Chicago this summer to meet new people and to experience the city life. My hometown is small and there's not a whole lot going on. Been going to therapy to work on my social anxiety and to help me come to term with my own emotions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my parents has always been very ""business professional."" Every interaction I have with them feels very scripted and almost routine, interactions you would almost expect at a office. Looking back on my  childhood, I don't have any fond memories with my parents. I learned very quickly that my parents love and affection was conditional. If I was performing poorly in school through their eyes (aka an A-) then they berate me, compare me to other children and just demean me under the guise of ""tough love"". They would say things like that since I'm there son they would NEVER say anything disparaging to me despite literally ten minutes ago they were calling my performance embarrassing to them and that John (arbitrary name) from down the block was doing xyz. My parents are unable to realize that despite what intentions they have with a phrase, that due to wording whatever they're saying may not be received in that manner. They also are just very reactive people, very quick to assume the worst, very dramatic, let emotions cloud their judgement and are never willing to listen to others. Literally one time I remember when one of my dads favorite singers died and I knew that he was planning on going  to see him live sometime in the near future so I said word for word ""Its a shame that you never got to see him before his passing"" and then my mom chimes in ""dont disrespect your father like that. Nothing he has done is shameful"" and of course I was like ""??? what???, I was literally just saying its sad that he didn't get to see him before he died chill out"" then my mom was like ""well you should of said that"" classic mom, one she heard ""shameful"" she latched onto the one negative connotation of that word and refused to be convinced otherwise that it was being used differently and let her anger blind her objective reasoning. but whatever i'm not gonna say anything back or try to reason with them because they cant be reasoned with and any ""debate"" with them is ""arguing with your elders and shows a lack of respect""

&amp;#x200B;

I never learned how to develop my own voice because more often than not if I'm out with my family/family friends my parents would do this weird thing were they would answer questions directed towards me for me. So it took me awhile to learn how to ""jump"" into a conversation myself without a direct prompting. I missed a lot of social events due to my parents thinking that I was wasting my potential by hanging out with my friends and would force me to stay home to study even when there wasn't anything to study. They would hardly ever compliment me and give any indication that they were proud of me.  Like when I was initially applying for colleges, one of my acceptance letters got sent to my parents email addresses by accident and at lunch my dad was like ""oh this email was meant for you, you got into Purdue btw"" and I'm like ""Oh thats great I got accepted into Purdue"" then my parents were like ""yea that is good"" bear in mind this was my first college acceptance ever and the conversation stopped after the last ""yea that is good"" like oh cool, not like your son is entering a whole new chapter of his life, but lets just treat it like its whatever. just downplay every achievement of his to ""thats expected of you to be performing at this level"" 

&amp;#x200B;

My family has never been one to display emotions to one another. I remember at one session with my therapist, he asked to me to give a list of adjectives describing the dynamics of my family. my family dynamic is honestly just cold. like roommate who doesnt really like his other roommates but is still just cordial with them to keep the peace. i dont share any intimite details about my life to them, i've never seen my parents as firends i can joke around with or a shoulder to lean on. even going through my most recent breakup, my parents never came to with support, they never asked about how I was holding up, never gave me any kind of advice. all they said about the situtaion occured in one random dinner we were having togethor and it can be boiled down to ""dont worry, you're young, you'll find someone"" gee thanks... 

all in all, my parents have really been tryign to ""reenter"" my life and try to make me see them as friends but I dont feel anything towards them. al the hate I hate towards them in high school and much of my early childhood has dissapated towards just nothingness. i'll love them like a son love his parents but no more. sorry if this is disorganized or really not going anywhere, just wanted to vent."

I wanted to get your take on this. I am starting my last two semesters for a BS in Computer Science in 2 days, and am looking to roll over right into the OMSCS at Georgia Tech. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.06 (I was an idiot 13 or so years ago at a community college, otherwise it would be 3.6 or so, which is my university GPA), and am a United States Air Force veteran. I just finished a software engineering internship covering Python, and I'm starting a cybersecurity internship in a few days. I'll have enough of my G.I. Bill benefits to get started on my Masters, but unfortunately not enough to cover all of it, just enough to get me started. My wife and I figured we could just use student loans to pay for the rest. I am kind of stuck overanalyzing my situation and wanted to get your opinions on the following questions:

1) Going for my MCS right away. Good idea, bad idea, and why/why not?  
2) Was told by some not to go after my Masters without getting funding first, either through employer coverage or reimbursement, or possible an option through Georgia Tech itself, such as teaching assistant, research assistant, or fellowship. Thoughts?  
3) I am still concerned that, despite getting a Masters, that I might still find it difficult getting a job, especially with no job experience except two internships under my belt. Is it just me?

Let me know what you all think."

Booked the exam on the 1st and got 857/900 :) Studied around 3 hours per day and also managed to squeeze in 10 practice questions every hour whilst at work.

Resources used/recommended:

Jason Dion's Network+ on Udemy - invaluable, concise but also good at explaining the fundamentals.  
Jason Dion's Network+ 6 Practice Tests - very good value for the price, pretty similar in difficulty/style to the real thing  
Kaplan Network+ Practice Tests (through my existing Cybrary subscription) - the most difficult of the practice tests I used, though very useful for finding gaps  
Pocket Prep Network+ App on Android - good for squeezing in practice everywhere, if a bit pricey

As a bit of background, I'm currently a undergrad studying Engineering but with quite a lot of background in sysadmin and cyber security (CPTE). I'm doing certs to try and prove what I know, as it can be quite difficult to get to employers with quite an unrelated degree."
cpgftq,1,2019-08-12,"Internship going horribly. How do I go about maintaining my sanity to stay? Or how can I quit politely, without being harassed in the interim?",TheGreenLoki,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cpgftq/internship_going_horribly_how_do_i_go_about/,"Hey there. I'm currently interning at a company that I interned with last summer. 

Last summer was great. I learned about the field I'm going to school for. They even offered to keep me on full time after last summer ended, but I had to decline to stay focused on my education. 

They wanted me back for summer 2019. And made promises that I could lead the next group of interns, and work on project management certification (six sigma/lean certificate). 

But. None of that has happened. 

Despite being overloaded and overwhelmed with work, I'm constantly berated for either A. The lack of quality on my projects (from being told to just rush them) to B. Having my work ethic called into question if I spend too much time on a project (from attempting to give them the quality that the company deserves). 

I've been told off for ""not knowing what to do,"" when I was never shown what to do. When I ask for help, I just get steered to someone else who has no idea. 

Not to mention I work full-time at a different business at night. I'm tired. Stressed. My anxiety levels are through the roof. 

The only thing keeping me here is the fact that I'm being paid here (pairs nicely with the money from my other job) and that I don't like to just start something and not finish it. 

If I were to turn in my badge and quit today, I have other people willing to give me a positive reference for the future. 

I don't want to burn this bridge. But I don't see any way out. 

What should I do?"

I have 9,000 saved currently.

Just want your two sense basically. I'm enrolled in both schools and only have a few days to choose.

Went to IUS last year for a semester and did okay, not well in my CS class but that's because it was late at night.

What are your thoughts and personal opinions on this?

Also if it's relevant, I'm a 19 yr old lady. I don't think I want kids, but if I do a CS degree could be useful for part time work, and pay well also.

But I really want to be an engineer. I want to pay off my debt really quickly as well, but I don't know how I could honestly do that. I really really want to be an engineer but I also really want independence and financial freedom.

MITRE internship. Internship for the summer before junior year where I helped to develop a website for my robotics team. 

NASA internship. Internship for the summer before senior year where I developed new tools for the agency. Super fun and thinking about writing an essay on it. 

NASA Internship. Internship during this fall semester of school to continue my work from the summer. Considered part-time I think. 


Volunteering: 

I volunteer at my public library 2 hours a week since last October. I have 50+ hours


Awards: 

FIRST Deans List Semifinalist. Award giving to members that Excel and show strong leadership within their team. Was nominated by my mentors and made it as a semifinalist. 

Virginia Pilot Scholar Recognition. Award that recognizes high achieving students within Virginia. 

AP scholar with distinction. 


In terms of what I like in a campus I’d say I like a more urban setting that’s pretty easy to traverse. I really liked Georgia Tech when I visited because it was right in Atlanta and fairly easy to travel. I didn’t like Cornell and how it was kind of in the middle of nowhere and pretty spread out. In state or out of state works for me. 

If you guys have any suggestions that would be awesome. Thank you!"

Where website/resource has it to where I can find entry level jobs /jr software jobs easily ? LinkedIn does not do a good job sorting entry level jobs and engineeringjobs.com doesn't do a good job sorting entry level jobs either.


Does anyone have advice on this ? Thanks for the help !"
cphjak,1,2019-08-12,Recent college grad with little to no experience in business/IT. What business/IT career do you recommend?,sephir007,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cphjak/recent_college_grad_with_little_to_no_experience/,"Trying to make a long story very short.   
Just some background: I recently graduated college this past May with a biology degree, but for a while, I had abandoned the idea of finding a career in the medical field. It hit me hard acknowledging this.  
My boyfriend, who graduated with a degree in computer science, is doing phenomenal at his job and is pretty much the only provider between the two of us. He always pushed me during college to try out cs but I was always stuck on the idea that I'd go into something medicine related...\*regret noise\*.   
Anyways, I learned some coding languages but have found it hard to stay motivated out of college. I've also been trying to apply for some admin assistant jobs and IT internships this summer with no luck.   
During college, I did some research work for the cs department and also worked as a phlebotomist at a hospital for a year. 

Recently, my boyfriend's dad asked whether I need help with landing a job. He holds a pretty high position at his company and has connections he could talk to. He told me to think about what I'd want to do and then talk about it when I'm ready. Problem is, I just absolutely have no idea what type of work I'd be ready for in a business/IT setting. He recommended project manager, but I feel I don't necessarily have the skills, background, or experience. 

What are some entry-level positions I should inquire about with my boyfriend's dad? What would you recommend for someone in my position?"

I've gotten a fair amount of interviews and interest from recruiters, nothing special but definitely not zero... but I have never ONCE had any luck with Workday. It seems like everytime I apply with Workday I'm throwing my application into the abyss. I either get no response or a rejection very soon after. It's not like I interview and then get rejected...it's just instant rejection. Anyone else experience this? Is there something about Workday that's different that I'm not considering when I apply?"

Should I ignore recruiters on LinkedIn?,billetepaper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cpij65/i_dont_have_time_for_a_job_right_now_should_i/,"I'm doing my last year of highschool and I have technical degree on programming that is decently valued in my country's CS field. Besides that, I've been in two internships.  Anyway, a recruiter sent me a message on LinkedIn proposing me to be a candidate for a CS-related job. As I said, I'm finishing highschool and I'm also enrolled in some extracurricular activities, so naturally I don't have enough time for a job. I'll only be free starting December when school ends (Southern Hemisphere). Next year, I plan to be in college and to have a CS job at the same time, as is normal for CS students in my country.

So, how do I go about these messages I get from recruiters? I'm interested in having a job, but I just can't have one yet."

cpj991,3,2019-08-12,Emotionally abusing mother that I try to hate but I can't,theorgcap,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/cpj991/emotionally_abusing_mother_that_i_try_to_hate_but/,"It is the first time I am writing on the internet about my situation. I was always a bit scared of putting down in words what I was living. It is only after I found another post here where I was sharing a very similar experience that I decided to also share mine with you. It is is very long so I apologize for this (I am also not a native English speaker so please excuse my grammar!).

My mom has been emotionally abusing me for more than 10 years. She is bipolar and sometimes she gets angry very quickly for nothing, I really mean it: it sparks from stupid unnecessary shit and it escalates extremely quickly and violently. She is narrow-minded and always thinks that she is right. She is always giving me orders and if I disagree with her, it's the beginning of the end: she insults me, and it hurts me so much even though I know it comes from madness... She says very mean things about me and then sometimes it can become aggressive like ""you're a dog"", sometimes ""you are a whore"", often times she finds connections out of nowhere to talk about my boyfriend and often says that she hopes I will be beaten one day in my life by a man so that I ""understand life"". When we are in a public area and that she gets angry, she is taking pleasure in humiliating me in front of a lot of people and treating me like shit because she knows I hate it. She also tries to control some parts of my life, and for example she doesn't like the fact that I am going out and have a social life. She would rather have me at home learning how to be a good ""housewife"" and learn how to cook. Because that's her limited view of the life of a woman: to be a good wife and to stay at home prepare dinner. She will try to not let me go out because she thinks I am going out too much (which is not true at all.... I maybe go out with my student friends once a week if not once every two weeks, and all reasonably as I am not getting crazy drunk or with drugs or doing dangerous stuff). Once she put a lot of pressure on me while I was at a party: at 1am she called me 10 times and she yelled at the phone saying she was going to call the police if I was not coming back home soon. She is always using ""I will call the police"" as a kind of weapon, for example at home she will pretend to go the phone and compose a number so that I will be scared.

Verbally speaking, she is extremely mean and tries to hurt me in every sensible point she can find. She also used to beat me a lot when I was much younger. She used to throw me shoes or anything she was able to find quickly. Sometimes in those episodes of craziness she would go in my room, take all my stuff and throw it away in the corridor, or she would open the door and throw all my stuff outside. Then she would also try to kick me out of the house and leave me crying behind the door. And crying, god knows how much I cried in my life. But me crying and being sad never affected her. She would look at me crying and not react or feel a bit of guilt. I used to be very sad because I didn't understand what I was doing wrong: I was never a bad kid or at least I never considered myself being one: I grew up a shy kid, very good at school, and I always had good feedback from my teachers. I never did drugs, I never acted violently, I was quite a model child/teenager actually. But it was not enough for my mom. My mom would never recognize that. She doesn't know me and mostly sees me as a mouth to feed. She doesn't value the fact that I did high studies or that I succeed so well in school, at uni and in my professional life. She doesn't know me at all, she doesn't know what I like, what are my convictions, what I am concerned about at the moment, what are my passions or what are my dreams.

The problem is, that is not that easy to hate my mom. She also has a lot of moments when she is kind and loving. She can act normal. But sometimes she gets crazy very easily and this is where she shows her ugliest nature. I always thought that I can't blame her because she really had a tough life, her marriage didn't work out, she also has 2 terrible cancers including one that doesn't allow to see from one eye and she has been enduring pain for 10 years. It makes her very nervous, and it is said in my family that cancer made her bitter. So because it's not all black and white, I hate her but I can't also blame her. I know some asian moms tend to not show well love and affection. I try to be tolerant. But sometimes it's too hard to handle because she is getting so angry and abusive that I am getting seriously depressed.

Because of all of this, when I was a teenager I used to be depressed all the time. I thought a lot of time about committing suicide. I didn't want to live in this golden jail anymore: golden jail because I was living a normal life as a normal kid on the outside, but in the inside at home it was a nightmare a lot of times - too much times. However, I was thinking about my friends and my sister who was very supportive and kind. She is much older than me so she left the house a long time ago, the only thing she could do is to call me and try to cheer me up at my darkest moments.

Today I am at the end of my studies and starting to slowly leave the house with internships abroad here and there. When I am not at home, I feel so much better. I feel like I have a life and that I own it. I have a very supportive boyfriend who is tougher than me and tells me to move forward and not to look back in the past. But sometimes I look back in the past and I think at all the harm and the emotional damage she did on me. There were some very dark and violent moments I try to erase from my mind forever. As my bf says, ""you can't choose your family but you can choose with whom you decide to be with"".  How can I live with the fact that I have a mom like this? For me it is very important to have harmonious relationships at home and it affects me quite a lot when there is an argument of the types written above happening with my mom..."

How did you guys progress your careers? Did any of you guys quit your (presumably non-cs) jobs during the program to pursue an internship, say over the summer? Or were you guys able to continue working and do a remote internship?

cpketk,2,2019-08-12,"First Lenovo Ideapad S540 review - Less than 1000€, good gaming perfs, premium looks, 12h battery",McManus26,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/cpketk/first_lenovo_ideapad_s540_review_less_than_1000/,"The first review for the Ideapad S540, which is a laptop that i'm monitoring closely, just dropped [on a Netherlands website](https://tweakers.net/reviews/7260/5/lenovo-ideapad-s540-goedkoopste-gtx-1650-laptop-doet-veel-goed-conclusie.html).

Here's a quick translation i made using DeepL, TL;DR, it's a very good machine.

**Pros :**

- sleek premium design

- great value for money

- solid gaming performance

- insane battery life

**Cons :**

- 4 GB of soldered RAM on all models. Unfortunately limits upgrade potential to a total of 20GB if you replace the second 4GB stick with a 16GB. 

**Specs**

Here are the specs for the reviewed unit. **Keep it mind that this is the cheapest configuration, at €799**. It can be upgraded with up to 12GB RAM, a Core i7, and a 1TB SSD.

Screen : 15.6"" FullHD

CPU : Intel Core i5-8265U

GPU : Intel UHD 620 // Nvidia GTX 1650 Max-Q

RAM : 4GB DDR4 soldered + 4GB DDR4

Storage : 256 GB SSD

**Build Quality** : fully made of aluminum, sturdy and premium-looking. Weights around 1.9 kg. Good touchpad and keyboard, there's a fingerprint sensor and a webcam shutter.

**Screen :** 1080p, good quality, very good colors, average brightness (not doing too great outdoors).

**Performance** : Here are the [CPU benchmarks](https://tweakers.net/reviews/7260/2/lenovo-ideapad-s540-goedkoopste-gtx-1650-laptop-doet-veel-goed-specificaties-en-cpu-benchmarks.html) and [gaming benchmarks](https://tweakers.net/reviews/7260/3/lenovo-ideapad-s540-goedkoopste-gtx-1650-laptop-doet-veel-goed-gpu-benchmarks-en-games.html). Performance is generally around the level of the MSI PS63 modern or the Dell XPS15. In game the difference with a ""normal"" GTX1650 is negligible. Reaches 45 FPS in Rise of the Tomb Raider on Ultra Settings, 70 FPS on medium. 

**Battery Life :** 70wh battery. Battery tests show results of 12.5 hours of battery life in a web browsing test, and 3.5 hours in the PCMark 8 benchmark (emulates video editing or light gaming). 

**Conclusion :** this laptop looks like an amazing product for uni students, interns or young professionals that want a laptop that can be used both in a professional environment and a solid gaming machine if you're willing to either play most recent games below 60 FPS or crank the settings down to high or medium.

The only drawback i see is the soldered RAM, but is having more than 20GB so important when looking at the rest of the specs ? 256gb of storage is pretty low on the entry model, so i'd rather advise looking at the 512gb and 1tb units.

Now lenovo, get a move on and release this thing in all countries before the end of summer, pretty please ?"

I applied to hundreds of applications online (trash process btw). Anyway I got a call back for a position at this huge naval base. Everything looked good, had a phone interview and that went great. He said he will email me in a week.

A couple days later I got an email saying “I apologize but there was a mistake made on our end, this position is 500 hrs and suppose to last the end of our fiscal year which is on October. It is impossible for you to get those hours in by then so we will renew the application on October so reapply there” 


I’m so hopeless. This was suppose to help me. I have an uncle in engineering and I don’t want to ask for an internship through him. He is toxic and makes me feel like shit a lot (says he had a better GPA and graduated in 3 years etc.. just always bragging) He is the kind of person that will say things like “because of me you got your first job so you owe me” . He even told me that if his company would hire me that I should give him my hired bonus (around $5000 given to all new hires to get situated and what not) on top of the referral he gets for getting me hired etc... anyway worst case scenario I might have to suck up my pride and ask for his help 😒 I know it could be worse but man I’m so irritated rn.


Ugh I hate relying on others"

I have done a few internship, have decent knowledge of java/python and some other tech stacks (android/ data analytics,etc) .  
I always had the dream of being selected in gsoc, but i was always too late to start preparing/applying, being busy in college stuff(lame excuse, i know)  

But this year seems i can try my chances. College is all focussed about students getting a job, so they are pretty lenient. If i dedicate my full time to GSOC, i might crack it. But i would then be playing all my cards on this , as I won't be focusing on other companies' interviews and placement tests. Plus from what i know, its whole timeline takes around 5-6 months and ends somewhere in August-September (the time at which  my college would be ending and my other peers would be starting a full time job)   

So is it worth for a final year student like me to go for gsoc? I know it does gives a good weight to the resume, but is a heavy resume with no job in hand better than a light resume with a job in hand, for a passed out student?"

Being subscribed to a hub where so many people in one place are focused on learning has honestly improved my mental health. Thanks!

Anyway, I was hired as an intern at a small hedge fund a month ago and have only been programming since May. My boss wants me to be the ""data guy"" and I agreed, so he showed me this xeroxed page of formulas in a spreadsheet he wanted recreate to measure stock performance with, and then, he said, if I could automate that procedure across the S&amp;P500, ""that would be great"". I produced two modules that do just that [here](https://github.com/VincentGW/Momentum-Ranking/blob/master/run.py) and [here](https://github.com/VincentGW/Momentum-Ranking/blob/master/excelmanip.py).

I'm honestly stoked I got this far and I'm amazed it works. I'm convinced I can really change my career if I keep practicing. Anyway, if there are things terribly wrong with my formatting I'd love to hear feedback. I know there's still improving to be done but I'm not sure where to start. Handling exceptions? Implementing classes? Recursion?

cpnpek,1,2019-08-12,Well fuck me gently with a chainsaw...,noodle_honey,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cpnpek/well_fuck_me_gently_with_a_chainsaw/,"Four words seem to pop up too much on the subreddits I find myself wondering .“worth”, “support”, “selfish”, “help” and so on...
A plethora of tortured individuals who long for someone to understand. Not to be a smart arse but I used to pride myself on understanding... getting a kick out of making sure people didn’t off themself gave me a sense of worth other substitutes just did not. 

Apart from one other this is my first big post so let me give you some backstory (this is the bit you realise your in for the long haul and keep scrolling). I’m a 15 year old (goooorl) from the uk. 

I’m currently in the midst of a cahms assessment regarding my mental health and risk. It came about by a emergency appointment triggered by some domestic issues at home that got out of control and so social services got involved . 
I was at my girlfriends house the day I got a call from my social worker informing me I sound unfit, unwell, paranoid and generally sick I was sitting with my wonderful girlfriend and I just didn’t care. This, lady’s and gentlemen is my issue. I can’t seem to care (along with other fuckery but this is the special for this evening so dig in) 

I’m sure a lot of you can relate and I’m not looking for sympathy more of a diary with opinions attached so I don’t forget but, this lack of love nor hate nor respect for anything is what scared me in that moment. 

I’ve suspected being ill up in the noggin for a while. I never wanted to self diagnose or anything in fears of the reactions of my friends and especially my parents who are far, as you probably already realised, from perfect. 

The thing that scared me was that I didn’t know... that I always told everyone, all those mates I got a kick out of helping, all those times my sisters asked if I was ok I said “yeah I’m fine DW” and yet this person who hardly knows me is calling me telling me I’m not ok? 
That was and would be the only thing that was scary... the fact it had happened that any of it had happened just didn’t matter. 

The only person I feel for is my girlfriend who’s been there consoling me while dealing with 10x as much crap as me ( OI I know it’s not a competition but in my humble opinion it’s just more severe) and yet even then lately although I still love her I can’t seem to read her. To read anyone. When they are happy or sad? 

I could never really tell with me, especially recently but since the day it all went down with social services it’s kinda shifted. I can’t remember muvh of anything but I have flash backs to my girlfriend tying to explain I’m not ok, my sisters and brother consoling me that I’m not mad and me lying on my sofa laughing as my girlfriend almost threw up knowing that the next morning my parents where going to say somthing and that somthing would happen after it. Nothing’s any fun, no ones any fun. I’m dipping into old habits and yet it’s no big deal. I never go into enough detail when I’m at meetings, they say I think erratically that it’s all too much for me but I fuck you not there’s nothing... yeah the odd Burst but apart from that I’m fine up here. 

...And yet logical me knows I’m just too numb... that the dissociation has taken a turn for the worst as even if I can’t remember the breakdowns my girlfriend does , these days even my mother does and yet it doesn’t effect me. Life is a party you’ve got to live fast and hard and Fuckung viciously if you want to squeeze every morsel outa this fuckery bc the pain you bare out weighs it all. 

I don’t know if I’m ok... I’ve told myself I am for so long the concept of not is not even unbearable but just idiotic. It just doesn’t matter ya know? 
I don’t feel selfish or unworthy of help I just don’t need it? If I die I die if I don’t I don’t. I shouldn’t bc of the wife but like we all have moments and in my moments ya boi forgets. I forget who I am and what I am and sadly who I’m with. 
I’ve hurt her bc she’s going through a lot and I can’t seem to show compassion unless she spells it out. 
I’ve hurt her and so many people even when I’m trying so much that the prospect of getting up or doing anything except from trying is so much. And that’s not on her OH FUCK NO that’s on other friends and most importantly my pussy of a noggin. She’s hurting, as a good girlfriend I should help and yet in one of her last big break downs I just let her be. Yes there’s more to that story but the crux of it is I left her when she needed me. I know I’m not perfect . I never wanted to be but that’s just fucking shitty no matter how bad I feel that’s just morally wrong and that My lovely and patient reader is the scary but for me. The only scary bit. That I yes me may not be in my right mind *gasps*. Yes you heard it right a depressed little kid on the web thinks she’s loco. Well sir the twist in this tail is that bc it’s scary and intern evokes an emotional response from the bois up in my skull it is also very intriguing and captivating to my self destructive ass as I know that getting worse helps no one and I know I’ll just off myself or try to again but also the light at the end of what I think of a tunnel... *looks around* hmmm I can’t make it out it’s too dark... anyway the light at the end of the tunnel is the promise of feeling something and and unless I relapse heavily on my two bois (sh and substance) or attempt or so somthing rAdiCaL then it looks like ten most fun or whatever? 


As we speak some demon fucker who looks like a dog mixed with a rabbit is shadily jumping up and down and the foot of my bed telling me if I put my toes out he’ll eat them. I’m over heating. Meanwhile I’ve got franc Sinatra in my head and a full bladder longing for me to pop off the the cursed bathroom where my evil twin lurks. 

Reading that back I don’t seem ok? Like idk I’d worry I guess? But I feel so comfortable and content in this madness? So Devine in this nieve bliss. So pure...

I’ve had a lotta bad nights and a lotta bad days, I’ll stick around to look after my lady bc nothing matters? If I killed myself it would be for a laugh... bc I can? Everything Fuckinh sucks and that’s not gunna change but if I can keep her on this green earth and happy for another minute I’ll be happy with my lot of life. There’s not a lot out here... up in space... we all seem to choke on the nothing? I seem to? I should have sorted this out but then again so should have my parents when they found out about like sh shit a while ago with the whole “we did everything we could” bullshit, mate fuck off you ridiculed me and I’m too not me to be angry. I fuck you not I’m possessed bc there are eels in my bones and rats on my teeth. 

This happens too much 
I happen to little 
People say they are loosing themselves. Well please sir help me bc I’m lost. My girlfriend knows it to some extent... fuvk even I know it to some extent...
and I just feel like I’m forever leaving something out, somthing undone... somthing is missing and yet I simultaneously just don’t care 

Anyway thank you for reading my rant and have a good evening

I'm a 19 year old female who will be finishing her associates degree in Business Administration by Spring 2020. I am from California. 

I was recently made known of an opportunity where students at certain community colleges who obtain their associates in Business Administration could study abroad for one year in France and obtain their Bachelors Degree in Business Management (with a specialty of course like finance). There would also be a guaranteed paid internship once you graduate.

Now, this intrigued me since it's basically a 2+1 in which you obtain your Bachelors in 3 years as opposed to the usual 4. That's one pro of it. I also think the experience would look great for a business major. But I'm also afraid of moving so far from my comfort zone and leaving my boyfriend behind for an entire year. I would be in France from September 2020 to the next years September. Money isn't a huge issue either.

So with that said, can someone give me advice regarding this whole situation? What would you do if given this opportunity? Additionally, has anyone studied abroad for this extended period of time before, or at all that can share their experience?"

The kicker is I'm confident I can do UIUC in 3-4 semesters. not because it isn't tough, I have thoroughly reviewed the curriculum compared to MCIT and MCIT would be more challenging because of my previous experiences. MCIT is looking closer to 5-6 semesters. I do not plan on doing anything other than continuing developing my skills and get in another internship or two.

\- **Stanford/MIT**: awesome schools, but I feel I'm wasting my ED chance for such a slim chance.

I admit that I lacked consistency and I was very confused when I came to uni - I just moved to a different country, living without my parents for the first time and I had a lot of freedom - I got overwhelmed, and I forgot where my priorities should lie. I even changed my major a bunch of times only to make the situation even worse.

Since 3rd yr I have actually worked very hard on myself, got all A’s in every single course I took, finally discovered my true academic passions and interests, even tried to participate in more club activities

Now that I’m in my final year and it’s nearly time for grad school apps and job apps I’m actually scared as fuck, I can’t sleep at night thinking about all the time I lost and all the opportunities I missed.

But none the less I accepted it knowing that wherever it is that it would be a good opportunity.

Flash forward to this summer. I interned at the second company, and I really like it. It pretty much checks all the boxes for what I am looking for in a job. They have also extended a full time offer with comparable benefits and compensation.

I understand that I was at fault for accepting the first offer without asking to extend the offer deadline until they can give me all the details. 

I guess what advice I am looking for is how to deal with that first accepted offer preferably without burning that bridge. 

Please don't roast me, I know I've made a mistake and going back on accepted offers is a bad practice but that's why I'm looking for advice/guidance.

At my IT internship I was told that since I scored high in the first place with only two weeks of studying that I should skip it and go straight to network. I was wondering would having both of them would lead to a decent paying job or would I be fine with Network and security. Also how much hard is the 1000 series compared to 900 series?

cpuroz,2,2019-08-13,Subtle fat-shaming,vvelv,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/cpuroz/subtle_fatshaming/,"I love my mom and I know that she genuinely cares for me. Unlike some Asian parent stories I heard, she doesn't tell me what to study and worry about my grades, I mean, sometimes she still compares me with her XYZ friends' kids but it doesn't bother me. What I can't stand is all the 'fat-shaming', it's not like she tells me I am fat outright but the little things she does makes me feel like a pig. Some background, I was skinny growing up, I am 5'1 and weighed about 95 pounds when I was 18. Unfortunately, I did gain the freshman 15  in college, and then further gained weight during my internship. When I was at my heaviest, I was close to 130 pounds, that was 3 years ago. I didn't realize how much weight I gained until I came home for Christmas that year as I didn't have a weighing scale at university. I was really upset of course, but my mom was much more upset than me.  I started dieting right away and my weight has been hovering around 110-115 pounds for the last 2 years.  I still prefer to shed 15 pounds or so but find it really difficult even after cutting down to two meals a day. I want to accept the fact that I will never be as skinny as I used to be, and be ok with that, but my mom is making it really difficult for me. I work and live far far away from my parents now but some of the things she does make me really hesitant to visit or call her:

1. Whenever we eat together,  she reminds me to scoop less rice or she would prefer to help me scoop rice to make sure I don't overeat.
2. Suggesting I stop eating dinner (My mom has not had dinner since 1997). She doesn't serve me dinner when I visit, she would only cook dinner for my dad and my brothers who still live at home. Once, I told her I am hungry and I am going out to get something to eat and she strongly suggests that I refrain from my desire to eat because  'the only difference between human and animal is that human can suppress their desire'
3. Every time we call, she would ask me what I had for lunch/dinner and proceed to voice her concern over the amount or the type of food (too oily/fatty/sugary)
4. Whenever we go shopping together she would often 'kindly suggest' clothes to hide my fat arms or thighs
5. Making comments like ''oh, because you already have the big butt and thighs like your dad's family you have to work especially hard in maintaining your figure, otherwise you'd look like aunt XYZ when you have kids""
6. She asked me what I ate and I snapped, telling her that I don't appreciate her making me feel like I am a pig and that I am already aware that I am fat. In turn, she got upset and told me she never raised me to hate myself and has never once told me to lose weight.

I know she sacrificed a lot for me, but my weight already bothers me more than it should and I already have an unhealthy eating habit that telling me I am fat really wouldn't help. I don't know why I am making this post, I am probably half venting and a half asking for suggestion what to do since I am dreading my scheduled call with her tonight."

cpw3hx,2,2019-08-13,Starting to prepare for a transition from AstroPhD into Data Science or similar?,This--is--Me,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cpw3hx/starting_to_prepare_for_a_transition_from/,"Hello everyone! I apologize for the lengthly post (and/or for the weird tone 😔), there is a TLDR at the end.

I am in the second year of my astronomy PhD in the Netherlands and I have 2-3 more left (had some medical and private issues and took time off). Originally I wanted to go the ""regular"" route aka postdoc -&gt; postdoc -&gt; research group head -&gt; professor (or similar) which only a fraction of people succeed in. As I used to be doing very well (the top of my class, had great astrophysics internships, lots of outreach projects ect.) I was confident (*or stubborn?*) with going this way, but now after facing what was too much for me to handle I sadly predict my PhD will probably be closer to the bottom of the barrel than to the top of it. With such prospects, I might be able to land a postdoc ...but the chances of me never becoming a tenured professor become astronomical (haha). I am planning on finishing my PhD for a few reasons: it gives me a payed job (which I need as I am the main provider for my parents), my partner is Dutch and this way I can stay in the country and obtain the citizenship myself, I do find the research I do interesting in its own right and last, but not least my supervisor has been extremely good to me.

I am not sure why I did not study CS to begin with...  I have done small projects to learn a bit of new things like: building small 2-D games, implementing a few cryptography schemes, recognizing numbers and text with ML (keras), some probability models for population growth ect. and I have received comments from professors and colleagues who do CS that I am good at it. I think I went for astronomy because at the time I ""needed"" to feel like a ""snowflake"" and now I am sad to say I likely made the wrong call.

I figure it is time for me to take a hard look at myself and the chances I have outside academia. As it stands:  
\- I am learning Dutch (as I would like to stay in this country)  
\- I have a generous physics and mathematics background  
\- All of the research I do requires some programming (mostly Python, IDL and SQL, used to do a few projects in C++ and C#), I don't think this is too applicable to ""real world jobs"" and I would need a lot more learning  
\- I sent applications for the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship a few years back and while I did not win it, I have been getting contacted by recruiters from Google because of it.  
\- *Not sure how to formulate this....*I think I would like to do a job that is more than just coding for 8 hours a day, I don't think I would last long in such a position.  
\- I TA at the University and there might be a chance for me to sit in some lectures for other classes, but I have to check  
\- I think I can spend a few hours in the evening on Tuesday and Friday and either better part of Sunday or Saturday + Sunday mornings on this every week (or almost every week).

I have split 'courses' within CS into two groups: I have some footing (1) or I am completely lost (2).  
(1) Coding, Computer Architecture, Algorithms and Data Structure, Mathematics for CS, Operating Systems, Databases, Languages and Compliers   
(2) Computer Networking, Distributed Systems, ML/AI  
At the moment, I am also considering getting Brilliant premium and working through the stuff there as well as other learning platforms (Codecademy, Leetcode ect). 

**TLDR**: I am doing a PhD in Astronomy, want to say in NL and find work outside academia once I finish the PhD in 2-3 years. I am looking for advice on how to catch up, what to focus on and make myself a good candidate and use that time wisely (I estimate I can invest 4-14h a week on this endeavour).

**The three main questions I have are:**  
1) What jobs would you say I might find interesting/be a good fit for? (perhaps where me not studying CS is more of a plus then a minus)

2) What would I need to do in the upcoming years to prepare?

3) Have you or someone you know transitioned in a similar way?

I am grateful for your insights and happy to answer any questions/provide info. Thank you for your time!"
cpwosa,1,2019-08-13,Asking for the Details of a Promotion?,dierer_,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cpwosa/asking_for_the_details_of_a_promotion/," 

tldr:

I don’t know if it is appropriate to bug my supervisors about the details of a promotion I was given or if I should wait for them to talk to me about it.

Hello r/ITCareerQuestions I’m hoping you can give me some advice, but first a little background:

I am 19 years old, I recently graduated from high school, and I take classes at a community college towards a CIS Networking degree. I was hired in April as a paid summer intern for an educational agency that provides IT services for its two schools, three school districts, and  fifteen municipal or non-profit customers around the county. Over the course of my time here the other summer interns and I were told that some of us would be hired on as full technicians at the end of the summer and the rest would be let go. I was lucky enough/worked hard enough to be offered one of two full technician positions well before the end of the summer season. The other position is still open as they have not chosen who else they would like to keep. I was offered the job on July 23rd, during that meeting with my direct supervisor I was told “details on the promotion and raise will be worked out at a later date.” About a week later I still hadn’t heard anything so I asked my supervisor when I could expect the promotion to take effect. My supervisor told me to wait for our assistant director to talk to me about the details. Our assistant director is a very busy and forgetful man. It is now midway through August and I still haven’t heard anything about my promotion. This time of year is very busy due to our three school districts starting classes again.

Should I email my assistant director and try to setup a meeting with him? Or should I wait until the end of summer when the other technician has been chosen to bring it up again?"
cpyh0h,2,2019-08-13,Question for those of you who work/have experience working in Germany,RothmanBear,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cpyh0h/question_for_those_of_you_who_workhave_experience/," Hi everyone, throwaway account  


I've tried this question on r/germany and while the answers have been helpful, I don't think any of them came from people who work in the financial sector. So I thought I'd post here, who knows...

I'm contemplating moving to Germany, and it's a really big step for me, and I would really appreciate your take on my situation to help me with the decision making process. 

The facts

\- 27 year old   
\- Would be moving to Germany with my girlfriend (the two of us have thoroughly researched the process and we think we have a good handle on it)   
\- Liberal arts degree (Political Science) from an Ivy League  
\- German level currently at A2 (Bilingual in English/Arabic, Turkish B1/B2 although I haven't taken any official exams for it)   
\- 2 years experience in commercial banking (credit analysis)   
\- Two startups founded and up and running (i.e. I'm not worried about money)   
\- Passed the three levels of CFA, 2 levels of CMA, 2 levels of FRM, and 2 levels of the CAIA, also passed the Series 65 and SIE exam. I did all these while I was working on my startups so while I have passed all the exams, I don't have the experience to get any charter yet, unfortunately.   
\- Excel/VBA, Python, Tableau 

The desired goal/planned process

\- Move to Germany (I would only be moving after obtaining a residence permit as a spouse of a German citizen. The advice I got was that then I would be able to work after I obtain the permit)  
\- Enroll in intensive German classes for 2 years   
\- Obtain a job in the financial sector (I'm moving to Frankfurt if that matters, but my gf is open to moving to Berlin if it would be better for me professionally)  
\-  I hope to get something in financial analysis (hedge funds, mutual funds, etc) or investment advisory, although I wouldn't mind going back to credit analysis for a while in the beginning. 

The questions:

1. What level of German would I need to get to before I could start applying for jobs in the field? B2? C1? C2? 
2. I'm estimating it would take me 2 years of intensive studying to get to B2/C1. By then I'll be about 30 years old. Would the combo of old age/lack of experience be a serious obstacle in getting an entry-level job in the field assuming I have the language by then? 
3. Would I be able to get part-time or even full-time internships in the field in the first two years while I'm learning the language? (even unpaid is fine by me during that stage)
4. Would I be taxed in Germany on my income from my 2 startups? (no operations in Germany, but I would be doing the bulk of my work on them while I'm residing in Germany)
5. Are there any standard certifications/licensing exams to pass if I want to work in the field?  Any info on these would be much appreciated because I know that might be a tough question to answer. 
6. Any advice that pops in your head that you can give me 

Thank you all for all your help in advance! "
cpyuie,98,2019-08-13,I helped cure Mrs. Wickers' schizophrenia and now i'm seeing the same things she did.,AuthorJoJo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cpyuie/i_helped_cure_mrs_wickers_schizophrenia_and_now/,"No other singular moment has served to open my eyes as much as watching Mrs. Wickers stumble into the room. Her body swaying back and forth, a body so torn up I had thought she crawled through broken glass to reach us. The collective silence of me and my colleagues as she begged us to make it stop, to undo what we had done.

That moment, and everything that followed it made me realize that science has no limits. It will relentlessly chase after anything it doesn't fully understand. It doesn't matter if something needs to be fixed or discovered. Science is a hungry and unforgiving animal. Science has seen many roads to hell paved by good intentions. Including the one me, and three other researchers walked down.

&amp;#x200B;

It was in college that I first noticed my mother's mental state deteriorating. She would forget my name all the time. She would attempt to call me but end up with a handful of wrong numbers before realizing I was sitting right next to her. Worse of all was the visions she had. Her schizophrenia was a mild case but when her faculties started shutting down, it attacked.

She would claim there was a hoard of flies on the ceiling when we were outdoors and ask me who my friend was when it was just us. It was hard to watch, hard to experience. It got worse and worse until it all came to an end. A nurse informed me, in the most polite way she could, that my mother had become frantic and took her own life.

A day like that can change you and it changed me. It felt horrible and the more I looked into it the more I saw that I wasn't isolated. Far too many people suffer from this plague. So after I had given myself time to grieve I went back to school and switched my major.

For years I applied everything that I could to learn what makes the brain tick and why sometimes the gears don't align. I think it was my way of fighting back, throwing myself so hard into my work, keeping my mind as sharp as I could.

Late nights and caffeine pills became my bread and butter for a solid eight years, I needed my grades to be the shining example of perfection. When graduation came around I stood proudly on stage and looked out to a sea of smiling faces. I imagined my mother in the crowd, cheering louder than anyone.

It took more effort than expected but I eventually lucked into an internship of sorts, I was to help with a study. I, two other interns and the lead scientist were going to map out the brain activity associated with schizophrenia. That would be the easy part. Once we had done that, we were going to try and cure it.

After receiving my acceptance into the program everything moved so fast, we had a grant and we put it to use. We invited those diagnosed with schizophrenia to our very own facility that was little more than a warehouse. We would study their brainwaves, looking for abnormalities that would take place during hallucinations.

We looked for ways to differentiate between auditory and visual hallucinations as well as how they affected neighboring parts of the brain. It was fascinating and somber to watch the thing that took my mother sprawling across someone's brain. It was a good thing I had already become so accustomed to running myself ragged because for the next two months that's all I had time to do.

Dozens upon dozens of patients were recorded all with varying degrees of the disorder, looking through all the mappings Mrs. Wickers proved to be the most severe case. After all the data was painstakingly analyzed we started to brainstorm a way to not only treat the disorder but to cure it. For the sake of my reputation, I'm going to skip over a large number of details leading up to our answer to the cure.

I should also mention that Mrs. Wickers, is not her real name. Everything that happened after we developed the cure, should and will remain under lock and key. There's also an argument to be made that Mrs. Wickers' reaction to the drug could be an incredibly unusual incident. The details, however, should be discussed.

We decided the cure should be administered orally, so we went with a pill. A small and grainy white pill that would dissolve in the stomach over the course of 24 hours.

When I called Mrs. Wickers to ask her to come back in it was clear even then that she was experiencing nearly constant hallucinations. The poor woman was always scratching away at her skin convinced something was under it. Or she was backing away from what she would refer to as “Trees”. She described them as four-dimensional beings absorbing the three-dimensional space around them.

It was hard to get much more out of her than that, she didn't want to talk about them so we didn't keep pressing. When we told her we wanted to test a possible cure on her, she seemed mildly vexed by our assertion. After some discussion, she agreed to let us test it on her, with the assurance that it was safe and a healthy sum of pocket money for her.

All we had to do was give her the pill and observe her over twenty hours while recording her brain activity. The four of us took shifts, watching as the hours ticked by and the flares in her brain started to diminish.

Every so often the four of us would exchange a hopeful glance whenever Mrs. Wickers was able to sit still for more than a few minutes. Something she was unable to do when we first met her. I could almost feel my five o'clock shadow sprouting out of my face when my shift rolled around. Head resting in my hand I watched the imaging of her brain and the live feed of her room.

I must have missed it, maybe I dozed off for a moment but when I looked at the live feed I noticed all of the furniture had been moved around the room. There was a direct audio feed into the office, we wanted to hear if she was audibly referencing a hallucination. You'd think if a sixty year old schizophrenic was moving furniture around I would have heard it.

She was still though, just sitting on her newly relocated bed running her hand along the skin on her arm. I leaned forward and with my lips close to the microphone I pressed the 'talk' button and asked her if everything was alright. Her head turned slowly, it looked as if the camera feed was out of sync with her movements. 

“They're all gone.” That's what she said to me. I almost didn't recognize her voice, she said it so calmly where all our previous conversations had been choppy and distracted. I rose from my chair and asked her to repeat herself. When she did I was beside myself, I thought that we had done it, sure there were a few more hours to go but- we had done it.

I called the lead scientist and told her about the change in Mrs. Wickers behavior and the statement that was made. As instructed I called the other two interns who were only a block away sleeping in a motel. The smile from my face didn't drop, but when it did, when my joy was eventually taken away from me it wasn't gentle. It was ripped from me.

Waiting for the others to arrive I kept flicking my glance between the live feed and the imaging of her brain. The specks of light in her head that represented the illness started going out one by one. Then with my eye on the live feed, I noticed that Mrs. Wickers had become visibly disturbed again, she was shaking.

That didn't match up though, her brain activity if anything, was lowering to normal levels and as I watched her I connected with her concern. One of the chairs was slowly moving across the floor, the movement was so smooth it almost went unnoticed but I saw it. She wasn't touching it and I knew that room in and out, no draft could move that chair. We bought the heaviest furniture we could find to ensure the patients wouldn't try to hurt themselves with them.

Once again my lips went up to the microphone and my voice chimed through Mrs. Wickers room. She jumped as words filled her room, I was asking her what she was seeing. She just replied that she couldn't see them anymore. She couldn't see the Trees. Then she asked me.

“If a tree falls in the forest-”

I was intently focused on the live feed of Mrs. Wickers who had lifted from her bed and was standing in the middle of the room. When the chair stopped moving her head lifted up to glance at the camera once more. Her lips parted and the office filled with the echos of her scream, I went to cover my ears but got distracted when the furniture in the room started lifting from the floor.

Quickly I exited the office and started making my way across the small warehouse towards the room we built, towards Mrs. Wickers. On the way to her room, I passed by the lead scientist who had just arrived alongside the other interns. By the time I passed them the screaming had already ceased and they voiced their concerns over my hurried paces. 

Their footsteps echoed mine as I neared the room and swung the door open. The whispers behind me sang of confusion as we looked into the empty room. Mrs. Wickers was gone. All that remained was the furniture but it had all become so torn up and broken that the room was unrecognizable from what I had seen hours ago.

Pillows were ripped open and had their fluff seeping our, the wooden structures inside the hairs had become splintered and mangled. All four of us just looked around the room, trying to figure out how a sixty-year-old woman could have destroyed the room and slipped out.

Within the stillness of our perplexity, I heard a dripping at the entrance to the room. In unison, our attention shifted to it and we were privy to the whereabouts of Mrs. Wickers. She was leaning on the doorframe, her body mirroring the state of the room. Long and deep gashes ran up and down her arms. Through struggling breaths, I caught glimpses of missing teeth, plucked right from her mouth.

Slowly she stumbled forward and reached out to us, begging us to make it stop, begging us to let her see the Trees. The fingers on her outstretched hand, I watched as divots were created in the skin as if something wrapped around them and then, her fingers bent backward. The snapping sound they made, like years of built-up knuckle cracking played all at once, was enough to bring bile into my throat.

The pill we created were only meant to last twenty-four hours and Mrs. Wickers was on her twenty-third. There was nothing we could do, even completely flushing her fluid at that point would take longer than just letting the drug run its course.

I mentioned that we could sedate her. If anything we could knock her out and once she woke up the drug would be out of her system. As I attempted to reach the exit I saw the wooden doorframe bend and crack. You would have thought someone had taken a sledgehammer to it by the way the wood splintered and sent shards flying. 

I and my colleges exchanged glances. This was a test, after all, an experiment. When I watched the lead scientist crack a smile, I understood. What we were really after this whole time. The woman in front of us, Mrs. Wickers, begged with everything she had. It was far too late, it was too late the moment that pill slipped into her mouth. She was never going to leave the facility.

Indentations that looked like a snake or the arms of an octopus appeared running up her arms and without any warning, they were destroyed. Her arm became nothing more than a mess of red and worthless flesh. The rest of her body soon followed suit, all contorting and shifting around into bizarre proportions. All while the liquid running through her pooled onto the floor.

Just for a moment, watching the mass of Mrs. Wickers' body becoming smaller and smaller I understood what she had described to us. The way a four-dimensional thing might look as it suffocated the 3D space around it. That shape of what used to be Mrs. Wickers continued to be compressed by whatever she could see in her hallucinations. To us though, it was just her body disappearing into the void until there was nothing left.

None of us could move, or say much of anything. The only words I heard for the rest of the night was our leader telling us she would clean up. That and “Good work everyone”. The rest of the night, when my body allowed me to move again when I could think again. Was just as still as it was when we entered Mrs. Wickers room.

It felt like things were standing all around me wherever I went, all perfectly still. Like they were waiting for the day that I could finally see them. I don't know what happened that night, what the cure did to that poor women but I have my theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Perception is important. The way we observe the world around us and sometimes science will take that to arrogant heights. Whatever attacked Mrs. Wickers, I worry that it was only able to do so because she was no longer watching it. She called them Trees.

&amp;#x200B;

If a tree falls and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

I think it does, just because you can't see it, it's still there. And if you are unable to see the tree falling. You're might get crushed under it but you would need to know the tree was there in the first place right? Otherwise, you wouldn't be in the forest. I'm sorry, my thoughts are scrambled but I think that's what happened to her.

&amp;#x200B;

She saw the trees, was able to watch them. Once we took away her ability to observe them, that's when they were free to do what they wanted to her. I think those Trees, are all around us and the only reason they can't hurt us. As I said, no other moment has opened my eyes as much as that moment with Mrs. Wickers did. 

My eyes are open wide enough too see it, to see what she was talking about. How could watching a human body compress into a little ball only to disappear completely, all the while ringing out her insides onto the linoleum floor, how could that not mess me up?

It is the last class I have to complete before getting my Associate's and transferring to a university in fall 2020. My last semester will be spring of next year and I am already taking Physics for Engineers II and Programming III: Data Structures. I'm debating two options: On one hand I could add the Machine Learning class on top of those two and have the summer open for an internship, on the other I definitely don't want to overload myself because I expect these two initial classes to be very challenging as it is, so I was thinking I could also take the one machine learning class in the summer for less stress. If I did get an internship I would only be around in Austin for 2-3 months before I probably have to move away to the university, so I don't know how valuable a 2-3 month internship would look on my resume..."

* I have no interest in working restaurant. however I want to get managerial experience.
* I getting myself burnout from working Hospitality, and applying jobs for Web Dev position
* I want to do something that is more office oriented that involves number crunching / inputting data on Excel.

I've been working in Hospitality industry (specifically restaurants) for the past five years. However, I made zero career progression for the past five years, which is a big *red flag*. There are some things that I would like to point out, before starting:

* I have zero interest in Hospitality industry, however it is something that I am frankly quite good at (in terms of menu knowledge, up-selling items, attentiveness towards guest tables (such as: filling up drinks, changing plates, etc...).
* I have no formal education. My highest education at this very moment is only a high school diploma.
* I am self-taught web developer; however been getting nearly 0.1% response rate from +800 resumes that I have sent over the past 2 years, and got 0.1% response, I got 0% job offers. To the point where I am burnout, and started to lose interest in it.

Some things that I would like to accomplish (short term):

1. Get managerial experience. My current assistant manager, has no prior hospitality experience asides from an year hospitality training and an year of internship which equates to 2 years relevant experience towards the industry.
2. I would like to transition to a more office oriented work, due to my technical background from countless hours that I spent on Udemy in teaching myself web development.
3. Learn more about, a day-to-day job of a data analyst and the minimum requirements for job entrance.

Ideally, I would like to work with spreadsheets to input data and create a daily / weekly / monthly / annually report back to the company. Couple of things that I came in mind was:

* Data Analyst: however when I researched a bit regards data analyst, it also returned me back data scientist (relating to software engineer category). So I would like to know the difference between Data Scientist and Analyst.
* Bookkeeping

Applying jobs for restaurants are quite easy, because a manager / HR will see that I have a vast experience, and usually I get a 90% success rate in securing the job. However, when I format my resume to target technical jobs, I have hard time in getting response back from HR / project managers / CTO; my resume include:

* List of technical skills that I withhold (programming language, frameworks and miscellaneous technical related skills)
* List of projects that I worked (includes source code via repository)
* List of companies that I worked in (with date and year)
* Education (high school)
* Languages

Hi all, 

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while now and was hoping to get some insight. I'm having trouble deciding if I should go for a MBA. I've always told myself I would, but the cost and time really has me reconsidering. It's not something I want to pursue until I am about 30 or 31 years old. 

**Background**

* Work experience:

This is a bit of a whirlwind, please bear with me. 

**August 2013-October 2015** \- I worked as an English Teacher in South Korea. I also worked as a Market Research &amp; Brand Development intern (Latin America) for a start up company that focused on exposing Korean artists to different countries,  by performances and what not. I was only there for a few months, but this company later turned into an international ponzi scheme.

**October 2015 - June 2016** \- I came back to the USA (NYC area) and I was unemployed. I thought my education and work experience would land me a job quickly. I kept getting offered admin jobs and I didn't want to take them because of my pride. I was trying to get into entry level marketing, but I wouldn't get any interviews. I lost count how many jobs I applied to. I was able to take care of my grandmother at this point who was dealing with severe Alzheimer's.

**June 2016- April 2018** \- I worked as a hostess in a Cuban restaurant. 

**April 2017- April 2018** \- I got a job as a Brand Strategy associate for a boutique advertising agency that dealt with kid's marketing. Maybe about 7 employees in total. I got to do some research for Crayola and Arby's. I still was a hostess at this time. 

**April 2018 - July 2019** \- I became an Office Coordinator for a large European marketing research company. I think they are Top 5 in the world. At this point I swallowed my pride, and decided I had to start from the bottom to get to where I want to be. 

**July 2019** \- I have changed from my Office Coordinator role to a Research Analyst position within the same marketing research company. At the moment, I am doing research for a music label. I am planning to stay here for at least 2 more years until I get promoted to a Research Manager. I would like to move onto the client side eventually. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Extra curricular:
   *  I studied abroad twice during undergrad; one semester in Grenoble, France, and another in London. 
   * I tutored some students in France to help them learn English
   * I have volunteered at Advertising Week in NYC. 
   * I speak 3 languages!
* Undergrad school/major: 
   * I went to Boston University's School of Management. I have a Bachelor's in Business Administration with a concentration in International Management. 
* Other education/coursework:
   * I planning to take an online course dealing with Statistics and R - just for fun.
   * I took a sewing course at FIT  (probably doesn't count?)
* Race/nationality: Hispanic 
* Sex: F

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 
   * I haven't taken any practice tests yet. I want to start studying to possibly take the exam next year, since scores are valid for 5 years. 
* Undergrad GPA: 2.8
   * During my sophomore year, my grandfather (he raised me) was re-diagnosed with prostate cancer. My father was also diagnosed with Lymphoma. I was afraid of losing them both at the same time. My grandfather did pass away a year later.
   * My junior year I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 
   * I failed my intro to finance class which took a toll on my GPA. I retook the class in the summer an got a B+, but my school doesn't have the policy of where they replace a failing grade. 
   * I ended up on the dean's list my first semester of senior year. 
   * I also hope that by the time I apply for a MBA program, I have enough work experience where this won't be much of an issue. 

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
   * I'm honestly doing it for the salary bump (and maybe the possibility of going abroad again). I'm currently making 50k a year, where my peers are making around 80-90k. I currently feel like I'm making up for lost time. Ultimately, I would like to make around 150-200k by my late 30s. 
   * My career goals: I really enjoy marketing, especially international marketing. In 5-10 years I envision myself in a role where I am introducing new products to different countries and tweaking that product based on cultural implications. Sort of like how McDonald's has different products catered to different markets.  Music, Beauty, and Fashion have been my favorite industries. My dream company right now is Spotify. 
   * I have spoken to high level executives at my current company - only half of them have MBAs. They have said to me it's not really necessary to have one. This is where I struggle the most in knowing if I REALLY need one. 
   * I would like to get a MBA before I start settling down and having kids. 
* Target schools: 
   * I was looking into INSEAD, HEC Paris, Columbia, and NYU. 
   * I do know I need at least a 730 on the GMAT to consider these schools and possibly get some scholarship money. I'm still paying off undergrad student loans. I'm not fond of the idea of taking more debt. 
   * I love Columbia's EMBA international program, but I don't believe their regular MBA program is the same. 
   * I heard international programs make it more difficult to find work in the USA. At the end of the day, I rather get my foot in the door at a large international cooperation, and move around country to country if I so do wish.

I recently finished a 12 month internship at IBM Canada as a software dev and my manager said I'd have a job lined up for me once I graduated.

I was just told I'd have to accept/decline now but obviously nothing is on paper yet. I'll be finishing school at the end of May but I don't like the idea of not exploring other options in the meantime.

I'm trying to get some more information to see how IBM stacks up against other companies. What does the starting salary usually go for a recently graduated undergrad student? The range on glassdoor is pretty massive so I'm unsure. This is in Toronto, Canada.

A) a lot of all allaboutcircuits and electronic tutorials (textbook / website) to extend pass the minimal network analysis and learning about semiconductors we do as a ME

B) Reading digital design and computer architecture (Recovering topics of architecture and microarchitecture that I find interesting) by Harris

C) Minimal Amounts of programming, covering topics like OOP, templates/ containers, exceptions, dynamic memmory, etc. (just running through Cplusplus topics from a textbook and doing sparse amounts of exercises), some reading on data structures/ algorithms, (Cpp and python)

So it is relatively meager and at a noob level, but from the taste I've had, and my natural wonder, I find myself more interested in Electronics / Computers than stuff like cars or nuts and bolts and tabs and springs and fittings and tubes etc. I also hope I'm not mistaken when I think of more of ECE as closer to using a knowledge base for problem solving, rather than ME which seems largely templated since most foundational knowledge has been well established. Of course, it varries between jobs and fields, but I'm thinking more of a general trend from what I can extrapolate

MAIN QUESTION:

Should I

A) Learn as much background in computer architecture, Operating Systems, Compilers, computer networking, etc.  as I can before graduation, and after graduation start working on projects based on this

B) Try my best to involve myself in a senior capstone project related to a topic of interest. The main risk I see in this is not implementing much of the content I covered or being kind of cornered based on my lack of ability, where I'm more of an annoyance to the team if I do manage to get into a related role, with some learning on top

C) Learn individual topics, and directly try to apply as much as I can in terms of projects based on each topic I'm learning for the next year, with the potential sacrifice of depth in theory

D) Some better plan that you have in mind

So far at the minimal, I think I want to read through and do what I can with learning HDL or something, and learning about computer architecture

I'm also planning on joining this project that is supposed to be embedded systems based, and at the minimal some hands on experience for the project (in a mini group setting) with PCB design and likely microcontroller programming on a STM32                

As far as career, is there the most potential to 

A) work yourself up through a low paid job/ internship to gain experience

B) Work largely on personal projects    

C) aim for a related graduate degree and go from there"

I frankly have not had very good luck with my job search. I get interviews sometimes but I'm often told I don't have enough experience or education in more relevant technologies. My college education taught me mostly C++, which I realize is both unconventional and impractical for finding a job.

I had taken a short job for a few months writing software for a no-name startup that ran through its money, which is why I left. I thought this could boost up my resume, since I had no internships and moved to a new city with very few connections.

Perhaps a coding bootcamp could actually help me kickstart a career? It would give me more modern and relevant education, plus I could make valuable connections. On top of that, many bootcamps have programs to help place you into a job afterwards.

So I just started a new job a month and a half ago. I’m a direct support professional at a group home for two adults with intellectual disabilities and behavior problems. It started off okay but lately I’ve been feeling very stressed out about it. I was told that the guys at the house had some problems but nothing like I’ve experienced. I’ve seen them try to run away, use the n-word towards each other, and threaten to kill themselves with a knife, among other things. I was prepared for some cursing at each other but nothing like this. Furthermore, one of the guys has a major anxiety problem and I’ve actually begun to feel secondhand anxiety due to this.

I’ve had plenty of jobs and internships similar to this before, which I’ve liked, but this is my first full-time gig. And I dread coming in every day. I feel so bad, too, because I love the company, my supervisor is great, and the benefits aren’t bad at all. But the stress from the two individuals’ behavior is something that’s increasingly getting to me, and I feel it’s only a matter of time before it affects my job performance.

I also can’t transfer somewhere else in the company because that requires an employee to be there for 3 months. I’ve been there since the end of June. I’m not sure I can take 1 1/2 months more of this.

So basically I’m looking for some advice on what I should do here. Keep in mind I’m fresh out of college and still living with my parents for now, and I have almost $10k saved up and no debt.

Do I stick it out with this job and hope to get another position here in a month and a half? Or do I quit and look for greener grass elsewhere?

Thanks!"

A few projects I had at work was to accumulate some asset data and do some stat analysis on the results. Collecting the data, analyzing it, and coming up with a conclusion to report to the executive didn't feel like work hours to me. I have some experience with data visualization via python panda and seaborn and those were a lot of fun too. However these projects are rare at work. There is a higher demand for cloud, AD, and powershell skills at my company.  


What I am conflicted about for this last year is whether I should I buckle down and learn powershell and master AD, VMs, and cloud and continue working in my company as a potential Sys Admin (More guaranteed job), or chase that interest of data analysis(Would have to job hunt)?"

I'm a first-semester senior in college. My major is one where your image (honesty) is very very important, and there's also a structured recruiting process. In fact, I'll be doing recruiting for an internship very soon, where (obviously) I'll hand out and discuss and resume and whatnot. But here's the situation

I currently work for an X company ( X company only hires students btw), which partners with big companies to provide customer service. I'm in one of their programs, working support for a big Y company. Recently, an investigation by this big company has been going on to catch students who've sent themselves free subscriptions or lifetime products (as part of support for the big business we can send tokens to customers). And my name pulled up.

So yeah, I did send myself a subscription, but for one month. One month of Z product which can be obtained for free through the company's website, one month we as tech support are told we can give out to any customer that we talk with. It's very important to note that I didn't send myself this month for personal gain, as I already own this product AND also get it for free because I work there. I was testing something in the token process, which I won't get into detail because it'd just give more clues as to what company this is (it's not insanely hard to figure out).

HR called me and told me about the investigation by Y company, and that while this goes on I'll be on suspension. They said the investigation would come to a conclusion by the end of the week. I messaged my supervisor and caught him up to speed (HR claims he wasn't made aware) and gave all the reasons why I wouldn't ""steal"" a month of this subscription. He said he'd passed the information along to HR and the manager (honestly, I don't think he can do much for me but it'd help for him to give his thoughts if asked?)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah.. here's the big dilemma: my work email is no longer accessible, it's been suspended. Before that, I noticed I was removed from the big team group (where all customer service students can talk/ask for help). I was told by X company that the Y big company would reach a decision by the end of the week, which seems like a short amount of time for me.

I can't make my case with Y company (if I could, there wouldn't even an issue), as there's an intermediary which is X company, and they are my employer. Problem is, looks like if Y (big company) decides they don't want me anymore, X company will fire me. But fine, I can pay bills and get by without working. What I'm more concerned about is how this will affect me when I recruit for my major, and if it's better to resign tomorrow or wait for them to terminate me. I was also thinking of going to talk with HR, but even if they agree with me I don't know how much they could do to prevent me from getting fired.

So.. for recruiting purposes, and under this situation, would I be better off just quitting tomorrow? (based on the above fact) it doesn't look like the big company wants me anymore, and that most likely means I'll be fired, which is something I'll get asked about, and once again, image and reliability is everything for my major. But then again, any human (pretty much given this investigation was started by a computer, as it's a big big company) being would understand that I didn't ""steal"" (knowingly take something for personal gain), in fact, I haven't even made use of that one month subscription as I already own the product through other mediums

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: there's one thing I want to add. My employer offers tuition assistance. And I have the max amount for the semester (\~$2600) as set by federal standards. I wouldn't mind giving this up as I've already got my tuition covered, but obviously I don't want to resign and give it up if it's better to wait. If I get terminated I obviously don't get the TA"

My thought process is that now that the recruiting season has come to an end they may be on leave, or they may be busy with other members.  Previously they were incredibly responsive and I have no reason to think that they're ghosting me beyond this instance.

Should I email the Head of People who sent me the contract or wait it out another week? I'm just worried I've been ghosted but I also don't want to throw the recruiter under the bus by emailing the HR person."

I'm an (over-anxious???) incoming freshman looking to major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I will be taking my Programming Methodology and Abstractions courses in the fall and winter quarter. With no marketable skills currently, is there any chance that I can apply for (after the winter) and snag a summer internship/opportunity at a startup or tech company somehow? Are there any tips you would give to someone in my position? Thanks in advance, and good luck to you all this school year!"

I always see people around me working on their own projects on the side and making progress, meanwhile I've only really ever focused on my classes. I want to start putting in my own hours for my own projects, but now I can't help and think that I've wasted so much time and can't catch up. What's worse is that I actually only have 3 semesters left, because of received credits in high school. Don't get me wrong I do have some work ethic considering I spend a lot of my time during the semester studying and then getting high grades, but every time I try and program outside I have this feeling like I'm a piece of shit who should have done this sooner and now it's too late. I recognize that its almost an irrational way of thinking, but I can't get over it sometimes. It's especially harder coming home from work or school and having little will to tackle anything.

Honestly not sure what kind of answer I'm looking for here, maybe if anyone has felt this way and how they conquered it. I've thought about going to graduate school since I've heard you get to devote a lot of your time to researching into a specific field (which I'm curious about data science), and can also give me more time I need to really start developing my own stuff. My other biggest concern is finding an internship when I have practically nothing to show on my github and can put on my resume. How will I be able to land an internship I want without something to show to them?

I was planning to start at OSU this fall and work on switching my career while keeping up my job in my current field. However, I just got a 3-month notice at my work, and I work in a field where the work is scarce and I'm not really interested in continuing. I'm excited about switching to computer science, and honestly, I'd like to get started working in this new field as soon as possible. I was speaking to a couple of friends who went into computer science fields - one is a successful CEO of a medical tech company, and the other is in IoT. They both suggested to me that I go to a boot camp such as Lambda rather than a CS program, as ""most employers are more concerned about job-ready skills and experience."" I was gung-ho about OSU, but now I'm unsure what to do. My wife is really supportive of this and I have some savings, so I could go on an accelerated path (i.e. 3 classes per term) and try and get this done sooner, applying for internships all the while. However...is this really the best path? I don't want to be ""jobless"" for longer than I need to be, but I don't want to go into a new field unprepared/unskilled. Should I forge ahead with OSU, or go with something that allegedly would give me ""job-ready"" skills sooner for the sake of my family and future? I could use your advice, especially the more experienced of you. Thanks in advance."

I am thinking of just quitting if it severely hurts my academics.  In my perspective, I do not think I have much to lose, because I can basically quit if I want to at any time.

cq4gi8,1,2019-08-14,Upward movement question,blinkvondoom,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cq4gi8/upward_movement_question/,"Alright. Sorry wall of text on a mobile. 

Currently I am a Jr working on my cs degree and work for a pretty large SaaS start up in my town (for the last 4 years as tech support). In my current spot doing tech support they know I have been trying for internships internally and to help they have been having me build rails apps / node react apps that will normally have 200 plus users on them at a time. 

I have been trying to get internships through them but have hit a bunch of brick walls where they either want people with degrees or want me to go to a job fair to formally apply for an internship. Trying internally through tech support management they say 'well we gave you experience and we got apps out of you without having to pay a dev. so it's a win win' 

So I finally found an position for manual qa within the company that I am considering. But they made it very clear moving from qa to dev would mean I would need to take time off work and go to the job fair for the internship. But I've also had the opportunity to take an internship with a different company where I would be helping move their php code to react with 3 month trial period then reassess for a permanent Jr dev spot. 

So the question is. Would it beneficial in the long run to jump ship and take the internship and see what happens. Or move to manual qa and finish school in the next year and then see what the jobs look like? 

If general feeling have anything to do with this. I'm really tired of being jerked around and building apps without the title (I don't care about pay as I think the title is more important in the long term), but if having a qa title would mean more than an internship I have no problem with movement and learning. 

Thanks guys."

I managed to balance a full course load while working almost full time and waking up at 5 am to train everyday. I ended up get a 3.8 summer semester gpa and the only reason why I managed to do it with my busy schedule is because of honing my time management skills, meal prepping so I had food, sleeping at 10 every night during the week, and knowing when to have fun/relax.

And now I'm going into my junior year of college with the determination to get shit done. Here's a list of my goals:

* **Get better at socializing/make new friends** (most of my friends were two years above me, so they're gone and I need a new group). I'm going to go about this by joining a club and learn how to verbalize my interest in what other people are saying.
* **3.5 semester GPA**. Sophomore slump really hit me and both semester GPAs were lower than my freshmen year GPAs and I really want to prove it to myself that I am more disciplined and mature than I was last year.
* **No alcohol or weed** when everything starts to pick up. Essentially, when my 20 hour training schedule begins, I'm going the entire season without alcohol or weed (about 5.5 months beginning mid-sept). Mainly, because I need a clear mind and sleep if I want to achieve the above goal, but also sophomore slump was real both academically and athletically. Which brings me to my next goal.
* **Achieve what I know I can achieve in my sport**. I'm capable of being at the top in my conference and have been my first and second year, but it's time that I show it.
* **Be healthier**. This means on top of no alcohol or weed, sleeping at 10 when I have to get up at 5 AM or sleeping at 12 at the lastest and getting 7-8 hours of sleep every night. It also means eating healthier, so I plan on continuing to meal prep. Less drinking/smoking also means less pizza and chips craving. 
* And most importantly, **make a 5 year plan for myself** and begin to implement it by l**anding a competitive summer internship** for next summer, which I've already started by doing internship apps. 

I've learned a lot about time management this summer and I really believe while what I want to do is difficult to balance, I've grown exponentially since I've managed my depression and anxiety and for the first time since I was like 12, I finally feel like I have my life under control and all my goals are achievable."

They are pushing me to the next interview, which is with the head software engineer. He will be giving me a code test, and actually deciding if I get the internship. However, they gave me a list of languages to become ""familiar"" with before I speak with him. This includes Grail, Angular, Java, and SQL. These are the technologies that I will be using on a day to day basis if I get the internship. 
I have not set up a time yet, but I'm expecting my last interview to be this week, or early next week. 
What the heck does ""familiar"" mean in this context? I am pretty comfortable in C++, C#, JavaScript, and Python, But have never really used the languages they listed.

I have created a reddit account to find help in my job reaching quest. I am asking you to upvote this post – to attract attention to this post because finding job has become more than a goal to me. I am a bit confused here – but I will try to set out my case as clear as it is possible. Currently I live in Russia and I am willing to move to any English-speaking country. I am mostly looking for job opportunities within the Atlantic Immigration Pilot program but honestly any other job offers outside of Russia are welcomed. There is a limitation though – I have an elderly cat (who is ready for transportation and have all the required documents) and that is why I can’t participate if we have to part. We spend too much lifetime together, so looking for new owners for my cat will feel like treason.

 Why am I so eager to find job outside of Russia? I am almost 30 and here it means constant pressure from the people that surround me and are endlessly bothered by the fact of me not having any children of husband. For some reason not having husband is a huge issue here. I am bisexual and my relationships with girls tend to end on their need “to create a normal family”. So homophobia and heteronormativity are sharing the number one place in my imagined list of why do I need to leave. That is exactly why I am using the new email here – so I wouldn’t ad more pressure and judgment on myself. I like working – I enjoy challenges and I have been promoted multiple times. Sometimes I have multiple jobs at the same time since my paying rate as a female in this country usually is smaller than the male worker in the similar position. Even though I work hard and bring positive results I am always considered to be liability – because women are expected to go on maternity leave. I love the idea of having children but I am not planning to become a parent at least within the nearest 5 years, and besides, children are not considered like some sort of kryptonite outside of Russia. And then there are those”little things” like the economics that is just getting worse unless you are already super-rich or being unable to speak freely all this tiny little details that matters. As you might notice – I can’t be considered a refugee. At least right now and honestly I hope to leave before anything that terrible is going to happen. But that is not the only reason. I can work and I want to find a job. I am actually good at working hard and reaching goals. I have recommendations from all of my previous workplaces. If you need more details and more information about my motivation about why it is so important for me to leave this place I can answer you through email. I can send my CV and certificates to all the interested parties. I keep on sending my CV through linked in even though it haven’t brought me any positive result.

 /My rating is not enough to show a screenshot of job vacancies in linkedin, but I can send it to you personally. I sent more than 900 applications./

I have been sending my CV emails to various Canadian companies –so if you are from Canada you might have already received some of them (since there were more than 300 hundred of this letters). According to Atlantic Immigration Pilot program requirements – I may search for an HR position, but this doesn’t mean that I am not able to do other duties. Unfortunately my current English level B1-B2 is not enough to teach English, though my experience shows that language environment significantly increases my progress. I am ready to work in any field as long as my duties are legitimate. Work with the documents as an HR and then help you as a personal assistant or babysit your kids after that? No problem. Work for 12 hours every day with a whole bunch of additional duties and tasks on the minimum wage – I can handle it. I am not the genius programmer or an amazing surgeon but I am not afraid of hard work. I promise to do my best and become your model employee if you are willing to take me in I can prove it and prepared to develop the minimum level of required skill within 2-3 weeks. If you know some company or somebody who might need my service, or perhaps some long term internships and other programs that allows my pet to come with me I would be very grateful. It doesn’t have to be strictly Canada and nothing else - EVERY English speaking country will do. I promise to work hard and be the best. Here is my email:  [iwanttogetajob27@gmail.com](mailto:iwanttogetajob27@gmail.com)Thank you for reading this."

I study on the side and read books/watch courses on udemy about finances and investing, but I'm not sure what else I can do to boost my chances of finding a really good job after college.

The main points in my curriculum are: 

Comp. Engineering degree in a recognized european university

3 Years of professional experience as a software developper.

I speak French, English and Portuguese fluently.

What can I do to build the perfect resumé for a job in the financial sector?

cq92xz,5,2019-08-14,An engineering graduate's plight &amp; looking for suggestions.,METhrowawayyy,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cq92xz/an_engineering_graduates_plight_looking_for/,"Hey guys, I'll skip my background because I'm sure many of us are currently facing the same problem. Basically, I'm a mechanical engineering graduate, looking for work. Have been for 2 years, didn't have the luxury of placement offers. Been looking for entry level positions ever since, kept getting rejected because I don't have the experience they're looking for (grrrr..). So I decided to look for internships but lo &amp; behold, they only consider students who are pursuing their degree. 

Current (mechanical) engineers who have overcome this situation, how did you guys do it? 

For people asking me why I haven't taken up jobs from other fields, I've tried them and have given them a chance, I'd honestly like to get some engineering experience at this point. 

Also, does anyone know somebody who's hiring interns? I've tried both internshala and angellist. Employers don't seem to care about applicants and they never respond. 

I hope the comments can also be a sort of a guide for everyone else with the same plight."
cq95g5,2,2019-08-14,"Secured an ""Experienced Hire"" position at a bank as a graduate, starting in a few weeks. Underprepared, nervous, and need advice.",padiwu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cq95g5/secured_an_experienced_hire_position_at_a_bank_as/,"Throwaway account, as my main account is clearly identifiable as me. I've been following this sub for \~5yrs now.

Profile: CS Masters graduate (2018) from a reputable university in the UK, with 1 Software Engineering internship and 2 Data Science-y internships. During these internships, I was always assigned an individual, separate (but related) project to what my team were doing, so I didn't pick up on best practises or working on projects as a team at all.

Current Situation: After graduating in 2018 &amp; prior to starting a career, I took a year out to work some part-time jobs, personal projects, travel, and mainly just relax as I burnt out towards the end of university.

Job Search: Started about a month ago after having re-capped using Cracking the Coding Interview &amp; Hacker Rank. Applied to Tech, FinTech, and Finance roles in London. Ended up with a few offers. This is my first ""proper job"".

Opinion on Jobs: Generally, I like to throw myself into the deep end, and have been against graduate programs. Money has never been a huge motivator for me (enough to live comfortably, then other factors of a job take over). I value learning opportunities and having a boss that serves as a mentor very highly. I have a preference for smaller companies, with more personal accountability &amp; responsibility, tighter team, potential to have a broader range of work (i.e. where job roles are pretty fluid). I don't mind working long challenging hours, especially if it's not expected (prefer to work 8-8 on a 9-5 job, than 8-8 on a 8-7 job) and the work is engaging.

Choice: Of the offers on the table, I chose one at a bank (working in ""risk""). It wasn't the highest salary (£45k + bonus, highest was £55k + bonus), but I think it was the best overall option. The team is very experienced (mainly CS backgrounds), with the most junior hire ever being a PhD with 3yrs experience (this person started on £65k + bonus). The original job listing was for PhD with 5yrs experience. The team leader is one of the smartest people I've ever met, and I think could be a great mentor. This role has a ""quant"" title, but the job definition is 50% quant and 50% dev - I verified this with a member of the team. The interviews were all CS based questions and brain teasers - when questioned, the team leader (CS PhD) said the finance bits are easy to learn on the job, so they don't look for that. Projects change every 6 weeks to 6 months, providing exposure and learning opportunity, so this seemed like a good role to start off in as I'm still not sure exactly what I want to do. The team generally work 9-6, and Mon-Fri only.

The Issue: I start in a few weeks, and have been shitting myself. I really feel like I'm unprepared for the role. I know almost nothing about finance, and nothing about proper Software Engineering (e.g. design patterns, best practises, working as a team on projects) due to the nature of my internships (mainly individual, little teamwork), although my CS fundamentals are pretty good. So far, I've only really had experience working individually on projects during university and internships. I don't have direct contact with the team leader or any of the team members, so I can't ask if there's anything they would suggest I use to prepare. I'm not so worried about the finance-side as I am about the dev-side.

Are there any books / websites I can use to prepare for the role? Are there any ways to learn design patterns &amp; best practises of Software Engineering? Is there anyone that works in a bank (possible in ""risk"") in a similar position that might be able to offer some guidance?

Literally any pointers on this would be really appreciated.

(I'm actually super excited to be starting my first full-time job! The types of projects sound really interesting. I'm just panicking about how unprepared I am for the role.)"

cqa1fx,25,2019-08-14,Transition from AstroPhD to a CS careeer in 2-3 years (in NL) - looking for advice,This--is--Me,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/cqa1fx/transition_from_astrophd_to_a_cs_careeer_in_23/,"Hello everyone! I apologize for the lengthly post, there is a consise version at the start and more detail/my rambling later on.

**The three main questions I have are:**

1. What jobs would you say I might find interesting/be a good fit for? (perhaps where me not studying CS is more of a plus then a minus and living in South Holland and perhaps Amsterdam would good)
2. What would I need to do in the upcoming years to prepare?
3. Have you or someone you know transitioned in a similar way?

**TLDR**: I am doing a PhD in Astronomy, want to say in NL and find work outside academia once I finish the PhD in 2-3 years. I am looking for advice on how to catch up, what to focus on and make myself a good candidate and use that time wisely (I estimate I can invest 4-14h a week on this endeavour).

Here is a bit more info about me, which might help with giving you info on where I currently stand.

I am in the second year of my astronomy PhD in the Netherlands and I have 2-3 more left (had some medical and private issues and took time off). Originally I wanted to go the ""regular"" academic route (which only a fraction of people succeed in) as I used to be doing very well (the top of my class, had great astrophysics internships, lots of outreach projects ect.). I was confident (*or stubborn?*) with going this way, but now after facing what was too much for me to handle I sadly predict my PhD will probably be closer to the bottom of the barrel than to the top of it. With such prospects, I might be able to land a postdoc ...but the chances of me becoming a tenured professor are 0% and I am planning ahead. 

I figure it is time for me to take a hard look at myself and the chances I have outside academia. As it stands:  
\- I am learning Dutch (as I would like to stay in this country)  
\- I have a generous physics and mathematics background (BSc and MSc in Astronomy and Astrophyiscs) as well as a degree in music (violin, music theory and composing music) and I have done numerous projects in design/drawing (especially for science outreach)  
\- All of the research I do and did at internships required some programming (now mostly Python, IDL and SQL, used to do a few projects in C++ and C#), I don't think this is too applicable to ""real world jobs"" and I would need a lot more learning  
\- I sent applications for the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship a few years back and while I did not win it, I have been getting contacted by recruiters from Google because of it, hope that is a good sign  
\- I TA at the University and there might be a chance for me to sit in (aka crash) some lectures for other classes, but I have to check - do you think this would be worth doing?  
\-  I can spend a few hours in the evening on Tuesday and Friday and either better part of Sunday or Saturday + Sunday mornings on this every week (or almost every week)  
\- I think I would like to do a job that is more than just coding for 8+ hours a day, I don't think I would last long in such a position. Something in Data Science might be logical, but also the game industry could be interesting as well. There are probably more career paths I am not seeing and would be happy to explore.

I have split 'courses' within CS into two groups: I have some footing (1) or I am completely lost (2).  
(1) Coding, Computer Architecture, Algorithms and Data Structure, Mathematics for CS, Operating Systems, Databases, Languages and Compliers, ML/AI  
(2) Computer Networking, Distributed Systems  
At the moment, I am also considering getting a premium on one code learning website and working through the stuff there as well as other free learning platforms, but I am not sure what to choose. To name a few I heard of Codecademy, Leetcode, Kaggle, MIT open courses, edX, coursera ect., but the choices are so many I am not sure where to even start. I am uncomfortable with the feeling of missing out on something fundamental for my understanding.

I am not sure why I did not study CS to begin with... I have done (and greatly enjoyed) small projects to learn a bit of new things like: building small 2-D games, implementing a few cryptography schemes, recognizing numbers and text with ML (keras), some probability models for population growth ect. and I have received comments from professors and colleagues who do CS that I am good at it and should do more. I think I went for astronomy because at the time I ""needed"" to feel like a ""snowflake"" and now I am sad to say I likely made the wrong call.

I am planning on finishing my PhD for a few reasons: it gives me a payed job (which I need as I am the main provider for my parents), my partner is Dutch and this way I can stay in the country and obtain the citizenship myself, I do find the research I do interesting in its own right, and last but not least my supervisor has been extremely good to me.

Thank you for your patience and help."

For background, I am a 21 year old student pursuing a CIS degree at a state school. I work at a grocery store.  I will graduate as a fifth year senior in 2021 due to changing my major. I do not have longstanding knowledge/experience with technology, my first exposure to anything more than surfing the web was once I started CS/CIS classes at school. I luckily found a “mentor” (network engineer) who got me very interested in the IT world, however i still feel a bit overwhelmed. 

My questions, 

1.) What technologies, languages, etc. are going to provide the most utility to me while applying for internships? I will begin to search for them within the next couple months and know that i need to better prepare myself. 

2.) How can I buff up my resume to make me a more desirable candidate? Considering I have no relevant work experience. I have good soft skills and am eager to learn...

3.) Is doing the A+ certification appropriate for me? I see mixed opinions on it in this sub, I figured it may be a good learning experience and increase my knowledge and confidence. 

Any advice from you guys will be greatly appreciated. I know i need to practice and self-educate more outside of my school program, just looking for some tips on where to begin. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time!"

I took a leap and asked her to dinner to which she said yes. She was visibly nervous at dinner but we had a good time! We had a two hour dinner and I walked her to her car.

The next weekend I asked her if she would be interested in hiking and she agreed - we were together for about 10 hours that day and there was never a break in conversation.

After reading the above, it makes me think that she would have feelings for me, however: i felt like I was talking to a new friend on both of our meetings, we never embraced or talked about a potential relationship at all. 

It’s important to note that we are both pretty reserved individuals.

How can I tell if she is interested? After our hike, I thanked her for coming and told her if she was interested in doing anything else to let me know, and she replied “definitely!”

How should I move forward, knowing that I have feelings for this girl?

Question for you all with a bit of work history.

I started working for the company I am currently employed at as I worked my way through my associates and eventually bachelor's degree in computer information systems management. Currently making 45k with unlimited PTO and a 5 minute commute to work in Midwest, USA. 

I started in help desk (2.5 years) and was promoted to associate systems administrator upon my 4 year degree completion (I've been in this role for about a year).

I've been quite fortunate to get plenty of hands on experience and my role includes a large set of responsibilities that were gifted to me when both my senior systems administrator and IT manager left at the beginning of the summer. I am on a small systems team made up of a total of 4 (I'm the only sysadmin). Company size is roughly 150 with plans to bring on another 40 at least be the end of the year.

My current responsibilities include:
°Managing (1 intern) and working Helpdesk (internal only, 150 employees across 3 offices)
°WSUS Updates for servers and client machines.
°Manage VMs, physical servers, switches,routers.
°Manage on-site backups and datacenter backups (tapes)
°Manage email and AD accounts (+ 3rd party accounts)
°Deploy all company technology.
°Purchasing IT equipment (employee computers/hardware, IT software purchases, any IT needs).
°Conduct IT resources training for all new employees.
°Manage phone system (landline and VoIP)
°Serve as a IT representative and manage/oversee IT operations for several large yearly conferences.
°24/7 on call (only one locally to manage DC and building servers)
°Building security (keycards/cameras) 
°Plus more.....

I don't have any certificates, just my degrees, though I'm about to start AWS certification tracks.

My question is, I don't feel I'm doing quite as well with salary as I should be, any insights or feedback? I know things like Glassdoor and payscale are not perfect indicators of accurate medians and salaries, but I see other local employers hiring for my position equivalent that pay at least 15-20k more and require less from me. I'm not sure if I should press my current employer for more or if I'm being unrealistic.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Thanks."

I have done some pretty serious networking with Alumni from my school at various firms. It often reaches a point where they happily offer to connect me to a recruiter, refer me, or float my resume. However, once my GPA (which is currently 3.2) is brought up I either get ghosted or apprehensive responses.   I am about to reach out to the Partner who seemed most interested to assist me from my favorite firm, and would like some feedback on the email before I send it.

""  

PARTNER,

Hope all is well with you! It has been some time since we last talked so I thought I would reach out and touch base. Since our conversation, I have decided to postpone graduation until December 2020. I am doing this for a few reasons.

1) The opportunity to recruit for Internships this fall &amp; again for Full-time next

2) To reduce course load to from 21 to 18 credits a semester, giving me time to pursue more leadership positions on campus

3) To allow an extra semester for my GPA to more accurately reflect who I am as a student. (It is tracking 3.55+ by end of this spring. Was lower in early years due to family issues / full-time work / operating own business)

That being said, I am actively pursuing internships for Summer 2020 and FIRM XYZ is at the top of my list of targets. I recall you mentioning you’d be willing to forward on my resume / connect me with a recruiter. If this is still something, you’d be willing to do I would greatly appreciate it! If not, please let me know what it is I can do to ensure I am a premier applicant for FIRM XYZ in the coming semesters. Thank you in advance for your time, I look forward to hearing back from you.

Or should I eliminate #2 and #3 + reword, and just hope he does not ghost after seeing my resume?   I am pursuing advisory / mgmt consulting roles.

I’m a recent graduate and had an internship for 4 years. They didn’t have a position ready so I found a position at another company and started a month ago. Now, my old company is hiring and I wanted to know how much of a difference would it take you to change jobs. 

I currently get 60k , 12 PTO (vacation+sick), ~1hour commute.

I have a friend at that office that I interned at and 2 years ago he started at: 55k+15% bonus (63.25k), 16 vacation days+6 sick days, ~40m commute for me.

I am pretty confident that the numbers above would be the MINIMUM amount if they were to offer. 

I would obviously try to negotiate higher, but wanted to have some opinions on if this minimum amount would make you guys switch or would you require a substantially larger amount? 

I believe I can negotiate to 57-60 base
Probably as well, would this be enough to warrant the switch?

just wanted to add that my current position is my first full-time position as well. Also if leaving so early as my first job would affect me later on in my career or look bad etc.

This budget is very detailed and has information from hundreds of sources, and I have spent the last three months building it up from essentially nothing. As it is my task, I have the master copy on my computer. 

Now the 1st TIFU. A co-worker asked me to create a partial budget with some information from the master budget, but in my infinite stupidity I just started editing the original. Once I had deleted all the information my co-worker didn’t want I saved it and prepared to send it, and then it hit me: this was the only copy I had, and like an idiot I just deleted over half of it, and saved over it! I furiously Ctrl z-ed it until my fingers were sore but it was ok, I saved it. 

Now I closed the file so I could make a copy, and along comes my 2nd TIFU: it asked “save changes?” And I said no, thinking how smart I was to not save my mistake. But I already fixed it so it restored the deleted version and wiped out the master copy!!

Let me start off by saying that I’m young (23F) and I’m not necessarily asking for advice, but just to talk about my situation, and if you do have good advice or experience the same thing I’d love to hear!! Buckle up, cause this is gonna be long!! I started college intending to go into art education and soon realized that I still loved education, but I wanted more art so I switched majors to a bachelor of fine arts and planned on getting an education license after I graduated. In school I could never really keep a job... I would stay somewhere a few months here... a few months there.... then quit. I just made the excuse that it was because I was in school. So my last semester comes and I made a deal with the school that I was going to take a 3 credit hour internship and just work the full time job I got. This was my first big girl job and I loved it! I was a teacher aide at a preschool for children with developmental disabilities. This made me think that maybe I wanted to get a special education licensure instead. By just 6 months after I started this job, I got pregnant and we moved to my husbands home town to be close to family. Soooo, I quit that job and planned on being a stay at home mom. I have always been very interested in children and childbirth, so I started to get certified to be a doula!! But that was too hard to figure out... so then o got a job editing photos for a large school and church picture company. That was a miserable hell... so I quit. I got a seasonal job a Macy’s.... that lasted a week.... and o quit. Theeeeen I got a job as a resident assistant at an assisted living facility. They basically abused their workers there.... so I quit. Ok ok, I’m pregnant, my pregnancy is miserable... it’s ok for me to not keep a job right now!!! But we can’t live on one income, so what now? I tried applying for some schools and thought maybe I wanted to be a labor and delivery nurse. So I applied to nursing school and didn’t get in. I also registered to go to my local school to get my teaching license. But the classes would be in person and full time so o can’t do that. I had my baby. It was an awful birth experience. I took a lot of time to recover from my c section. By baby is awesome. Ok, I’m ready to work again!!!! So I got a job teaching children with autism that pays really well and I love it!!! Buuuut, it’s an hour commute. And we don’t work over the summer, and they don’t pay over the summer. So we couldn’t pay our babysitter during my time off, so she filled my baby’s spot. Now I have to find another babysitter, but I love my time home with my baby and  remember all the dreams I’ve had of staying home with her and becoming a doula. Soooooo..... you guessed it. I quit. But I have to make money.

So here is the situation I am in right now. My job that I was commuting to basically said I could come back any time I want. I left on really good terms with them. But I had an interview for an art coordinated job in town and I’m supposed to hear from them today. That would theoretically be a really good job. But I honestly really don’t want it. I think I realized I hate working for other people. So im trying to start my own in home daycare. I’m all set up for it, I would make more money, I would be home with my baby. But I can’t find any kids to watch.... so I also want to continue my path as a doula and put a post out there about that and I already got one person who wants me to doula for them!!! 

I know that was really long. But basically, I never feel like I can settle in a job and I never feel like my time is worth the money they pay me. I always end up miserable at work and wanting to be doing a million other things. I also really want a masters degree, but I don’t even know what in! I want to be my own boss and I want to help people more than anything in the world. I would still love to teach one day, but I would also looooove to run an in home daycare business. But I would also loooove to be a birth and postpartum doula. But I would also loooove to be a lactation counselor. I can’t do all these things at once though.... but I also can’t do nothing. Oh, I also have an interview next week at Starbucks in town... just cause."

tldr ; changed my major from comp sci to environmental science, internships are in software, trouble getting an env science job (even getting interviews)

one of my problems right now is that my two internships are software based, and i have been applying  to a lot of positions in environmental consulting firms that have to deal with fieldwork/sampling/lab analysis and what not

my angle for the software internships was to try to show that I can learn quickly on the job as I had to learn some basic programming, as well as the main application (one of my internships involved a banking application that I did QA for, and the other was a more complex customer loyalty application)


my guess is that I am not explaining how i contributed well to my internships on my resume and that is drawing people away

So I just finished up my Summer internship ~2 weeks ago and have already been offered to return for next Summer (the Summer before senior year). The offer has a deadline of two weeks to accept. My issue is that I'm unsure about confirming an offer a whole year in advance.

I was ideally thinking of applying to other places this fall to see if I can get a feel for the environment elsewhere -- my dream company's over on the opposite coast. I don't want to come off as rude, but I also really don't want to limit myself to one company. What also makes things extra hard is that I had quite a few supportive mentors that I would really not want to cut ties with.

Don't know if it makes a difference, but I'm also going to be working in the same position part-time over the coming school year. I'm currently about to enter my Junior year for computer engineering.

I am working for a company right now as a mechanical-electrical engineering intern (I have an Associates in Mechanical Engineering Tech) and while the job isn't bad, pays great for the area, and works with my schedule I just have some doubts. My doubts are that I am stretching my mind too much by learning material from classes for computer science, learning programming languages at home, and while also trying to maintain my engineering job where I am expected to help with both electrical and mechanical aspects. I am wondering if I should just take a job with the schools IT department where I can narrow down the amount of information I need to retain/focus or stay where I am at until I find something better. If I took the job with the school I would see a significant pay cut. I am not looking for a clear cut answer but just wondering whats some advice that can be offered towards my decision making process. At the pace I am now I feel like I am starting to become the jack of all trades but master of none kind of guy. 

Thanks,"

I have zero experience, but I am familiar with some programming languages such as C++ and Python. With no work experience, how can I stand out in my (software engineering) internship applications? Some people say I should have some GitHub projects to show that I'm interested in programming, so should I start working on them? I am (hopefully) capable of achieving a 4 GPA but I'm not sure if it's enough to get the internship. Also, is it the right time to apply to big companies like Google? I know it's unlikely to be accepted, but should I give it shot?"

I took 2 courses in C# my freshman year (but will have to restart at programming 1 for C++ since it is a different university), did some light tutoring for my friend in C++ last semester, and am currently teaching myself python. So my programming experience is very limited and superficial. My question is, should I even bother going to a career fair in September for an internship, or should I just wait for the spring where I will have some personal projects and school projects and a deeper understanding of programming and CSCE in general. I am just worried that if I were to get an interview, I would not be able to answer any technical questions. I would not want to ruin any chances with a company that I could do better interviewing with in the spring. I honestly do not know what kind of questions they expect me to be able to answer at this level since technically I am a junior. I think this is stemming more from insecurity, but any advice or thoughts would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance"

First of all I enjoyed working at the company and I really liked their culture. I had a great time writing code and working for my manager. He was very pleased with my work. 

The company conducts a final review for all the interns, and my manager gave me great scores. He also said that he wants to see people like me work at the company. He forwarded the review to my HR and recommended them to hire me on a full time basis. However, during my call with the HR, they told me that the reason behind me not getting the job was my final presentation. The hiring decisions are decided by the top dogs of the company. Some of them thought that I looked disinterested during a 10 minute final presentation, and also that they want to hire people with both technical and presentation skills.

Right after my final presentation, I had a chat with my manager and other senior managers of my team individually. All of them at the time said that the presentation was good overall. It could have been better, but nonetheless it was fine and wasn't poor at all. They also thought that I answered all the questions which the higher ups asked me perfectly. I personally feel that I did really well, and I really enjoyed the work and the environment at the company. I doubt whether they even took my manager's review into any consideration at all.

Currently, I am really frustrated. A part of me blames myself, and a part of me feels that they were a bit unfair on me. I need to regain my confidence and start applying for fall internships and focus on school, but I feel super demotivated right now. Can you guys plz recommend me any books/articles so that I can get my shit together, and also some for typical algorithm/tricky coding questions. I usually skim through programming language books, but I feel I need to change my approach."

It's been about 5 months of this pain and tension and I just can't handle it anymore. I need answers, I need to know what to do. I'm absolutely torn. So sit down, and get ready to read the last year (more like 4) of my life. it's a LOT and im writing this intro after I've typed it all. im sorry if i go off on tangents it's just months and months of built up frustration. I don't even know where im supposed to post this. im floundering here. please help. honestly the first two of three paragraphs are background info on how i got where i am and not as important as the rest.

Flashback to April, 2018. I'm about to turn 20 in June, I'm in my sophomore year of college. I'm finishing finals. I'm miserable. I moved from Southern California to Michigan in the summer of 2015 and went through my senior year of highschool in a completely new state and school (Before you ask, it f\*cking SUCKED but I toughed it out and graduated Honors and had AP credits up the ass.)I couldn't afford out-of-state college even though I hated Michigan and wanted to go back to California for school. But, I had no choice. I went to a prestigious university in Michigan for film and went through the first two years just trying.. trying to get through and get my degree. I hated it. I hate the snow, I hated college. And I was average a 3.5 throughout both years. I made it on the Dean's list. I was a good student. But absolutely MISERABLE. So it's summer after my sophomore year and I tell my parents ""I'm leaving university and moving back to Southern California""

They're on board. They could tell I was depressed and I had no choice in moving to Michigan. They helped me and I drove across country, found a shitty little apartment in K-Town and was ready to start my fresh life. My father is in the radio industry so he asked around, and I got a job at a big radio station working as a phone screener (it was shitty. I was up at 3am and home by 11am every weekday. I dealt with bullies, creeps, and quite frankly the on air-hosts (who i wont name) treated me in a really sexualized manner and it was just.. pretty bad. but honestly paid great. and they said they were goign to put me on full time in promotions. i was only doing the screening for less than a month)

While i worked at the radio station i actually got in contact with another company in the radio industry. Not a station, but worked closely with them, etc, etc. I won't go into details as im not comfortable giving out information about my company. They offered me an internship. 2 days a week, 8 hours a day. i said hell yes and started working for them doing marketing. i had never done marketing in my life but i LOVED it immediately. I'm a creative person, i write, i make films, i sing. and this felt like a wonderful outlet for my creativity in an industry that i've grown up around since i was a child.

Not even a month after interning with them they offered to hire me full time as a marketing assitant and again, I said HELL YEAH. Monday-friday, 8a-5pm. I quit my job at the radio station and started working here. I had to take two buses every day to get to work and still had to be up early and would get home late and being a young woman it was scary for me. so in january of 2019 of moved literally half a mile from my office so i could walk to work every day. i moved here FOR MY JOB. because i absolutely adored what i did. i felt like a part of the team. i did what i ACCEPTED the job for. (keep in mind the radio station was working on offering me something more full-time in the promotions department but i turned them down because i liked this company i interned for and liked the position they offered me)

February we get two new hires (also assistants in different departments) and one of them was just.. he had no manners. He (admitted to having) a crush on me and it made me pretty uncomfortable. he wasn't very liked, and after 3 months of struggling to come to work cuz of this guy, he finally got fired. and then the other assistant (We'll call him blake) started to tease me. i am under the impression he also has feelings for me with how he acts, but i'll try not to assume and just instead blame it on boredom. he eavesdrops on my phone calls and when i hang up says things liek ""oh you stuttered"" or mimic my voice. he talks to me almost constantly while im working. ive told, no, begged blake to please stop teasing me because i dont like it but he KEEPS going. im at my wit's end with him alone.  he boasts about how he makes more than me (which, the pay of this job is a whole other thing i'll get into. but he gets paid for working weekends. i do not.) and the list could go on but this post isn't me complaining about one particular coworker.

on top of that, my boss takes credit for my work and ideas i come up with, he is sexist and says that i ""have to answer phones"" (despite us having a receptionist and front desk) and makes all the women in the office pick up phones. not a single man answers the phone. i know it's a power trip. but i constantly feel like no one cares about what i have to say. we're a small company. i have a lot to offer when it comes to creativity and smarts.

I'm doing other people's jobs. doing the president's chores (making invitations for his parents' wedding anniversary party), doing things that... when i started here i didn't sign up for. When the first assistnat got fired, he was in sales. i was told i needed to pick up EVERYTHING he did on top of all my other tasks in the office. with no increase in pay. not even the slightest. that means im doing double the work, aLL the work that HE was doing adn getting paid the same amount that i was right now, FOR FREE.

my other coworkers are cliquey. i feel like i dont belong. im 21 now and im the youngest in the office (the other assistant is 22 and everyone is OBSESSED with him. it's always ""blake is amazing"" ""did you hear what blake did today?"" ""blake is employee of the year!"") but aside from him, the next youngest is almost 30. i feel completely looked down on and not taken seriously even though, most people at 21 dont even have a full time job. i feel like i am being discriminated against, taken advantage of, and just teased too much. im at my breaking point and dont know what to do. i am an assistant and make barely enough to live in L.A. my one year working here is next week and quite frankly i dont know if i can stay. iknow for a fact i wont get a raise. im completely miserable here. i have a strong work ethic. just like in college. i am doing well and getting my shit done. im not lazy. but i just can't handle this what feels like bullying.

i need to know if it's normal to come home crying from a job and how people at work treat you at least once a week for 5 months. Do I keep suffering through this because it's a stable job and it's a salary and full-time? or do i try and find something else? am i being dramatic? am i being naive or a typical ""millennial""? im lost. i dont want to make the wrong choice but i was supposed to be happy coming back to california. now im just as depressed as i was in college.

TLDR; my boss and coworkers treat me like shit and tease me. im the youngest in the office at 21 and dont get paid enough for what i do but i dont know if i need to just grow the f\*ck up and deal with it or find something else.  


EDIT: Sorry for spelling/grammar/anything mistakes and the rambling. im pretty much in tears AS i type this and didnt proof read"

Those new humans humans. How? How did they? I can't, WHAT EVEN?

Let me start from the beginning...

We are all familiar with the primary problem of Mechanoorganics. We can build a synthetic replacement for every organ in the body, one that will last longer and function better than the original piece of obsolete wetware it replaced. Even the brain. But what we have never been able to do, the crown jewel of our discipline. The holy grail to, to use the ahem, Human, expression. And I feel we will soon be doing that a lot more soon. Is to transfer the consciousness into the new brain in such a way that the same person, and not merely a copy of them exists there. To preserve the original consciousness, and not a mere copy. That we have never been able to do. Every advancement every new plan, for a thousand years has been a dead end. Immortality has been denied us. One stumbling block from achieving it. A single issue. Everything else was fixed. All other organs could be replaced at need. Any body part you care to name, replaced at need. But not the brain. 

Five years ago, their unit of time, the humans were introduced to the galactic stage. They were introduced to the Final Problem of Mechanoorganics, their own version of the field having been advanced by leaps and bounds in those five years as we shared our tech with them. One Year ago I got my first human intern. Dave Thomas. Dave was a bit hard to get used to in his first cycle at the university. Slightly too tall for my office door, one fewer digit on each manipulatory appendage than is advisable for our keyboards, the usual human related problems. But he was a hard worker, if a bit unserious at times, that human concept of a ""Pun"" caused endless productivity loss in the week after he introduced it. Seriously, WHAT KIND OF JOKE GETS BETTER AS IT GETS WORSE? NO SENSIBLE SPECIES HAS HUMOR LIKE THAT!

As he was catching up on the lab notes about a month in to his internship I explained to him The Problem. And he thought for a second. ""I'll be right back!"" he shouted suddenly, jumping up and sprinting from the laboratory. 

He returned a few timeslots later with a textbook from a human philosophy course of all things. He excitedly showed me a page. There was a picture of this boat.  An ancient boat, not even one with engines, one powered by oars and a sail. Not even a proper tiller for crying out loud! And he says to me ""I have the solution!""

You see, apparently in human mythology there was apparently this warrior named Theseus. Stupid name by the way. Who sailed from place to place on a ship slaying monsters that mostly seemed to be Earth animal heads on oversized human bodies. During his travels this idiot managed to break every individual part on his ship one at a time. Each having to have been replaced. One at a time. The ship never ceased being a ship. At no point did the ship become not a ship and no meaningful distinguishment could be made at any point to claim that it started being a new ship. Even though it was made completely different parts by the end of the journey. 

I opened my mandibles to explain to Dave why that was an interesting story but unhelpful, when I realized, that I couldn't. There was no reason it couldn't work. 

Programing a small swarm of nanites to replicate individual cells Identically is child's play. Installing a single cell in replacement of another, again simple, and fast with modern nanites. There is nothing to stop this from happening contiguously save the need for raw materials. Nanites can be programed to fetch them from the digestive tract with ease and convincing a person to increase their food consumption is easier. Difficult to not do in fact. With Pre Dave technology we could give a thousand years to any being without difficulty before running hard and fast into The Problem. At a rate of but a quarter million cells per human day. In that time the brain can become completely synthetic. Now of Infinite durability. And consciousness is contiguous throughout. 

We have solved immortality. With a ghost story about a fucking human boat."

I just graduated from High School and I feel like I've just been dumped into the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim. Last school year I decided that I don't want to go to college. I've wanted to be a Front End Web Developer for about 3 years now and I've been coding since then. But, I'm kinda lost on how to start into this field. I've already created an Indeed, Glassdoor, and AngelList account and I've been applying for paid and unpaid internships in my area. I just feel like I have a slim chance of making it past the initial sign up list since I A) don't have a college degree and B) have no real work experience.  I've been to a hackathon sponsored by my county education board and I've contacted a industry mentor from that hackathon. Any tips?"
cqjyvf,1,2019-08-14,Career in advertising/marketing is stalled - what other fields should I look into?,MissBluePants,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cqjyvf/career_in_advertisingmarketing_is_stalled_what/,"I've been a creative person my entire life, and on top of loving language and writing, I've been involved in theatre arts since I was a child. I earned my Bachelor's in English and began freelancing in film production, which was great work, but I didn't love the gig to gig lifestyle. I would prefer a full time permanent position with one company. 

Working in production, I worked on a lot of television commercials and met some great producers, which led to me getting my first job at an advertising agency as an Account Executive. I absolutely loved the work! I was good at it and was happy. Sadly, only 9 months into it, the agency bought their independence from their umbrella company, which meant more creative freedom for them, but less financial backing. There were many people laid off, myself included. 

9 months at an agency wasn't a great resume builder, so I had trouble finding another agency job. I picked up some projects freelancing here and there, and worked another part time job unrelated to what I want just to pay the bills. I decided that I needed to make myself more valuable, so I went back to school and earned my Master's in Marketing. I had a summer internship working with a tourism startup where I helped develop content for a website. 

A few months after graduating, I was ecstatic to be offered a job at a digital marketing agency as a hybrid Project Manager/Content Creator. When I was hired, the owner told me they were in growth mode and expanding and everything was so exciting, and they actually hired two writers at the same time because they were doing so great. Well, 5 months into that job, the owner took me aside, said business was not booming like he thought, and financially they had to get rid of one writer. I had actually negotiated a higher salary, so I was the one they cut. 

That was in November 2018. I have been trying to find a job in advertising/marketing this entire time, both at agencies and on the client side. But thanks to these unfortunate situations that were not my fault, my resume looks pretty sparse. I am heartbroken to not be working in the industry I love and that I spent a ton of money on my Master's degree to work in this field, but it is not working out. 

I need career advice! Is there something else I should be looking into that I can be both successful and happy in?"
cqk2ay,3,2019-08-14,Former internship manager gave me brutally honest feedback when asked for a letter of recommendation. What do you guys think? And what should I do next?,assbaring69,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/cqk2ay/former_internship_manager_gave_me_brutally_honest/,"Sorry in advance for the long post; I am feeling really down and want to understand where I went wrong. I am so utterly dejected. Every time I feel that something good is happening in my life and that I've made progress in my soon-to-be adult career aspirations, I meet a disappointing road-bump that brings me down ten times harder.

First of all, I had an internship this summer that I took very seriously, hoping to impress my coworkers enough to earn me a job offer, but I didn't get one. It sucked, but I couldn't do much about it. But I did well enough for *at least* a half-assed, formulaic rec letter, right? I really thought that, even worst-case scenario, I did well enough to deserve at least that. Well...

I contacted my manager a couple days ago, asking him if he thought my performance was good enough to warrant a helpful letter of recommendation (most urgently for grad school next summer, but also for future job applications). Today he responded, and apparently he thought my performance was so trash that he wasn't even willing to give me a polite/sugarcoated ""sure, I'll see what I can do"" or offer me even the blandest rec letter--he pretty much told me ""I suggest that you not ask me"". Now, I feel utterly deflated.

For those who want a tl;dr of what he said and how I feel about it (but please read at least a little bit more to understand the context):

* I worked diligently and met deadlines
* I expressed interest in and talked with employees about what the company does, and had strong motivation to improve
* I had initiative in terms of learning beyond the data assigned to me.
* I apparently had some issues with the aesthetic neatness of my work as well as my communication skills which I genuinely cannot believe is the case (was very careful) in the case of the former, and, in the case of the latter, think is not entirely fair as I made a strong, consistent effort to always ""be on the same page"" as my manager, but unfortunate circumstances resulted in inefficient collaboration between us.
* My written procedure was not up to standards in terms of conciseness and language, although I am genuinely struggling to see how I could have done differently, and there were many extenuating circumstances which must be pointed out.
* I did my project as directed but failed to find a well-designed, good-quality optimization of what is honestly a pretty confusing and bloated process. I believe that this is harsh but fair.

Can you guys tell me if my performance as (roughly) summarized above warranted not only a job offer rejection, but was so bad that my manager has a good case in refusing to give a good word to my future grad school and employers? I need to know because I need to understand whether I truly didn't deserve an offer or a rec letter or if I simply got a manager with harsh and high standards.

Also, given such a frank and unexpectedly disapproving rejection, which one of my internship coworkers should I ask for the rec letter, if I should ask anyone at all? (I really want to have an actual working colleague write one of my rec letters for my master's program, and I originally thought that I presented myself as a competent worker enough to deserve a stamp of approval from my workplace.) There was one other manager (not my supervisor) in the company who I was in much better speaking terms with, and who I think got to know more about how hardworking and detail-oriented I am, my interest in the company/industry, my hobbies, etc. Unfortunately, everyone on the team knows each other, and it is entirely likely that either he finds out that my manager didn't want to write me a rec letter, or that my manager finds out that I asked the other manager to write one, or both. And that's not to mention what the other manager (and probably the grad school admissions as well) would think when I ask him, and not my own manager whom I've been actually working with, to write me a letter... There's another guy in the team--young, few years out of college--who I've gotten even better along with and collaborated with, who I honestly believe thinks higher of my capabilities than my manager does (though after this unexpected disappointment I'm not even sure about that), but I don't know if I should ask him--for pretty much the same reasons, plus the fact that he is not a manager (I have a feeling that a regular corporate professional's rec may not hold much weight with grad school admissions, but I may be wrong).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my paraphrased version of what he said--good and bad--along with my thoughts on the matter (in the interest of honest self-evaluation and getting accurate advice, I'll try to make my own thoughts as objective/balanced as I can):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You were very diligent in your work and completed your work either on or before the deadline.

I agree. Like I said, I took this internship very seriously, and I know for a fact that this is true. And of course, the man himself said it.

&gt;You were receptive to feedback and showed a strong desire to learn and self-improve.

Again, agree. Although, I admit I wasn't as quick or effective in adapting to certain feedback as others. But then again, he didn't mention that, so I'm assuming that wasn't what he had a problem with.

&gt;Your independent problem-solving/troubleshooting skills improved (after earlier feedback) and were reflected in many of the final products you completed.

Agree.

&gt;You showed self-initiative in looking deeper into the work you were doing.

Agree; there was an ad hoc task that my manager delegated to me, and I was able to do some research and give him a more detailed answer than he was looking for, and he also expressed his approval to me at the time--which I thought demonstrated my willingness and ability to do and think beyond the bare minimum or what was ""assigned"".

That's all the good points he had. He then proceeded to unleash some brutally honest criticism on his dissatisfaction with my work, especially the final product that I created:

&gt;You messed up a lot of the formatting of tables/charts in your PowerPoint and I had to clean up the mess after you left.

I'm not gonna lie, I am a bit defensive about this comment. It is true that on some of the *earlier drafts* of my PowerPoint there were some stupid mistakes in formatting (everything had to follow a template/sample up to and including the correct thickness of the borders of the tables, the right shade for the color font, etc.; this was all very important in the company) and I was careless--that's my fault. But on the final draft, before I left, I made sure that everything followed the templates. I can honestly say that I noticed anything wrong. The *only* possible exception I can think of is maybe some copy-and-pasting issues (Excel tables look a bit different after being pasted into PowerPoint), but even then, I know for a fact that I had been very promptly updating him on these issues even when they did occur, so it could hardly have been something he didn't know ahead of time. And keep in mind that all of what I said above is about the *formatting* of my slides--even in this brutally honest email he never mentioned that the actual contents (data) of my slides were inaccurate, so I'll assume that they were accurate.

Another gripe is the fact that we had shit communication because we simply ""didn't click"", despite my efforts to be ""chummy"" or at least on friendly speaking terms with him. To be brutally honest, we ended up simply talking to each other when the work required us to. I'll be the first one to admit my role in this: I have always been a bit below-average with verbal and written communication (especially in formal/business/""adult"" situations), and I may have asked a few too many questions in the beginning of my internship which I honestly should have been able to figure out myself (though I improved my independent problem-solving skills and got significantly better towards the end). But beyond that, I don't see what else I could have done better. Even though my communication skills weren't great, I can honestly say that I *made an effort* \-- that is, I constantly kept him up-to-date on the important things I did (successes, roadblocks, questions) so no one could really say I had a failure to clarify/confirm things with him. (As he himself admitted, I ""respond well to feedback"".)

On the other hand, my manager simply didn't devote much time at all to consulting or talking with me. I'm being deadass when I say that we met face-to-face on average about three times *a week* (and not all of those times were actual full meetings, but rather ""dropping by his cubicle""), and about 40 minutes a week -- despite (initially) several attempts by me to reach out to him, to invite him to meet, talk, even get lunch together. He would always act really reluctant about talking/meeting with me, and sometimes he would outright tell me (in slightly more polite terms), ""Please stop emailing me so much \[about things that you want to inform and update me about\]."" (I was just about to be convinced that this was normal when I at one point found out that another intern was meeting and chatting with his manager about six to ten times *a day*.) He would always tell me that he was very busy -- and I believe him and understand that he also has his own projects to deal with, but regardless of the reason/cause, the fact remained that our relationship and communication were pretty awkward and strained, which, needless to say, really made things difficult when it came to not only me reporting my progress and questions to him, but also him conveying clear expectations to me.

Which brings me to my thoughts on his next criticism:

&gt;The procedure you wrote was far too long, had too much rambling and was not a good business document and I had to retype large chunks of it in order for other teams to use it.

Basically, the bulk of my project involved typing a written procedure for an important process that some teams in the company use. What he said was partially true--I know I have a problem with brevity and conciseness--and it's not a good look that my procedure was so unsatisfactory that he had to later change it himself. But I do need to be fair to myself and point out that it's really not that simple. The first problem is the piss-poor communication problem: I kid you not when I say that, with the exception of once-every-two-weeks 30-minute meetings where I presented him with a ""Sparknotes"" summary of my data analysis and procedure, *he admitted that he didn't thoroughly read through (or, as I have strong suspicions, even open) my written procedure throughout my two-month long internship--*ditto with most of the data analysis I did.

The second thing is, calling my procedure ""rambling"" and ""too long"" is not totally fair: I used professional vocabulary (definitely not colloquial language) and included what I genuinely thought was needed by an untrained reader to operate the company process. And the weirdest part is, someone on my team was asked to collaborate with me on this project, and was asked to proofread my draft and make it more professional. He ended up editing a handful of sentences and words that could have been rewritten to be shorter... for a combined reduction in length of about one page... out of the almost 30 pages in my procedure. Also, the procedure involves accessing a lot of (what I considered to be) specific websites, software, username/password, click here or there, etc., as well as *tons* of internal logic on, for example, why some data are calculated this way but there is an exception for this column... As an intern with no real idea of what other operators of this procedure (especially those on other teams or departments) know or do not know, I had no choice but to be conservative in how much detail I left out in the procedure (e.g. I have no idea if Jeremy in H.R. will be aware of this tricky step on Excel, or what the password for this server is, if I don't include that on my procedure). In fact, I had my coworker test-run my procedure, and even with the amount of detail I included, he *still* had to ask me a few questions on certain details--details which I had actually decided *not* to include on the procedure in the interest of brevity.

And just for the record, I want to point out that, despite my manager's criticism about ""rambling"", not a single person who has read my procedure (which now includes my manager) has ever told me that there was anything *inaccurate* in my procedure.

&gt;You were able to write me a procedure but could not find better ways of making it more efficient and automated.

In other words: ""you did what you were supposed to do, but could not go above and beyond"". I'd like to note that there were a couple of exceptions--for example, I voluntarily (and accurately) changed some code in the procedure which used to be very confusing/inconsistent with the rest of the process -- bot overall I admit that I wasn't able to find a way to successfully tackle the bonus challenge that probably would have made me a more attractive job candidate. This is definitely the criticism that I feel is the most fair."

I'm currently applying for Summer 2020 internships and have heard back from several big companies. So far, I've completed two pretty tough HackerRank assessments and passed every test case. They were both untimed (24 hour limit), so I didn't feel panicked and performed really well. 

My issue is with the timed HackerRank assessments. I have a learning disability and have never liked using it as a crutch (I've never used it for any standardized tests and just started receiving extended time for tests at school). I've always pushed myself to work harder than my disability and not ask for special treatment. I'm not sure if I panic or genuinely run out of time, but I really struggle with the timed assessments.

First question—I just completed a HackerRank for a company that I'm incredibly interested in. It was 30 minutes long and included 6 multiple choice and 6 coding questions. Are these assessments designed for applicants to be in a time crunch, or do I just need practice?

My next question is—should I reach out to a recruiter, even just to thank them for the opportunity, say I completed the assessment and maybe mention how I ran out of time? Should I mention my disability, or is it too late for that? I have yet to speak with a recruiter in this interview process, which is what makes reaching out a little weird. The first step was a pre-recorded video interview and the second step was the HackerRank. Both emails I received were automated and didn't come directly from a recruiter. I honestly wouldn't even know who to contact. 

Last question—In the future, should I request accommodations for HackerRank / coding assessments? Will this hinder my chance of progressing in the interview process or getting an offer? I HATE using my disability as an excuse and only like to  when it's absolutely necessary.

Any tips? Thanks in advance."

I recently finished my undergraduate degree in physics this past spring. I did well in my courses and I have been productive in my undergraduate career by doing research, co-authoring a few papers, etc. However, my motivation tanked in the last few months before graduation.

I know I love research because at my internship this summer I would work 8 hours then go home to relax; I felt like I had a purpose. So I do think graduate school is the right course of action for me, just not at present. I have been accepted to a university in the UK for a Master's program that's solely focused on the field I am interested in but decided to defer my enrollment to next year (they guarantee me a position for the next cycle).

Junior and senior year were taxing on my mental state. Along with upper level physics courses I was also doing research with 2 professors and assisting in teaching introductory physics courses. As the cherry on top there was also my thesis I had to write. While I was able to remain relatively calm during that time I could see that it was not a sustainable effort -- burnout. I was not able to study for the physics GRE during my senior year as well. Because of this I've decided to take a year off to get some motivation back and relax my mind from coursework.

I don't want to sit around and be doing nothing for a year so my current plan is to continue with some research and find proper time to prepare for the physics GRE. I've talked to both of my research advisors and they each have something in mind for me to do. With one professor I will be finishing up a project that was left unfinished before I graduated and get that published in the coming semester. With the other professor I plan to present a poster I made previously (with a few touch ups) at a conference related to my field.

So that's my story up to now. I want to ask everyone here that's taken a break or gap year before graduate school how your experience was. What was your funding situation? How did you continue to build your CV/profile during this period? Is there anything you would have done differently?"

Basically, I'm trying to choose between a degree-apprenticeship and a degree at a really good school.

For just under a year, I've been studying a degree-apprenticeship program with one of the world's largest  broadcasters. We're given a salary and have our tuition fees paid, and spend three years split between studying at university and learning on placements in the company, with various departments of engineering. Sounds great, right?

Unfortunately , the full-on nature of the course has taken its toll on me and I haven't been enjoying it! The two internships I've had so far weren't very rewarding and didn't feel relevant to my interests, offering little to do for interns.

The terms at university have been really challenging due to the condensed nature, with little/no free time to socialise, exercise or practice other stuff. We stay in a hotel with no belongings and don't get much opportunity to socialise. We get little time off each year, so I haven't been able to see friends as often as I'd like or go on holidays.

The alternative option I'm considering is to transfer to university to study Acoustic Engineering (possibly with music). It's a really strong degree at a great school with good links to industry. I'd get much more time to improve at hobbies and sports, and could pursue internships more specific to my interests (in audio engineering). I'd also get more free time etc, but I would have the debt associated with going to college or university.

At my early stage, it's hard to know exactly which path would land me best for my career, whilst factoring short term enjoyment in. I really want to study abroad but I can't doing my current course. I feel like I'm missing out on uni doing this course, but maybe it's for the best in the long term?

I've got the university lined up, I just have to quit this course and go, but I'm scared I'll regret it as soon as I do!

I need to make a decision as soon as possible, as it's been on my mind for ages now. 

Which path do you think would be best? Have you ever faced a decision like this, and how did you decide? I'd hate to make the wrong choice due to inexperience or poor judgement!

Thanks for reading, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to ask questions if I've been vague etc at all."

I'd also get more free time etc, but I would have the debt associated with going to college or university.

At my early stage, it's hard to know exactly which path would land me best for my career, whilst factoring short term enjoyment in. I really want to study abroad but I can't doing my current course. I feel like I'm missing out on uni doing this course, but maybe it's for the best in the long term?

I've got the university lined up, I just have to quit this course and go, but I'm scared I'll regret it as soon as I do!

I need to make a decision as soon as possible, as it's been on my mind for ages now!

Which path do you think would be best? Have you ever faced a decision like this, and how did you decide? I'd hate to make the wrong choice due to inexperience or poor judgement!

Thanks for reading, I'd love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to ask questions if I've been vague etc at all."
cqnmso,1,2019-08-15,My dev experience has splintered into many directions and now I'm not sure how to progress into a higher bracket of salary (eventually),bustyLaserCannon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cqnmso/my_dev_experience_has_splintered_into_many/,"I've been a developer for about 6 years - I did an internship at University for a year and did C# and C++, I then graduated and started as a graduate for a large ecommerce company for 3.5 years which I absolutely loved and bounced around to different teams learning Perl, Java, Node, Swift, Vue, and finally settled in a team as a full stack developer where I worked on high performant React and JS applications for about 2 years. 

I wanted to get more into the backend side of things though so I left and went to another company for a year (to a job advertised as full stack) but ended up working on React Native for one year. I eventually left because I realised I wouldn't get the backend exposure I wanted.

I've now been at my current company which is a small startup (something very different to the other places I've worked at) and I'm doing Elixir, Elm, a little JS, PostgreSQL and GraphQL. I'm pretty happy with the tech stack, I really enjoy Elixir, don't really enjoy Elm but I'm finally getting the exposure to things like DBs and API layers I've wanted.

My issue is because of the nature of my current business I'm not really working with any sort of high traffic or large scale issues which I want exposure to. Every interesting job I want to apply to requires experience with distributed systems or microservice experience (I used to work with microservices at my other two jobs but having not worked there in a while I've never used Kubernetes or anything like that which other jobs seem to want, I feel a little rusty).

A friend of mine who still works for company A was telling me about all these live issues they were having to solve by configuring routing, Akamai caching layers, and I got jealous that I wasn't being exposed to these sorts of things anymore.

I enjoy the stuff I'm working on now but whenever I chat to developer friends who I value as good developers I feel like my knowledge of what I should know is slipping. I'm very proactive about learning, often build side projects and do MOOC courses but some of these things can't be done at home.

I also feel like I'm losing my experise that I had built up.

I was pretty good at React and whilst I still do front end development, any jobs I look at require some advanced design patterns I never came across and don't do now (or have reason to practise with). It's making me think that I'm devaluing as a developer by learning a new set of skills which I'm no way near as good at yet and falling behind with the ones I was good at. Front end moves insanely quickly after all. This makes me think I won't be able to get a higher paygrade at the rate I could or want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR\*\* - I used to work in large companies and do a lot of React which I was good at. I don't do that anymore so I feel like I'm losing my expertise by being okay at a different set of skills and that I'm missing out on large scale work at my current company even though any jobs I'd like to potentially move to require it. I also feel like my salary progression will be effected eventually."

How to? I just graduated and haven't navigated the real world, but an internship gave me a taste.

So coworkers kissed each others ass for resources while bitching about them (to me) when they weren't around. They'd try make me complicit and it was a hell of an effort to stay out of it all, plus because I didn't manage to be bffs with them (I was friendly and helpful!) I ended up suffering due to less resources/inside info that others got. Plus I didn't have a taste for drinking 2-3x a week like the rest seemed to.

Plus, I'd attract ire when two people gave conflicting information and I'd try bring it to attention to find the final correct answer to a technical question on protocol or something. I just wanted to know the actual correct thing to do! Note I'd never tell on anybody if they did the wrong thing. If I KNEW it was wrong and they'd get shit for it I'd just correct them privately.

Finally, the boss would often give conflicting instructions, which, when I was directly confronted, I'd point out.

That's it. I wouldn't like to play multiple sides, or be a sycophant 8 hours a day 5 days a week. But doing what I did, I was left being seen in the worst light and at a disadvantage. So I was wondering how you navigate these kinds of things."

Hello, I'm a rising junior year computer science student studying in a third world country and would like to intern at a company in North American or Europe next summer.

I have worked with Java (proficient), JavaScript (moderate) and taught myself Python (elementary). I have a solid understanding of web development, system design and analysis, 2 programming paradigms (OOP and functional) and a good understanding of data structures and algorithm analysis, Boolean logic, computer organization. My weaknesses are discrete mathematics (some parts), statistics and probability, calculus, digital circuit design.

It would be probably hard for me to work or train in math-heavy fields such as AI, ML or data science, or hardware-focused fields. I'll probably be better in a web development or software development environment.

Do you know any companies that accept foreign students? How does the application process differ from people living in that country? Can said company provide a travel visa into the country?"

Throughout my entire college career, I’ve had countless professors tell me that the starting salary for a job with my degree should be around $60,000ish. I’ve even had my advisor tell me to turn down any job that isn’t offering at least that much to start.

I’ve been lucky to have an internship with a larger company, and have been making $25/hr, or around $50,000/year for a little over a year now. Unfortunately this company does not have any openings, and I have to look elsewhere. Also unfortunately this company has a strict 3 month policy post graduating that you either have to get hired, or leave and find a different job. So I have a hard deadline of next month to find a job and not much time to browse the market.

Now over the past month, I’ve spent basically every night filling out job applications and sending resumes to over 100+ jobs both within my city and a 40 minute commute away. Sadly, I’ve only heard back from 3, all of which are willing to only pay $40,000 to start. All the jobs I’ve been seeing for $60,000 or higher that are “entry level” require at least 3 years of professional experience and certifications that require post graduation experience to get.

So basically what it’s looking like is wherever I end up getting a “real job”, I’m going to have to take a $10,000/yr paycut from my job as an intern, which I think is annoying and embarrassing.

I’m not expecting anything to come out of this post, I just needed to rant."
cqsu31,1,2019-08-15,Advice for Student Job,aquaticalgabriel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cqsu31/advice_for_student_job/,"I’m in a bit of an uncomfortable situation and I was hoping for a bit of insight. 

I’m a university student and I have a summer job in a bioinformatics lab. I’m on a 3 month fixed-term contract (June 1st-August 30th). 

I’m feeling very uncomfortable and unproductive due to a few factors and I was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on my experience to give me a little insight. 

When I first arrived in June I was told my hours were 35 hours a week, but very flexible. I was hired by a prof who is actually on vacation all summer, so I technically work under a supervisor who is a research associate. He told me: « you have to work 35 hours a week, but it can be whenever. If you want to work later in the day/weekends or from home sometimes and that’s fine, as long as you make the 35 hours ». Beyond that, my responsibilities weren’t very clear. On the first day he kind of just explained what the lab studies and kind of just shooed me off to teach myself about the experiments and research they do, without much structure. That continued on throughout my employment; I would teach myself a topic, mess with data, loosely correspond with my supervisor about what I was doing and kept going. I never had a clear idea of what I was supposed to be doing or what the bigger picture was, which became discouraging really quickly. 

As I continued through the summer, I definitely took advantage of the flexible scheduling. I took long weekends and worked through lunch/longer hours to make up for it. I often emailed to confirm that what I was doing was fine and he only answered 1/2 the time, confirming that I was in the clear. The only hiccup I had was when I had a medical emergency and had to leave the city for a couple days, and ended up working remotely for a couple days in a row. I emailed my sup and he responded saying that it was fine and that he understood, but more notice would be better when working from outside the hospital. That being said - I always worked 35hrs weekly. 

I have two weeks left in my contract and I’m feeling so uncomfortable because I don’t know how to approach my boss to ask for guidance moving forward and I feel like Im partly to blame because of my flexible schedule. I also felt SO unproductive all summer because there was no clear/easy way to check if I was on the right track and there were never meetings set up with my boss. 

I mostly feel bad because I feel like I’m being paid to do nothing and I feel guilty for taking the money when this job has been so relaxed and I feel like I haven’t produced anything, even though I’ve learned a fair amount. Is this normal for a student internship??? 

Any advice regarding whether I’ve done something wrong or if this is normal or how to address that I’m nearing the end of my contract would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you :)"

I'm 20, and i've been working one of those medium business jack-of-all trades IT jobs for about 2 and a half years now (i started as an intern in high school). Additionally, I've been attending a small junior college during that time as well, only taking a few classes a semester.

I'm doing a mix of helpdesk/support type of work (probably 80% of the time), along with some network and desktop systems administration type of work (20% of the time). I wouldn't say i'm the only technical staff member here (we have developers who maintain the websites/cloud operations, but they all work from their homes and are like... 5 hours away from here)

Now, i'm transferring into a big state university (luckily it's only a few minutes away from my house so I get to live at home), so I need to reduce my hours at work in order to attend university.

Here's where the problem comes in... I want to have a social life, AND have a job where i enjoy the work (not be the phone/email support bitch).

I feel like i've been doing helpdesk type of work for 2.5 years at this point, and i'm ready to get to a higher level, like systems or network administration. But, that would require a full time commitment that I am no longer willing to make (i am currently a full time employee but won't be starting in September since I did reach an agreement to reduce some days). But i don't feel excited about my job anymore.... 

Usually in this scenario, people on /r/sysadmin or /r/ITCareerQuestions would say ""just quit and find another job"", but from what I see, my only options for the time commitment are help desk jobs, and more than likely; my university's help desk. I'm not going to completely avoid any help desk job, but I know i wouldn't be happy in another one. 

Now my boss is on my tail about the Win10 CVE-2019-1181/1182 vulnerability. Because we don't have any fucking configuration management solutions (hell, we don't even have a domain), I have to jump in to all 190 of our Win10 machines and manually check/update their machines. Which also involves coordinating with all 190 of these users, something that i hate because I have social anxiety. 

I had an outburst (more like an anxiety attack) towards him about it this morning. I've had quite a few of these outbursts the past few months, and I know if I keep those up, i'll be fired.

I've always had a passion for networks and systems, I had (what i would consider to be) my first homelab at 11 years old (just two older desktop PCs, one running Server 2003 and the other had XP with a few VMs on it that i played with Active Directory on). My current homelab consists of an HP DL380 G6 and a DL360 G7, one of those shitty Cisco small business switches, and a few laptops i've come across over the past few years,. I'm currently running two domain controllers, a Sophos XG home edition firewall, and some linux vm's i'm playing around with on it (currently getting the hang of Ansible). 

Additionally, I have a 3 public facing linux vps's for mail, web, and FreePBX (currently playing around with asterisk... it's quite interesting).  I wanted to include my homelab in this to be clear that i'm not just saying I want to be a sysadmin just because I hate desktop support

I will say, that the money at my current job is pretty good. I'm also going to be taking on student loans, and now a car payment as well (my trusty 03 Outback has finally bit the dust)

TLDR: I hate my current job and desktop support in general, but because i'm starting school full-time, I can't get anything better than desktop support for at least 2 more years, and I honestly can't take it anymore."

Hi reddit! I am currently halfway through a Bachelor's degree Computer Science program where my major is in Big Data. I would love to enter a career in data science but from what I have learned in my research, a Bachelor's is not enough to get at least midway up the career ladder in this industry.

I have been programming for about three years, one(Python) before I started university and I have spent the last two learning and practicing C++, Java, Python, Sql... I won't go into the curriculum, but it covers all the standard topics in a typical CS degree, so when I graduate I should have a good foundation to continue my studies and complete my own projects.

I started college a little later than most(just after turning 23) because of some personal issues, so time is an issue and I am focused on doing as much as I can as fast as possible. Which involves my own studies outside of school work and getting good scores. I'm currently taking a couple of courses about Data Science and R programming on Coursera while studying full time. But this, and my degree when I get it, is about all I have so far, no internships or projects to speak of as I've been spending most of my time learning the vast basics of CS in the last 2 years.

My Questions are:

What should I do next to enhance myself for a career data science career? (Do I need to get a MSc or PhD? Should I gain work experience?)

What should I do in my spare time to get myself ahead?"

Warning: this is a long read.,peachtartx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cqtfo4/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life_warning_this/,"So I’m a 22 year old female, and I recently graduated from college in December. Like nearly everyone else my age, I couldn’t make enough money to pay rent and my student loans as a part-time server, so I reluctantly moved in with my parents.

Let me give you all just a little bit of background. Moving in with my parents has always been worst case scenario in my mind. My mother is a narcissistic control freak, and while I know she does love me, she’s very selfish and will basically do anything to convince me to stay with her because she absolutely hates her life and is one of the most negative people I know. It’s gotten better as I’ve gotten older, but she has no boundaries and we have a really unhealthy relationship. For example, when I moved in, I asked to borrow some lotion and went digging through her vanity. I found a clump of my hair in the drawer. I KNOW it was mine, because no one else in my family has copper hair. When I asked if she hadn’t cleaned in a while, she gave me this look that told me she kept it on purpose- which is really gross and creepy and made me incredibly uncomfortable. I don’t care if she’s my mom, who keeps a clump of dead hair from w hairbrush? I think she’s low key obsessed with me, and tells me all the time that my sister (12) and I are the only reasons she’s alive.

Also my dad is an alcoholic and he’s sort of in the process of stopping drinking, so naturally, he’s being a massive douchebag, because he’s going through withdrawal. But I mostly avoid him when he’s in a mood, and it’s something I can deal with.

I think it’s obvious that staying in this house is a bad idea for my emotional and mental health. But I recently started a job working for a pretty big company, it’s in the entertainment industry, but like barely. I basically edit the TV Guide. Which is a monotonous job- I basically compare schedules to what’s in the system and then make changes if there are any. But that’s like all I do ALL day. I also work 1 to 9:30. Which I thought I would like, but it’s turning out to be exhausting. 

Where I live now, my parents moved here halfway through college. It’s a really tiny town up north and almost nothing ever happens. There are virtually no people my age, because people are all dying to get out of here, or they’re already married with children. So I have one friend who lives 45 minutes away and that’s IT. I see her maybe once or twice a month. But our schedules are so opposite, so it’s gotten almost impossible to see her. So I don’t even spend my weekends doing anything as a reprieve. I just sit and play video games- which is fine sometimes- but I have NO social life and I’m a very outgoing person, so it bothers me to no end and I find myself missing my college town and my friends DESPERATELY. 

SO with that in mind, this isn’t going to work in the long term. I could deal with any one of those depressing facets of my life, but the fact that family, work, and friends are all really shitty- I’m naturally depressed and I don’t want this to be my life forever.

My end goal, I would really like to be an entertainment publicist in LA. I did an internship there last summer and I loved it so much, and I know that’s what I want to do. Obviously LA is expensive, so I need to save up money to move, and I would also need a job that would pay at least $20/hr, because I’m a small white girl, and I don’t want to live in an area that’s sketchy.

If I stay at my parents, I can save money, but I’m not really sure that this job experience is worth much because I’m not getting experience doing anything relevant to publicity. Like I said, I edit the TV Guide. And pretty much every job in this building is like that, and this is a tiny town and there’s just not a lot of job opportunities here. There are tons of homeless and jobless people.

But my best friend/roommate from college wants to live with me. She and I could possibly get an apartment together, and there’s a job opening as a marketing assistant for a theater and I’m super qualified. Another friend also knows the manager and could put in a good word for me. I think I would be much happier at that job, I’d get all the same benefits I have at my current job, and it pays more.

I know that I wouldn’t be able to save as much money, but the actual work is more relevant to what I want to do, and I would only be 45 minutes from my college and generally closer to all my friends. Right now, I’m 9 hours away. I know I would be infinitely happier. I would definitely need to be frugal, but I would need to stay for a while and get job experience anyway, so I would have time to save.

My mom thinks moving with my friend is a mistake. Not that she dislikes her, but she thinks I’ll look like a flake on my resume for leaving this job, and that I won’t be able to save and that she can’t help me financially if I leave. She would still cover my phone bill and health insurance. So the only things I would be adding to my bills now are food, which I paid for during college anyway, and rent. But if I’m making more money, I would be able to afford rent and student loans. 

——————— 

SO TL;DR. My life sucks currently, do I leave my parents’ house to live with my best friend although it’s riskier financially or do I stay at home, because it’s safer financially, but it’s really toxic for my mental health and I’m really miserable?"

cqu2ox,0,2019-08-15,Future after Undergrad,AwkwardDifficulty5,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/cqu2ox/future_after_undergrad/,"Hi all, 
I am in a bit of an interesting situation and would like some advice. 

I am rising senior at a top ~40 public school studying Mathematics. Initially, I was very focused on getting a good job after college and throughout my time in college I have done a number of internships at top tech companies, mainly as a software engineer and even got a full-time offer. Unfortunately, I never really focused on school since I was able to succeed in my career without it and my grades right now are pretty low (2.9 gpa). 

Recently I worked for a top 3 Artificial Intelligence Research lab and really enjoyed the work and even published a paper into a good conference. Since then I have been working on AI research with a professor from my school, who has offered me a spot to do my phd with him. 

My goal now is to definitely do a phd, but I am trying to figure out the best way in doing so. The professor I am working with is great; however, I feel that I should apply to other schools. 

# Paths 
I will be finishing my undergrad (1 semester early) this December. 
I feel that I have a couple of paths I can take 

1. I commit to the phd with my current research advisor and stay at the same school I finished my undergrad and finish within 5 years. 
2. I reject the offer for phd with my current research advisor and apply to other schools (mainly CS, maybe a few applied math programs) and see which schools I get into. 
    * Low gpa: 2.9
    * Have 1 paper (second author), trying to get a first papered author out before December (w/ my current research advisor)
    * Recommendations: 
        * 1 from my current research advisor
        * 1 from top AI lab manager
        * 1 from a professor who I will be taking Algebra and Graph Theory with this upcoming semester
3. If I don't get into any schools of my choice, try to land a job as a Research Engineer at a top AI Lab and publish a paper or two w/ good scientists and then reapply in a year (December 2020)
4. Don't graduate early from undergrad, and try to raise grades, but seeing that applications for phd are due in December I don't think this would help much. 

No matter what I plan on focusing this semester and doing well (I am taking 3 undergad and two grad courses)
and
I am really trying to get a first authored paper published on the current research I am doing.


Given my circumstance, I am wondering which of these paths is best to ultimately surround myself with bright individuals and do good ML Research and eventually make it as a scientist and a good industry lab or a good post doc position."

I liked the company well enough, but I want to see what other opportunities are out there for EE grads, especially since I have one more summer before I graduate to try out an internship somewhere else.

Tomorrow is my last day at my current internship, and my boss told me I would receive two offer letters tomorrow, one for a temporary remote position while I am in school, and one for a  Summer 2020 internship, with a pretty much guaranteed full time position when I graduate. He said I would need to decide on next Summer by the end of September. 

So my issue is, I want to explore other opportunities for next Summer but I only have until September to decide on this current offer. Should I reject it and hope I can find other opportunities? Or settle for this company without trying anything else?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

cqwoqb,2,2019-08-15,My thoughts about college after getting my CS degree as a re-entry student in his 30's.,Itsaghast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cqwoqb/my_thoughts_about_college_after_getting_my_cs/,"My take-away is this: **a degree itself will not land you interviews, let alone open career doors in software engineering and development.** I was so focused on getting my degree finished asap for financial reasons that I pretty much blew through my courses and never really had the time to develop a portfolio or anything of note.

I focused on getting myself to the point that I have a decent grasp of a wide-variety of topics, so that when I landed a job, I could specialize and learn relatively quickly. But without experience or a portfolio of projects, I find that I cannot even get an interview to show off my general knowledge.

If you're thinking about going to college, you should aggressively apply to internships and/or get involved with research projects with the faculty. These are the people who have landed positions post-graduation. If you don't do these things, you are just kicking the can down the road. And you're not taking advantage of the real resources that college has to offer.

Don't believe articles you read about the demand for CS graduates, they don't tell the full story. Don't believe nonsense about landing 6 figure jobs upon graduation, or even on the higher side of 5 figure salaries. Even though some students do, post-graduation job search is highly competitive and I only see the top percentage of students getting interviews and receiving offers (I'm in the CA bay area job market). Now, I went to a more middling college, I'm sure if you go to a more prestigious school that percentile ceiling is lower.

If you go to college, the degree should be the last thing on your mind IMO.

In any case, good luck in your career journey and remember that often times making a choice is better then not making one at all, even if it turns out to be a mistake."

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting some emails &amp; envelopes from UF ( I've been only getting this from colleges that sound interested in me)! Right now I'm a Sr in High School I have pretty good stats, I know how hard it can be to get into UF. I think I have a good chance to get in tho...and I think them giving me emails &amp; envelopes must be some sign of interest. ( I have been getting some emails &amp; envelopes from pretty good schools that have asked me to visit, tour, and I've talked to a few )Anyways I want to go to college for CS, I was thinking about UF but I heard really really bad things about UF for CS. I'm not even sure anymore. I'm unbias with my decision, but I think UCF is better for CS and, UF is a better University overall. I would love to go to UF but I have some questions?

&amp;#x200B;

***( Please don't bias towards UF, just get me your honest opinion! )***

&amp;#x200B;

* I know UF is a Research University and I heard some teachers will come solely because of that not to teach the students? Is that true? 
* If you didn't get the UF's average SAT or ACT score did you have to take remedial classes?
* What kind of internships did you get, compared to UCF &amp; FSU?
* How long did it take for you to find a job?
* I've heard that a lot of people at UF are kinda rude/cocky? Is that true?
* How is the CS community at UF?
* How bad is the Debt?
* I've heard CS is kind of a weak spot for UF, so my question is Do you regret going to UF? Would you say UCF/FSU is better?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I have so many questions, I just don't want to make the wrong decision!

cqwtjz,3,2019-08-15,College of Ed coordinators SUCK,Drummergirl16,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/cqwtjz/college_of_ed_coordinators_suck/,"TL;DR: I'm going back to school and the heads of my program are awful. They are so condescending and lazy.

A little background about me: I never finished my degree for personal reasons, but ended up teaching at an alternative school for a year. I learned so much and truly loved what I did. Now, I'm going back to school to get my degree (finally!).

The heads of my program, however, truly suck. Maybe it's because of my degree, maybe it's because I worked at a charter school, maybe they are just assholes, I don't know. They are so condescending when emailing or speaking to me, and I feel like they have no respect for me. It's hard to go back to school after being out of university life for a few years, give me a break when I don't know how to register for classes! I'm asking you questions because I need to know the answers!

They have not set up a practicum (internship) for me, even though it's required of my classes this semester. I have been pushing them for weeks to set one up. They literally have a person in the college of ed whose job it is to set up internships, but for some reason they just can't be bothered. They want me to intern at my job, which is totally inappropriate to my degree type (I currently teach middle/high, my degree is elementary). I've told them again and again that interning at my job would not be feasible, but they literally have told me interning there is the best solution for THEM. It's less work for THEM.

I feel they do not respect the work I've done over the past year. I teach students with severe emotional and behavioral disabilities, and most of my students are way below grade level. But my middle schoolers showed hugh improvements on the state tests, and all of my students made great strides to getting up to grade level. I taught Macbeth to my students, and I had students who struggled to read a paragraph acting out scenes from Macbeth. That language is hard, and when something is hard in class, these students tend to act out. But we did it! They truly understood the underlying themes of Macbeth by the end of the unit. The kids even wanted to act out the entire play (dialogue and all) for the whole school, but unfortunately there wasn't enough time in the semester. But these kids, who tend to sleep in class, wanted to engage with the material!

In addition, I got my students to write. One of my students' IEP goal (special education goal) was to write ONE sentence by the end of the year. By mid-semester, this student had written three CHAPTERS of a horror/mystery book he was inspired to write. I MADE THAT HAPPEN. But did my program directors ask about my real-world teaching experience? No. When I mention different things I did with my students, they just brush it off. Like, wtf? Are my accomplishments in my position threatening the idea that you are all knowing and I can't be a good teacher without your direction?

All of the program heads have been out of the classroom for years, even decades -- if they were ever in the classroom at all. Literally, they have no idea what goes on in the classroom, much less MY classroom with severely temperamental kids. They expect the students in the college of ed to come up with ALL of their own material for every lesson. Like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I don't need to reinvent the wheel. Do I modify existing lessons to fit my class? Of course! But I don't have the TIME to create every single activity (unlike they do, because they are not in the classroom they have time to create all those things). They expect too much of their pre-service teachers when teachers have enough on their plate already.

Basically, I wish they would treat me as a professional -- especially as I have had actual experience teaching. I'm not perfect, I have a lot to learn, but I want them to recognize the things I've done well, too.

Sorry for the rant. I just have to get through this last year of school and then I can go back to doing what I love, with the degree title."

I'd like to go somewhere in Western or Northern Europe: Germany, Norway, etc. (Open to suggestions). I want somewhere that has a good balance in work and personal life compared to Americans with CS degrees. I think the American work environment is often unrewarding. I work with people who have little time to take off after having children who need dental appointments and stuff. They almost never take time for themselves in the year that I've been there.  
  
I have my high school diploma, and I'm getting my BS in health informatics in December of this year. I have a year's worth of experience at a hospital that uses Epic's EHR through an internship. I am very skilled with excel, and I know a little programming (VB, C++, SQL). I only know English, but I can definitely (with lots of time, years) learn another language.

I'm graduating this December with a degree in Health Informatics. This is a very important element to consider because I am very limited in what I'm qualified to do, even though it's a computer science degree. I am not a heavy programmer, not that I ever want to be, because my focus is management and implementation and maintenance of EHRs in hospitals.  
  
Epic and Cerner are the big dogs I'd like to work for, but I'd like to work out of the country (in a health system perhaps). There are a couple of reasons why, but I don't think that they're relevant to what I'm asking.  
  
I'm looking at some European countries like Germany, and also the Scandinavian countries in Europe as well. I am open to suggestions.  
  
Now, onto the questions:
  
How easy will it be for me to get a job in a European country? What must I do? Should I have ample experience, a master's degree, speak the language very fluently or even get certified, etc.? How should I go about applying to hospitals over there?"
cqzghb,0,2019-08-15,UVA or NYU Stern (undergrad),CamMohwinkle24,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cqzghb/uva_or_nyu_stern_undergrad/,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to get some thoughts as to which of these schools holds the slight edge in regards to placing its graduates into BB banks.

I am aware that UVA’s MicIntire is revered as the better of its two business schools (Darden being the other). However, does Stern still hold more weight on the street given its location?

Also, I will be a transitioning veteran using the GI Bill and Yellow Ribbon Program which I believe covers more at UVA than Stern.

As far as overall campus and college life goes I am aware both are totally different atmospheres. I will be 24 when attending so I am not overly worried about having a traditional college experience that perhaps UVA could offer.

I am leaning towards Stern given that it provides me the ability to network with veterans in the IB community right in the NYC area. My GI bill housing allowance offered for NYU is roughly 3700 a month so I could make it work given I have a roommate.

UVA alumni I do hear go to bat extremely well for MicIntire grads and also place very well amongst BBs so I am just trying to see if there are any major factors that sets one of these schools over the other.

Also, does going to Darden rather than MicIntire greatly decrease your chances of landing internships, and getting your name out there?

Appreciate any insights fellow alumni’s as well as others can provide, thanks guys!"
cqzigb,6,2019-08-15,"Struggling in an internship, what should I do?",y435ytr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cqzigb/struggling_in_an_internship_what_should_i_do/,"I am a soon to be 3rd year college student that signed up for a 10 week research internship for my school. This is my first computer science related job. In this job, my main goal is to make a tool relating to computer networks. So far, the classes I have taken have been mostly relating to OOP and DS&amp;A. I have not taken any computer networking classes so I have little knowledge in that field. This internship is designed for those that are looking into getting further into research.

I feel extremely incompetent. I am having a hard time grasping some of these concepts and am lucky if I even write a line of code in a single day. The main issue is that I have no help and am basically alone. I am not in a team or anything. I did go to my professor once to ask a question however, he said blatantly he does not care about answering simple concepts/coding issues. The person I report to is the professor's grad student. 
The grad student is not of much help to me either. He has a very ""go figure it out yourself"" approach to guidance and seems to get irritated if I am confused with a basic concept or if I need something explained twice. When he does explain, it is hard to keep up with what exactly what he is saying as my brain is about two sentences behind. I do have a notebook in which I try to write whatever advice he gives me so I can minimize asking the same question twice and to keep record of the fact.

I've spend most of my days simply reading textbooks, reading the provided documentation that came with the project, and Googling for relevant information. All this research doesn't help as much as my project requires very specific knowledge of which I either can't find or I don't understand. I did pay for a tutor outside of my school who has helped me with some understanding of concepts however, I am worried I am progressing too slowly and won't be able to finish the project by the deadline. How should I approach this issue? It feels like I am setup to fail.

Even if I understand some concept, I get stuck on trying to figure out how I need to implement that idea into code. Compared to classes where there is a lot of help and structure, I am in an extremely different environment where I  have freedom but no real guidance."
cr009l,1,2019-08-15,Conflicted about getting a permanent job before going to graduate school in one year. Any advice?,calivalley,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cr009l/conflicted_about_getting_a_permanent_job_before/,"Hi guys

So right now I am in a situation where I am currently on a gap year before starting graduate school, and I am conflicted on what I should do in the meantime. I want to work, and there are some good opportunities, but I would end up having to leave after less than year when (or if) I go back to school. 

I am looking at the salary potential of the area I can go in right now (GIS) vs. the salary potential in the field I am more trained in that I am planning on getting my graduate degree (research scientist). 

For the job I want at the company I would love to work for (and have interned for twice in the past), I would likely make more overall, but who knows if I'll get hired there. 

I really want to go to graduate school. If I don't go, I know I will regret it for the rest of my life. But I also need to be realistic about what my options are. 

Should I just get a job for now doing retail or something where it wouldn't be a big deal to leave after such a short amount of time? 

I feel like I am hearing different opinions as to what I should do from people close to me. People at my internship are telling me to apply to permanent jobs anyway. My dad is telling me to not even bother with permanent jobs (or at most, get something part-time while I wait for graduate school to start.)

I'm conflicted and would like more opinions. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Sorry this is very long but please stay with me. I don’t know how to handle this. 
I have two weeks left at this position that I came back to help with for this big show coming up. I started as an unpaid intern then got hired a few months after. Then quit because of college. Right now I’m not quitting before the show because I will get the opportunity to work with a celebrity in the field I want to work in and want to be able to put that on my resume. Until then (and after because she’s already asked me to come back temporarily after I worked for a year so she’ll probably ask again) I need advice on how to handle my boss. FYI- She has me helping with this show because I am one of the few people who have run this show before and since there will be a few hundred more people she needs more people to help that know what they’re doing. 

Here are some examples: 
-I have to keep track of my own hours and things I’ve sold. When it came time to be paid (I was only paid once and for several months I worked) she told me she couldn’t prove I had sold those things so I couldn’t get commission 
-She calls me late at night (like 11:30 pm) saying she needs me to work 9-7 the next day 
-She tells me I work until a certain time but then when it’s time for me to leave she blows up at me and says I haven’t finished what I needed to do. Then proceeds to list for the first time what she needs me to do. 
-She leaves me alone in the store with all the expensive product and gets mad when I don’t give everyone enough attention even though I’m answering phone calls, signing for packages, helping walk ins, and the people who actually scheduled an appointment. 
-She sells the same product to different people for different prices. I sold one item for $7000 to one person and the same item for $3500.
-She tells me to lie to my coworkers about certain things and when I ask why she says “because I’m your boss and I said so” 
-I have maybe gotten one break in my entire time working there and I’ve worked 12-15 hour days 
-She comes to the store whenever she feels like it, occasionally turns off her phone when me or my coworkers are working and makes herself unavailable when she gives us a project with no or limited instructions. (Then yells at us when we did it wrong) 
-A coworker and her got into an argument so my boss went to my coworkers house and continued the argument after work. 
-I told her I wanted more hourly pay than I got last time since I have more work experience now and am doing a lot more than i did. She yelled at me and said she was going to pay me less than I earned before just like everyone else (even though I do most of the work) 
-I came into work twice now expecting to have a normal day of appointments when a new employee walks in, whom I did not know anything about, and my boss tells me I’ll be training them along with my normal duties. (She said this over the phone of course because she wasn’t at the store)
-We had to sign forms for a release at one point and I was under 18 so she made me lie about my age so we could proceed 
-She once tried to pass off a (very obviously) used product as brand new to a client who paid about $8,000+ for something brand new. The client didn’t believe it at all
-She makes me give out my personal social media, email, phone number to clients so I am accessible outside of the job and I’m expected to reply in a timely manner (I’m part time and have two other jobs)

The turnover rate for employees is INCREDIBLE. She has four employees currently. Me, another consultant for the show, and two brand new hires. I don’t plan on working for her again but it is inevitable our paths will cross eventually and I need advice on how to deal with her. If you need more details please ask, I know I included a lot but that’s just basic things I could think of off the top of my head. 


TLDR; my boss is very difficult to deal with and puts me in uncomfortable situations repeatedly. How do I deal with her? I’m not quitting yet."
cr0oqv,373,2019-08-15,Part 3: Bad Experience with Manager at Internship,ExtensionSort,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cr0oqv/part_3_bad_experience_with_manager_at_internship/,"This is the third in a sequence of rants about a  hitherto nameless Big N company that I'll now reveal to be FB. I'll link Parts 1 and 2 below.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c3uvgv/having_a_bad_experience_with_intern_manager/)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/chu69d/bad_experience_with_internship_manager/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

First off, I don't think it's a bad company to work for, even though I got royally fucked. The process is very challenging, but 100% fair; in this case, however, it was my manager who was holding me back.

Turns out he'd been having problems at home; he has a newborn son, and just apparently realized that he regrets marrying his wife. How do I know that? He's mentioned those problems several times before, and each time was associated with a day where he's come off as specifically crabby or exhausted.

To recap, he miscommunicates severely enough to keep me from getting my work done on time (asks for some code, looks at the commit for it, and says ""fuck, man, I actually wanted the opposite!"") Not only this, he also yells at me - a lot. Sometimes, it's when I'm behind on a feature that he'd thought was done, and other times, I could see him visibly brooding at his desk before he'd go off on me.

Despite him and his garbage, I managed to finish my project against all odds. It was missing some unittests, yes, but he also piled additional work on me that wasn't part of the original project plan and made it hard for me to push code through by never reviewing on time.

Yesterday, I asked him ""When will I get the result of my return offer?"" It was a fair question; he was supposed to have had the final calibration meeting about that then. He asked, ""why so impatient, man?"" I thought I was in for another outburst at that point, so I awkwardly tried to brush it off as a joke with ""I'm just an intern, Yo - I'm not like you where I'm here full-time with money in the bank and all, so you could imagine why I'm stressed haha...""

This is when shit completely hit the fan. He said I was very disrespectful right there, and somewhat aggressively told me ""I'm not your brother - I'm your manager, and I deserve some respect. Don't talk about my personal life."" I apologize myself up, down, sideways and in circles, because I'm not looking for another outburst at that point.

Then, at the final meeting, he says ""OK, we can talk about your result now."" I then ask, ""OK, so did I get the return offer?"" He goes completely off on me with ""I'm trying to do my job here, and you keep interrupting me. Plus, who the Hell are you to talk about my personal life and my bank account?!"" (I had already apologized profusely for this, and only said it because I was trying to diffuse a bad situation to begin with.) Then, he says ""That's it, I'm reporting you to HR, and they can give you your result"" and storms out of the room.

He then comes back with ""I'll give you one last chance, but if you ever interrupt me again, I'm going to go to HR and ruin your career."" He then gives me my final round of feedback and tells me that I won't be getting a return offer. No skin off my back! I hated working with him so much at that point that I just wanted out, no matter how much FB would have paid me otherwise.

Then, he has the nerve to ask me about his feedback. I tell him politely that there were some communication problems that he created that held me back, but each time I brought up a specific incident, he'd say ""no, I actually meant &lt;such and such&gt;."" I was so sick of him at this point that I just said ""That's it, man. I'm very uncomfortable talking to you, so I'm going to leave."" He asked me again and again, ""give me the feedback for sake of my improvement,"" but I insisted on talking to the skip manager or literally anyone else.

Of course, I immediately went to the intern director and got a formal complaint filed to HR. They said that it was clearly a toxic situation he created that impacted my work, but there was nothing they could do on their end about the return offer.

Before, if you'll read the previous posts, I was very stressed about getting that offer. However, I learned from this experience that there's not enough money to pay me with in the world if it means I have to work with a guy like that. I'm getting a head start for next year (a rising junior now, so got one more internship left) and applying to as many places as I can.

Just wanted to say that this experience fucking sucked, but it taught me some hard lessons that I always find senior devs trying to teach junior devs on this sub. When shit goes sideways like this, you gotta watch out for yourself first and forget about the company and about the other guy; regardless of which company it is and what kind of manager it is, each is trying to protect its own interests and could not give less of a shit about your career.

Thanks for all your support throughout, guys! Hopefully, next year, I'll be able to post about some good experiences that I had instead.

Edit: Links were wrong.

Second Edit: Somehow, despite all of this, I got my project done. Admittedly, it was missing some unittests, but productivity was the only failing, and that was the part that he held me back on. Again, the return offer doesn't mean anything to me right now, but I'm very concerned with paying this feedback forward like /u/xjtian said so that nobody else ever has to go through what I did here."

should I remove my first internship as it is kind of a huge gap?

also, im applying to environmental science jobs and at that time I was a comp sci major so the internship isnt really related to what im applying to (neither is my 2015 one, but it's more recent and i need to have SOMETHING)"

I graduated from college with a bachelors in IT about a year ago. I went straight from an internship to working full time as soon as I exited school. I quickly found out that I lack passion for IT (or more specifically system admin) work. I'm good at it, I use a lot of my investigative qualities to get me through, but so early in my career I have such little drive to progress in the field. 

This was the first major red flag for me. Working for a mid-sized corporation definitely amplified this for me, but I'm so burnt out of the 8-5 life with no remote opportunity and so much responsibility for things I don't have passion for.

 I've been considering going back to grad school for something that I could potentially enjoy so much more, such as Human Factors Psychology or UX Design. Something more specialized (with no incident response work during the weekend)!

Is a transition out of IT doable even before going back to school? I feel as though the only thing I could do with an IT degree is to pursue a destined career path (like security, cloud, networking) or learn how to code, I don't like my options there. I think I'm ready to switch things up but I'm not exactly sure where to go next. 

Just seeking some advice from you guys!! I'd appreciate any input here so much!

TLDR: I'm sick of IT after working a short time &amp; want to make a dramatic career switch."

cr23ij,2,2019-08-16,[LONG] Juggling multiple offers/interviews/aggressive companies,Wyndtor35,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cr23ij/long_juggling_multiple_offersinterviewsaggressive/,"Hey guys, first time poppin my head in here to actually ask a question.

I was recently impacted by pretty significant layoffs at the company I had been working at since I graduated from college in May 2018. I have a BS in Software Engineering from a prestigious school and I'm confident in my tech skills, so I figured I wouldn't have much trouble finding a new job but I didn't expect it to be like this. Both my previous jobs I was hired pretty much immediately and didn't have nearly as many aggressively competing organizations as I do right now. I have a little over 2 years experience on the job, one year for a co-op in college (but it was a junior level position, not a true internship) and then this past year at my most recent employer. It was a business decision and the reputation of the company among other engineers in the area is stellar. A bunch of my former coworkers (including senior leadership) also reached out to a bunch of companies without me prompting them to, and as one hiring manager said to me, ""We've received multiple unsolicited, glowing recommendations about you from your former coworkers""

I'm not even a week out of work yet, and I have 2 offers in hand. I still have more in person interviews scheduled for next week, and I've been on-site at a different company every single day this week. I'm in the ""waiting for an offer"" stage with 3 other companies. They are acting similarly as aggressive as the two companies I have offers from, and some of these opportunities are close to the top of my list.

I have a couple issues. At both my previous jobs I was performing WELL above my job title which means my experience is fantastic, especially for my age. I'm looking for a fairly significant raise, and a new title. This hasn't been an issue.

As far as the written offers I already have in hand go, one is for a company (Company A) that I would 100% enjoy working at. Modern tech stack, firmly in my domain, the people that work there are fantastic, and I'd be given more opportunities to be a decision maker. Only problem is the salary is a bit of a low ball, and the benefits aren't particularly great. Exploding offer which is complete bs, but I still have a few days left to decide and the hiring manager is a reasonable person so I'll be able to extend it no problem.

On the other hand, I have a company (Company B) that I don't think would be particularly great to work at due to their domain, but they gave me a stupid absurd offer for more of an architecture role than implementation, which is where I was planning to take my career in the long term. This one was further down my list initially, until I saw the offer that was 15% higher than the other one I received +  a 40% raise from my previous position. They headedhunted me and gave me an offer after a single hour long interview and some conversations with my references. This would be a red flag, if they weren't one of the biggest companies in the world in their domain. Few caveats here are

1. Like I said, I'm not particularly excited about the company or culture, but the base compensation is leagues ahead of both my previous position and my other offer, plus great 401k match and other benefits.
2. Exploding offer (WTF) with a drug test, and the start date is a less than a week and a half away. I will 100% fail that drug test (just weed) because I'm not going to have clean pee within a week, like literally no chance. They even explicitly say it doesn't matter if you have a med card are not, which pretty much disqualifies me immediately unless I cheat the process (Medicinal use for epilepsy and the side effects of anti-convulsants) and it really makes me think a whole lot less of their organization as a whole that they won't even hire legal medicinal users. I'm also not sure how flexible they are when it comes to exploding offer deadlines, I got the offer late in the day today.

I'm expecting more offers next week, 1 or 2 are likely but I could get up to 3 or 4 if things continue to go well. I have an on-site interview with my #1 choice on Monday. I intend to bring up the offers to speed up the process with them. I really don't want to accept any offers, exploding or not, before I get a chance to interview there.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I have a few questions.

1. What is the best way to politely refuse because of a drug test I'm going to fail, without sounding like an ass? I don't even want to bother accepting if I'm going to be drug tested on a week's notice (+ potential random tests as a medicinal user...yeah no). There are plenty of legitimate concerns I have other than just the drug test that I could raise in my refusal, like the culture (lack of diversity in the office, seemed like a bunch of old white dudes...meh. I came from a hypersocial startup environment with an average age of like, 28), domain, and a lengthy commute. I'm also in a fairly small market, so I don't want to burn any bridges or taint my reputation for something that is realistically totally unrelated to my job performance, not their business anyway, and likely won't be an issue a few years from now.
2. Is it a dick move to ask Company #2 to give me a bit more time and use an offer I plan on refusing, and honestly wouldn't be able to complete, to negotiate? The other offer I have is from a smaller company, so I totally understand if they can't match the package of a $15 billion company, but they took the lowest figure in my range and undercut me- and I'm definitely not accepting that. They're also a similarly long commute, which is not great. I  personally have 0 issues pretending I'm mulling it over to get a raise elsewhere, but I know it doesn't tend to go over well with some people. If I was going to turn it down on the basis of the other factors I mentioned and there was no drug test I'd have no problem at all holding onto it, but the fact that even if I accepted I'd probably end up not getting hired makes me feel a little strange about it.
3. Exploding offer tips? These are new to me, and to be honest they're really not okay. It feels like a predatory practice  to give less than a week's time for people to decide on something as life-changing as starting a new job.
4. Any other general salary negotiation/tips when it comes to being in this high demand? I'm likely going to start negotiating with Company A tomorrow, Company B gave me my offer today so I have at least a *little* bit of time, and my interview at my #1 choice is on Monday. My other opportunities are in various states of completion. Company C I finished the full technical interview process and am waiting for an offer or the ""sorry we're not interested"" email, Company D (hyper aggressive) I did all the phone screening, coding tests, and aced the in person non-technical interview this morning, Company E is on Monday...Do I just straight up say ""So this company offered me this base salary, plus all these benefits...but I'd much prefer working for you guys. What is the best offer you could do given the other offers I have?"" or something like that? It's pretty stressful having like, 5 day deadlines to accept a job offer less than a week after I transferred all my knowledge and handed my laptop in. I knew my market value was higher than my previous salary, but I didn't expect a company to come in and offer me significantly more than the range I provided as their first offer. Threw a wrench right into the works.

Anyone that read all of this deserves a gold star. It's particularly tough for me because some of these companies are very similar as far as culture/tech stack/domain goes, so it's really boiling down to compensation which is new territory. My ""#1"" choice is more like a 1A and Company A is more like a 1B/C. Company B is much further down my list, but I wasn't going to self-sabotage myself and sound not interested when I'm primarily feeling out the market/my value, and they didn't say a damn thing about drug testing until I got the formal offer, and honestly...None of the other companies I've worked at/interviewed with did any kind of drug testing. I've done an absurd amount of research and am fairly sure I could navigate these waters on my own, but some specific input from other people (not 5 year old articles or forum threads) in the same field that have had similar experiences/maybe are on the other side of the hiring process would be invaluable to me right now.

Thanks to anyone that got this far, and for any advice you guys can give me! There are much worse problems I could have, but I'm still stressin'"

&amp;#x200B;

I know C++ and a little of Java (took two OOP classes in them so far), a little bit of JavaScript (not as familiar with JS OOP as i am with java and C++ OOP since im learning it on my own). When i do stuff like leetcode i find it easier to work with java (probably because idk too much of JavaScript OOP or have enough experience with it?). My fear is that to be a web developer i would need to learn many many languages and frameworks, which is very time consuming. it would be much easier to focus on one language like java and a few of its frameworks. Im a senior and barely got enough time to learn what i need to get a job (barely learning anything in college). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have done an internship where I messed around with a large data set using python and then visualized the data with JavaScript using a library called d3.js and i absolutely hated it. it was too much designing and coloring and arranging lines and div for my liking. I far more enjoyed working with the data (filtering data, rearranging the data matrix, finding patterns in the data, normalizing the data, etc). i guess i hate the front end side of things? Or is there more to front end than designing and stuff?

I havent done to much project with java but im guessing i will be interacting more with data based and make apps and such right? Im just lost right now. I live in NY and idk which is more in demand/ easier to get a job in"

I am a 16 year old intern for a fairly well known congresswomen. I am an unpaid intern, and I just answer phones and go through mail a few days a week.

Now normally I start the day off at 9am. However because of a scheduling conflict, I had go get there at 8:30, normally not a problem. We usually have our scedualer there early, and she could let me in.

Here is where the catch is. I had hip surgery 2 days prior, and I really wanted to sit down in a chair in the lobby. We have a door to a small lobby that is usually unlocked, and then a door to the office that stays locked. So, to my luck, the lobby door is unlocked and I rest my sore hip in one of the cushy leather chairs.  

Here's the problem. Right when I sat down, a faint alarm goes off. I accidently set off the motion detectors. So I have no way of getting inside to turn off the alarm, let alone do I know the code. Now I am just waiting for the police to come.

Suprisingly, I had no one in the office's cell number. The only cell number I have is our Chief of Staff in Washington. So he gets a call, that 800 miles away an intern set off an alarm. So he then calls the district director, and he says that she will be in shortly.

We get inside, turn off the alarm, and tells me not to worry as it is not my fault. The police stop by to check on us, and let them know it was a false alarm.

The Chief of Staff, however, was not very happy to be bothered early in the morning. I learned after the fact that he was in a meeting with the congresswoman, because of course he was.

TL;DR: I am an Intern that accidently set off an alarm to the office of a well known congresswoman, causing the  Chief of staff in Washington, D.C. to be alerted as well as the police."

This is (obviously) something I want to avoid, so I started looking through roles within the SWE space. 

I happened upon Cloud DevOps Engineering and being the grease on the wheels of the development/deployment pipeline sounds very interesting to me. However looking into the tech stack I see a lot of things like kubernetes, docker, AWS, bash scripting skills, etc.

The thing is, I really enjoy traditional programming, specifically in Java and Python. I am aware that I am very good at it (I’ve crushed every CS class I’ve been in, all while taking various online courses on topics like ML, which I now know I do not enjoy whatsoever after just completing an internship in ML). I read on another post that Cloud Engineers need 20% of the programming knowledge of devs, but I have 20-30% more knowledge than my peers who want dev roles... 

So I guess I’m asking 2 questions:

A: are there OO programming intensive roles for DevOps people, and if so are there the same opportunities in cloud computing specifically?

B: With someone very skilled with Java/python (from algos and data structures to design patterns) and with okay skill in C++ (only used in school context), is the only solid entry level path with these skills as a backend web dev, or Android development? Or desktop applications if I know C++? That doesn’t feel like “specialized,” if it’s what everyone and their mother does immediately out of college... I know that might be ignorant, but that’s why I’m asking, I want to know."

I've started the internship thinking that it will be the best thing that ever happens to me and I'll finally be able to do what I love and earn decent amount of money. However, after few weeks of being here I realised that it might not be what I want to do. I struggle to go work daily because sitting 8 hours in an office really bores me. I'm given some simple python project just to make it easier for the team because they don't know or don't like to do them. I've already written 3 scripts and some documentations and other days I just sat at my desk doing nothing because they didnt have any tasks for me. 

I dream of travelling and constantly working on something creative, thinking of new ideas etc. And this job just bores me. I know that computer science has many different fields but I'm kind off lost and I'm not sure what I want to do.

What are some areas that I could really delve into and see if they are potential strengths of mine? I would like to experience as many different aspects of the start up in this early stage as I can so I can recognize what my strengths are so I can double down on those areas.

Cheers!"

Hi everyone, so after my current internship experience, I've had quite a blast exploring the world of embedded development and I was graciously provided an Explorer 16/32 Development Kit with a PIC24 line PIM and a couple modules to program with during my time there, but that will soon be coming to an end. I've already dabbled around with Arduinos a lot, but I find that the amount of resources out there are too abstract and high level (plentiful libraries of plug-and-chug functions). Its convenient, yes, but its unrealistic of what real-embedded development consists of most of the time and I want to prepare myself for that. I'm currently reading through O'Reilly's ""Making Embedded Systems"" and really finding it helpful.

&gt; ***My Question***

**I want to continue my development on something a bit more small scale (still affordable) for my own curiosity and educational sake.** **I am more familiar with Microchip products so comfortability, I would lean more towards that.** But as an Embedded software developer, I know it is preferable and necessary to be open to new platforms from whoever it may come from, so long as the documentation is provided. **Please drop some dev boards and microcontrollers or any useful books if you know any.**"

I was a sophomore at a top 5 school studying chemistry, but I wasn't happy with my major and wanted to study CS instead. After many talks with my dean, he convinced me that a leave of absence was the optimal solution for giving me the maximum amount of semesters left to finish a CS degree comfortably. 

So far, the decision has turned out well. I left school in March, and since then I've

1. Finished an intro CS class online
2. Applied to a hundred internships before getting an offer to work as a data science intern this summer. The internship was an amazing experience, and although it wasn't exactly SWE, I got lots of experience writing code, training ML algorithms, deploying actual production level solutions for the company, git, etc, and also advanced statistics stuff as well.
3. I finished one personal project with an Arduino, and I'm currently working on two Web Dev projects which have been lots of fun. 
4. Finished an algorithms series and have started leetcoding as well. 

My plan was to return to school this semester and hit the ground running interviewing for summer 2020 positions, especially because we have an amazing career services center. However, my dean notified me two weeks ago that my college may require me to take an extra semester off if they deem me unfit to return this semester; in his experience, my chances are 50/50. The decision will come out this Tuesday, but until then, I wanted to prepare for the worst case scenario. 

To prepare, I started applying for many SWE fall intern positions in my hometown, and I got an offer with American Airlines yesterday. I have 10 days to decide, so if on Tuesday my college tells me I can't return, I will take that offer. But I am worried that although I am working with real internships during my time off, companies, especially big N, will look down on my leaves of absence if they see my transcript. 

Additionally, I was looking to apply to the Big N fresh/soph internships like Google EP or Microsoft Explore, because I would've technically still been a sophomore this fall by graduation year. I felt that with all the work I had done, I had decent chances to get one of those. However, to apply to those you have to be currently enrolled in school and you must have taken or be concurrently taking 1-2 CS classes, and I haven't taken any formal classes which are on my transcript. So it seems that delaying my return to school would destroy my chances of getting those offers. How strict are these requirements for Big N sophomore internships? 

So basically, how fucked am I if I can't return to school this fall and have to take the fall internship? I'm really worried about this. Thanks a bunch, this subreddit has been incredibly useful for me."

I’ve submitted about 500 online applications in the past few months, but I haven’t gotten any job offers. I’ve interviewed at 3 places, but each time I’ve been told after the interview that there are actually no positions available and they’ll let me know if one opens up.

I just finished my (second) unpaid internship and I’m running out of savings to live off of. I think I can last another month, then I won’t be able to pay rent anymore. I don’t have any family I can move in with. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 28 and I feel like I should’ve been able to get a real salaried job by now. I can’t help but feel worthless since no employer thinks I’m worth hiring. 

All of my friends have professional jobs with living wages and they tell me it shouldn’t be that hard to get a job with my degree and skillset. It seems like they have it so easy - many of them are younger than me, work from home (doing nothing) 2+ days per week, and earn 6 figures. I just don’t know why I’m struggling so much.

I’m frustrated that I’ve been working my butt off for nothing. What was the point of throwing away tens of thousands of dollars and wasting 10 years to get a degree that’s proven to be useless? What’s the point of working for free as an intern if the experience won’t help me get a job somewhere? The internship was actually advertised as a paid internship when I applied, but after I accepted the role, I was informed that it was actually unpaid and that there was a mistake in the job posting.

Every day I wake up wanting to kill myself. I feel worthless, I have no purpose, and I no longer find joy in life. I don’t know how much longer I can afford to live. I have $15k in credit card debt in addition to $30k in student loans. I feel crushed and there’s no light at the end of the tunnel."

I'm 22, and I've been working in my industry for just one year.

After getting my degree, I moved to the capital of my country, where I had an internship lined up assisting a production coordinator at a very well-respected production company. Basically, soon after I started my internship the person I was assisting left on maternity leave, and I was pretty much left to my own devices for a few months. I ended up getting the hang of things pretty well and by the time she returned (some 5ish months into the internship) a couple people in other sister companies had taken note of my good performance so I got two offers to move up.

Offer A was by the CEO of one of the sister companies (an film animation company), who wanted me to assist him because his workload was getting a bit much. Then offer B was from the managing director of a second sister company (film distribution) who told me he was leaving the company to direct another, new one. He wanted me to be his right hand and the coordinator at the new company. I took offer B and left the company I interned for.

Fast forward 8 months into my new position and although I'm really happy with what I'm doing and how much I'm learning, there have been a couple of let downs so far, including a 30% raise I was meant to get at the 6 month mark which fell through because although my performance was very good, the company hadn't made the return my boss had hoped, so he couldn't justify giving me the raise he had promised me to the investors.

I've kept in touch with the guy from offer B and we are good friends. He got someone to assist him after I declined their offer, but now he's thinking of starting an additional company (a new distribution company) and have be me the managing director, this all would go down in March-ish next year. Let's call this offer C.

Now, me being 22 I am super grateful to be having such quick career progression, and I definitely wouldn't turn down offer C just because of self doubt, but man am I nervous about making such a huge jump. I have managed people in school productions and such and I'm good at interpersonal relationships but I've never been someone's boss in the long or even medium term, so I'm scared about how I would do.

I suppose what I want advice on is how I can use the time I have until march to prepare for the new role, and also just how not to let my insecurities get in the way of things.


TL;DR I'm 22. Did very well in an internship so I got offered two different positions. The one I declined (but which I have kept in contact with and remain friends) has come back with an offer to make me managing director of a new company. I will definitely take it, but I'm at a loss as to how to make sure I fit the bill and get prepared."

I looking for some advice on career path based on my current situation and would love to hear y’alls opinions. 
 
Some background info on me: 
- Mechanical Engineer (BSME 2017, 3.3 GPA)
- EIT certified
- Project Engr internship for computer company
- 1 year - Eng Test Tech II for semiconductor
- 7mo (current) ME for Machine shop / sheet metal company (semiconductor industry)

Basically I am not satisified at my current workplace due to 3 main factors (payscale, management ping pong emergency decisions, and upward advancement) and I would like advice for paths going forward.

1.  Current payscale is below average by 10k for my exp. My boss wants to hire two more MEs and have them report to me, he bumped my pay by 2.5% but im still underpaid on average by 10k based on my exp and thats for my good work over 6mo and i doubt they’d bump for managing two other MEs (My college associate with similar exp is getting 80k a yr so bit of envy there).

2. Currently my boss is a nice guy and has quite a bit of experience however he is very deadset negative guy when it comes to projects and company outlook, ans its hard to keep motivated whenever he brings up all the negatives (i see it as we move at the company’s speed and if they change things we’ll follow suit, and just deal with it and show them to the best of our ability the time &amp; money savings of future planning).  

3. I want to learn more but the projects here are a bit too soft, design load test fixtures, vacuum leak fixtures, cost analysis on processes, solidworks design.  I just feel a lack of challenge.  I’m thinking about other certifications such as PE and Lean Six Sigma certs outside of work but im not sure.

Just looking for some advice on what I should do, I would like to get into Aerospace becuase I love space.  Not sure if PE is worth the study and $.   I wouldnt mind volunteering to work under a PE for study projects wise if thats even a thing.

So ye need some general guidance so I can move forward looking at other jobs.

But I'm running out of time (money) and am feeling like I should just take whatever I can get at this point. I know I probably have a better chance with iOS postings given my prior experience.

So, as per the title, is it hard to ""get out"" of iOS dev if that's where most of your experience is? I would love to hear from other iOS devs out there. I enjoy back-end work the most and hope to end up there eventually- and I'd be happy to do full-stack iOS- but I don't want to sink 1-2 years into something I'm not terribly passionate about if it means I'll have to basically do this whole ""first job search"" all over again. 

For the record, I'm pretty language-agnostic and I feel that a good programmer should be able to pick up new languages pretty easily (depending on the context). I understand experience is extremely important but I'm sometimes disappointed by the lack of flexibility a lot of companies show in their hiring practices.

And currently, I am leaning towards becoming a front end developer since that's the only experience I have and it has the highest chance of landing me a good job. But I can not help asking myself if that is something I want to do for rest of my life? I am slightly worried that once I get a full time job as a front end dev, I will be stuck with that line of job forever. And it will be extremely difficult for me to try other type of software engineering.

So for example, if I have a 5 years of experience as an mobile app dev, I am not gonna suddenly switch to becoming a Unity developer. Whenever I talk to my other friends doing completely different stuffs like firmware development or game development I feel like there is so much more in programming industry and I should go out and explore. But with experience and skills I have right now, it seems unlikely I will get a job as any other programming position beside front end development.

It also does not help when all my friends have generally a pessimistic view towards front end development, saying it will soon be automated. And that the market will be saturated with people who finished basic boots camp. Telling me that taking almost 5 years of intensive computer engineering/science courses and becoming a front end dev is wasteful.

At this point, I really don't know what to do. I have to start looking for a job soon and make my mind up. My biggest fear is that I will just reluctantly chose a career path I do not truly enjoy and end up their for rest of my life.

creri7,4,2019-08-16,How to get the most out of leetcoding,spaghettithottie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/creri7/how_to_get_the_most_out_of_leetcoding/,"Hello CSCQ,

I’m currently applying for internships for summer 2020 as an incoming junior and I’m currently finishing up my internship for this summer. I feel like I don’t have an issue getting interviews, it’s just that passing them can be pretty tricky. Probably imposter syndrome but I feel like I got my current internship out of sheer luck (they hired me 2 days before their hiring deadline since the original candidate went to accept a FT offer elsewhere).

Everyone in this thread seems to imply that lots of leetcode —&gt; job offers, although I feel like I’m not getting the most out of my time leetcoding. When it comes to problems you get stuck on, what are your approaches? Do you spend a large amount of time (quite unrealistic in a real interview) and eventually get it or do you look over the solution and try apply it yourself? What do your thought processes in leetcode vs. the real interview look like?

Would love to hear your strategies on mastering technical interviewing!"
crfgrh,3,2019-08-16,Asking for a raise with an offer from another job?,javia1492,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/crfgrh/asking_for_a_raise_with_an_offer_from_another_job/,"So I've been at my current job for alittle over 2 years now. I have 1.5 years of prior experience and as well as my Bachelors Degree and Master's degree, and roughly \~2 years of part-time internship at a national laboratory doing semi-relevant work. When I first started my current job, I had just complete my Master's degree and was in a rush to work so I took the first offer they gave me and within a year realized I lowballed myself as i got the bare minimum they pay. Since then i've only received 2 annual raises which are the standard 1.5% inflation raise so my salary hasnt moved much (\~3k). I've ran some numbers using the GlassDoor salary estimator and a few other sites and the rough numbers im getting point to me being about 15% below median market value...which sucks.

Now, I have a monthly 1 on 1 with my manager and I the next one is coming up on August 23rd and I wanted to ask about my current position and the different levels I can climb as well as an adjustment to my current compensation. Likewise, a few months ago I interviewed with another company and they want to extend an offer to me (not sure what number yet, but being that the position is 2 levels higher and I asked for almost double what I make now, i'll probably get somewhere around 35k+ from the offer). I dont want to use this as an ultimatum, but I was wondering if I can use this on the off chance my boss rejects my request for compensation adjustment?

&amp;#x200B;

Some more facts:

I live in NY. The other job offer is in San Diego so I expect it to be much more since the cost of living is much higher, but its still pretty expensive in NY.

I work as an ASIC Design Engineer (sort of like a computer engineer....).

My base salary starting was around 65k and I'm at 68.5k now. Total compensation including stock+bonus puts me around 72k-73k but I never include stock/bonus as they're not reliable/consistent.

I got my bachelors in Electrical Engineering and my masters in Computer Engineering.

My previous job was a firmware engineer where I made roughly 63k. I worked for 1.5 years after my bachelors before going back for my masters.

My company HQ is in Arizona and it seems their pay-scale is based on that as well.

I have a rough idea of what the pay brackets in my company are and unfortunately its not very good as I want to ask for 15% adjustment, but I think that would require 2 promotions from Design Engineer 1 -&gt; Senior Design Engineer and I dont think they'll do that. However, the other job offer is for a Senior Design Engineer so that could be good leverage?

&amp;#x200B;

I always thought I'd be confident when asking for a raise, but now that its getting closer I dont know. I think I'm more afraid of being rejected as it will make me think that they dont value me and my work enough to warrant giving me a raise even though I know i've done very good work for them thus far and have had lots of positive feedback and have taken on more responsibility and larger design tasks so...yea. Any suggestions/advice would be much appreciated."

I just happened to be wondering all of this when everyone else is asking about them too.

I'm a computer science student going into my junior year, and I want to start applying to CS internships this semester, but I want to make my expectations realistic.

**What are my chances of getting an internship?**
I've gotten through CS1 and OOP and stuff, but I only have about 4 Arduino projects on my GitHub and haven't had an *actual* job before. I do have certifications for plenty of Adobe and Microsoft office programs, a decent number of volunteer hours, currently Dean's list, and graduated #10 in hs, but that's all I have. My GPA is about a 3.0. I'm definitely passionate about CS and most people who talk to me can tell. **I guess what I'm saying is: I'm not sure how I compare to other applicants, am I ahead or behind?** I can't help but feel like I'm behind, but idk if that's just imposter syndrome. **What can I do to make myself a more viable applicant? How many typically get the job?**

And secondly, what should I be expecting? I'd *prefer* to be in a paid internship if possible, but I assume my probably-lackluster resume won't help with that. **Are the internships often paid, or are paid positions usually saved for those far ahead of the rest?

What are some opinions on Chicago's tech scene and internship quality for software engineering? Some might say to go check out r/chicago, but I'm curious to know what people from this subreddit think since I've been lurking around here for about 2 months and have seen some great advice.

I already know about the presence of low-latency HFT firms that are good gigs, but also curious to hear about unique startups people have heard good things about as well as Big N opportunities (I know not much of Big N around Chicago).

Additionally, I'd love to hear some advice about working in Chicago as a software engineer. I have no desire to go to SF/SV or NYC or really any other city to work as of right now, and I don't see that changing. My family is in Chicago, I want to live here permanently, and I highly value my time with them. Would this have a stifling result on my career prospects or ability to develop skills? Also interested in thoughts about UofC, Northwestern, or UofI(UC) CS PhD programs if anybody has experience with those (might be interested in pursuing an AI/ML career)."

I am among the top ten coders in my college and refuse to apply for internships that don't have defined roles (a more, *we'll see about what project you'll work on when you show up for the internship*, kind of attitude) or that are in non-product companies (investment banks, services, etc), So far, I have applied for internships at two well-known companies, but didn't manage to clear the first rounds of either because I either freaked out too much and couldn't think clearly, or some random luck-based factor. I'm the only one in my year who's so adamant about getting a developer internship or nothing at all but when I see my friends getting hired in (mostly) investment banks or services companies, I can get a little dejected. 

Is my adamance reasonable? Does it even matter what work I do during the internship, if it's in a 'brand name' non-product company? I'm still of the opinion that what you learn and the work you do is of paramount importance, (and since I want to work as a developer, I am more focused on developer roles in product companies), but I don't know what to think anymore.

Context : Canada, small scale up, first post uni gig. 2+ years. 

Tldr below. 

I had a long week leading up to a deadline, busting tail to finish, all the while cleaning up after others in the process. With everyone senior to me left predisposed, I was left with very junior members and a college intern to carry out a 6 week project to delivery. 

During celebratory drinks after, I found out that the intern I was mentoring was offered to stay for more than what I make. By a lot. Tax bracket a lot. 

I first thought : ""well the offer probably adjusted for him having to leave school unfinished."" 

But for obvious reasons, I started to ponder my worth as a working professional with experience and key knowledge at the company. 

I was angry. I'm constantly left with few resources and time to finish my own work, while also stepping above and beyond to help others. I have done stellar work for this company for 2 years, and have their testimony to prove it. To make matters worse, I've constantly covered for the intern and let him put his name on pull requests to not deflate his confidence and encourage his work.

It was a big blow to the ego to find out all this, and I'm considering making drastic changes come Monday. I just can't imagine what it would be like if the intern decided to stay.

I came home and wrote a resignation letter immediately. Come Monday, I don't know if I'll give it to them or not.

I have other grievances about work life balance and resourcing with the company. I feel like this is the last straw, and I'm considering unemployment to play hardball + find other jobs.

Thoughts?

Tldr: work super hard, cover for/lead others, find out intern was offered more than what I earn. Thinking of playing hardball and quitting straight up Monday."

Had a lot of ups and downs recently with school, but apparently I got a position to TA for a statistics course at my uni(highkey wanted to TA a computer science class but got rejected 3 terms in a row .\_.).  Coincidentally, I also passed an interview for a software development part-time job within a medical research group at my uni (totally thought I wasn't qualified for it based off the interview tbh)and now I'm not sure which one to do...

&amp;#x200B;

Don't think I'm good enough to juggle both jobs while taking classes, but these are both opportunities that I never got no matter how hard I tried in freshman year...(literally took an effort to volunteer for something that didn't even end up being technical fml) The thing is, I really want to take on both positions, and I want to believe that I can do both, but I don't think its realistically possible for me... 

Now, I have not secured an internship for my winter term(jobs have barely been posted on school co-op for the winter term lmao), so I guess my question to this subreddit is... if I want to have a nice internship lined up for the winter/summer... which path should I take? Currently, my end goal is to have a career in SWE/DS, but I think its way too early for me to say...

I'm having a number of struggles here.

&amp;#x200B;

I got hired as a .NET and c# intern developer without any experience in either (I know Java and SQL pretty much, thanks school) and I'm working with one other remote-worker on it. The issue is, this worker is meant to be my mentor and someone, as my manager puts it, should be who I'm contacting every time I have trouble. The thing is, my mentor has not been available for weeks. For the past however many weeks my mentor is either working across country in a timezone 12 hours ahead or as of now, on a 2 week vacation. I'm getting task after task assigned to me and I feel incredibly behind on everything because I'm lost and have such a limited communication with my mentor. She's nice and understanding, and even checks her email each night on vacation just for me, but there's only so much I can include in my once-a-day emails that I need help with. There's one other software engineer near me in my department, but this dude seems to hate me, and has either blatantly not responded to my messages or appears extremely annoyed when I come up to ask for help and usually makes some snide remark. Hell, even when he is helping me he'll constantly, and awkwardly, include some remark like 'Oh, they don't teach you git repositories in school? Really?' or if I do something wrong some rhetorical 'Oh? Why'd you do THAT? Why did you think THAT would work?'

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, even other workers in other departments will sometimes approach me to add a feature to our .net site and so far, without fail, every time this has happened will include some 'Well, a REAL software engineer could get this done in an hour, but you'll do I guess...' or 'This shouldn't take more than 20 minutes... But I'm stuck with a student worker'...

&amp;#x200B;

One final thing, I had a chance to speak with my manager during a meeting about the tasks I'm assigned. He's always been a real cool guy, but time during the meeting he just seemed so agitated. I told him the tasks I had and he was just so agitated about the fact they were assigned to me about 2 weeks ago, but I really had trouble answering his whole ' tell me the problem and give me a plan of attack'  to 20+ problems I had going on, a majority of which I truly did not have information for. Now I always liked this manager, but while I was struggling to figure out what my assigned task by a worker literally titled 'resolve error' was about, the dude flat out laughed at my struggling to come up with an answer about what 'resolve error' meant. He even said 'it's funny you don't know what's assigned to you'. The guy even was on his phone on goddamn facebook for more than half the time I'm presenting the progress I've made on the tasks I was assigned. By the end of the meeting he was nearly yelling at me that I need to be calling and emailing and spending every moment working to make up for my absent mentor. Edit: Mentor and I are the only 2 people working on this specific site. Since mentor is gone and has been gone for so many weeks it is my 'test'. I am horridly lost. I'm also helping Software Engineer 1 who seems to hate me with his other site, but again he seems to really not like me nor like my help

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like everyday I get some issue that I start working on, then more are assigned, and I get lost as all hell. One day software engineer 1 will tell me to spend my time working on this, then some new issue comes along I have to work on, then software engineer 2 says he needs this done within an hour, gives a snide remark when it takes me 1.5 hour, and on and on and I get lost as all hell. Am I just a bad intern here? I'm getting desperately behind on my tasks, almost everyone except my absent mentor and cube mate are hostile as all hell and I've considered looking at applying to different companies."

I'm incredibly anxious about finding a job. I think I just need advice on what I should do to be more employable. 

I live in Chicago and I'm studying to be a front-end developer. I have an ok grasp of HTML, CSS, JS, and Java, but I wouldn't consider myself good. I understand the fundamentals but haven't progressed to OOP, Data Structures, REST, GIT, space/time complexity, etc. I have no internships or projects. 

All the companies in Chicago seem to want someone skilled in .NET, which I've never touched or heard of. Even after I graduate, I dont feel like I'll be qualified until I grind all the medium leetcode problems, read CTCI, get good at a framework, and build a web application.

crnixy,8,2019-08-17,Don't lose hope,writequit,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/crnixy/dont_lose_hope/,"I graduated from my university way back and wanted to share my experience and the journey I went through in order to give hope and show incoming/current students that they aren't alone. This is lengthy but hopefully helpful.

**Background**

Simply, I am pretty dumb and not naturally smart. But I am hardworking (which I think every person possesses, including you).

Lastly, I had very minimal programming experience. I did take a command-line course but other than that nothing programming related.

**First Year**

One thing about college (and life in general) is that it's all about figuring yourself out. I spent most of my first year trying to be like the smart students in the class. I thought I was naturally smart (little did I know...) and didn't need to pay attention in class. This was terrible thinking because I was missing out on learning and solidifying the basic concepts which the upper-division courses built upon. The other thing was that some of these concepts were very basic and straightforward so I wasn't doing bad. But these bad habits carried over to my second year where things got even harder.

**Second Year**

I had built no passion for Computer Science and because of this I put minimum to no effort in the classes. This definitely didn't help in my second year. I was already struggling at the start of my second year. This just further blew my confidence and I would just rely on my peers. Because I was nice, they were willing to help me out and I barely scraped by but learned absolutely nothing. Some of the work was project-based so I ended up passing because my peers would do all the work. I ended my 2nd year on a really bad note by failing Algorithms which made me lose hope that I was meant to be a developer. I was also about to be kicked out of school because my GPA had fallen really low.

**Lucky Internship**

Luckily I  got an internship (only because of connections) following my second year. I didn't deserve this internship at all but somehow I was here. I got more out of the company than they did from me. I made a mentor there who was extremely patient and kind. I owe everything to this mentor to show me how Software Engineering is not as overwhelming as I thought. He realized most of my flaws pretty early on and suggested the following.

* Get a Mac (Or a PC with Linux). My environment was playing a huge toll on my classes. I'd spend a majority of my time setting up my environment and fall super behind on my courses (I had a Windows back then and doing C programming is not the friendliest on it...).
* Stay away from IDE's. I depended on my IDE to automatically do a lot of things (especially for Java).
* Accept you are different. You may have to spend more time understanding things and that is okay. Not everyone is naturally smart.

Now you may not face all the issues I had but the idea is the same, face them and correct them for the better of your future.

I invested in a Mac (No regrets whatsoever. Not an Apple fan or anything but this machine has a stable version of Unix that I think everyone should use when learning programming :)).

I got rid of my IDE's and began using Sublime Text and Terminal (though now I have switched over to VSCode). This was a huge deal breaker actually. I began spending hours debugging at first which sucked but I learned a ton about the syntax and how the code executed.

And lastly, I gave up my thought process of being smart. I accepted I was dumb (still am) so that I always strive to learn and work hard. I began to build a passion for Computer Science to motivate this even more.

**Third Year**

I was super nervous going into my third year, especially with the mark on my back that I could be kicked out. But I reinforced and reminded myself that this year was going to be different. I was going to use everything I learned from my mentor and all the reflection I had done and do my best.

At first, it was a little rocky but as the session went by, I got more comfortable and confident. I worked immensely hard and put in several hours (and though this was hard at first, this eventually became normal). The most important of them all is that I wrote code how I thought it would work best. I didn't overthink it or get overwhelmed. These coding assignments, after all, are puzzles that can be solved so many different ways.

After my first session, I had scored all A's. I couldn't have been any happier. I had goosebumps literally everywhere but also a sense of doubt that I may have been lucky.

My next session went the same way but I thought again that I may have just taken easier courses and hence why I did well. To prove to myself that I was doing better, I took one of the hardest courses at my school. I was so confident and started early on the projects as well so I didn't panic or fall behind. And lo and behold, I passed with a really high grade! Looking back at it, it wasn't the grade that I was after. I just wanted to know I was passionate about computer science and that I was capable of doing it.

**Conclusion**

I won't bother the details with my fourth year, but it went well and I went on to work at a company (whole different story and journey at the company but for a later time :)).

But a message to all that are lost, alone, and hopeless:

* Reflect on yourself. Try to figure out the different issues you face and talk to a mentor or someone experienced to help solve them.
* Build a passion for Computer Science. This is key to motivating yourself to work hard and spend those extra hours. If you truly don't love Computer Science, then go do what you love! What's the point of doing something when you feel miserable doing it?
* The changes I made might not be the same issues you have but that is something for you to figure out and address soon so you have an excellent and even better career than mine.
* Work hard and practice, practice, practice! The story may seem like all this worked out flawlessly but there was A LOT of time and hard work put in that people sometimes don't talk about.

Thanks everyone for reading, I hope this helps someone out there and give you hope. I am willing to help in the comments (and hopefully there are others that can provide their insight) and even privately (you can PM me). If you have any other insight, do comment as well!"

It has not been the best environment for me to be in mentally so I am wanting to transfer to another UC closer to home. Goal UC is UCLA, but also want to be chanced for UCB(old dream school) and UCSB(I was admitted in high school already). Considering applying to USC so based on info if can chance me here too would be much appreciated.

3. ****NEED ADVICE HERE*** Educational Opportunities: I wanted to take a bold approach by talking about bare minimums I take advantage of like going into office hours to create relationships with my professors being that lectures are 300 people big; how I force myself to sit in the front and raise my hand even though I’m extremely shy; going to the free writing center at our library to talk through essay ideas and logistics—— these are all things anyone can do but my point is to show not everyone does them out of fright or pure disregard of their existence. I wanna show I’m “sucking the marrow” out of college education experiences. 
4. School a better place : I’m did a ten-page research assignment on this for English regarding middle eastern representation (the documentary was a part of this assignment) that I intend to publish soon and discuss with my college Provost [principal] and will discuss how I have been trying to get a middle eastern studies program apart of the GE accepted courses for the humanities breadth.

I am formally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, but I did not disclose this to my employer's human resources department at any point before or during the internship. At the time, I did not expect it to have any effect on my performance at the company.

Unfortunately, the internship did not go well. In my final performance evaluation yesterday, my lead told me that my technical skills were adequate, but that I lacked basic social skills, like using a ""polite tone"" in my in-person and electronic communications, and making small talk with teammates. I was then told that for these reasons I would not be receiving a return offer and had to leave the office.

I was fairly blind-sighted by this. Although I knew that I had made some social mistakes, I did follow up on them during my one-on-one meetings and I didn't think that they were severe enough to warrant no return offer.

I still like the company I interned with, and I feel that I was a valuable and effective employee. Had I disclosed my condition, maybe my team would have been more willing to work with me to overcome my interpersonal challenges.

I would love to be reconsidered for full-time employment. I am now considering reaching out to my recruiter at the company and disclosing this to her. At the very least, I feel that my team and company knowing this would help them to be more sensitive regarding employees on the autism spectrum in the future. I know that I have very little to lose with this company at this point, but I also do not want to come across to them as desperate or manipulative.

Should I go for it?"

So I'm a recent graduate (May 2019) in mechanical engineering from Rutgers. I have had 2 internships (1 my junior year and 1 my senior year) both in the MEP consulting industry. They were both at different really small (10-30 ppl) consulting services firms. I really enjoyed my time with the people there, but did not enjoy the work most of the time. They offered me a spot there after graduation but I told them I wanted to explore more opportunities in the world at bigger firms. Now that I have graduated, I am searching for a new job basically anywhere on the East Coast in either mechanical engineering or as a financial analyst since I am passionate about finance and want to get into it. The problem is that after 3 months and 100s of applications sent, I have not received an interview yet. Recently, I was contacted by a recruiter from another MEP consulting firm near me saying he likes my resume and wants to discuss career opportunities. I am almost close to giving up my search for a different industry job and thinking about just taking this MEP job for a while until I can get a better one since I have to start paying off my student loan debt starting January 2020. 

I would really appreciate any sort of advice you guys can give me regarding this matter.

Nothing wrong with my resume, I've had it checked by the head of the career center of my uni.

For context, I am an international student at a US college and a sophomore. I've had 1 internship which mainly involved programming, but not software dev. Fairly decent projects (3 in total), good LinkedIn, good GitHub. 

Are my rejections mainly because I'm a rising sophomore and they want juniors? I could do a SWE internship in my country, will this make me a much more competitive applicant for next year?

I interned at a company this summer as a Data Science Intern. It's a fairly big company, ~6 yrs old and in 15+ countries. HQ in my country, that's where I interned.

Work was awesome, interesting, new. Team was the best, welcoming people and my mentor would actually jump on the chance to teach me something. Perhaps he was the kinda guy who loves teaching. And he was patient with me too.

I wasn't bad either, I successfully completed my project and received a very good rating from my mentor, manager and other team members.

On the last day the two senior guys (one being my mentor) on the team literally said they'll push for offering me a Full Time position.

Also on the last day the HR told us interns (from my college, we were 6 total, in different teams) that they'll tell us the final results of the Full Time offer when they visit our college for on-campus hiring.

Well, exactly a month later now, they are here at my college, but we have not received any Full Time offers as of yet.

Its a long weekend so the HR isn't responding to my email. I'm gonna try to get in touch with my mentors now since I was fairly close to them and then the HR on Monday.

Thing is, during the whole internship we were basically told that the conversion rate from intern to FTE is pretty high, and I was specially reassured since I'm from a Tier-1 top tech college in my country, and it seemed like my team genuinely wanted me for my skills. They are, or at least seemed like, good people.

I worked hard on my project thus sacrificing my time to practice Leetcode for the Campus Hiring season going on right now, since I was sure I was gonna get a FTE offer, I mean, the new FTEs who joined in the middle of my internship were also ex-interns ffs.

But now I'm kinda lost, and very broken. Gonna start applying for jobs on campus with probably below average Leetcode skills, while also handling the pressure of completing my Final Year B.Tech project.

I mean, I understand, I was stupid to trust a company like this.

I'll probably disappoint my parents as well, I hope I can find another job before this Hiring Season ends so I don't have to be a financial drain on them even after graduating. Even if they're well off, they're always so nice and this kills me. I wanted to be the one to take care of them.

Please learn from my mistakes and don't put all your eggs in one basket. They'll make you think it's perfectly ok to do so, it's safe. But it's not.

I always thought I was good at risk management, but I'm not I guess.

One thing everyone always said was that the HR is pretty bad here, but I don't even have the energy to play the blame game after going through the stress of waiting for a month.

I'll just go to sleep now, or watch a TV show I like, cuz I'm drained, thank you if you read all this."

Had a lot of ups and downs recently with school, but apparently I got a position to TA for a statistics course at my uni(highkey wanted to TA a computer science course but got rejected 3 terms in a row ._. ).

Don't think I'm good enough to juggle both jobs while taking classes, but these are both opportunities that I never got no matter how hard I tried in freshman year...(literally took an effort to volunteer for something that didn't even end up being technical fml) The thing is, I really want to take on both positions, and I want to believe that I can do both, but I don't think its realistically possible for me...

I've never had a girlfriend. Haven't made regular friends since middle school. My family is really caring but they want me to be someone I don't want to be. The only reason I go on with it is because I don't have any life project to oppose. I have been able to continue college so far but I don't care enough to work. I am in computer science yet I am barely able to code. I have spend an entire internship watching YouTube and Hentai (yes, both at work) and now I have to make a 50 pages long report, due in four days (I already did a small part though). Of course I don't do sport and I don't have any hobby.

It's not like something happened to me or anything. I just feel like I have less and less lifeforce. I don't look forward to anything or not enough to actually make efforts, and I am always procrastinating on every single thing to do.

Today was the first time I really considered committing suicide. I have Tor and a VPN so I may use it in the next few days to go to the dark web and find a way to do it, because I heard you can have that kind of stuff in this part of Internet."

In all honesty, my job mostly entails fucking around on Tableau and Excel all day with the occasional VBA and SQL. It can be fun at times and days go by fairly quickly, but mostly my work seems tedious and inconsequential. Furthermore, my office is ugly and in the middle of the suburbs, the pay is okay but not great, and our company is a sea of boring, middle aged, low energy white folks who never shut up about their kids. It all seems like a major downgrade from my last internship (AM) where I was in a beautiful downtown office tower, was paid well by intern standards, and was surrounded by ambitious, energetic young people. I have one summer left before I graduate in order to course-correct, but I'm kind of worried that my shift to FP&amp;A will show I'm not on the right path for the careers I really want (equity research, ECM/DCM)."

crubfn,0,2019-08-17,Torn between two career paths? IT in financial industry vs Big Tech on the West Coast,douggie1239,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/crubfn/torn_between_two_career_paths_it_in_financial/,"Hey guys, I'm looking for advice (throwaway for privacy). Sorry for the long post.

tl;dr: already have nice cushy internship with systems department in massive top 3 US insurance company 20 mins from my house where I get to work+get paid year-round and probably have job lined up. Want to get an internship with a big tech company in silicon valley/West Coast instead. Is it worth giving up what I have already?

&amp;#x200B;

Long version:

I need serious advice. I want to do something that might alter my career path very drastically, and I don't want it to be a stupid action that ruins my career. If I'm going to do it then it needs to make sense.

I'm about to be a junior in college. I have an internship right now and It pays decent, it's with one of the top 3 largest insurance companies in the US, very very big company. I'm in their systems department doing java/javascript dev work on CRUD apps and the occasional weird-ass proprietary language (that runs on the JVM) specific to some vendor product. I'll be doing some better work with Angular and REST APIs soon along with doing more customer-facing webapp stuff.

I am in a year-round co-op (they let me work remotely from my school or just go to their buildings near my school) and have been for years, it's basically a part time job all school year and I get to intern full-time during the summers. It's 20 minutes from my house in good traffic and the company and it has a pension plan. Perfect work-life balance.

Cons: tech stack is old as all hell, little opportunity for career advancement so you'll probably just end up being a jaded old senior dev waiting until he can retire with his pension or somehow get more money elsewhere (tons of mobility within the company though but you're pretty much screwed if you want to work in the tech industry).

I really want to be able to get a high-paying big tech job where I'm excited to go to work. If I stay where I am, I'll be that jaded senior dev.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if it would be worth it to leave my current internship where I believe I have a job waiting for me if I keep giving this internship my all like I am right now (most of the people older than me that I used to intern with have jobs now). 

I'm going to apply to a bunch of big tech companies on the West Coast this semester. Below are the ones I'm applying to so far. I think I have a shot because I have 1 good personal project and I'm chugging along to get another 1 or 2 done before applications come out, 2 collective years' worth (i.e. I've been working year-round since Freshman year started and I'm a junior now) of industry experience, and I'm cramming the coursera algorithms/data structures and doing leetcodes/CTCI like mad.

&amp;#x200B;

If I get an offer (probably won't, but let's say I do), would my current position where I'm interning at and getting paid year round by a big fortune 100 top 3 US insurance company with a pension be worth giving up for a big tech internship in the West? Is it worth it?

  
Here's companies I'm thinking of applying to and I have referrals to the Big Ns from people I used to work with in the past. If any of these aren't worth applying to over my current internship, I would be very grateful if you help point them out.

So I’m looking for a laptop that’ll last me a while. Here’s some of the things that I would like for it to be able to do:

**-Gaming:** I used to be active gamer (LoL, ffxiv, destiny, and a shit ton of mmorpg’s) but I’m in my last year of uni and am working an internship + job so I’ve taken a huge step back. I play every now and then and download a indie games from steam when I get the chance. And, I sometime hook up my ps4 for remote play when I don’t have access to a tv. I’d like something that can handle these things, and more if I decide to get back into gaming again. 

**-Video Editing:** I do a lot of editing on the side as a hobby and as a side gig. I use mostly sony vegas pro and after effects. I’d like something that’ll let me pre-render my work a bit faster  (especially if they’re open simultaneously). My current desktop is pretty old and half the time just to precompose or just pre render a section to check it out..

**-music editing/composing:** audacity, sibelius, museScore, Finale

**programming-** I do some coding and data manipulation, but not extremely so because I’m still learning (python, sql, r)

-be able to use **visualisation tools** like power BI, tableau, visio, dynamics. CRM softwares like dymanics

**-microsoft office programs**

**-adobe creative cloud:** photoshop, dreamwaver, after effects, etc

-my budget is around **$2500** , can be a bit more if the system will last me a long time. 

I’d prefer not to buy a Mac, unless you have a very good reason to (not super familiar with the os in general)

I’m sorry if this seems like a lot! It’s just that I’m trying to make this a worthwhile investment.

**Thank you for reading!**"
crv094,5,2019-08-17,I don’t know why I’m here.,misharost,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/crv094/i_dont_know_why_im_here/,"This year has been probably the shittiest year of all time. Honestly I’m not sure why I’m here, I’m alone and I feel lost and all by myself. I guess I should start back at the beginning of this year. I was with my ex of 5 years at the time, I had made the decision to move from Edmond to Tulsa for an internship for a missions organization. This was something we talked about and knew would be hard, yet the decision was made and I moved to Tulsa again to take on this new internship. Within 3 weeks of the internship I’m on the highway to visit my ex(girlfriend at the time) and a semi truck smashes into me on the highway. This put me in the hospital, destroyed my car, and I was not able to work for 4 months. While I had saved a lot of money up before I had gone to this internship, I was not getting any support and slowly my bank account drained as I was not able to get support because I wasn’t in the internship anymore and I was also not able to get a job. Through this my ex was patient with me and loved on me, but she would keep on telling me that I needed to move back.  Slowly but surely more nagging happened even though I told her I couldn’t because I couldn’t financially move there. She knew that but she would keep bugging me. Like I said I had dated this girl for 5 years, the first couple of years were wonderful and amazing. I’m not saying the last few years weren’t but it got harder. She would act so negative, she would criticize everyone I was friends with if they weren’t here friends. She would criticize people in my family. She had told me once that my brother in law would be abusive to my twin sister. She criticized me going to the gym and starting to improve my body, and she would criticize me for changing my hair or trying to hang with my buds. It always seemed that no matter what I did I was never good enough. I wanted so hard to please her and make her happy but I didn’t want to lose sight of myself. There were things that scared me sometimes. Her temper was terrible and she was known for throwing things, on 2 occasions she chose to hit me on the arm. I remember once we had an argument because I chose to put some coloring in my hair and she said people were asking if I was gay and I looked like a homo sexual. That night she threw her coffee in public on the sidewalk and started crying after I tried to reason with her. I remember looking at her and with a stern voice told her she needed to control her temper and that it was out of control, I also remember her looking at me and asking if I was going to hit her. I was so filled with anger and sadness that should would ever think I would lay a hand on her. For 5 years I tried so hard to love her with all my heart. For 5 years I payed for everything we did, I brought her to Florida with my family, I provided when I needed to for her. I tried to make sure that in everything I did I did the right thing to please her. Of course there were times I could have been better. There were times that sometimes I prioritized video games a little bit over her, but in seeing that I tried to work hard to change that. We messaged every day, I went to see her pretty much every day. If I failed she would get mad sometimes, sometimes she would get angry if I didn’t respond for a while. I know that relationships are a two way street, but I feel like I’m the reason the relationship ended. I remember telling her in May that we needed to break up. I remember 2 weeks later getting an email telling me she was glad I broke up with her, I remember her trying to reach out to me on LinkedIn. She told me that her family hated me, she told me that my church family back in Edmond hated me, and that everyone hated me and I was a monster. I remember snapping and going to the Jenks bridge and preparing myself to jump off and die. If I was truly a monster then I needed to not exists, this was my mindset. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital and was finally let out. Within being the the hospital I was diagnosed with major depressions and PTSD(military related). 
What they didn’t know and I didn’t know was I was bipolar. The anti depressants mixed with even more communication from my ex made me lose my mind. I remember seeing on her social media about being in a toxic relationship with a guy and just snapping. Was I really still a monster? Was all of this my fault? I drove to Edmond with a pistol in my car ready to go to the lake and dispose of myself in the water. As I drove I had no care for texting and driving and telling my family that they didn’t care about me....none of them had really bothered to try to understand my issues. They would tel me to suck it up and go on. My dad had even asked if I even had planned to kill myself. I sat in the woods crying, feeling like I had lost my mind for sure. I just couldn’t shoot myself, so I went back to Tulsa and was met by 3 police officers who took me back to the hospital. I spent another two weeks in the hospital and then was diagnosed bipolar rapid cycling. After I got out there was still some talk between me and her. I told her how much I loved her still and wished nothing but the best for her. I was responded yet again with hate and being told the same things. I was a monster, people hated me, she told me about how other guys were asking her out. This time I chose to walk away instead of break. At this point I was taking the proper medication I needed and I could think a little clearer.  At this point she plays a game where she blocks and unblocks me on Facebook. She looks through my Facebook stories to see what I am doing and what is sad.......is I can’t bring myself to block her or to change anything. It’s like I find comfort in knowing she is still there somewhat.  Present day: I’m doing better, I got a job and I’m rebuilding my life after all of the hospital bills, my settlement from the semi accident is about to come in, and I will be getting my own place soon with maybe a cute little dog. What’s sad is I can’t get over her. No matter how much hate she has shown me I still feel this pull to her and want the best for her. I still wish to marry her even though I know it may not be healthy for my mental sake.  I try to move on day by day, but I find myself just crying every day. The other night I just sat on the bridge in the dark and cried. Sometimes I just can’t help it,.......I don’t know what the future holds and honestly I’m so scared. I don’t think I will ever be able to love again. I’m not sure I want to love again. As each day goes, I just feel like I’m continuing to die inside. It’s been 6 months and it’s still hurts just as much as the day I had to do it. Not gonna lie I regret my decision even if it was a good one, because I miss my best friend. 

I’m not sure what to do anymore, often I believe I’ll snap again, except this time I will finally do what needs to be done and I’ll finally grant myself peace. Every day is a battle, I just want this battle to end. I’m tired, and I’m not sure how much longer I can keep walking. I just want to hold her again even though I know it’s wrong. I just want to be healed."

Miscellaneous Information: I’m also doing a Senior Capstone project that is rooted around the upcoming 2020 presidential election. As part of this project, I plan on going around my local community and giving various public speeches and talks informing people about politics and the election process 


What I’m Looking For in a College: 

Size: Small to medium (I don’t wanna get lost in a sea of faces, but I don’t wanna be 1 of 3 people in a class) 

Location: I don’t really care too much. I just don’t wanna go to school in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do on the weekend. 

Student Life: 
-I don’t want a super fratty school. I know I’m not going to join a frat, so I want to avoid schools that have their entire social scene based on whether or not your in a frat/sorority 

-I want to have things to do on the weekend like exploring a city, going to concerts, hanging around with friends, etc. 

-I want to go to a college where the dorms are nice. If the dorms are falling apart, outdated, small, or have other problems, I wanna steer clear of those. 

-Clubs are important to me; I want to go to a school that offer lots of clubs and that have plenty of student-run organizations (like a newspaper, student government, etc.) 

-Internship opportunities are extremely important to me. I want to go to a college where there are plenty of opportunities to intern at top notch companies, work with local political leaders, etc. 

-I want the opportunity to be able to study abroad 

-I want to avoid cut-throat schools where the people in your class see you as competition rather than a fellow student 

Intended Field of Study: Finance, Economics, Political Science, Public Policy, International Relations, Psychology. 

(I don’t have a concrete idea of what I want to study in college but these are a couple fields that interest me) 

Post-Graduate Studies and the Future: I want to pursue either an MBA or a JD. Then ideally in the future I’d love to be apart of the political sphere. 


(I’ve tried to include as much information as possible in this post so I hope it helps. I find this entire college process to be so difficult and I find myself kinda drifting through it, so I’d be grateful if someone could give me some guidance by recommending a few schools that would be a good fit for me)"

What would you have done in my shoes?,Estoybuscando,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/crxlm2/how_would_you_determine_my_bosss_feelings_for_me/,"He is a man in his fifties and I am a young thing of 20. I worked as an intern at his company last year and he was satisfied with my... looks, he made no secret of it. Thus, I became the centre of gossips amongst co-workers and I needed to be extra nice to get friendly with them. This year he called me back and, since this company pays extremely well and they sort of know me, I decided to come back determined to set boundaries between myself and my boss. At the first week, he couldnt keep his hands off me, then I showed a picture of myself and my girlfriend - after that he basically ignored me, did not look at me, left the room when I entered. I said goodbye to them because I am moving very far. My boss did not say to go there to work, but gave me his PRIVATE cell phone number, saying that if I happened to be in the town and needed or wanted ANYTHING, I should call him.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what he is like - he is kinda a predator, he has been that for some time. I am not naive I know he is not looking for a relationship with a girl young enough to be his daughter. But I also have liberal views on relationships (I am living with a girl) and I think that if an older man plays with open cards and the young woman finds him attractive, they should go for it. Therefore, I cannot understand why he called me back to WORK to him, if he wanted to have me (after I finished working there last year he should have called me for a cup of coffee, or offer me to watch some Netflix together).  I also thought that if I go back to work with a proud smile, I should be labelled as ""innocent"" - guilty people are slimy and quiet, not kind and proud. I also cannot see why a boss actually bothers with hiring pretty girl as employees if they could have had pretty girls OUTSIDE of work. Moreover, if my boss has many girlfriends, why he made so much effort into having me or why he looked offended when he realized I was not single. Is there something wrong in my head or with my way of thinking? If I were a boss, I would not call back girls I like to work, I would ask them out. If I were a ladie's man/woman, I would not care about ONE girl turning me down."
crxvjn,29,2019-08-18,I'm a CS reject enrolled in 0 units (waitlisted for 16) looking for some advice.,kdsnk9s88,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/crxvjn/im_a_cs_reject_enrolled_in_0_units_waitlisted_for/,"Bit of a long story, but basically until the end of Spring 2019 I was just a normal L&amp;S intended CS boi planning on declaring this summer, taking some upper divs, and getting an internship next summer (which I was informed by CS advising is when most students get there internships (remember this, it's a surprise fact that will help us later)). I had taken 61A, 61B, and gotten an A in both and was wrapping up 70, not doing well but also not failing, I thought it would be good enough to get the 3.3, especially since I only needed a C to get it. Lo and behold, I screw up the final and end up with a C- in the class, thats a 3.23 average, and I get rejected from the major. 

Uhhh well that sucks, but I look into the appeal process and most people are saying it's pretty likely they accept your appeal if you got a 3.23, especially with two A's and a C- instead of 2 B+'s and a B. So thats fine I'll just appeal. The instructions say you need a letter of rec from a CS related job or internship, but I haven't had one of those yet (because, again, CS advising said most people do that Summer between junior and senior year) so I submit my appeal, explain in it that I couldn't have had a CS internship before now because I didn't even know I needed one until this summer when I got rejected and all the applications have been closed for like half a year. So I explain all of this in my appeal and explain about my contributions to the major and how I just made one mistake and I don't want to let it define me and all that, and I submit. Few weeks later I get an email where they essentially tell me ""we rejected your appeal because you don't have a letter of rec, try again after you get one"" which makes me think they didn't even read it they just saw it didn't have a letter of rec and rejected me.

So now since I'm not a CS major I didn't get any of the reserved seats in any upper divisions, I'm waitlisted for all the classes I could take next semester that would be making any progress.  I've already finished all of my lower division requirements and Breadths (except 16B but I'm waitlisted for that too) so I really don't know what I'm meant to do now or what classes I should be taking. I even tried to enroll in Data 8 so that I had the option to switch to DS if CS just refuses to work out but since I had to wait until phase 2 I'm waitlisted for that as well.

At this point I'm trying to figure out what the best option for me is since if I'm not enrolled in something by the 28th ill be forced to withdraw for the semester and reapply later. My positions on the waitlists are as follows:

Data 8 - 354 (not getting into this one I guess)

CS188 - 194

I've emailed the professors for each of these classes (minus Data 8 cause I mean come on, it's not happening) to ask whether they think I'll get off the waitlist but If I don't get off the waitlist then I really have no idea what classes I could possibly enroll that wouldn't be full in order to fill up my schedule so that I can, you know actually have enough units to be enrolled. I guess I'm asking what I should do, wait to see if I get off the waitlist, give up and enroll in some other classes (if so which ones) or just *give up* give up and withdraw for the semester and hope I get accepted when I reapply.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I'm waitlisted for a bunch of classes and am actually enrolled in 0 units, should I wait to get off the waitlist, , give up and enroll in some other classes (if so which ones(I've already completed all my breadths)) or just *give up* give up and withdraw for the semester and hope I get accepted when I reapply."

We are both pretty busy working and going to school and have been terrible at keeping up with the friends we do have... most of them just sort of fade away and we own this. 

However, her and I both want to meet new people and make/keep friends through our engagement and well into our wedding and beyond. Right now it’s hard because she’s in Florida doing an internship until this coming January while I am working full time in Arizona. Are there any good/casual ways for both of us to make friends while we’re away from each other as well as when we’re reunited in January? We’re both not to big into the bar scene, but can’t really think of other good activities or places to meet new people. Any advice?"

I (27M) have been admitted to INSEAD the January 2020 intake and I still have 2 weeks to confirm my admission (btw any questions feel free to ask me !) 

I can’t help it but think about the state of the market. A recession is in the way either in 2019 or 2020. I know that I can’t time the markets but it would be nice to have the intake of MBA grads who graduated around 2009 ? 

I work in finance and I heard that banks for example offered less full time positions this year to interns compared to last year and are expected to reduce hiring. 

With all that in mind I would love to know what you guy think about it ? I’m leaning more toward doing it but I can’t deny the rising fear looking at the state of the world economy. 

Thanks and good luck for the next round 1applicants."

I am totally confused about what should I do?

With some basic theoretical knowledge of programming back in August 2017, I joined a software company here in Biratnagar as an Intern to learn programming.   I learned Python with the Django framework over there and later I started working there in the same company as a junior developer. 

Now the company is on the verge of collapsing ( it's almost collapsed ), so I started to look for a job here in Biratnagar only to find to out all those few companies use PHP, in one of the companies I went for informal interview asked me if I could switch the language?

Personally, I don't want to switch to PHP but at the same time, I need a job. There are very few companies here in Biratnagar and none of them uses Django.

How is it in Kathmandu? Are there any jobs for Django developer? 

As I have only worked as a junior developer, can I get any good job in Kathmandu?"

As the title says, I’ve been having trouble finding a job to start my IT career.  Some background about me - 24, I have about 1.5 years left for my B.Sc in Networking and Cybersecurity. I had quite a turn of events in my education path, switching majors, switching schools - so taking longer than I want, so I have quite a bit of coursework completed. I completed my CompTIA A+ back in January, and completed my Network+ in June. 

I have been applying for positions for months now, probably sent out over 100+ over the past 6 months and have only managed 1 in person interview (which went well, really thought I had it but employer decided on another candidate last minute). Most of all my applications I receive nothing back. Few I get the denial email, which is discouraging to see but I keep it moving. This is for Junior help desk positions too so...my question is -

What am I doing wrong? How can I get my foot in the door? Are there skills I should work on? More certifications I should look to obtain? A special way I need to submit applications and follow up with employers I hear nothing from? 

I’m looking for some help here. I thought that with 2 certifications, working towards an IT related degree, some experience with customer service and project managing through internships - I’d at least be able to land a help desk job. I have no problem starting from the bottom, but the bottom doesn’t even seem available to me."

Currently I’m working as a waiter right now trying to get by while I’m job hunting. My dream is to work in a office job but I’m finding this difficult. I’ve been applying to over hundreds of entry level jobs but it seems like no one wants to hire me.

I went to a 4 year college and got BS in hospitality and management and originality I wanted to open my own restaurant. I’ve had 10 plus years working in the restaurant business because my parents used to owned a restaurant and I wanted to follow their footsteps. I’ve also done an internship at an accounting firm during the summer while I was still in college. I’ve worked at various other restaurant jobs like line cook and waiter. But now I want to switch careers and it seems it’s so hard to even get my foot in the door.

What can I do to help improve my chances of getting an interview and being hired? What position should be easier for me to apply to with no prior experience? I have also thought of going back to school and maybe take some accounting courses at H&amp;R Block. I’ve done some bookkeeping and I really liked it and I wish I stuck with it.

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you everyone for all of the replies. I didn’t expect this to blow up. I’m working right now so I won’t be able to respond right away but I’m still reading everybody’s replies and I really appreciate it!"

I don't feel overwhelmed by planning at all, we do team planning and even the modifications I make for my class come naturally after so many long nights of planning during internship.

I feel completely comfortable in my classroom. The actual lesson teaching feels like it's coming straight from my soul, like it's second nature. 

The logistics and the ""little things"" still pile up quickly but I'm keeping myself organized and laughing at myself if I mess up. Also helps that my admin constantly keeps saying ""hey, you're going to mess up. We expect you to, just let us know when you do so we can fix it"" which is great and I have a ton of support from my team who is constantly checking in to make sure I'm okay and is there to answer my 1000 questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just absolutely couldn't be happier. I feel like my entire demeanor has changed and I've become a happier person now that I'm finally doing what I love, at a place I love, with students I love. I know this year is going to be hard in many ways (like I have to get my gifted endorsement/start my Master's degree, while teaching, and running an after school club) but I don't think it's going to feel as bad as everyone makes it sound.

Also side note: I know there's a lot of Charter school hate on this sub, and politically I absolutely see why. I was completely against them myself, but now that I am working at one (they made me an offer I couldn't refuse) I have to say I'm getting way more support than I ever did at the public schools. The teachers are more down to earth and friendly. The admin is realistic and personable. They encourage you to take care of yourself and family first. I know every Charter school is different and this will not be everyone's experience by far, but I don't think I would be this happy elsewhere."

Having taken German in high school I continued into college and somehow completely fell in love with the language and culture that Germany has to offer. For the first time I found myself taking deep interest in something academically related outside of the classroom. Through my language learning process I met a couple of Germans who I've grown very close with and even had the amazing opportunity to hang out with them in person during a recent trip to Europe. During said trip to Munich I felt truly happy for the first time in a long time, it felt like a breath of fresh air and there was a realization that there's more possibilities out there than I had previously imagined.

cs47tm,1,2019-08-18,how can I move from data scientist to people manager?,blondemathslut,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cs47tm/how_can_i_move_from_data_scientist_to_people/,"I have a Master's in Computer Science and have now been working for almost 2 years at my company. The first time period was as a data engineer. The last few months I've been working as a data scientist, but am the first one and therefore still doing mostly data engineering to set up our infrastructure and the processes to gather data. 

I am good at technical work, but it has felt like my most valuable skills so far are actually: 
- explaining technical concepts to non-technical colleagues (through presentations or documentations or meetings). Bridging the gaps between engineers and Product etc. 
- working with people. Everyone enjoys working with me and trusts me and my opinions. 

Furthermore, although I definitely love coding and analysis, I'm still relatively junior in those roles. My Master's was in theoretical CS so I feel less skilled than those who had a more applied technical degree and have more years of experience. 

I think I've just unlocked what I actually want to do -- manage people, particularly technical people (engineers are my people). I spend so much of my time around work thinking about how to make the engineering culture happier and more productive (because honestly it sucks at my company). How to let the engineers enjoy their work and do their best work. I find myself watching and internally critiquing every manager's moves. I sometimes attempt a bit of ""up-managing"" with some success. I'm super vocal about my opinions and things I think could be done to solve problems, even when it's not exactly my place - I've earned enough respect from my good work that people let me and sometimes listen to me. 

I also believe I would be naturally well-suited to a people management role. I am what they call a ""leader"", whenever I'm with a group of people they look to me for what we should do. 

I have struggled with admitting that this is what I want, because when people say ""I want to be a manager"" I imagine (wrongly, I'm sure) that they say it because they want the power trip or something. But the truth is I want it so that I can make our team succeed, and I believe I could do it better than most. I want people to enjoy their work and be happy to come to work. I want to protect them from external stresses and set appropriate conservative expectations from outside teams. 

So, how can I move into this kind of role? It seems that engineering managers come out of many years of engineering, and their role often does have some technical components that require this. Are there other companies where this is not the case? Are there other skills I should work on to prepare for this kind of role? How does one get their first ""management"" job (I did manage a couple interns for a while, and it went well, but that was brief)?"

It was a software engineering role, and I had probably the best experience I could have possibly hoped for. I was contributing almost right away, and within a month I was doing the same amount of work as anyone else on the team. It got to the point where I would finish my tickets for the sprint (2 weeks) in the first week, and management started relying on me to take out some high priority bugs since I would finish early. I was given the same amount of work as anyone else — I wasn’t given soft balls. 

Anyways, I made quite a name for myself and my manager told me several times how pleased he is. Our lead engineer/ architect whatever has started unloading additional responsibilities on to me. Which is fine... I like wearing multiple hats, but there is a problem. I work on a fairly modern project but now I’m also working on some old ancient project that the company has to maintain. They trained me on it, and now I’m doing tickets for it. No features (that would be too exciting) just cracking bugs using ancient software. I hate it. 

I want to be the best developer I can be. That includes using the most up to date softwares/ frameworks/ technologies/ whatever. The project I was working on (that I had a ton of success with and learned so much) uses those newer frameworks. I just feel this other project isn’t going to propel me forwards. It’s not inline with my professional goals, and I want nothing to do with it — nobody else does either. 

I really like the company and the project I was working on, but I’m really nervous they’re going to try to stick me with this old piece of code nobody wants to maintain. It’s a dead end project, and they already trained me on it. 

I get my return offer this week. Should I demand more money if they are going to stick me on this shitty project? Should I demand to work on the newer stuff?  I love working in an agile environment. This old project would just be me and some remote dude. Not what I signed up for! I feel they teased me with this awesome project and then after I say I’m sold, they dump some old crap on me. Thoughts?"

To add more context, during the summer I took a job as a Mig Welder making 10 bucks an hour.

My first semester at Pitt I took 13 credit hours which were all General studies courses so I could enjoy my first semester at a university. Plus I was also trying to make their cross country team. My second semester I took 14 hours to as I was still attempting to make the team.

By March my parents called me and said they did have any more money to pay for my tuition. They told me don't worry about it they'll figure out a way to pay. It was at that moment I knew I was being extremely selfish. Considering my parents did not have much, but would do anything to make me happy. My mom is a cook at a public school. My dad has been disabled due an accident that happen back in 2013. He used the rest of his settlement check to put me through my first year of school. I decide to take action and promised they would not have to pay a single cent for my schooling.

I quit running and focused on school. My first year came to end and I went back to my hometown to work as a machinist/fabricator in the same shop making $10 an hour. That would cover my living expenses during school. I applied for Fasfa and various scholarships. I would go on to receive a full ride. Now I could fully focus on school.

Fall 2017, I took my first metal casting course. My advisor helped me set up a practice interview with a fortune 500 company. Even though I had no experience in what they would looking for in terms of Designing and Simulations. I impressed him with my work ethic and curiosity to learn. I ended getting the Internship for the Spring semester. I intern there from January 2018 to August 2018 in Marshalltown Iowa.

I went back to school Fall 2018. This was my last semester of Gen Ed's. I had one designing and simulation class. Thankfully, this is exactly what I did throughout the entirety of my internship. So the class was breeze, I ended up helping being a TA.  During School I was able to land a Production Supervisor Internship at a manufacturing company located in Joplin Missouri. During this time I had discovered we had an alumni at Tesla. I asked my Advisor to help send me resume over. I got in contact with the Alumni who sent my resume to a recruiter. After two interviews, with two different teams; I got the position as a Tooling Engineering. 

From January to May 2019 I was in the tooling engineering team. During my last month of this internship, all interns received an email that a position was open in the Battery Cell team. I applied and went through two vigorous interviews with a Staff and Senior engineer. A Month later i got the news I got the position! I'll be here till December 2019 and return to school in January 2020. With one year at Tesla i'll return to school with three semesters.

Since the start of the year I've been in contact with recruiters from Google, Facebook, Microsfot, and Apple. I have one more internship as an ungrad before graduation in 2021 May. 

My advice to students is to show the wiliness/curiosity to learn! Companies care more for personality rather than experience when starting.

cs4k1z,3,2019-08-18,Feedback on my plan to find a career in Germany as an American?,jerpp1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cs4k1z/feedback_on_my_plan_to_find_a_career_in_germany/,"I'm currently a senior communication student with a minor in business. As part of the school of liberal arts-- it's required that all students within take a certain amount of of foreign language credit. Having taken German in high school I continued into college and somehow completely fell in love with the language and culture that Germany has to offer. For the first time I found myself taking deep interest in something academically related outside of the classroom. Through my language learning process I met a couple of Germans who I've grown very close with and even had the amazing opportunity to hang out with them in person during a recent trip to Europe. During said trip to Munich I felt truly happy for the first time in a long time, it felt like a breath of fresh air and there was a realization that there's more possibilities out there than I had previously imagined.

Today, I'm considering adding a German minor to my education in an attempt to continue pushing myself towards the direction of an international career. I've done some research and found potential careers that I can imagine myself being happy in including public relations, marketing, brand managing, and overall corporate communications. At the beginning of this week I'll be scheduling appointments with the career services at my university to see what kind of opportunities are available to me, as well as speaking to the director of the communication department to find out more about how I can make this ""dream"" happen. Ideally I'd like to have an internship in Germany lined up after my graduation in fall 2020, so I'm trying to start as early as possible to make this happen. If I can land a proper internship I have a couple options which I can work on simultaneously, including busting it for a full time offer and taking advantage of my time in Germany to seek out other opportunities available to me. I've been thinking about this for a long time and often feel as though it may be unrealistic to hope for such things.

I'm only 21 years old and I'm sure there's much more to this than I'm currently aware of and more obstacles in my way than I imagine. As the current situation is I feel as though the entirety of this dream depends on my networking skills and my ability to come in contact with the right people. After the years of stress I feel as though I've finally found my goal, and now it's a whole different challenge to make it real. I'm looking for people who were me at one point, who chased the idea of living abroad and having a successful life in another culture. I'm interested in any and all opinions on my plan or ideas I've proposed. Thank you."

Link to original post^

As the post implies, I was recently recommended for termination from my clinical PhD program. Good news though: I won my appeal! However, I am uncertain if I should stick it out here or apply to other programs and obtain my PhD elsewhere. 

If I stay here, I would have 3 years left before internship (including this upcoming academic year). However, my mentor took a job at another institution (and I can’t go with him) and I would have to find another mentor to work with here, none of which really do similar research to my previous mentor.

If I go elsewhere, I would perhaps find a better program with better funding due to the fact that I’ll have 5 publications and a MS in experimental psychology before applying, as well as strong letters. But I would basically be adding another year or 2 onto my education. Moreover, I worry that if I stay, I would have a rocky time due to my poor relationship with the program director and her obvious bias against me (see previous post for more context). 

I would appreciate it if anyone could share their thoughts on my situation!"

I am a 25M, and graduated from a top tier school (think Ivy League) and got an entry level position at a finance job 3 years ago. I was the first hire at the company (my boss was the only one, everything else was outsourced), and I thought it would be a great opportunity (my boss was highly successful in his field), he seemed like a good guy to be around, and I was willing to take a little bit of discount to market pay in the unwritten hopes of becoming a partner at the firm eventually and really start making real $$$. Things started out great—I was finding great profitable ideas, our Performance was great, and i was learning a lot, etc. we would talk about our weekends, our travels, etc.  I even got equity after my first year, which were the first steps in becoming a partner. 

Sounds great right? It wasn’t until after a year or 2, when I started getting more responsibility and tasks. I made mistakes, which i of course I blame myself for. He then proceeded to yell at me and shout angrily when I made those mistakes. Of course I apologize, knowing the mistakes I had made and put in the perspective that this was Wall Street and there were no room for errors . Things cool down and things go on as normal. During this time, I start noticing his tendencies. He was pretty paranoid about things (he accused me of not locking the door once when it was actually the janitor), and was highly detail oriented in things like what time I was coming in at, etc. 

It wasn’t until the end of my third year, when he was out on vacation. One of our portfolio companies started failing and the price of the stock precipitously falls. Mind you, our performance during this time was pretty bad. He calls me as he was on his way from vacation asking me what  is going on. There was a bad connection, so I couldn’t quite hear so I hung up, but I could hear his anxious voice. I was pretty stressed out at this time and pretty panicky, so I didn’t think of calling back, and stupidly decided that he would call me  back. He never called back, but 30 minutes later, he storms into the office back from vacation. His face was completely red as he comes in and yells “WHY THE \_\_ DID YOU HANG UP ME”. And then proceeds to yell at me that I would be fired if I were anywhere else for what I did. He then goes on to list his grievances about me, like not being respectful enough to get the mail like his previous intern used to (I didn’t even realize that), how I was wasting tons of paper on printing, etc. . Basically everything that annoyed him was out in the open. I didn’t even realize these things bothered him. I just took it and apologized after his diatribe. 

The next couple of weeks were awkward to say the least. I would quickly come in and rush to my desk, not say hello in the morning, and do my work in silence. The days  we would talk about our weekends were long gone. It’s depressing to say the least. 

But here’s the thing. I quickly realized that he hasn’t fired me because, he doesn’t have any other option. He’s a pretentious \_\_\_\_, and wouldn’t hire anyone except anyone from a top school. But no one in the right mind from one of these top schools would would work here. Why would they? They can get more prestigious Jobs with higher pay. Also, the training required to get someone up to speed would be at least a couple of years. Also, it takes a special type of somebody (like me) who likes working in an environment with no other coworkers. Some one who is experienced wouldn’t also want this job because it doesn’t pay enough (this is  all relative). He needs somebody to help him manage the entire portfolio, and he’s screwed if I leave. 

That being said, what would you do in my situation?  Basically, I’m milking this until I get a) fired b) find a new job"

I’m currently in school in my country (Denmark)  my education takes roughly 5.6 years to complete, and I’m done with 1.5 years already. I’ve gotten this opportunity through school. 

Plans are I’ll be moving from Denmark to California when I’m done with school (14th of October 2019) and I seriously don’t know what to do. I still live at my parents house here in Denmark, and have never lived alone.

I’ve already said yes to the deal, although the company still has yet to accept me. I’m looking for advice on how to get started in a new country, all by myself. 

I’ll need an American drivers license (already got my danish one) 

I’ll need to find an apartment, something cheap close, or in San Diego.

Those are the things I know already. But how does one get started on my new life, so far away from everything I know? The time difference is 9 hours. And for reference, the population in San Diego, is literally half of whole Denmark.

Do you have any advice for starting fresh? Economical advice, how I settle in, what to do first, and how to get new contacts, friends etc. 

Is there something I should worry about? Public transport, work environment that sort of stuff? 

I’ll take all the advice I can get. I’m scared to start of on my own like this. So far away from everything I know. 

If there is anyone currently doing the same as me, heck just some locals from California, please help me get to understand things, where to go, how to finance my life, tax, food. Is it cheaper to eat out? Cook for myself?

Any advice, huge or small, I’ll take it.

I’m also getting cold feet thinking of all of this. Am I doing the right thing? Or should I stay? 

I’m very social. So I won’t be afraid to do things.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, my education is programming. Data technician with special in Programming, for those who are interested."

I'm a Canadian citizen &amp; a CS new graduate from a well-respected university here. I have 8 months of internship experience and a good GPA. I'm looking for software engineering work (Backend, iOS, or full-stack, in that order)  in the EU- I traveled through central Europe this year and loved the density of different cultures, art, and history. My top picks would be Berlin, London, Hamburg, and Amsterdam, with Berlin ahead by a good margin.

My reasoning for wanting to move is as follows:

1. Since it's my first job and I have no commitments in my current city, it probably isn't going to get any easier to travel/work in other countries. I feel that the experience gained by living in different cultures and learning new languages is well worth the difficulty of relocating.
2. Salary to COL ratio in my city is notoriously terrible, so I probably wouldn't be taking too much of a hit financially.
3. My friends living in the EU *generally* live healthier/happier lifestyles (workplaces seem respectful/flexible, more vacation time, easier to travel to different countries/places over the weekend, so on).

I'm wondering if anyone here has any experience trying to relocate from NA to Europe for work. Is such a move feasible given the current job market and my (lack of) experience? If so, where should I be looking for work? Are there any companies you know of that historically hire new grads and/or sponsor visas? 

For reference, I've mostly been looking on LinkedIn, Relocate.me, Glassdoor, and Stack Overflow jobs, but so far with limited success (a few interviews scheduled with companies in Amsterdam, not much of a response from companies in Berlin or London). Should I give up or keep trying? If the latter, is there anything I can do to improve my odds?"

I also went to a very easy high school (full of kids of working class folks), which gave me the opportunity to shine.

I was accepted to two Ivies, but opted to attend a slightly lower ranked school (ex: UCLA) on a full ride + an annual stipend). I used none of my family's money for 4 years and graduated with 0 debt.

In college, I struggled. I decided to be a computer science major and found it to be too stressful (I had no prior coding experience but I was so good at math I was still accepted), so I ended up double majoring in sociology and quantitative economics. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA.

I interviewed for a bunch of IB/high finance positions but didn't get final offers (I did 2 super days on Wall Street). I legitimately think I'm kind of stupid and am just good at test taking. I did a one-month internship at FDIC which was really cool, but other than that I didn't do any other internships because I wanted to travel/chill during the summer (I regret it now).

In my senior year of college, I got an offer for a risk advisory position at a EY/Deloitte near my family and took it. It's pretty much a glorified audit job, and I'm rated very low in my class. I find what I do to be uninspiring, I hate staring at a computer all the time, I wish the atmosphere wasn't so cutthroat, and the hours are terrible. I didn't study accounting in college and I didn't do my due diligence before accepting this job. Maybe it's because all my coworkers have BS/MS in accounting and CPAs and I have neither.

It is an enormous hit to my ego to hear that my coworkers who graduated from unranked universities (ex: Grambling State) is rated a tier 1 or 2, whereas I'm rated a tier 4 (1 is the best, 5 is the worst). I think I deserve a tier 3, but obviously my manager does not think so. He thinks that my accounting/technical skills are terrible.

So I graduated last year with a BA in Communication with a specialization in digital media. I was hoping to get a job in social media content creation / copywriting, etc. and yet I’m really struggling to find anything.

I did well in college, I participated in extracurriculars related to my major, and I’ve had two internships that were social media and copy creation related. One was for my college itself and another one was for a mom and pop shop through a family friend. I moved to a new state and began to apply for jobs there. Not too much interest after lots of looking but I did get an interview which went badly because they essentially told me I wasn’t qualified...

Since then, I’ve been temping in a kind of unrelated role that I took at the time out of desperation. I was tired of the job hunt so I decided to stay in the temp role for a year.  I hoped to build my resume and my longevity of work since my two internships were only one and two semesters. At this point, it’s been 10 months at the temp job but after failed promises of taking me permanent, my need for healthcare, and assorted other problems in the department, I’m hoping to leave earlier than expected. 

So I’m back to applying for social media / marketing / copywriting jobs and I’m not getting responses. I have been more casually applying for the last few weeks. 

I’m not sure what to do because I feel like maybe employers are looking for longer term experience but if I can’t get hired at a related job in the first place then it’s hard to get that experience!"

My goal is to further enhance on my experience by taking a Data Science certificate in a year or so... where I will have to relocate.

I don't know what to choose:

Perm vs Contract position.

Analyst vs Specialist

Analytics vs IT

Mid-size company vs well-known company (across Canada)"
csbf6n,0,2019-08-18,Questions from a freshman international student,ThanksIllPass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/csbf6n/questions_from_a_freshman_international_student/,"Hello all, I am an international student at a community college and have a couple of questions to help me &amp; others with their future.

1) Is there a recommended guide/general plan to land an internship? Best ways to build a resume? What do you think of Skiena+EPI+LeetCode to prepare for interviews? 
(I know freshman internships are difficult to get but its worth trying for the experience &amp; interview practice.)

2) Practical difference between CPT/OPT for internships? I searched a lot but its still not clear, can the same job listing be used under CPT&amp;OPT? What do most internationals use? (I'm talking about pre-completion OPT)

3) Should resume projects be focused around CS fundamentals? For example, many project ideas involve high-level frameworks and not much CS/algorithms. Should we try making projects that show CS concepts?

4) Bonus: What's your opinion on applying through direct contact/LinkedIn vs the standard methods/sites?"

csbrjk,2,2019-08-18,"Should I continue working at a startup, take a government job, or pursue a PhD?",StaleFigNewton,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/csbrjk/should_i_continue_working_at_a_startup_take_a/,"Hello all,

I have found myself in a stressful albeit good situation. Some background: **23 years, STEM field,on my parents insurance, and have a Roth IRA**

**My options:**

1. I have a year left in my MS degree where I have consulted part time for a startup company ran by a few former professors and PhDs at my college. The company primarily deals with government contracts pertaining to our field. I oversee/assist in the development of several software tools commonly used within industry and get to attend conferences and write technical reports and occasionally publish information pertaining to the models we develop. This town is only **1.5 hours from my home town** (where my SO currently lives and attends school)  and I absolutely love the area. They have expressed an interest in hiring me full-time and I'd expect to make about **$65k (smaller, LCOL area)**. However, they are still rolling out benefits and therefore currently **do not offer health insurance or retirement but they are working towards it**.  Additionally, funding/contracts can be hit or miss so I would not consider this as secure as a larger company.
2. I am just finishing an internship in the **San Francisco Bay Area** at a government institution that is well renown in the field and will receive an official offer soon (for after I complete the MS). I have thoroughly enjoyed my summer here and consider this a place I could temporarily live (I have no desire of settling down here). They would **pay between $84k-$90k, offer insurance and a 401k.** Ultimately, this job is the work I would expect with the degree and would look great on a resume for other institutions throughout the country similar to this one. However, my **SO and I will have to do a LDR for at least a year.** We've been 1.5 hours apart for a couple years but this is stepping up the game a bit (10 hour drive) when we originally expected to be living together within the next 9 months.
3. I have **strongly considered a PhD** for the last few years. This is something that I need to be 100% sure of but I am probably more at a 75%. I don't believe it is necessary for a good career in the field but I am attracted to the idea of being a researcher so I go back and forth a lot. It would not be a hard transition to do and I have the opportunity to continue at my current institution although I believe leaving would be the better option.

**Original Plan:**

Before this summer the original plan was to take a year or two off following the MS, work for the startup while my SO moves in and finishes their degree, and really evaluate if I think a PhD is worth it. Then, if I were to decide against it, I'd look for a job elsewhere in industry unless the startup was doing particularly well and I was enjoying it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a lot but I am at the point where I feel like I am swinging between all three every couple of hours. I am really putting a lot of thought into this and I'd love to hear what anyone has to say.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the time!"
csbzwl,755,2019-08-19,My body is slowly being replaced with someone else's,byronius_j,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/csbzwl/my_body_is_slowly_being_replaced_with_someone/,"I first noticed when they installed fingerprint scanners at the tech firm I work- well, used to work at. They were to improve security, to streamline things for employees. No longer would we have to fumble with tedious ID cards that most of us ended up losing anyway. It sounded great to me, and for a few days, it was. That is, until my fingerprint was rejected.

I stared, bewildered, into the flashing red light of denial, my mind not quite registering that the usually flawless system had made an error for the first time. I tried again, and then a third time, both to no avail. I tried wiping off my finger, then polishing the sensor with the edge of my coat. Neither of them resulted in anything more than another infuriating flash of red light.

At this point I started to panic a little. Being late to work at this point wouldn't exactly do wonders for me, since I was just an intern and hadn't done anything to prove myself yet. It was only through the convenient arrival of Elliot, the only coworker I'd dare to call a friend, that I was able to slip in during the narrow window the doors unlocked for him. He didn't notice a thing; probably thought I'd already been on my way in and simply stopped for a chat.

I was able to keep up this little trick for about a week or so, timing my arrival to work with Elliot's so I'd be able to ride his coattails into the building, figuratively speaking.

Why didn't I just file a complaint for a broken scanner, you ask? Well, because it wasn't broken. Every single damn person I saw use it- and I was watching, trust me- got through no sweat. And I knew they *had* my prints, or else it wouldn't have worked for me the way it did the first few days. This was just a weird fluke in the system and treating it like anything more would only bring unwanted attention to myself.

That's how my mind justified it, anyway.

Then one day Elliot was sick. I was left standing at the entrance to the firm like a lost child, my mind trying to justify an excuse for loitering next to the scanner like a brain-dead idiot. I wasn't able to before my manager stormed out of his car and up the walkway, black coffee in hand. He looked pissed.

""You think I haven't noticed your shit?""

""I.. what?""

""Don't even try to pull that card. You've been sneaking in for the past week. Haven't validated yourself *once* since last Tuesday. And you've been using Bradford to pull it off.""

""It's... it's the scanner, man, I swear. It's conking out on me or... something.""

""Yeah? Why didn't you file a report then?""

Silence.

""Okay, you know what, I don't have time for this. Take it up with my supervisor, you know him. And if I catch you talking to Bradford, I swear to God this coffee is going into your retinas.""

That was of course the end of my little trick. The next thing I knew, I was in the office of my manager's manager, the highest ranking man I'd had the pleasure of meeting at the firm so far. I'll admit he was intimidating, the way he just stared at me when I came in, but the weird part was he wasn't even making eye contact, rather looking slightly to the side of me, and when he finally spoke to me, it had nothing to do with the scanner at all.

""What's wrong with your hair?""

""My hair, sir?""

""It doesn't match your ID photo. Did you frost the tips? Even overlooking the fact that it looks terrible on you, it's a class B appearance change. You know our policy, you should've notified us in advance.""

""Sir, I'm not sure I understand-""

""Well, it's not like you have a swastika on your forehead, so I'll let you off with a warning. The next time you decide to give yourself a surprise makeover, though, it would be handy if you let the firm know about it.""

""...Okay.""

I wasn't about to argue, especially since I'd just been given a free ticket out of the doghouse. But as soon as my meeting with the boss (which ended in a simple re-calibration of my print recognition, to at least fix the scanner problem) came to an end, I raced to the bathroom and looked myself in the mirror.

*What in the hell?*

He was right. My normally dull brown hair was now fringed with blonde at the edges. So if the boss wasn't the crazy one here.. was I? The prints were one thing, but this... I would remember a spontaneous trip to the hair salon, right? *Right?*

When I went home that night, I noticed as I was getting out of the shower a small patch of skin on my lower back that was... lighter than the rest of me. It was as if I had gotten a serious burn and needed a different person's skin grafted onto the wound. Except that had never happened in my entire life.

Going to sleep after that was hard. The only solace I had was that at least I'd be able to get into my own workplace without relying on Elliot.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, Elliot was absent again.

Because he was dead.

Police cruisers swarmed the usually peaceful lawn around the building, and cops were questioning crowds of frenzied employees. The moment I pulled up to the curb, I was planning to talk to one myself, but they got to me first, to put it lightly. I had barely set one foot outside my car before I was forcibly yanked the rest of the way out. The cop held my face directly up to his, so close I could see my reflection in his dark glasses.

""You're gonna have to come with us.""

""What's going on here?"" I barely managed to choke the words out as I was put in cuffs.

""Elliot Bradford was murdered. We found your prints and hair at the scene.""

Elliot. Murdered in his own home. He was my best work friend. And yet his death didn't disturb me as much as the fact that I was apparently the one who killed him.

I couldn't argue with the police. They showed me the diagrams of my prints they had on record, and the ones they found at the scene. It was a perfect match. The only thing I could do was keep insisting it wasn't me until they begrudgingly agreed to re-check my prints and DNA. I didn't notice it at the time, but the strand of hair I yanked out for them was now completely blonde.

The cop who came back from analyzing my samples looked... shaken. That's the only way to put it.

""These... don't match. Not with the ones we had before.""

""Well, who do they match with?""

""No one. No one we have on record. To put it literally, you aren't you.""

""I'm not me?""

The cop behind me gave me a rough pat on the back. ""Don't worry about it too much, bud. I'm sure it's just a glitch in the system. It happens from time to time, leads to a good number of mix-ups. Luckily most of them are sorted out simple as this.""

I looked back at him. ""But the crime scene... if those aren't my prints, my *DNA*... whose are they?""

""Who knows? Probably an undocumented immigrant, if you ask me. But we'll catch 'em, leave it to us. You should be free to leave by morning.""

The cop gave me another pat on the back, walking to the doorway. Right before leaving the room, he turned around again.

""Oh, uh, by the way... you wearing contacts?""

""No?""

""Huh. Cause it says on your record you have brown eyes and those are some beautiful baby blues you got right there."" he gave an exaggerated shrug.  ""Just another glitch, I guess!""

The remaining cop stayed in the room with me until morning. He tried to hide it, but I could sense he didn't know what to think of the person sitting in front of him.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I was proven innocent, it's obvious the firm didn't let me go back to work after that. Having a murder suspect, even a proven innocent murder suspect, working for them was going to look sketchy at best. I don't blame them nor do I question their decision.

I only wish I had more options left than moving back in with my parents.

From the moment I stepped back in that house, they didn't stopped asking questions for a while. What happened to your hair? What happened to your eyes? Why were you accused of murder? My father, being especially conservative, didn't exactly approve of my new look and refused to believe I'm not wearing contacts and dye. Why wouldn't he? It's the only logical explanation.

The questions eventually stopped, the ones coming from the outside.

The ones on the inside persisted.

Every morning I wake up and something is different. The wave of blonde is steadily creeping up my hairline. More patches of lighter flesh have appeared on my abdomen, slowly expanding and morphing into each other. My hands and feet are completely off-color now, and this morning I found a small tattoo on the back of my right palm I didn't have before. I've taken to wearing gloves, but I know that's a temporary solution. When it reaches my face, I'll be out of excuses.

I want to convince myself that this is some benign disorder, that my pigmentation is fluctuating due to poor diet or some crap. I know deep down this isn't true. These parts of me aren't merely changing color; they're being replaced entirely by someone else's parts. Each time the sun rises, more of me is not me, stolen in the night. Eventually none of me will be me.

I don't know where these parts of me are going.

I don't know who's using them to commit murder.

But I dread the day I will wake up and not recognize my own face in the mirror.

The day someone else will wake up and finally look exactly the way I used to.

I feel like my life is just in shambles. Like I’m not doing good in any aspect of my life. I just graduated from college this past May and I don’t have nothing to show for it no job no internships or anything and I’ve been trying to find something since April but still couldn’t find it. My family frustrates me by telling me just get a job here or there even though that’s not something I went to school for like I just spent the last 5 years to get a degree and I can’t even find a job in my field or something that I like to doand I see my peers they all have jobs and going on trips meanwhile I’m just at home. Like this post-graduation depression is eating me up. My little side business is failing too. I feel like I invested so much money into it but I don’t have anything to show for it. Like I’ve spent almost $1000 on it and I have nothing to show for it or even made close to that much. Like I feel like all my time money and effort is going to waste. I also feel like a burden to people. Like people invite me out just cause I so happen to hear about as they was telling somebody else. I know my friends don’t feel that way but it’s just always I don’t really feel they want me there even though they do. Also my best friend seems to be acting very distant for no reason. I wish I knew why we used to talk just everyday now I’m lucky if I talk to him 3 times a week. Also my mother recently broke her foot so I’ve been taking care of her but every time I see her with the boot thing I can’t help but to feel like it’s my fault even though I wasn’t there when it happened. It’s just hard seeing her struggle to even move around and it’s taking a toll on me. Lastly I’ve been sad about my ex. I am in love with this woman I’ll do anything to get back with her. The reason we broke up was mainly because I was in my hoe phase and my ex was the only girl i had sex with at the time. I’ve always said I was going to marry her or that I found my wife I’m just going through my hoe phase well I did go through it and had my lil fun I was planning on getting back with her once I graduated but on February she gets a new boyfriend and I was heartbroken not as much as I am not but I was hurt. I was hoping they would break up or something but it wasn’t happening so back in March I told her to stop talking to me cause it hurts that she’s with somebody else. Well fast forward to the beginning of August she DM’d me asking for advice on camera stuff and what not so of course I tell her about and suggested we text so we texting back and forth and in my head I’m thinking she broke up with her boyfriend or whatever turns out they was still together but even though I have these feelings for her I thought I was good enough to accept it and be friends but I just started hurting again cause I truly do love this girl. So then like a week later she texts me asking about my mother because of her foot injury so I tell her what happened and we still texting and she starts asking what’s a good iPad to buy so I tell her because I know a lot about Apple products so I put 2 and 2 together and figure out the camera or iPad that she was finna buy was for her boyfriend cause his birthday coming up so I was hurting even more and told her how I feel about how I still loved her and told her that she was still gonna be the girl I marry and everything and she goes and tells me why I ain’t never say this before and all that but and I told her why and everything and I just can’t stop hurting from it. It’s my fault we not together in the first place. Today it was just everything was hitting me at once from my ex, to not being financially satisfied because both I don’t have a job and my side business is failing, I feel like I have nothing to show from college and feel like I wasted my mother’s money, I feel like I’m a burden to my friends and just me having depression itself it’s like all these things are happening at once and it just hurts and I don’t want to hurt no more."
cscbav,1,2019-08-19,Resume Help for a Computer Science Major?,Sorleii,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/cscbav/resume_help_for_a_computer_science_major/,"I graduated back in 2017 (over 2 years ago now, yikes), and since then I've had little luck finding what I'm truly looking for in a job. Or, if I found it, I never received a response from the employer.

Initially, after I graduated I went back to my hometown and found something sort-of in my area of expertise (the Graphic Artist Role). If I'm being honest, that position is the closest thing I've had to my dream job since graduation, but I digress. While I was working there, I was applying all over the country, (mainly focused in cities in New England). I heard back from quite a few, but we could never make interviews/etc. work because they wanted in-person and I was hours away at that point.

So, I moved. Since moving to my current location, I've been applying like crazy, but so far have only been able to secure low-paying jobs that really don't require a degree at all, much less a degree in Computer Science. I have a sneaking suspicion that my lack of experience at this point 2+ years out of school is a large factor, but I also believe my resume was to blame.

On the advice of friends/family members, I've updated it with their input, but I've come to you strangers of the internet to critique the newest edition of my resume. It's definitely not perfect at this point, but I'll say it's better than it was. I haven't applied to any jobs with this edition yet, as I'd really like the input here. It would be much appreciated!

What are your suggestions/critiques/comments?

(I've just realized the dates for my IT Intern role are incorrect, should be those months, but 2016, not 2017. Oops.)

cscfox,1,2019-08-19,Seeking career guidance throughout community college and transferring. TLDR; Should I still push through and focus on getting my associates?,propsamus,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cscfox/seeking_career_guidance_throughout_community/,"Hello I am 22 years old and I am currently at a community college.

A bit of my past history, I attended a local community college after graduating high school and studied general engineering then eventually changed majors a couple times but in the relevant fields (ex. electrical, cyber security, computer engineering). I was very clueless as to what I wanted to do in the future and I wanted to seek a degree in which I was interested in rather than just to find a job. And so I pretty much wasted a lot of my time at the community college managing work, personal life, and not even attending classes due to lack of motivation. I currently have a GPA below a 2.0 (1.93 i believe) and have 40 credits out of an attempted 90 or so. I received an academic warning last year and was stripped of my financial aid. I took a semester (or two) break and just worked blue collar jobs as a server, hvac contractor, delivery driver, and at a ups store and hit a point that the purpose of school has become very valuable to me.

Throughout the past year I have spent my time on the side trading in the stock market and became interested in becoming educated and to eventually pursue a career as a financial analyst (or anything related to the stock market/trading). I feel a lot more different about school now that I have a career I want to pursue and it feels immensely motivating to study hard for it.

I talked to my local community college adviser and registered my degree as business administration (there was only a choice between accounting and business so no finance). Looking back at my past records made me realize how much I messed up my GPA and it made me lose a lot of confidence.  On top of that, it worries me that I won't even be able to transfer to a decent school because of how poorly I did previously and because I took so many credits already that it tanked my GPA so theoretically I don't think I can raise it to a 3.5 or even a 3. I know that once I transfer my GPA will reset  but at this point will business schools even accept me ? I hear that they care a lot about GPA and business has become even more competitive these days. The school that I want to get into and to further pursue my career at has quite the competitive business school and my adviser said I'm not going to get in which is understandable but other 4 year universities would take me in for sure.

Which concludes to the main question, should I still push through with it anyway and focus on getting my associates in Business Administration and then transfer to some 4 year university to finish my bachelor's?

Is becoming a financial analyst even a realistic goal for me?  Should I finish my bachelor's at some 4 year uni and apply for a good masters program? Do I still have a chance with the dream school if I did a lot of extracurricular activities? Also any tips on finding an internship related to the finance field with no experience at all?

Just throwing it out there, I'm an INTP and asian.

&amp;#x200B;

Honest feedback to the situation is very much appreciated."

I have a bachelors in Aeronautics but other than being a commercial pilot I don’t know how this will help me because I screwed up and did not do any internships or make any connections in college.

I know that maybe there could be options out there for someone with a bachelors degree but I do not know where to look. 

Does anyone with more life experience know how to start from scratch at this point to get into a career? I do not think I can afford anymore schooling at this point.

This was all based on my impending conversion into a normal employment, which for some reason is not happening right away and that would take another 5 months at least. Based on this info, I decided to continue stay with my friends and postpone getting my own place. And hence wanted to cancel my loan with the bank.

But the problem was I had made it into an FD (same bank account), so that I would not end up utilizing a penny for anything else. Now the bank is considering it as utilisation of funds and have told me that I can't apply for cancellation, but has to go for the preclosure and pay some amount, which is to the extent of 20% of the interest on the loan amount.

Now I don't know if I should go for preclosure (which I can't afford right now) or just continue with the loan, even if I do, what do I do with that money?

csgclz,12,2019-08-19,Desperately Need Advice on Launching Career (Bad Situation),Screwed12345,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/csgclz/desperately_need_advice_on_launching_career_bad/,"I graduated 3 years ago with a B.S. in IT, specifically focused on systems integration. I have a minor in cyber security as well (but it wasn't incredibly in depth). By the time I graduated, I wasn't exactly in love with the work I was headed towards. Then, I ended up completing an internship that ended up giving me no actual relevant experience, and that was sort of the last straw for me.

I began investigating other career paths, and after nearly a year I decided on a new (totally unrelated) path. I took some prerequisite courses to bridge the gap and then I was hit by some health issues. It threw my life off course and hit me pretty hard financially.

Thus, I'm at a point where I can't think about continuing my education because I need to get a decent paying job soon. So, I'm 3 years removed from graduation, nearly 30 years old now (my Bachelor's was also interrupted by health-related things, thus my age), and I feel so far removed from my formal education that \*I\* wouldn't even hire me. 

WTF do I do? Try and refresh my memory as best I can, find my notes from school, etc? Just spam applications to anything semi-relevant and just try and make something happen? Everything entry-level I find requires 3-5 years experience. It's madness. I apply anyway, but I'm not hearing back thus far. Why would you hire a 30y/o with no experience and a huge gap on the resume over a 22y/o with no experience? I really need some constructive advice on how to proceed here.

Thank you in advance."

cshazc,1,2019-08-19,"Unrelated Bachelors, considering an MSCS but have some questions. Advice appreciated!",robin_nohood,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cshazc/unrelated_bachelors_considering_an_mscs_but_have/,"Hey r/cscareerquestions,

As the title states, I’m considering doing an MSCS. My goal would be to gain an educational background in CS to ultimately work as a Product Manager in tech, but would likely start as a Software Engineer. Here’s my story:

- 2 years work experience at the moment. 6 months as a Sales Rep, 1.5 years as a Product Manager in the construction industry (mostly BizDev &amp; Marketing duties).

- B.A. in Journalism. 3.4 GPA.

- Very little programming experience. Currently working on self-teaching SQL &amp; Python.


I work for a small company that doesn’t build products, just sells them (we’re a distributor). Almost 0 upward mobility. I REALLY need to pivot into something more substantial that will give me more opportunities and a more rewarding career, which is where going back to school comes in.

I received a message from a recruiter for Northeastern University’s Align program, which is a program from non-CS graduates to earn a Master’s in CS. It’s a 2.5 year program with a paid co-op (internship) included. I’d really like to consider doing it full-time, but I have some questions:

- I know the importance of relevant work experience. How likely is it that I could find a part-time programming job with a tech company while in school?

- Would I have any sort of leg-up in the entry level job market (due to my PM experience)?

- What kind of salary should I expect after graduation?

- Would this MSCS be valuable in furthering my desired career as a PM in the tech industry?

- Does anyone have ANY advice regarding my situation? Have any of you been on a path similar to mine, and how did it work out?


Any help/feedback/insight is very appreciated, good or bad. This would be a big move for me and I want to make sure it’s logical. Thanks!"

He really sold me on this job and my only concern is that it won't pay as much as I want.

Google says $31k is the median for a job like this.

A little about me:

- 4 year degree, BS in Computer Science

- Two internship experiences, one was $12/hr and one was $18/hr which respectively translates to ~$25k and ~$37k annually

- I've had one job offer for a full time technical writing position that I had to turn down because of the location, that would have been $56k.

- No prior insurance industry knowledge but I have solid exp in technical writing as well as programming/web development (but I'm more interested in reading/writing and detail oriented work, and willing to learn anything and get specialized in whatever)

Should I assert $56k or will they turn me down for asking too much? I'm not willing to go below $45k."

How should I go about applying without letting my boss know?,WeathermanTook,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/csl5et/should_i_tell_my_boss_that_i_am_applying_to_other/,"Hey all! I have an issue that I have been struggling with for about a year. I graduated from college in December of 2016 and joined a super small business in January 2017. The owner is a friend of the family, and the clients that she works with are also very friendly with my family. It was supposed a temporary position of 6 months, but I ended up staying when my other plans fell through. After about 1 1/2 of working here, I started to think that I was being taken advantage of. I’m working as a “contractor,” and that means that my boss doesn’t have to pay taxes/benefits, etc., but still treats everyone as employees (we have to be at our desk from 9:00 - 5:00 and always on call if she needs help. I am making less than $30k a year before taxes, but have the potential to make more money on commission (this is typically a couple of hundred extra every month or so, but I just got our highest paying client since I am the last one here). This is my first “real job,” and all the past part-time jobs were not in a typical office setting, so I really didn’t realize how unusual everything is here. The business has my boss and then at least 3 or 4 full-time employees with one or two interns. But we have a high turnover of full-time employees (my boss has fired multiple people, and people tend to leave after about a year of working here) and interns are only around for about six months or so.

I kept telling myself that I couldn’t leave just yet because of several reasons (“I still have things to learn” or “no one makes great money right out of the gate” or “I can’t leave my boss hanging” or “I don’t know what else I want to do”.) We had a massive deadline on June 30th and back in January, I told myself, “Once June 30th is over, I need to be GONE.” But then in May, my boss fired her second in command and purged the office of two other people that weren’t “loyal” to her. So it was down to my boss, me, one other full-time employee, and one intern. About a week later, the other employee had a fantastic job offer and left. Once the deadline past, I was getting my resume updated and ready to send out; then my boss scheduled surgery with a six week recovery period. I am literally the only person in the office right now that has any knowledge of how to do things. We have hired new people, but again, they are brand new, and I am the only person left who knows how to do the job. I have been training the new hires, but it takes about 3-5 months to achieve knowledge of how everything works and the skill to use it.
 
Here to the actual questions: Can I apply to jobs without having to let my current boss knowing anything? I am scared that if I tell her that I’m applying to other jobs, she’ll convince me to stay. Also dealing with references, if they ask, how do I let them know that my boss doesn’t know I’m looking to leave? Or should I sit down with my boss letting her know that I will be applying to other jobs and that she needs to focus on hiring other people to replace me?

I am so sorry that this is more of a rant/ramble, but I am reaching my breaking point with this. I need advice. Has anyone had a similar experience? Or watch someone go through it?"
csl7qc,1,2019-08-19,What to do after 'failed' business and mental health issues?,Sweatygun,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/csl7qc/what_to_do_after_failed_business_and_mental/,"\*Long story short\* got my expensive generic degrees, started a business after school, had some success but had to take a hard step back because of a medication-induced nervous breakdown....\*slowly\* recovering, what do you think my next steps are?

25 living with parents outside NYC (commutable distance)

Had a 'new product development' internship in 2015 at a prominent software/webapp firm;

Took on my MBA right after undergrad since I didn't line anything up for after school (Loyola University Maryland 2016, Marketing and Information Systems). Fell in love with drone photography and videography (long-time geek and photographer), got my part 107 certification and started business to see where it went-&gt;started having some success in 2017, filed LLC, however, spread my grasp a little too wide-did jobs in multiple verticles- commercial real estate, marketing firms, construction, mapping/survey...tried to be a jack of all trades in the commercial drone environment in my area. Struggled to breakeven through the rest of the year as I'd reinvest all revenue back into business for marketing experiments and exploring the new industry. Most of the experience was one big prolonged bootstrap and attempting to satisfy my wantreprenurial aspirations.

Continued on this course until mid-2018 when I had a major setback with my mental health: had to rapid taper Klonopin which I was given back in 2015 by a shitty psychiatrist...shouldn't be on that stuff for more than 4 weeks realistically. A quick google search will yield thousands of results for 'benzo withdrawal' but my psychiatrist told me to ignore it... By about September 2018 had to take a hard step back from business activity considering I couldn't answer a text or an email without having a panic attack. Both psychological and physical symptoms (nasty restlessness I'd imagine heroin withdrawal to be like) were pretty unbearable. Took it day by day, days became weeks became months. 10 months later I'm still just trying to pick up the pieces. Haven't formally dissolved the LLC but the latter half of 2018 and first half of 2019 had barely any activity. Had to flake on past clients through most of this time because the emotional pain was too intense...I was really a mess. Unfortunately also currently tapering off the Zoloft too and this continues to throw me in and out of that psychotically depressed headspace...but in the long run I know these things have caused more trouble than they're worth so I look forward to being off entirely sometime over next few months. My mental health situation is still a balancing act but I'm optimistic I'm headed in the right direction it's just getting off these meds. 

Now I'm very much at a fork the road. I've been seeing progress in my psychological state the past 4 months, slowly but surely. My parents are supporting me emotionally and financially and try their best to understand the situation. I'm finally in a state where I can leave the house (first month was the worst), and I'm nearly confident I could work a part time, or even a full-time. I don't want to say I've given up on my dreams of being a successful small business owner but I don't want to kick the can down the road any longer and the smartest thing to do is take advantage of where I live and utilize my expensive degrees (yes student debt is very much a factor). I started doing weddings again which is nice because it's the only real income I've had this year

I'm trying to figure out how to spin this nasty hiatus into a positive, and also figure out where I should start. My internship was now 4 years ago...Is this too long of a gap? I reached out to one of my managers on LinkedIn recently applying for a nice entry-level product analyst job that was perfect for me but he or the company hasn't replied. 

Should I just shotgun approach jobs utilizing business grads? Drone sector is still super new, can't find too many listings for jobs like that but I low-key want to move on from drones and actually pursue a path a bit more defined. Entrepreneurial activity is exciting and I may even miss it, but as I continue to recover my mental health I think it might be best I have some direction over the unknown that is small business ownership."

I've done fairly well in my classes so far (\~3.9 overall), but up until recently I didn't think I had it in me to actually pursue CS as a career. This summer, I decided to push back on my imposter syndrome, join some online communities for women &amp; LGBT people in tech, and start focusing on software engineering in a serious capacity. I spent the summer learning Swift and am building an app for a museum on campus. I've also been practicing on leetcode, but it's been slow going; I can generally solve easy questions--sometimes even solve them intelligently--but I'm certainly not going to be blowing anyone's mind on a whiteboard. 

In short, I feel like I'm a junior with the resume/experience of a sophomore. I have one or two jobs listed on my resume (in addition to the side projects, technical skills, etc.) that are in line with my previous, unrelated career trajectory just to show that I haven't been twiddling my thumbs for the past two years, but I've gotten a handful of rejections based on a resume screen and that makes me nervous. So I guess I'm wondering: what are some internship programs that put more emphasis on behavorial qualities/learning ability than technical skills? In other words, what are some programs designed to get one's foot in the door? I know smaller companies often have programs of the sort, but I haven't seen many that are recruiting at this stage. Companies that have diversity in tech programs are especially of interest. Thanks so much in advance!"

It was all rooted into the fact that I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life (still do) after college. I changed majors which helped a lot during my sophomore year, but I’m going into my junior year extremely stressed and unmotivated. I really enjoy my major and find it interesting (info tech), but I never have enough motivation to remember things I learn in the long run. This year I’ll have to find a summer internship required for graduating credits, but I feel too under-qualified to land any. There are so many different things you can do with an IT degree, which is a benefit and curse for someone like me who’s lost. 

I want to note that I’m an honor roll student, so my mental health has yet to hit me to the point where I’m on the brink of failing classes. I’m just one of those people who went to school and stayed home their entire life, so education is basically all I know.

csnpzf,2,2019-08-19,Depression and Interview Prep,NegativeMess2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/csnpzf/depression_and_interview_prep/,"Hi everyone, 

I apologize for the long post but I really need some guidance. 

A little background about myself: I recently graduated from undergrad (i started fall of 2013). When I was in my sophomore year, I was diagnosed with Major Depression and anxiety which I am still dealing with to this day. I withdrew second semester of that year and I took off one semester in junior year.  I was not initially pursuing a career in software engineering. I started out school as pre-med, and upon some soul-searching switched to Computer Science (in my junior year) because I felt that I did not like pre-med. I've had one small internship that I got because I knew the guy that ran the company. No real projects in my portfolio. GPA was like a 2.8. I am currently seeing a therapist.

So based on the above, I already really lack confidence. I feel like I can't do anything right. The basic advice I've been given is use Cracking The Coding Interview (I'm using Interview Cake so I can email someone when I have questions about a problem) and power through. Just somehow grind through and it'll make sense. The problem is, when I go through some of these problems that I got wrong, I just feel like a complete moron and that it will never make sense to me. I think that I would never come up with that solution on my own. Then I lose motivation to make side projects because of that, which makes me feel bad about my prospects, which makes my motivation to do interview practice problems go down in this never-ending, vicious cycle.

I know I'm not a complete idiot. I made it through my classes (though I basically forgot the algos class over the past year), and I've made some good projects in school and at the internship. But I still feel like there's no hope and that I'll never get a job. 

So fellow redditors who have gone through something similar or are depressed and made it to a good career, what did you do? What do you suggest that I do? Thanks for reading the post, and for your time.

TL; DR Depressed, how do I interview?"

Of course, Biotech is also an option, but I have to get my foot in the door with some CS knowledge first, right?

TLDR: considering a career switch from bio into CS, but will be graduating uni soon. Looking for advice /feedback / recommendations for bay area programs that teach programming skills within 1-2 years."

I am a **Masters in Computer Science** Aspirant from India. I am aware that the no one can really chance me. That said, I hope to get some perspective on what I could do to improve my chances.

(Spoiler: This is going to be a long post)

I am looking to get into T20 or T40 that are in either US/Canada/Europe. (In that order)

Competitive exam scores:

* **GRE: 166Q, 154V, 5.0 AWA**
* **TOEFL: 105**

Academic History:

* **GPA**: 7.48 over 10 from a no name college.
* GPA went like: **6.6, 7.10** ,(Sem 1 and Sem 2: Bad Breakup of 2 years) **7.1, 7.76, 6.93** (Just when my exam prep habits were improving and I was learning to deal with exam anxiety from year 1, Grandma died less than a week before exams. Was close), **7.44, 8.3, 8.43** (I don't know how it will be perceived. Given other details that follow)
* **Research Experience**: No Academic Research.
* **Internships**: ***2***

1. **Android Development and Enterprise Java Dev** (Fortune 500 Oil Co. in my country) (2 months)
2. **Web Development Internship**: Developed a bulk-emailing tool right from scratch using low level tools and learnt how to use varying data models beside SQL. Developed application layer from head to toe: HTML, Application logic to Server Config.  Learned a lot many things. (6 months)

* **Thesis Project**: Developed a Full-scale Notification System covering use cases for information management in an educational institution. Worked on all aspects of it: Android Dev, Web Dev, Database Layer as well as Application Deployment.
* **Others**: Participated in various workshops during college and tutored juniors 3rd year onwards on Some CS Subjects.
* **Graduated**: August 2017.
* Kept studying about various other areas online: ML/Image Processing/CV.

Professional Journey:

* Joined a product based startup as a Full-stack Developer. Liked product development and the role helped me learn to build solutions beyond just writing code but thinking about the bigger picture.
* Worked on container based virtualisation, Distributed architecture and focused from developing full stack products to learning the product life cycle.
* Left after about 9 months.
* Co-founded a startup in August last year.
* Have been working on Computer Vision, Information Retrieval and NLP Related Problems since then. Developed products for use in Video Analytics.
* Worked on the problems related to **Video Processing and Streaming, Face Recognition, Web Crawling, Image matching, Object Detection and Recognition and Robotics(UAV Systems)**.

**What I look to gain from the Program**:

I want a thesis based program. I want to get into research based roles from here, either in the industry and academia.

I am interested in studying, specifically, Machine Vision and Perception, its application to problems in the Robotics sub domain, learn more about General Purpose AI, with an aim to build deeper ground in these subjects that completely amaze me and that I can grasp rather well now.

That said, I come with an open mind and I am open to working on more or less anything I find interesting, even if not directly related to these areas.


Another query I have:

I understand that all of this might/might not get me to a place that I want to get to (T20/T40), given a definitely unimpressive academic history. In that case, Based on your experience, or that of anyone else you know, what would be a realistic target list of universities I should focus on? Or at least what should I keep in mind while choosing the universities I apply to.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I appreciate your thoughts."

Sure, some of my classmates are pretty anti-social, but a lot of the people I’ve met through engineering are incredibly social. Additionally, I finished up my first internship last week, and my boss told me something that really stuck with me: any engineer can solve problems, but if you’re not able to properly communicate with your friends/peers/coworkers, or present your results to a group of people in a way in which ANYONE could understand your reasoning, then who cares? The best engineers are incredibly extroverted.

So, future engineers who might be a little shy, I think it would be a good idea to work on our social skills!"

Being a full time college student looking for his first internship, I was thrilled when GG called me for a phone interview for an internship in my field. In my interview they said this was a full time internship, so I knew what I was getting into. 

I’m informed by HR that they want to do an on-site interview, on Thursday at 8am. She then said she will follow up with the location. The day before my interview , I still had no idea where I was interviewing at. I emailed her, and no response. 

I finally got an email THE MORNING OF about the location. I wasn’t familiar with the area, and had an hour to find out where this plant, that was all the way back from the road, and had multiple doors, was and where my interview would take place. I was 15 minutes late, but this didn’t matter. I BOMBED the interview and said some cringe worthy things out of nervousness. Then I got a call that I, strangely, got the job. The HR lady says to go to this temp agency and get all the paper work and drug test done. Weird. Also to note, on the phone, she was super eager for me to hurry up and accept. Whatever I did, 

Fast forward to my first day. I walk in and I end up standing there for awhile for someone to come get me after someone asked what my business was. Someone finally walked in, took me upstairs, and showed me my desk. He advised me to wait while he got things situated at his desk. For an hour I sat there with nothing to do, no one even acknowledged my existence. Finally, I get set up with scanning documents, and that becomes my job for the next month. Coming in, scanning huge piles of documents, and leaving. 

Eventually I got set up with other tasks, but people frequently ignored me. My requests for help would go pretty ignored to the point where I had to hunt people down and ask in person. To which I would get some lackluster response. I was never told “good job” or even given any feedback on my performance. The only time one of the head honchos talked to me was when they needed something, and boy was one great at making me feel dumb. 

I worked my butt off, and I even got suckered into helping the company with a big inventory move. Me, a full time college student, worked 10am to 10pm for five days, after I initially said I have class. I was a warehouse worked that week. 

I was a ghost around there for awhile. No one acknowledged me, talked to me, and I got kind of tired of it. 

I was in a wedding party that April, and I started in December. I told my superiors and HR several times months leading up to April, I was a groomsman in my friends wedding and needed to take some days off. They said sure, no problem. Around that time, I also emailed HR and said I was considering taking summer classes, and if I could cut my hours back a little bit. She said she would talk to my bosses and let me know. 

The day before I left on vacation, I worked like normal did some things, had someone cover me while I was out, and it was a normal day. I talked to everyone and said I would see them Monday. The next day, the temp agency called my parents house phone, not my cell, and told my brother they ended the internship. When I got back that Sunday and heard this, I called in and inquired. The temp guy said I did a good job, but they decided to end the internship. 

I was completely blindsided and had no job. They all acted like I wasn’t getting fired, or whatever. The temp person said they all thought I did a great job, and I could ask my bosses and HR for a reference and letter of recommendation. They all ignored my calls and emails about this. 

Never again will I settle. Now I’ve had companies ghost me, etc, but nothing ever like this. 

It was a learning experience, and this four years ago. What a lesson about red flags."

Got addicted to video games and sacrificed some of the best worry-free, obligation-free times to play pointless games (which have nothing to show for now). Got into college ""Get a good gpa so that you graduate with a good looking resume! Get internships so you have experienced!"" again... sacrificed some of the BEST times of my life to stay inside and do homework, or because I was too exhausted from 40 hour weeks + online classes/homework. Now... My friends who called? they don't call anymore. They've got girlfriends, kids, high paying jobs, satisfying lives, purpose... social events... Me? I don't have any of that. Never learned to talk to girls, lacked confidence and was too anxious about ""building a good future"" for myself. The jobs I worked so hard all those years to get so that I'd get paid good and finally live? They don't pay, salespeople are lying sacks of shit, I don't have a STEM degree, and there are 100+ other applicants for anything around $15.00/hr which is barely livable, and requires you stare into a screen at least 40 hours/week, most require after-hours and rotational weekends now too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to do this anymore. There is no fucking point. I don't have friends that I see anymore. I'm too depressed to even want to. I have flat fucking feet so bad that I can't work out anymore, damaged them way beyond repair after a 15 mile hike 4 months ago. Feeling my health deteriorate, about to get fired from this job I hate with no backup plan, no interests, no desire, no drive.  I just want to go to Walmart and buy a shotgun and scatter my brain. 

The only thing preventing me from doing that is that my mom/dad/brother/extended family would be sad, and view me as selfish for doing so. I don't want to leave them with the financial burden of apartment/car/phone/whatever else, but I don't want to live either. I truly don't want any part of any of this shit anymore. Any decent ship I could've boarded, sailed. and I'm clueless.

Recently I got an email from someone with a company called Molex, inc. looking for students who wanted to work in a research support position. I am a fourth year undergrad neuroscience student and I get a lot of emails through the school for job offers like this so I emailed back that I was interested. I received another email the following day telling me the pay and general job duties (i.e. mostly research with some administrative work.) so I gave them the contact info they requested.

I waited nearly a month before I got a response via text message. I was sent a check with my first week's pay and enough money to buy a laptop, printer, and date stamp. They said they will give me my first assignment once I get the aforementioned items.

I'm confused because I was under the impression that I would be doing work as a research assistant. I looked up the company and it seems legit. But everything about it seems strange to me. Are they providing a printer and laptop for me, or am I meant to send it to someone? I already have access to both those things. Is this a common thing, and will I be working remotely or long distance? I've never heard of a job setup like this before.

But what really bothers me is the wording in some of the texts. When I asked for them to elaborate on what kind of work I would be doing (I thought I might be working in lab setting like my internships have lead me to believe) he wrote back almost word for word what was in the email, which was vague to begin with, and that I don't have to ""worry about a thing."" 

Is this a real job or have I managed to get myself into something shady? Should I send the money back and cut off all contact?

The TLDR is that I hate the job that I do, no matter the amenities they throw on me and I want to know if I should quit.

The long of it is as follows:

A couple of years ago, my family (military) moved back to the States from Europe. It took me a month to find a job at a bank, which I hated. So I looked for another job and ended up working at a call center for a big box retailer that’s well known in the US.

When I joined the call center, they had billiards, a nap room, on-site gym, study room, and were completely supportive of me working on homework between calls. I loved it there so much, I happily signed up for all the overtime that I could get my hands on in the first year. I would work 12-14 hour days because I loved my team and I loved what the company said they stood for. A little over a year into my time with the company, I found myself getting bored. Not unhappy, but I wanted a change of pace. I switched teams and got onto a team that I loved even more than the first one and a (somehow) even better boss than the first team too. The change didn’t work. There was an offer for an internship in a field that I had interest in, but no formal training. Without getting into the messy details of it, I didn’t get the internship, even though I was promised at least an interview.

From the moment I was rejected for the internship within my company, I started skipping as many days as I could manage without getting fired. I used up my sick time as soon as I got it. It came to the point where they had me on a final, which deemed me un-hirable to the company for 6 months. This came to light on April 9th, meaning I’m at the brink of being fired until October 10th (+ extra hours just in case). In that time I have gone on no less than 4 leaves of absences (LOAs) each spanning 3 weeks long minimum. I have a therapist who is happy to sign off on whatever time I need. It’s that bad. 

The current LOA I’m on has been since July 6th or so, and I’ve kept myself busy with school and freelance / contractor work. I dread going to that place and I’ve only managed to work 3-5 weeks at a time before I absolutely have to get out of there. 

Today, while browsing r/askreddit, I found a thread of people who just quit their jobs. A lot of the symptoms that they felt is what I’m currently feeling. I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I just know that no one in my life would support my decision to leave without sticking it out until the final falls off. October is around the corner, I’m literally counting the days until I’m free. What do I do? What would any of you do if were experiencing this level of work burn out? I need to know what I’m thinking and feeling makes sense and that I should go, OR that I should tough it out for another 51 days. 

Please note: it’s also 2 am since I’m writing this and I just can’t be arsed to check for spelling / grammar / format. Please be nice."

* I am a very strong student with a 4.0 GPA, but I go to a relatively mediocre (Times Higher Education 801-1000) school with no co-op program or major recruitment opportunities.

* I have much higher-than-average social skills as far as math/CS students are concerned.

* I do not currently have any side projects of my own.

* It is not practical for me to switch majors to a full-CS degree now, but I intend to fill in the gaps in my CS knowledge by studying certain topics myself after my degree.

* I have never done an internship, but I would really like to try to get one next summer.

Is it reasonable for me to switch my orientation from academia towards software engineering given these circumstances?  Do you folks have any advice for how I could make this transition as seamlessly as possible?

Thanks."

I got three offers, help Desk Intern, QA Specialist Intern, and somehow I got an offer as software engineering intern.

I was wondering which one of these internship would be better for me as my first internship? I hear help desk intern would be a start it will be basic stuff. I thought about QA specialist but I heard it gets such a bad rep even to have it on your resume, but the company that offering this position says mostly all their previous QA intern transition to  dev position within the company.  I'm skeptical about the software engineering  intern position  because during the technical questions they didn't ask anything any coding questions, and their offer hourly rate was below the average rate a software engineer intern would get in my area. 

Basically I just hope I don't make the wrong decision, I was wondering if anyone here and give me some advice."

So I guess my question is what year do students normally intern. I’ve read that it’s generally after 3rd year. But if I was at a UC wouldn’t I have more of a shot at interning before that. Or will going to a CC as a Digital media major be worth it?

I’m also kinda worried I’ll be missing out on college campus life( I’ve heard that CC social life isn’t the best). My brother attends a UC and I’ve visited and it really makes me think I should be doing the same. I was accepted to a college in Boston (out of state) which I really wanted to attend but the tuition price is what steered me away. My parents said they would have helped pay for it with loans and such but I really didn’t want to end up in a lot of debt.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a small start up asking me for my availability for this upcoming semester to work part time. I will be graduating from University in May 2020 and already have been doing interviews for full-time Software Engineer positions after graduation. That being said, I've only had one software engineering internship and I feel like my experience is lacking in comparison to other full-time candidates.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously experience is king, but I've already been getting interviews without this part-time internship and do not think it would help all thaaat much in trying to get a ful-time position. Additionally, I really enjoy to TA students and be a tour guide on campus. Also commuting to this part time internship would kind of suck and I am unsure just how much time I can commit to this internship. Additionally, I might have to take a decent amount of time off for on-site interviews. Also I am taking 19 credits this semester.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think, should I stil try to make time for this part-time internship for the experience or just keep doing the extracurriculars I want to do?"

Asides from the MSc being fairly intensive, I switched supervisors in March, so my thesis research project is fairly behind. I also still have one more course to complete in Fall, whereas most students would have already done their four courses in the first two semesters. For this reason, I don't have a lot time to be doing interview prep (LeetCode, CTCI, etc). This lack of time has has me neglect my personal life for the last year+, which in turn has wrecked my academic/career productivity, ... so I often do a terrible job trying to balance the two and in the end both aren't handled very well.

My MSc is from a top ten CS program and I specialize in Machine Learning in Healthcare. I've been involved in a few good research projects and we've put out a few publications, but I also haven't had any groundbreaking discoveries of my own, so I'd consider myself a fairly average researcher. I am Canadian and my undergrad was from a decent Canadian university. I interned for Intuit in Canada doing frontend for a year, for Intuit in the Bay Area for 4 months on DevOps work, then 8 month at Uber NYC on backend engineering. I received a return offer on all internships, but declined Uber to go back for MSc. My goals are to sort out a bunch of personal goals and tasks I've been neglecting, but I also want multiple offers and to ideally end up at a top tier tech company in the US doing backend end, maybe some ML. I know the interview cycle is long, but not sure how long, so any tips on trying to time this right?

TL;DR - Finishing my CS MSc around Dec/Jan and considering taking a 1-3 months off for a mix of personal time, travel, and interviewing/interview prep. Pros and cons of this?"
ct0b08,14,2019-08-20,"Toilet leak that resulted in 130,000 gallons of water usage (and an $1,100 water bill...)",easymoneypiper,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ct0b08/toilet_leak_that_resulted_in_130000_gallons_of/,"Hello all,

This is my first time posting on this sub. Background: I am a current grad student and I just moved out of a house that I rented with two fellow classmates for the last year. We have always been responsible for utilities. Over the past year, the account with the local water authority was in my name I collected the funds from my roommates to cover each bill. Each billing cycle was a three-month period was never over $150 per billing cycle. I never had problems with the landlord and he had always been fair when it came to repairs. 

Fast forward to now: I moved out of the house last week and went online to cancel my account with the local water provider. To my surprise, I found that the current bill for the May-July billing cycle was over $1100, indicating that my three-bedroom house consumed 130,000 gallons of water during the three-month period.

I immediately contacted the water company because I believed there must have been a mistake. The water company responded that there was no mistake and that the meter had been checked twice. The water company then told me to contact my landlord to arrange for a plumber to check the property for leaks.

I then called my landlord and he said that while conducting an inspection of the house after we moved out, he noticed the water was running inadvertently from the bathroom toilet. I'm no plumber, so please excuse my lack of technical terms regarding this issue. Basically, the water in the toilet was stagnant but the back of the toilet would refill itself very frequently. He called it a ""leak"" and said he was not responsible for the high bill because we did not notify him of the issue.

This is where it gets tricky. Because I am a student, I received a summer internship out of state. I moved out of the house on May 11. However, before I moved out of the house, on May 6, I contacted my landlord saying that the toilet ""kept making noise and I believe it could be wasting water."" He sent a repairman out the next day and told us it was fixed. The toilet continued to make the noise, but because of my lack of knowledge on plumbing/toilets, I assumed there was nothing to be worried about and that the toilet was just going to continue making this noise.

Once I moved out on May 11, I subleased my room to another student. Part of my sublease agreement with the new tenant included a provision which stated that I would continue to pay for utilities, including the water bill. After speaking to the landlord about the high bill, I called the sublessee and he said the same noise was present when he moved in and continued for the remainder of the summer. The only issue here is that the sublessee never contacted the landlord about the noise because he thought it was normal too.

My question here is how should I go about resolving this situation? Is it the landlord's duty to cover this cost? Does it make a difference that we never contacted him a second time after the initial contact? My past roommates do not want to split the bill with me because the toilet was in my private bathroom, so there was no way for them to know about the sound coming from the toilet. Should they help cover the bill? As mentioned earlier, I am a student with very limited means and simply can't afford a bill this large. 

Thanks for your help!"

I'm lurking this sub for some time now and and want to upgrade my rig. But first a tiny bit of backstory:

I'm a university student living in Germany, who has a \~6 year old pc system which in the latest games struggles to run smoothly (1080p) - even when set to low / very low settings. For the last 6 month I did an internship and earned some money that I want to spend on some new gear. I was wondering if a new GPU is sufficient or if I should switch the whole system (which obviously would help). The prefered settings are 1080p/120 fps. For reference, here is my current setup:

This community is amazing, and you guys have almost made me cry several times today, but out of happiness instead of hopelessness. Thank you!**

So this is long, but I'm in dire straits right now. If you're going to get on this post and suggest I ""get over it then"", I invite you to please just not comment. I don't want fluff advice, but I'm also in a very low place mentally right now after an extremely rough year and a half of stress, trauma, and hard work feeling like it isn't resulting in anything.

So I just graduated from this bootcamp that's well known in our city and actually has a foothold in tons of major cities in the United States. Thankfully the program is free if you get in, and people that complete it get a Fortune 500 internship if your grades were good. On top of that, our classes counted for college credit, so I was a 4.0 student, and was sent to one of our best partnerships because of it.

What they *didn't* tell us is that if you didn't get converted during your internship (the structure is 6 months of learning and 6 months of internship, then graduation), you're basically screwed because while our school had connections for helpdesk/pc repair students, they don't have really any job openings they find for software students, and often encourage us to lower our bars by ridiculous amounts just to get our first jobs. I have a LinkedIn profile that's been evaluated by a professional who holds seminars that cost hundreds of dollars (I got my eval for free through a connection with my mentor) and 1.4k *relevant* connects (a third of them are recruiters and hiring managers, a third are alumni or previous students, and a third are current software devs). I have a portfolio website, and two small projects. I have 6 months of a Fortune 500 internship. It's only been a month, but it feels like ages, because I still don't have a job. And our program promises that they'll ""help you find a job"" within 4 months of graduation, and since then, they have sent out exactly 0 software development opportunity alerts (companies that are looking to hire our students).

""That's no problem, "", I think to myself, ""I already knew I'd have to do searching of my own"". Two months before graduation I started putting apps out, and since, I've literally applied to over 150 jobs. I got up to a second round with Fortune 500 with a rare opportunity where they only wanted bootcamp grads that actually paid really well, and they picked someone with 6 more months of internship experience than me. I've been ghosted by 3 major companies who told me that they *absolutely wanted* an interview and that I only needed to call them up and schedule one on the set dates. I did. No response. I've been hounded by foreign recruiters who clearly aren't even reading my profile and are offering senior positions. I cannot leave Atlanta (my city), because I have too many personal obligations here, and my savings are down to a few hundred bucks after going to this school full time. My SO and I live together, and he's claimed that he has no problem covering the bills ""As long as I need him to"", but I, like any other sane person, question how long that will last before it puts a strain on my relationship.

I feel like an enormous fucking loser to be honest and I almost never take a break. I haven't even coded for the last month because I don't know if the things I'm putting effort into are going to make a difference. Here's what I've been doing so far:

* **Working on a blog** \-- I've been interviewing professionals in my field so that I can begin making tech blog posts on a blog and putting those posts on LinekdIn for recruiters to see to gain myself some positive attention
* **Applying like mad** \-- I've been doing nothing but applying to any and every junior positions, and some mid-level, particularly in design since I have a formal background in design and the arts.
* **Going to meetups** \-- Atlanta is a huge tech hub, and I go to as many events as I can, and I've even started attending some paid ones, something I'm not going to be able to do soon.

I haven't taken a break in a year and half honestly since I started studying (I studied front end 8 months prior to getting in on my own) and it feels like every bit of this has been for nothing. I've lost so much sleep and studied so much only to not have a job yet. **The only prospects I've had are one position that wants me to work** ***12 hours a day*** **getting paid only** ***$19 an hour*** **for a position that is an hour and a half away, and another gentleman that wants to talk to me in a bit for a position paying** ***$15 an hour*** **that's the same distance away.** The worst is that these recruiters and people from my school are gaslighting the shit out of my for their own incompetence and *insisting*, ""These are REALLY good rates for someone just starting out! You're ungrateful if you don't take them."" Bullshit. I'm not stupid. I know what going rates are, even for someone with a bootcamp as their only background. I had a really good internship, but I'm always told that 6 months is just 6 moths shy of enough experience to *really* be considered a good candidate for these positions. The only thing I can think that I can do left is apply for a few positions a day, do my blog posts, and spend the rest of my time not going to events, but picking up a new frontend framework and building some more projects (that is one thing I'm missing -- during my internship, my frontend was to be built in vanilla JS and jQuery, and lots of places want React or Angular), and to pick up a more popular back end (Node), because the logical thing would be to just keep programming, right?  I'm just terrified of doing this for one... two... three... six more months and still getting nothing back. I feel very discouraged that so many people pushed this narrative that those that go the self-taught route are in just as good a standing as those with degrees when that hasn't been my experience, even though I'm NOT applying to Fortune 500s predominantly, and definitely not FAANGs.

I know I definitely feel burnt out right now. And my depression is flaring up more than ever. I got into programming because I clawed myself out of homelessness after 3 years of struggle from 17 to 20 into a minimum wage position delivering on moped, which resulted in me getting hit by a car one day after work. I shortly lost my job afterwards for not being willing to do yet another dangerous delivery, and used most of my resources fighting a lawsuit. I got into school and skipped meals, sleep, and gave up tons of my time to get here. I don't know if it's momentary or not but I just feel really weak when it comes to morale. I don't know what the right direction is, if I've wasted time, or if I'm just about to waste more time. If anyone has any advice that would be cool."

I finished my first 2 years of college at a community college. This fall I am transferring to a university. I work at a country club, intern, and go to school.

At my country club it is mostly all guys and same with my internship. I don’t really have any exposure to building any friendships with females (I am a female). 

I will be living with my boyfriend and our two dogs off campus, but nearby. 

I’d love to be involved on campus and make friends. I’m coming into the university without knowing anyone. I was thinking of rushing to be in a sorority however I don’t really know what to expect school load wise and If I’ll truly have enough time with my work, internship and school and still have any time with my bf &amp; dogs.

I made a chart below of my schedule dividing the day time and evening per day.

My available time is the only time I’d be able to study or be involved in a sorority or have time for myself. I don’t know if it is the smartest move to add a sorority to my schedule but I wanted opinions. I just fear not having any friends without involving myself..but also don’t want to lose my sanity if it ends up being a bad move.

Rising senior studying math at a good state school this year. Just finished up an internship at a big bank this summer and discovered that programming is rewarding and way more important than knowing math. I pretty much coded for 8 hours every day, so I have some experience now. 

I'm taking as many CS classes I can this year and thinking of a master's in CS after working for a year. Fortunately, I have high GPA. I prioritize salary only slightly more than work-life balance after working at a bank. 

Questions:

1. Work at a bank vs. tech firm for a year before master's?
2. CS master's or just work till I eventually get the role I want?
3. Quant vs. Data Scientist vs. SWE?
4. New York vs. California?

Any thoughts/opinions are appreciated. Thanks!"

ct3t19,1,2019-08-20,Always thinking of the future,CWthoughts,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ct3t19/always_thinking_of_the_future/,"  I am a recent college graduate with a degree in marketing from a large state school. After college, I got a job at a small start-up doing digital marketing which is something I’ve had previous experience in. I’m about two and a half months into my internship. I took a trip to my girlfriend’s family house around a week ago and when I returned, I realized I strongly dislike what I’m doing. Don’t get me wrong, I am super thankful for the opportunity and though it is an unpaid internship I know it has already proven its value. However, my internship ends at the end of this month and I’m supposed to be going full time. I know I can’t do this longer, but with good old college loans on the horizon, I feel this internal struggle. I know a lot of other people have probably gone through this which is why I am turning to Reddit. 

To best describe me as a person, I’m a very Marco thinker. I love reading books about any of the social sciences. In high school, I worked with the arts as stage crew which are some of my fondest memories in life by far. In college, my family went through some serious changes and I went to community college for two years then transferred. When transferring, I fell into a depression but found a way out through meditation and self-help. I didn’t get too involved in my state school because of these events but I don’t really regret that. I had a great time my senior year when things finally leveled out, but now that I am out of school I feel like I missed out on a lot of great opportunities. 

The largest mental challenge I face is troubled long-term thinking. I really would love to go back into the arts field, perhaps even start a creative agency creating experiential events for sponsors. Even time I think of getting into something however my mind begins thinking of what a super successful person in that industry would be like, and more often than not it makes me feel like I can’t do it. I’m also a big follower of stoic ideology, and the famous maximum “It is not things that upset us, but our judgment about things” yet I am having a hard time finding comfort in this saying like I normally do.

I am looking for advice on how to focus on the process rather than the outcome. Secondly, I am wondering how to stop comparing myself to others. For those who are in creative agencies or places that society typically deems valuable, how do you deal with these feelings of uncertainty? Any idea would be much appreciated."

However, even though I have heard back from companies that seem interested, they seem to back away once they hear my graduation date.

Just today alone, I got one phone screen which seemed to be leading to an interview, but then I was told to look at other positions because they needed the job filled and the employee ASAP, even asking if I would relocate as early as next month. Another company just emailed me saying to reach out closer to my graduation date.

The phone screen company sent me a request for a video interview; should I even bother doing it since it was sent before I was on the phone with HR (about 5 minutes before)?

Bottom line is: Is it too early to apply for post-grad positions? If so, what month would be best to seriously start?"

I'm already getting a tuition waiver so I haven't necessarily been applying for TA/RA positions (most just offer a tuition waiver and not a stipend)

I'm getting my graduate degree at the same university I got my undergraduate degree at. Last year, I had an unpaid internship at this nonprofit during the fall semester of my senior year. Due to my performance, they offered me a spring internship, but I had to decline the offer because I had to complete a social work field placement to graduate, which they were completely understanding of. 

Now, this nonprofit JUST opened their fall semester internship applications even though the fall semester starts in less than a week. I know they had a paid position which was catered towards seniors/graduate students, so I asked them if they were hiring for that paid position. They said ""no, but we would love to have you back for our other internship opportunities"" (which are all unpaid)

* I'm taking that message as ""if you formally apply for our other internships there's a 99% chance we'll take you back""

Now on the side, I'm having a crappy time looking for paid part time jobs. I applied to 4 paid part time jobs and I've only heard back from one (it's in IT which I'm really not that interested in, but money is money) I'm still waiting to hear back from the other 3 which are much more interesting than the IT one

Should I just say fuck it and take the internship ""offer"" (aka apply for the internship and most likely get accepted) even though it's unpaid and do it with the IT job? Would it look bad on my resume if I did the same internship during undergraduate and grad school?"

I'm debt free and have a 401k etc.  My slight concern is anything can happen in 15 years or whatnot and the company can go South.  It may never happen, but I'd be 45 in that scenario with no degree and only retail experience at the end of the day.  

I've eyeballed getting into trade schools such as HVAC and becoming an electrician but the idea of the hours you need to be put in as an intern seem daunting compared what I make now.  The other option I've been looking at is Computer Science but that route guarantees I'd get into debt however I'd be more ""future proof"" that route.  

My original plan was just to work at Costco full-time and do a part-time gig on the side after purchasing a house in two-three years but now I'm being a bit apprehensive because I'd be in trouble if I lose my main job.  

Have any of you left a secure paying job to get into something different?  It feels a little bit intimidating.  Ideally I'd look into a local community college first then go from there."

I need to make sure dates are entered as ""Jan-19"" and all the cells highlighted yellow are mandatory. I have never used VBA so I am trying to figure it out. I'm pretty comfortable with STATA and have done some R and Python so I'm not that bad with coding just never used VBA before. Hoping to figure this out by Thursday as this is the last week of my internship.

From the research I've done, the following code should refer to cells that are highlighted yellow, if the vb.Yellow is the same yellow. 

    cell.Interior = VBA.ColorConstants.vbYellow

I'm note sure if the date cells being highlighted yellow as well complicates then and means I would have to do an ""and"" function or something. However, from what I have searched for dates I would put something like

    Sub Format_Dates()
        Selection.NumberFormat = ""mmm.yy""
    End Sub

In one video I've seen so far the code he wrote for mandatory cells was 

    Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
    For Each cell In Range(""C2:C7"")
    If cell.Value = """" Then
    MsgBox ""Response required. Thank you!"", ""vbinformation, ""Selection not made""
    cell.Select
    Cancel=True
    Exit Sub
    End If
    Next
    End Sub

So, I was wondering if I could something like 

    For Each cell.Interior = VBA.ColorConstants.vbYellow
    If cell.Value = """" Then
    MsgBox ""Response required. Thank you!"", ""vbinformation, ""Selection not made""
    cell.Select
    Cancel=True
    Exit Sub
    End If
    Next
    End Sub

Now I would have tried to run it myself already but the other problem I'm having is when I click play it tells me to create a name and when I enter one it says invalid procedure name. Not sure how to get around that. Getting off of work in a few minutes and going to the library. I will update with images to make it easier.

I've just finished a data science internship with a tech company and generally felt pretty good about the experience. My boss/team was happy with my knowledge of statistics, machine learning, etc (mostly using sklearn, NLTK, etc.) but where I  struggled was the CS side of the house.

For example, my team managed an application, which helps employers recruit contractors, part time workers, freelancers, etc. Years ago, they made the mistake of not requiring clients to make a selection on the job title. 

So client A can ask for a ""business analyst"" while client B can ask for a ""business intelligence specialist"" and my team would have no way of lumping these two together or otherwise quantifying their similarity. 

Fortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has a guide book on what a job should be called, its description, and a sample of skills assigned to it. Plus, the company had manually tagged nearly a million observations with the BLS codes. So I trained an ML model to classify these codes correctly.

To my surprise, I was ""the data guy"" on the team. So training a model wasn't quite the finish line. I know some SQL so I was prepared to deploy the script to the cloud, use PyMySQL etc. But my team didn't even have permission to deploy anything to the server. So I settled for making a script that can open an excel file, iterate through all the job postings, classify them as whatever code, and return a new excel file. As it stands, it'll never be in production, but it does give my team the ability to make sense of information and better understand their clients. 

However, my team (initially) wanted me to make friends with the software engineers/applications developers and incorporate my model as part of their stack. Unfortunately, I don't even know where to begin on that end. 

Would it be beneficial for me to learn more about software engineering and do an internship in SE? Should I expect experience in app development as a requirement for future data science roles? Or maybe this is more the experience you get when you're the only data person, so it's unclear what you should and shouldn't be expected to know?

Any feedback is welcomed!"

I would take the new offer in a heartbeat, save for the fact that I understand it's a pretty shitty thing to go back on my word at this point, and I'm not eager to wind up on any shit lists. Not to mention that I'd have to deal with all the trouble in cancelling my plans for my initial internship.

I guess the best thing for me to do is just to suck it up and stick with my initial offer, and hope I'll be able to land another offer with this new company in the future. But, I'm honestly having a lot of trouble accepting that. I've got until tomorrow afternoon to make a decision, so I guess I won't be certain until then."

In my line of work, we have 3 separate boards of work to do as 3 separate teams. Each team has a leader with 2-4 coordinators who help pull their weight on each board (depending on which board is busiest). I was on the slowest board of work to train on &amp; accelerated quickly. My boss moved me to the busiest board about 7 months in' as the board was having a ton of issues and I was the brightest of all to move up and help (of the people who weren't board leaders).

The board saw an immediate turnaround in production. After I was added, we stopped rolling so many project's to the next day and stopped overpaying on a ton of projects daily. During my time on this board, our leader has taken 3 separate weeks off of work for vacation. Each time he took off, other parts of our office all agreed how much smoother our board (the busiest in the office) was running under my control, while our leader was out. I was nominated an employee of the quarter, had compliments on my output etc... Even though our branch was severely down on projected goals for the year, the office was in agreement that I would be next up to become a board leader when the time presented itself.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 weeks ago, our branch manager (my boss's boss) flew out for multiple meetings to each office we had around the country. He was bitched/griped at for hour our branch was underperforming per the goals he had set. Although, our branch had lost 3 of our biggest accounts at the start of this year and our sales teams weren't bringing the output our branch needed to offset our loss of accounts.

During the past 3 weeks, our branch manager has had an absolute magnifying scope on my boards work, as we're the busiest and should be bringing in the most money. My board has anywhere from 2.5-4x the amount of work/daily as the other two boards do.

Each error myself/my board leader had, daily, for the past three weeks have been called out to us by our branch manager. Every single time. I've asked my coworkers on the other boards if they ever received these type of emails, and never. I've concluded, more work = more errors to be made though.

Today, our branch manager had my board's leader step down into a normal role. He moved another leader from another board onto ours and had me move to a different team, of less work.

Our branch manager then made an employee on that board (who's been here almost a year less than I) the leader of this board... When the general consensus before the microscope was turned on was, I would be the next up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm conflicted. In the meeting with my manager/BM when I was told I was being moved/my co-worker was getting promoted over me being he showed more initiative than I to move our branch forward. Which has absolutely blown my mind since being told.

&amp;#x200B;

Our branch is only 1.75 years old. I started during Q2 as my co-worker started in Q5. Since i've started, I've never taken a day off of work. When our branch moved offices from supported 14 people to 35, I moved over every piece of furniture, volunteered my weekend to set up every desk, computer, TV, furniture, etc. I took over our social media platforms when our HR person couldn't figure it out. When we hired sales interns, I saw their training (2 hours) and was embarrassed for them because it was impossible for them to learn how to sell our industry in two hours (I was in sales previously for another company in the same line of work). I secretly created them each a binder on everything sales the would need to learn how to actually sell our industry because there's no way they learned it in training (to which each intern thanked me tremendously and said my binders helped way more than the training ever could have). I've worked the most amount of weekends' among every employee, voluntarily because our branch needed the work done &amp; was the person chosen of everyone to move boards because our busiest was struggling. And after four months of hard work, I'm moved boards and told this other employee of ours is my new leader because he show's promise in the possibility of our branch growing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no ill-feeling towards this guy promoted, I'm very happy for him moving up. I know of the 15+ weekends I've volunteered my time, he's done 3. Among the countless other thing's I've done, I just feel all of my efforts has been shunned off because of the few weeks my team was under the BM's microscope &amp; now I feel totally worthless for my job and have no passion to work the way I have been.

The only + I see for my coworker being promoted over myself is that I'm 24 and he is 33. Nothing else. I don't want to go to manager's and bitch/cry about this because the decision has already been made. He's been promoted, the teams have switched etc. I just don't know how to go about my job going forward as I've put in so much effort to be the next person up and this has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I start looking for another job? I need some advice going forward. I know I'm not delusional with the feeling I deserved the raise in every way possible as multiple other people in my office (including the board leaders) have called me since being off work today and told me they have no idea how the guy was promoted over me. I think my BM is out of touch with the branch he runs; saw issues and felt other people in these positions could fix things.

But they are only letting me work 3 days a week which doesn't work that great for me and I had to find another part time job to cover my bills.

I applied to another internship that doesn't really have an end date, and they called me. I passed the initial phone screen and have another interview next week. This is all great since this potential job is going to let me work more hours, and pays more but I am having a lot of anxiety about possibly having to tell my manger I will be leaving.

Through out the summer we had several conversations about me staying on after the summer internship ended, and on the last week it was finalized. They told me it would only be 3 days a week and asked if i was still going to stay after knowing the hours and I said yes. And now I might be leaving just a few weeks after the internship ended and I tried so hard to stay on after the internship bc I didn't want to go back to my shitty retail job. 

So now I am not really sure what to say to him if I get this other position and I feel like they are going to be pissed since I tried so hard to stay there, and then found a new internship just a few weeks later."

I'm a Computer Science student applying for internships for next summer and I'm trying to figure out how to organize the work experience on my resume to best highlight some of the cool opportunities I've been able to partake in.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, my work experience is, in order from oldest to newest:

1. A tech startup I cofounded that went through two accelerators in the Bay Area and had funding *(we have since closed our doors)* **(Oldest Experience)**
2. An internship that I had this summer
3. A teaching assistant (TA) position for a computer science course this upcoming semester **(Newest Experience)**

(I left off a few high-school freelancing gigs that are interesting but I feel take up too much of the page to explain—let me know if this is a mistake)

&amp;#x200B;

In order to showcase my startup experience, **I'm considering ordering my experience oldest-to-newest** as opposed to the more standard newest-to-oldest. This also works out well as the TA position that I am just starting will sit at the bottom of the list as it's least impressive and I have less to say about it at this point.

I'm worried that this ordering is too nonstandard and this might confuse companies—or automated ATS systems that scan resumes for words. Does anyone have any advice for this situation?"
ctbwtu,3,2019-08-21,Break in at my apartment. What now? (MS),doggoismyfriend,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ctbwtu/break_in_at_my_apartment_what_now_ms/,"I live in a 4 bedroom 2 bath apartment in the town I attend college in. Each bedroom has a separate lease from the others and roommates are matched by a quiz you take prior to signing your lease. This is my 4th and final year living here and I planned to move out after school. For the majority of my lease I have lived alone or with only one roommate, the complex is old and often does not fill units. About 7 weeks ago a girl was moved from her previous unit to mine. I was not given details as to why or what happened to cause this move. She seemed nice and had more friends over than i would like but whatever. I had a break in my classes and arranged a 4 week internship in the town my husband lives in. I was informed by my new roommate before leaving that the complex was beginning the eviction process on her for having guests stay for extended periods. I expressed condolences and left it at that. 

Upon returning to my apartment Sunday afternoon, I found my room broken into (door frame in pieces, looks like they pried the door loose with a crowbar). I immediately called the sheriff's office and they came and took a report. Obviously I suspect my recently evicted roommate. There was no sign of forced entry into any of the other 3 rooms and the front door was fine when I came home. I spoke with my apartment's office workers and they stated they did an inspection on July 31st prior to new roommates moving in and found nothing amiss, but they did not mention when the roommate was evicted or if they did an inspection after she was gone. My roommates who were supposed to move in over this past weekend never showed up (a common occurrence for this place, I've been matched with many people over the years who simply never showed up) so I do not suspect any strangers. Whoever broke in knew I was gone and knew which room I lived in. 

The sheriff informed me that my evicted roommate had a previous police report against her though he would not say what for. Also when talking to the office they informed me that my roommate thought I had reported her for having someone living with her who was not on the lease. Additionally they had advised her to treat her dog for fleas (they had to bomb her last room because the fleas were so bad) and she blamed my dog for giving them to hers (makes no sense since they told her they treated her last apartment but whatever) so maybe she wanted revenge of some kind.

So I now have a copy of the police report with some of what was missing. I guess my question is what happens now? I'm talking to my insurance about being compensated for the loss. The more I go through my things the more I find missing. Lots of what is gone is not mentioned in the police report. Do I need to fix that? How do I get them to adjust the report to reflect loss if I do need to fix it? Additionally, should I add things that have almost no monetary value?

Can the sheriff realistically do anything? obviously she is going to deny any wrongdoing when questioned by police even if they can find her. I've pretty much written off the items taken as gone for good but I've never had to deal with this before and want to be as proactive as I can to get things done. I'd like to not live here this year but I signed a lease in May to stay until July 2020. i know I'll have to comb my lease to see about breaking it and moving somewhere else. I'm also pretty pissed at my apartment complex for matching me with someone who they knew was a criminal (they were aware of her previous report and that she was having massive problems with her old roommates, as well as the fact that she wasn't paying rent on time and was breaking all kinds of rules). I have spoken to them about, at the very least, moving me to a 2 bedroom to reduce the possibility of crazy and they said they would get back to me. I don't think there's anything I can do about the apartment complex but if anyone has ideas about that I would appreciate those too."
ctci9a,1,2019-08-21,Snapped at work yesterday,viccio123,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ctci9a/snapped_at_work_yesterday/,"I don't think I'll get fired for it but its kind of messing me up.

Rant

Some background: I'm a software engineer in the cardiovascular research department of a large company. I'm in charge of developing medical tech prototypes that are then patented and created for the company's clinics to use. I've just graduated college but I've worked there for over a year in internships because of my school's work-study program. 

Starting out as an intern they gave me some very advanced projects that I managed to figure out with ease, which caused them to keep inviting me back increasing my pay each time. I got to work with incredibly talented doctors in a great part of the state and was included in some very important research. I was able to realize my dream of creating medical technology. I was treated more like an engineer than an intern. I get along extemely well with my coworkers and boss so I am very well liked in the office.

Before I left my last internship they told me they were working on a permanent position for me at the company, which I told them I would accept. However, two weeks before graduation they told me that they couldn't beat the hiring freeze the company had (going on two years now) and that I would have to be hired as a temp. I accepted the position because two of the medical devices I developed were getting ready to be patented and would be rolled out to patients, something very important to me. Unfortunately being a temp means shit health insurance and no PTO (not even holidays!) I accepted because I trusted them that I would eventually get a permanent position.

So I accept the ""new job"" doing exactly the same thing, just getting paid more. However once I got there they started treating me like an actual intern instead of an engineer! I thought things would at least stay the same but my boss and the higher ups and some of my coworkers basically only pretend to care about me.

This is certainly a bad decision because I'm the only engineer in the department. What I work with requires specific training I have and they've mentioned they would have difficulty finding someone else. I'm the only one that actually creates the devices! None of them can make them! They give me a vague idea and I bring it into reality. They're impressed each time - but mostly at the technology. They act like these projects are easy for me and because I'm ""smart"" I should be able to figure anything out.

They hold meetings about how great the tech I developed is but they ""forget"" to invite me, even though the meetings require me to explain it. When I'm invited at the last second by my coworker, the only one who remembers, they talk about how excited they are about the projects and how much this will benefit the company, etc... They told me that they weren't even sure how to change my outlook email from ""intern"" to ""engineer"". 

Once I started they tried to shove my desk into a hallway with no windows and pretty much alone. When I asked to be placed in the same room that literally everyone else was sitting they told me they were saving the only empy spot for the ""new hire"", a data analyst they haven't found yet. I eventually managed to get a spot in the room because someone else quit the week I ""joined"". The desk they were saving for the new hire is still empty months later.

Anyway yesterday I absolutely snapped in front of everyone in the office. One of the medical devices I created that was going to be patented was forgotten by the patent lawyer. I found this out when my coworker sent me a paper about how another company got a patent pending recently on something almost identical to the technology I created over a year ago. In front of half the staff, she asked me if I got the paper - and I literally lost my shit! I started yelling about how the patent lawyer sucks and how I got screwed and I said something like : 
""I really need this patent! How else am I going to get another job, I'm still a temp!""

She took me aside and told me that I shouldn't mention about leaving the company (duh) and I told her I wasn't planning to (kind of a lie). Anyway it turns out that because I've worked there for a year and brought on immediately most of my coworkers had no idea I was a temp, and literally the only one in the office. I'm mortified that they found out because now they're acting a lot nicer to me. I know they feel bad for me.

I seriously doubt I'll get in trouble for this, considering they still need me to develop these projects, but I think I made a mistake coming back. A temp job doesn't look good on a resume.

I don't know what to do."

I myself was able to secure a job 6 months before my graduation and I'll be starting really soon. Now that I'm done with school, I've seen so many situations in regards to getting jobs. I know a good amount of folk that had better grades than me and have had a much harder time finding jobs than I have. Some of them were on my Senior Design team, and found jobs way later than me. I know some people who were in Eta Kappa Nu, the honor society for Electrical/Computer Engineers, and they didn't have a job when they graduated with their BS. So they went back to get an MS, and apparently one of them got a job at UT Austin as a Research Assistant. 

Since we're going to school for one of the most in demand majors, you would think that getting a degree, especially if you have good grades, would be a slam dunk for a job. But apparently that's not the case. I've heard plenty of people say that getting an internship/co-op, which I did last Summer, will greatly increase your chances of getting a job. Or to at least have some type of job experience, to show that you can hold a job, be attentive, learn new duties and etc. I worked all thru out school. It was a rough schedule, but if it helped me get my internship and job, then I guess I can be thankful."

What do you think about this one vs the old one (**[https://imgur.com/Z7aAzcO](https://imgur.com/Z7aAzcO)) ?

Hi everyone! I am not trying to complain, but just want to tell you my story and maybe get some good advice. So the story... I really love programming. I decided that this is going to be my career many years ago, probably at the time I started learning some coding being at age 10-11 y.o... I was relatively persistent with my plans, but didn’t code anything meaningful until high school. I didn’t really have good grades in high school, maybe because of all the mess that was happening when my family immigrated to the US. I did really well with math and sciences, though. One way or another, I managed to get to a state college. I paid a bit more attention to getting good grades and graduated in time this May with a Bachelor's CS degree, minor in Math and 3.91 overall GPA. During my wandering I tried several languages (well, at least read the documentation and wrote something bigger than 1k LOC): C, C++, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Elixir, PureScript, Elm, JS. My favorites are Java and Scala. Former one because of the ecosystem and latter one because of the language itself (type system, functional programming in general). Also I realized that distributed backend systems is something I like much more than system, mobile or frontend programming. In addition, I played with numerous frameworks, but my current stack is mostly:

\- Scala: Cats, Cats-effect, fs2, Doobie, http4s, shapeless

\- Java: Vert.x, Spring, Hibernate

\- JavaScript: Koa, React, Redux, Feathers

During my college time I didn't really worry about getting an internship. I always thought that I can learn more by myself. Also, I kept a plan in my head that I will code something decent and only then will start applying anywhere. Now I have to admit that I haven't managed to code anything interesting during those two years. Although, you can look at my github . There are some projects. They are simple, but all of them were done for fun and none of them is a lab or homework. When I finally started looking for a job, I encountered some problems with algorithms during interviews. I can't say that I had any difficulties with them before, definitely not in an algorithm class nor while making pet projects. But it is super difficult for me to write any code while being observed. After couple attempts I realized that I have to practice leetcode one way or another. I did a little (about 30 problems) until I felt less or more comfortable with algorithms. However, it was already summer break and too late to look for an internship. So I spent the rest of summer learning about functional streams, IO monad, heterogeneous lists and Scala macros.

Same thing happened to me during my senior year in college. I still prioritized getting some new knowledge over starting looking for a job. Finally I started looking for a job, but without success. I failed 2-3 interviews due to being worried too much, even though algorithms were quite simple and I could easily solve them while not being observed. I realized that I have to bring my algorithm skills to some mechanic/reflex level, when being nervous won’t matter much. I got to about 115 solved problems on leetcode (90 medium, 25 hard). However, when I started to apply again most companies just reject me without any interview. So far I didn't manage to get any job and still looking for one. I guess I am doing something really wrong. Was the internship experience THAT important? Any advice?"
cteq45,50,2019-08-21,I found a dead monk's last letter...,j_scriv,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cteq45/i_found_a_dead_monks_last_letter/,"I’m an intern of law in a small town in Eastern Europe, working for an attorney whose father and his grandfather before him were also lawyers. A few days ago, I was organizing files and came across an account that still haunts me, left with my boss’s grandfather over 70 years ago. My boss said he doesn’t dare to get rid of it, and that he was warned by his father not to read it. For all he knows, he’d said, the story it describes is true. I translated it the best I could.

This is the last letter of monk Vasily, who died in the year of our Lord 1947:

“It was the evening of Palm Sunday when I took the sheep back from grazing in the hills near the monastery, rushing to make it to evening service.

But the Devil had other plans – it wasn’t meant for me to make it back on time that day.

I noticed, at first, the sheep being restless, stopping every few steps, turning to look at me with their large eyes as if trying to tell me something. Stopping, turning, stopping, turning – especially the ram, who wouldn’t budge even when I swung my walking stick at him.

I’d reached the spring, and thought to refresh myself and give some time to the sheep to calm down – but as soon as I started drinking, something screamed and splashed into the water right next to me.

Startled, terrified, I fell back. Thought to grab my walking stick and get out of there as fast as I could, but I couldn’t move! Not an inch!

I lay there, in the water, sprawled on my back, but felt no cold. Didn’t feel anything…

For a moment longer I could hear the sheep, and then silence descended heavy as the night.

Eyes wide open, unable to blink, I stared at the sky that grew dark unnaturally fast, with swirling black clouds that brought the howling winds. They were so strong that all the shrubs around the stream bent to the ground under it, whipping at me, tearing my clothes and my skin, but I couldn’t feel a thing.

Then the pain came, as if someone tore my heart out of my chest, and I was yanked up into those black clouds that now created the shape of a giant cross, and I saw my own body down there in the stream before I sank into the depths of the sky. Light as a feather, I floated on the winds, turning into a fog that reached sprawling, abandoned cities, with roads made of white mists crawling between the buildings… I heard no sound, saw no bird, no man… just those giant cities, floating between sky and land like I was.

Thunder rumbled and I started falling, faster and faster, until I saw two men below me, with long white beards and mantles, hooded and eerie, carrying me, Vasily, between them. My consciousness slipped away, and then the pain returned.

Gasping for air, I started thrashing, pulling myself free from their grasp. I found my feet and ran like a rabbit, until one of them called after me.

“Vasily, STOP!”

Dread rose in my chest as I recognized the voice of our late Abbot, Gabriel. It had been more than twenty years since he died, falling into the river next to the watermill and drowning under the water wheel. Terror froze me where I stood. All I could do was turn around, my shaking legs barely holding my weight. I stared at the two men.

“You know me, Vasily?” Gabriel croaked with that terrible voice of his that scared me even when he was alive. Lord forgive me, but he seemed younger, straighter backed than before he died. Like he found a second youth in that soil we buried him in.

“You saw, Vasily, what no living man before you did,” he said. “Go to the monastery and tell the Prior to dig up my remains and give them proper funeral rites, put them in the crypt where all the other monks lay… You buried me on the crossroads like a vampire, like I committed suicide… Today is Palm Sunday… Tomorrow, do as I said, and tell the Prior if he doesn’t, he will die tomorrow evening… Go, Vasily, go!”

I turned and ran for the monastery gate.

I, Vasily, ever the Lord’s humble servant, told the Prior and the other monks what I lived through. They laughed at me, accused me of getting drunk, losing the sheep, and making up stories to make myself look holier than I was.

What the late Abbot Gabriel said would happen came true. That same evening, the Prior fell sick and died in pain. My life turned into a nightmare. The other monks exiled me from the monastery, after torturing me with dark spells and putting dead bat wings in my bed.

So I decided to write this account, and give it for safekeeping to a lawyer I know well. Let my story be written, and let the folk know what truly happened to me, poor Lord's servant haunted by ghosts.

Poor Abbot Gabriel, buried forever at that crossroads.”

I wanted to know what happened to Vasily, after.

The lawyer who kept his letter, my superior’s grandfather, told his son that Vasily was found dead one week after the events he described, at that same spring in the hills.

And last night, I also dreamed of poor Abbot Gabriel, buried forever at that crossroads. If I don’t find him and bury him at the monastery crypt, I fear I will be next."
ctex7r,6,2019-08-21,Has anyone here done a research internship at IISC Bangalore?,the_rat_from_endgame,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctex7r/has_anyone_here_done_a_research_internship_at/,"I am a final year student, was gonna apply for an internship for ML at IISC, preferably a long term one, like a year or so. In terms of the skills that I have, I have done some internships at startups related to ML. Besides, I have done Andrew NG's Deep Learning courses on Coursera, was working through CS 231n and CS229 at Stanford  (via their online free materials). I haven't done super great projects but I am working on a research project right now in the field of Computer Vision with a professor at my college (its a private engineering college, not one of the better ones)

I also have taken courses in my college related to Maths that comes handy in ML. These are Advanced Linear Algebra (where I learnt about various norms, SVD, etc.) and Stats (where the main focus was on Time Series). I have a good understanding of the former subject.  I also have read ISLR and done some of its course work on Lagunita.

What are my chances? I have been working on drafting mails to almost every CS professor at IISC and I needed some guidance on that. I want to know how I should prepare for it and what they expect of me. Also, if you were interviewed, how long did it take for your interview? Was it telephonic or Skype based?

Other skills that I have are : Python (great at it), Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV (worked with both, know some stuff really well, some not so much), some concepts of Computer Vision like Edge Detection, Connected Components Analysis (but I have not gone super deep into it), Data Structures (so-so), DBMS (pretty good at it, I think)

GPA: Not too great. Barely above a 3.0 (on a scale of 4)

Full Disclosure: I hope to do an MS eventually in CS and I thought doing research might be the best stepping stone for me to go abroad rather than being stuck in a job at an IT company for XYZ years."

Nervous about talking with my advisor about my arrest record.,InfiniteDisplay,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ctfvn5/need_thoughts_nervous_about_talking_with_my/,"As the title states, I have a meeting today with my research advisor to discuss getting arrested in my undergrad.  

I am a first year graduate student going into a STEM PhD field, and already have an advisor lined up from an interview and previous conversations via email.  I am very interested  in his work and he gave me the great opportunity to assist him in his research which for the most part takes place in a national lab (DoC).   However, I am 90% sure I need to get a Secret Clearance to enter this facility on a regular basis.  Wouldn’t be a problem, except.... 

In the summer of my freshman (in college, about 4 years ago) I ended up getting arrested and plead guilty to 2 misdemeanors.  Possession of marijuana and paraphernalia.  I was speeding and had weed in the car and got pulled over, I’m sure the rest can be figured out.  I was young and dumb, and have learned my lesson about the situation and never had a problem again with the law again.  I ended up getting both charges expunged after going through a program in my home state which got me through normal background checks for internships and such.  

So I know the arrest will DEFINITELY come up in a background investigation for a security clearance, and I plan on coming forth to my advisor and telling him in person about it before he’s shocked to learn I got my clearance denied.    Would this be considered the best course of action?  He seems like a very understanding and caring guy, but I wasn’t sure if I was handling the situation in the correct way.

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the comments and thoughts, I did end up bringing it up in private today during our meeting.  He was very understanding about it and appreciated my honesty and maturity about the situation.  He is originally from Hungary (just got citizenship a few years ago, worked at the lab way before that) and said that he didn’t have any long process of getting cleared, so he doesn’t think it requires a typical clearance like a secret clearance.  He is going to have me talk to the head of the group at the lab just to make sure it won’t be a problem, but that won’t be until the summer when I will be working at the lab.  

Thanks again for all the support and guidance."

In terms of the skills that I have, I have done some internships at startups related to ML. Besides, I have done Andrew NG's Deep Learning courses on Coursera, was working through CS 231n and CS229 at Stanford (via their online free materials). I haven't done super great projects but I am working on a research project right now in the field of Computer Vision with a professor at my college (its a private engineering college, not one of the better ones)

I also have taken courses in my college related to Maths that comes handy in ML. These are Advanced Linear Algebra (where I learnt about various norms, SVD, etc.) and Stats (where the main focus was on Time Series). I have a good understanding of the former subject. I also have read ISLR and done some of its course work on Lagunita.

What are my chances? I have been working on drafting mails to almost every CS professor at IISC and I needed some guidance on that. I want to know how I should prepare for it and what they expect of me. Also, if you were interviewed, how long did it take for your interview? Was it telephonic or Skype based?

Other skills that I have are : Python (great at it), Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV (worked with both, know some stuff really well, some not so much), some concepts of Computer Vision like Edge Detection, Connected Components Analysis (but I have not gone super deep into it), Data Structures (so-so), DBMS (pretty good at it, I think)

GPA: Not too great. Barely above a 3.0 (on a scale of 4)

Full Disclosure: I hope to do an MS eventually in CS and I thought doing research might be the best stepping stone for me to go abroad rather than being stuck in a job at an IT company for XYZ years."

I don't have many details as of now but have certain considerations and really need an advice.

First of all, it's AI and China seems to be rocketing in this field, and Huawei is one of its top tech companies. On the other hand, they have recently gained some bad reputation and I'm somewhat concerned with this.

I've tried to google feedback about working in Huawei but what I've found was mostly about its offices not in China and the position is open in the Chinese office, most likely in Shenzhen. I've read that Shenzhen is one of the best cities to live in China but here are my two main concerns:

1. still not fully understanding working culture in Huawei in particular and in China in general; read some frightening stories about constant overtiming and lack of communication with managers so wonder whether it also applies for IT industry and for foreigners
2. have even worse understanding of the social opportunities: I'm a foreigner who doesn't speak Chinese (I don't mind learning it but hey, it will require much time before I know it to least useful extent); I've read that China has quite nationalistic trends nowadays so such terms as ""social isolation"" and ""workplace discrimination"" come to mind - of course, it can be false perception but that's why I'm asking these questions here.

If you can share your experience or ideas I'll very thankful. Particularly hope that some of you have relocated to China or worked in Huawei. Thanks to everyone in advance."

Long story short I was forced to quit my job in Ann Arbor at the end of Winter 19 because of my summer internship.

They said they’d rehire me, but the pay sucks.

Obviously I’m way too late to be an IA for Fall 19, but I was wondering if anyone here had any insight on the likelihood of getting an EECS IA position in Winter 20.

-	Senior graduating in Winter 20
-	No previous IA experience
-	A- in EECS 183
-	B+ in EECS 280

The grades get worse after that haha so I’ll probably only apply for those two courses.

I would prefer to not go back to my previous job and just be an IA in the spring, but if I’m not likely to get an IA position then I’ll probably have to go back to my old job.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts on the matter."

* It's pretty cheap and hope it will pay for itself (6000 after Scholarships/Grants)
* I'd like to do a masters at some point anyway, I just always thought it would be at a different school.
* One more summer for an internship. (I'd be graduating in December 2020)
* Pushing back work for 1 more year :)
* Requires no GRE
* I get to take a lot of classes I was interested in that prerequisites stopped me from taking 

The cons:

* It might not be worth it if I am already getting job offers

I know the basics of programming, but I feel like I should focus on data structures and algorithms for interviews. There's a lot of libraries  that I should probably learn(such as itertools, pandas, etc), but decided to focus on the above since they're most interview based. 

I have been doing leetcode, but I struggle with it, as I'm sure many people do when they start doing it. I usually have to look up solutions to understand the logic behind it. 

I'm also thinking about buying the physical copy of CTCI to help me focus, as I get distracted by reddit and other things for the PDF version. 

I'm thinking of purely focusing on DS+A questions from CTCI and LeetCode to help prepare for interviews even though I'm far off from it. Is it worth to purely focus on that rather than OOPs and APIs. I know there's SD questions during interviews, but I'm thinking of studying that after I feel confident with DS+A. 

I noticed that some people say that they've done around 250+ LC questions before they started applying. Does that include the ones that they looked up the answers to when they starting LCing? How many questions do you usually do a day and do you just do it on the console that LC gives you, or write it on paper too. I've heard that writing on paper helps too. How many questions did it take on LC before the questions on LC started to click for you and that you can do it without much hints. 

If you used CTCI, how long did it take for you to go through it? Did you use EPI right after CTCI? I know some people here read other books like Algorithms, but 900+ pages seems like a lot of info to take in. Do you read the whole book or just skim through it?

My portfolio has some more information about myself and my projects as well as links to my LinkedIn and Github page. **My resume:** [**https://imgur.com/a/sH2hkP3**](https://imgur.com/a/sH2hkP3)

I've applied to hundreds of job applications and have had 3 interviews. 2 companies that I interviewed with emailed me telling me they filled the position. The third company said I was recommended for the final interview, but never scheduled a time for it, and I haven't heard from them in 2 weeks. I have emailed them but haven't heard back, so I assume that position has been filled as well.

I got my resume looked at, at my university's student center. They made some suggestions about how I could improve my resume and I implemented their suggestions. I have been applying for positions since improving my resume but have only noticed more rejection emails (normally I would just get ghosted). I can't tell if this is a good thing or a bad thing, honestly.

I have been applying to any city in Canada but mostly Toronto and Vancouver. I would need a visa to work in the US, and I doubt a company would sponsor someone with no experience so I have stuck with Canadian applications. I've applied to all types of positions (contract, full-time, internships) focusing mainly on software developer titles.

I will post an anonymous version of my resume here. I've been avoiding posting here altogether because it makes me uncomfortable to be under the microscope, but I have no one else to ask for help. 

I'm not sure what else to do. I feel stuck. Do I start up another personal project? work on my resume? I've wanted to work on an open source project but don't know how to contribute or how I would list it on my resume.

Im a senior studying EE and im doing an accelerated degree which is essentially a combined bachelors/masters; it lets me do my master's degree in 2 semesters instead of 3. So once I get my bachelors in May, I will be automatically going to grad school next Fall. 

My question is: What should I look to do during the summer?

I would like to do an internship, but I dont know how many local companies would be ok with only a summer internship since I would have my bachelors. My other option is to try and do research, which I feel I can get by talking to some professors, but I've never done research and im not sure how useful having research experience is when I finish my Masters and go into industry. 

My other predicament is, if I end up doing an internship, if I should continue to work/do an internship during the time in in grad school. Ive personally never worked while attending school so im not sure how my class/study time would be affected.

ctpfdp,3,2019-08-21,My mother is being abused by her manager. What can she do?,_narcissists_suck,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ctpfdp/my_mother_is_being_abused_by_her_manager_what_can/," Throwaway account in case the people involved in this situation are on reddit.

I apologize in advance for the long post. There is a TL;DR at the end. However, if anyone is willing to read this through, I am very grateful.

My mother is a qualified professional with two masters degrees and over four years of experience in her current field (speech therapy). She is commended by her patients and their families, by former internship advisers, and by coworkers (many of whom have left her current workplace because of issues similar to those that she is facing) as outstanding at her job.

She has been working her dream job for the past couple of years, and I have been so happy for her. However, I have recently become very sad and frustrated because, for the past six months or so, she has been the victim of ethical abuse by her immediate manager, who seems to be a raging narcissist.

My mother has always been very busy at her job. Although her work hours technically end at 4pm, she often stays hours later than that finishing patient evaluations and writing reports. Up until February, she figured that it was normal to have to put in extra work at this new demanding job. She accepted this conclusion because, hell, she loved her job.

However, around February of this year, she began to notice that her fellow speech therapists were consistently leaving on time and never had to stay late. Upon looking into the speech department schedule, which is public information at her workplace that any staff member can look at, she noticed that she was constantly being given significantly more evaluations and reports to do than her coworkers. She had a lightbulb moment of sorts, as she realized that the other speech therapists who were given lighter workloads were all friends of her manager. She is the only one that is not ""goody-goody"" with her manager. Now, this is not her fault at all; she is very nice and respectful and professional to her manager. However, she is many years, even decades older than her peers and manager because this is her second career and only their first. For some reason, this age difference seems to have caused her manager to resist becoming friends with my mother.

Anyways, upon making her discovery, my mother, with the help of another supervisor, respectfully presented the issue to the manager and I believe things were sorted out. But ever since that happened, the manager has seemed to be out for revenge. For months, she has been closely monitoring my mother and going after her for anything that she perceives to be an error or mistake. Instead of presenting these mistakes professionally, she raises her voice at my mother and accuses her of not caring about her patients (my mother clearly loves her patients; she talks about them for *hours* each night after work).

She has created lists of ""problems"" with my mother that she needs to fix, and has emailed them to her. None of the items on the list are quantifiable, observable, or measurable. They contain no criteria for improvement. They seem to be strings of personal attacks. The manager, for some reason, has seemed to have gotten worse with time. Over the past couple of weeks, she has been calling my mother to her office to yell at her frequently, and has decided to supervise my mother's therapy sessions. When supervising, she interrupts and disrupts the sessions, making it difficult for my mother to give good therapy.

To make matters worse, few of these ""mistakes"" that my mother is accused of, if any, are actually worthy of correction or are even mistakes at all. The main thing she is accused of is making errors while doing video swallow evaluations. The technician who is the expert at the workplace in such evaluations has written a letter to my mother's manager that essentially proved that she did not actually make any mistakes, and rather that the manager falsely interpreted some of my mother's actions as mistakes. This only made the manager's attacks worse.

Furthermore, my mother's fellow speech therapists have made similar mistakes to the ones she is accused of, as well as have intentionally written poor reports and documentation in order to go home sooner. As far as my mother knows, they have never so much as been spoken to by the manager about such behavior.

My mother is humiliated, broken, and depressed. She no longer enjoys her dream job. She has come home in tears for the past few days and it breaks my heart and makes me furious at her manager.

My mother is a loving, religious woman and is terrified of going to the CEO, HR, or other supervisors. She doesn't want to hire a lawyer or anything of the sort. Her fear is that the manager's attacks will only get worse. She is searching for other jobs, but is not having much luck. She doesn't really want to leave this job because at one point it really was her dream job.

What should she do? What can she do? She is hopeless. I am heartbroken for her. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Ever since she pointed out unfair distribution of workload to her narcissistic manager, the manager has felt threatened and has abused her to the point that she now comes home in tears from what once was her dream job. We are both looking for advice."
ctpggn,0,2019-08-21,Graduating in December - No internships and a limited amount of projects,1234511231351,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ctpggn/graduating_in_december_no_internships_and_a/,"I'm graduating in December. I switched majors half-way through my degree, and as a result have the minimum amount of classes to graduate with a CS degree. I didn't get any internships, and my github is quite sparse (one working android app, and one 1/4 finished CLI application I'm *slowly* working on). I don't have a ""stack"", and am not super familiar with a lot of the technologies companies seem to want. 

The truth is, I'm not self-driven when it comes to programming/tech. I like programming. I really do. I even get enjoyment from class projects or doing leetcode problems. But without a carrot on a stick; money, a grade... I don't really push myself to do it. I'd rather go out with my girlfriend and come home to play DotA. I've got other interests that I enjoy more than programming. 

I'm just looking for some general advice from people that are like me. It's not just me, right? My sparse portfolio is a bigger issue than my lack of internships, and I'm not sure what I can do about it. I'm still working slowly on one of my projects, but it will be a long while before it's complete."

I was just wondering if someone could take a look at my syllabus and tell me what I'm missing to start programming seriously and any maths that I might need so that I could market myself for a decent internship and show some employers a project or two that would give me an edge in 3rd year. Any links to video series or even websites would be nice. I'm looking to go into data science but I also want the standard software engineering skills. Any advice would be much appreciated."
ctppyw,1,2019-08-21,Good online courses for portfolio/CV building?,AndroidQuestion27,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ctppyw/good_online_courses_for_portfoliocv_building/,"Hi there, I'm going into the third year of university and I am currently preparing to apply to companies for internships this summer. 

My github is somewhat lacking in comparison to the rest of my cv and I am currently planning to do coursera's ""Deep learning specialization""  to fill it out about more while learning about deep learning. Would anyone know if this course would be suitable for github filler at any point? I recently got out of my internship for this year so would be able to devote 40hr/weekish for the rest of the month until applications start.

I'd ideally like to do a course instead of a personal project as although I'm fairly familiar with standard neural networks and other machine learning techniques I've yet to have any deep learning experience and would like to learn some.

Many thanks to anyone who can offer help."

ctqhur,1,2019-08-21,"What do you do when you need to work but just can’t? Long explanation, but I need help or at least a few kind words.",fallenarist0crat,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ctqhur/what_do_you_do_when_you_need_to_work_but_just/,"My mental health is in the toilet and has been for several years. I dropped out of freaking community college partly because I needed to take care of my sick father (whom I hated... which I don’t recommend doing) and partly because I just couldn’t handle it any longer. After he died I never went back. I never had enough money to pay for classes and books anyway. I just started looking for work. Couldn’t find anything and ended up taking an unpaid internship in my field that promised to turn into a paying job. For a while there my life looked like The Pursuit of Happyness until I didn’t end up getting a paying job out of it. The company eventually closed. 

Spent the next couple of years floating... mental health just kinda stayed the same. Wasn’t great, but I didn’t feel totally helpless yet. Kept applying to jobs and finally found one that allowed me to work from home. Pay wasn’t great ($16) and there were no benefits, but at least I felt that I could manage doing the job. Ended up being let go 5 months into the job because the couple who the ran business didn’t know how to manage it. Lost all their clients which resulted in no work for me. 

About a week after being let go I woke up to water pouring into my room because of really shitty weather and a bad roof. Insurance barely pays out and I have nightmares about waking up to seeing water fill my room. Contractor that we got to do the work seemed fine until he wasn’t. I’m pretty sure he screwed us over somewhere in the billing and the work was done half assed. I live with my elderly mother. Neither of us know anything about remodeling or loans or anything like that. Think the contractor saw that and used it to his advantage. Mom has a stroke due to the stress of having to pay off loans we didn’t even understand in so far as ‘remodel cost money, get money from a loan’. Contractor doesn’t care that I’m getting less mentally stable by the hour. After all, one can only say “I don’t understand” so many times before they start ignoring you. I start having new nightmares about the mortgage company taking our home that my mother once owned free and clear. I barely ever sleep again because all I think about is becoming homeless. Insomnia sets in. I worry about being able to find a job when I can barely wake up before noon. Every time the phone rings or I get the mail I panic. 

Finding a job is stressful enough on it’s own... I know that. Finding a job when you have PTSD, anxiety, and depression is damn near impossible. However, no one else seems to think so. They all think I’m fine. Everyone only worries about my elderly mother anyway. (She’s fine by the way, thanks for asking!) Everything is on me.  I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders. 

I manage to snag a job that pays me $12 under the table a month after my mom’s stroke. I actually like the job, it’s something I can do and somewhat in my field, and it’s close to the house. So you can imagine my devastation when I get a phone call after a month into it and my boss says “Sorry, but I just can’t afford you anymore.” I sorta get the feeling that wasn’t really the real reason for letting me go. I try telling my mom what happened... she makes it seem like it’s my fault that I got let go from this job and the one before it. She doesn’t understand why I’m having so much trouble finding a job. She thinks I should be able to walk in somewhere, apply, and then get called in for an interview. I try explaining that everything’s online now. That most of the time I never hear back from anyone. That sometimes the ones I do hear back from ghost me even though they seemed interested. She thinks I’m making it all up because I’m lazy and don’t really want to work. 

Fast forward to last week. I get hired as a cashier at a bookstore at the community college I used to attend. I wasn’t thrilled about the job... I’ve always known I wasn’t a good fit for customer service, but everyone keeps telling me “a job is a job”. I try to suck it up the first day, but it’s hard. I can’t focus, they barely let me know what I should be doing, and all the special student codes I have to learn are going right over my head. They put alone at a register right away. I can’t stop thinking about what happened when I got there earlier... as soon as I walked in a coworker tells me “Why are you wearing those shoes? You can’t wear those here.” I was wearing sandals. No one told me I needed to wear closed toe shoes... I swear it. I don’t own any closed toe shoes besides a pair of boots. After my first day I meet up with my mom at Target to find some closed toe shoes that fit me. My feet are small... my heels are very petite. Can’t wear flats... my feet fall out of them. I start crying in the middle of the Target shoe section because I can’t find any comfortable shoes to wear in my size. My mom yells at me. Blames me for being a failure and being let go from my previous jobs. I yell back and tell her how unsupported I feel. How lost and scared I feel every minute of every day. She doesn’t care. I don’t think she understands mental illness or even really believes in it. I think she has a few issues of her own but she won’t listen to me. Thinks everything I say is an insult towards her. 

I spend the rest of the day crying in my room and frantically looking for another job. I don’t go into work the next day. I call and leave a message for my boss telling him thanks, but this isn’t the right opportunity for me. My voice wavers toward the end of the message and I hang up. I don’t even know if he got the message. It’s been two days. Should I call again?

Fast forward to today... I don’t know what to do. I have no friends to lean on. I have no support network. My mother doesn’t listen to me. We need the money but I can’t a find a job that suits my capabilities or my mental health needs. No one understands or cares that I’m a special case. I just keep being told that Mcdonald’s is always hiring. I hate this piece of advice... I’m a vegetarian and the smell of meat cooking makes me sick to my stomach. I really can’t work at Mcdonald’s... I think I’d just drop dead on the spot. Y’know I used to think I’d die before I reached age 30 because of an freak accident or a serious illness, but at 29, I starting to think maybe I just off myself due to not wanting to do this anymore. I’m tired... I’m so fucking tired. And every time I reach out for help... even on this website, people tell me I should just help myself. Why are people so mean? 

I’m looking into actual medical help even though I’m worried about the cost. I wish I just had someone to tell me what to do with my life, because so far, I’ve been getting it wrong. Does anyone out there have some genuine, useful advice? Or even a few kinds words. It’s been so long since the last time someone wasn’t yelling at me, letting me down, or blaming me for something I can’t control. I’m not even sure working would help me feel better, but if you need the money, what else can you do? 

I’m sorry for how long this is, I really am."
ctqlcd,0,2019-08-21,"The time I didn't get hired, and I'm so ****-ing happy :D",LopsidedWater,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ctqlcd/the_time_i_didnt_get_hired_and_im_so_ing_happy_d/,"Story time:

I graduated from college in May about a year ago, with one crappy IT internship position at a local business in my hometown. I was really struggling to find another internship, or better yet a full time position. Around this time, I was applying to places up and down the west coast, in California, Oregon, and Seattle. One big issue for me was visa sponsorship, as I needed my employer to eventually sponsor me, but I was gonna be fine for like a year. Eventually, after getting my feet wet with some interviews and coding challenges, I got an interview from a startup in SF called Aether. This was apparently a big bio-tech startup that I had read about in some news article, they did some work with bio-printers. I was really interested in embedded systems, so I thought I could definitely help out with the product and at the same time learn some stuff. After one phone interview though, the guy ghosted me... so ya know, I guess sh\*t happens...

Fast forward to now, I have a full time job at another start-up, where I got hired as an intern, and made it to a full time position. Not gonna lie, I was kinda upset for a while, that I didn't get hired there and even tried to reach out through LinkedIn for some interview feedback from my interviewer, but alas that didn't work either. So anyways, I was on Glassdoor looking at some open positions, when I remembered this entire experience and decided to lookup the company to see how it was doing, if I could apply again, etc. and holy sh\*t -- apparently, I was the lucky one. It turns out, the company was super sketchy and a little Fyre Festival-ly :)

TL;DR - Sometimes, getting ghosted is good ?

At first I didn’t know that it was IT because it was poorly conveyed, then I had the internship and I understood it. It was my only full time offer so I took it. I regret that. I am on the third interview for a job that I would love doing and it might even include a pay bump. Am I right to take the offer if it happens? Interviews have been promising."

If it even had a hint of technology or anything mentioned, I applied because why not. Most of the jobs I felt qualified for as they were mostly internships with training. Regardless, being the lucky soul I am, I got an interview offer for next week for one of the jobs that's an actual job. I re read the post and they seem to want someone who knows mac(they say that 80% is mac and 20% is windows) and I'm not exaggerating, but I have never worked on a mac before. It also mentions leading classes, which my ""soft"" skills could lend itself to, but I'm hesitant. It's just a regular IT support student and it's even more biazzare is that I think they want someone to be THE IT person. Should I bow out gracefully or just go and see what happens?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I accepted the offer and lo and behold, when it rains, it pours. I now have a different interview offer for a job that wants to meet an hour and a half after the interview I just scheduled. Interesting that my applications with the cover letters didn't lead to any offers."
ctrpy3,1,2019-08-21,HELP!! Advice on how to approach intern who keeps chewing on his cuticles? Summary below!,Cleavse,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ctrpy3/help_advice_on_how_to_approach_intern_who_keeps/,"I have an intern that reports to me. He is a good kid but he chews on his cuticles constantly. This happens in meetings with cross functional teams, when I talk to him, in our car rides when we travel for work, etc. I've try to subtle hint to him about always keeping things professional and being aware but I don't think he's getting the hint. It's also very noticeable, he'll bend his thumb or index finger, chew it, look at it, and continue chewing his cuticles. It's gotten to the point where I  try not to touch his computer mouse anymore when I show him Excel sheets when using his computer.

I don’t know the best way to approach him without destroying his confidence or if it’s even in my place to talk to him. I've had plenty of interns in the past, but never really had a situation like this. I feel like as his mentor, it is part of my job to set him with a foundation for success after his internship. In college, they really don't teach office etiquette, how to interact with people, etc. The small things that we typically see from interns - always being on the phone, maturity, speech patterns, email etiquette, can all be directly confronted since they are work related. This situation is different but I can't imagine his future coworkers or employers liking this behavior. 

Appreciate everyone’s inputs. Thanks all!"

I've just received phone screens for MSFT/FB new grad SWE positions. Apparently the FB one will be technical while the MSFT one will be mixed. Does anyone have any experience with these? 

I'm also wondering how long the processes are for these companies. I'm waiting to hear back from Google about intern to new grad SWE conversion, and my recruiter said it'll be about a month. I want to line up (potential) offers as close as possible, so I'm wondering if I should schedule these phone screens ASAP or give myself a bit more time to prepare.

Also is there a discord or something for new grad SWE?

ctt28h,1,2019-08-22,how to be confident at new job with insecurities haunting me?,tangyjam,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ctt28h/how_to_be_confident_at_new_job_with_insecurities/,"hey guys, hoping to be able to garner some insight, perspective and advice from you guys to help me assimilate to my new job that I started a few months ago. 

I recently relocated for my new job after graduating college in biomedical engineering with great internships and one toxic one.

in college my strategy at work was to always ask questions, always be proactive, and put my self in uncomfortable situations. I always tried to solve the issue myself first then follow up with another mentor/manager for some advice

I no longer am confident in asking questions at the fear of being seen as incompetent because of my toxic mentor. To elaborate on this: I was hired for part time contact work at my 3rd internship throughout the school year.  I worked for a very smart female engineer, who had 4.0 gpa undergrad and 4.0 masters.  She was very book smart, hard working, and competitive per her own words / disclosure.  BUT she was terrible at soft skills, extremely technical but a poor communication with LOW EQ, very inconsiderate, unempatbhetic / cuttthroat

Her personality was very tense.  She had a reputation to be very overbearing especially when it comes to her projects.  she had trust issues and tended to micromanage.  I was her first intern. and unlucky to be under her for 9 months as I could have lasted 3-6 without cracking.  what started off as mutual respect, turned toxic where ethically I felt I couldn't state any opinion, challenge her work, Or ask questions about her work or more clarification on what she wanted me to do without offending her since her peronsality was to be a super perfectionist and she literally took offense /personal if I asked questions about her directions or how she came about.  she jumped to conclusions quickly and also took credit for  my work which ultimately ended in her promotion.  I didn't say anYthing because I thought and was hinted by her I have a good chance to get hired at the company.   it wasn't until near the end point about 3-4 months away I found out about her taking credit , her lying about a future for me there (there was no budget on that team, opening on other team was no interested in me due to lack of expeience).  I got ill from stress and ended up applying to other jobs, which she told my team I was playing hooky.  at that point the team turned toxic, with one person saying I need to be more engaged and hold responsibility at work to which I apologized and he said he doesn't care about me but I should be doing this for my female mentor. 

he didn't know the female mentor micromanaged me and left me feeling powerless.  it stunted my growth and her micromanagement led me to believe I was truly incompetent of my work.  indices of passive aggressive behavior from herr hurt my feelings and DESTOYOED my confidence. she commented on how I was too outgoing and setting up meetings with my old team saying I was more proactive than her at her age.  she said she preferred to be cc;'d and noticed when I do this despite my cubniclel being at the end cap of her cubicle (not even a real cube but end cap), where she could literally breathe and view my work over her shoulder  the whole day which was exhausting.  

she would change her mind with directions at the end of the day, causing me to redo ALL my work for the day.  she seemed to be on her period all the time and very TENSE causing me to be afraid to raise issues or questions since I saw what happens if you do something like give critical feedback to a engineering meeting (she cried).  she would give backhanded insults and offend me. the worst ones were giving me bad directions which could be interpreted as one way and calling me basically incompetent and putting me on blast by saying this in front of my whole team and stranger co workers telling me to ask her if I didn't know how to do the task which wasn't the case, I technically did it correctly to her directions, I just took it the wrong way (multiple instances).

another time she pulled me aside and said "":Dont take this the wrong way but sometimes you actions might seem arrogant to other co workers:""  which she apologized and said she was WAY out of Iine fo saying that later.  she also didn't elaborate what she meant, so I had no closure but continued gas lighting my self to the point of apologizing and saying she Was right just like a door mat would do.

I felt betrayed for covering for her after another female engineer tried to sabotage her work and she bitched at me for taking so long in bringing the samples I prepared for her (I recounted due to some missing),.  I should have told her some were missing, but was afraid she would blame me for it when in fact she had the female engineer proof read/validate my work.  the box was open and the only other person that knew was that engineer.  so she sabotaged the missing ones.  I ended up finding an extra to solve the issue but the damage was done to my reputation once again

&amp;#x200B;

long story short after that incident , I lost my confidence and mojo., showed in interviews.  finally got it back and now im struggling with basic things I should know what to do like asking the right questions and asking for help.  im just petrified at looking/seeming incompetent when in reality im an associate engineer thats developing, I was ridiculed for asking questions at my previous internship expeience causing me to be very wary (ie my last internship I didn't know an answer to a problem and said I wasn't sure, the senior engineer said you should have learned this in school in a smug way)"

ctttke,1,2019-08-22,PLS HELP: Should I be a surgeon or should I go into something computer science related?,HentaiEnthusiast_3,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ctttke/pls_help_should_i_be_a_surgeon_or_should_i_go/,"Sorry if this is messy. So, I’m a junior this year and I have always considered becoming a surgeon. I come from a pretty poor family and was pretty much homeless for a part of my childhood. My main goal in life has always been to get a high paying job where I could make a ton of money, considering I’m scared of being poor. I enjoy the idea of becoming a surgeon but it seems that everything around me is pointing to a career in computer science. I’m president of the robotics club, Vice President of girls who code, have participated in multiple coding competitions, and have taken AP CSP(I’m trying to open an AP CSA class at school). I enjoy computer science a lot but mostly took it to expand my extracurriculars for a bs/md program. I’m struggling to understand if I actually want to be a surgeon or if I’m just pursuing it for the money(if so, is that so bad?)I know that the path to becoming a surgeon is long but time isn’t really a big deal for me considering I’d be aiming for a PhD in any career anyways. I’m scared that if I decided to go into a field in CS I’ll change my mind and it’ll be too late to build my bs/md application considering how competitive it is. I feel like a PhD in CS wouldn’t be worth it compared to a surgeon’s salary but I also know I have a screwed up perspective on the value of money. I’m not sure if I should still volunteer at a hospital and shadow a doctor this year just in case I decide I want to be a surgeon. Im also not sure if I should look for an internship at a hospital or a CS company this summer. I’ve tried looking at jobs that combine both fields but the pay doesn’t seem as good as a surgeon’s salary. I’ve talked about it with family members and they’ve all said that being a surgeon would be worth it in the long run and I’m not completely opposed to being a surgeon it’s just I haven’t been as exposed to it as I have CS. Would I utterly fail at becoming a surgeon if I’m pursuing it for the money? The idea of surgery fascinates me but I feel like I don’t know enough about it. Everyone always says they became a surgeon because they wanted to help people but it seems like a pretty unstable reason to me as I also want to help people but am scared that I’ll end up dropping out of med school and I’ll be stuck if a degree that won’t pay as much. I like the idea of being a surgeon and working in a CS field but I don’t know which to choose considering a surgeon gets paid more but I know more about CS but at the same time I’m pretty good in science courses like bio,chem, and phys. Oh and I absolutely HATE math which is a actually a big reason why I’m considering becoming a surgeon as well."
cttv0w,2,2019-08-22,Have had enough of being mistreated at internship;should I quit?,VeganNoob2222,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cttv0w/have_had_enough_of_being_mistreated_at/,"I'm on my last year of uni and I got an internship at a women's online magazine over the summer but it's been lowkey pretty bad from the beginning and I think I've had enough. 

I was quite desperate when I accepted this internship because another fell through after months of contacting them and them leading me on (I even cut a holiday short so I could go for the interview for them to talk to me for literally 5 mins). Anyway so when I found this I was quite relieved and took it up even though the pay was low. (And I didn't have too many options as they are only a dozen good publications on fashion here in my country).

The first few weeks I was eager to learn and say yes to everything because I wanted them to see I was try and teach me but idk they haven't been doing much to make this any educational for me and I'm just the office bitch that mainly runs errands and other laborious tasks more than I do the stuff that they told me I would get to like writing and media coverage. 

I don't mind doing shitty stuff like fetching lunch and sending packages but when you get paid less than $2/hr and have to send packages for hours all over town via public transport and they ask you to look through the trash for something, that's where I draw the line. I haven't been guided on anything and if I do things wrong they just give to someone else or ask me to redo and idk like they literally don't care at all about whether I learn or not. Plus, I'm currently the only intern so I have to do everything shitty ass thing in the office and don't get to write often as I'm also doing this part time on top of schooling.

 Wondering if I should just quite because I still have like 4 months to go or if I should talk to my supervisor about my issues but they seem pretty busy and not like they would care. My hr is basically this one lady that orders me around to do all these things so it's not like I can talk to hr. A previous intern turned full time is saying I should quit because she would too if she were in my shoes and I feel really mistreated here and am not seeing any value in it. 

Any advice?"

I just received a new grad offer and want to open the door for salary negotiation. I have seen plenty of negotiating tactics online but given our unique backgrounds, as a post-bacc degree 2.0, I would love to hear people's experiences when it came to negotiating salary/TC.

How did you negotiate and what were the biggest takeaways throughout the process? What was your leverage if you didn't have any other competing offers? Were there any resources you used that helped streamline this process? If negotiating salary wasn't on the table,were you able to discuss other forms of compensation(vacation time, signing bonus, annual bonus, or whatever else you would take as additional compensation)?

Background: I'm halfway done the program with one summer internship. Made the decision to go after new grad roles since I saw success from past students. I had a couple of promising onsite interviews and just received a verbal and written offer as a Software Engineer from one company."
ctyraw,98,2019-08-22,[uni] I don't feel normal,proto-drake,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ctyraw/uni_i_dont_feel_normal/,"TL;DR introvert freshie intimidated by how ""on"" people are in uni

I'm quiet around new people but energetic with **close** friends, which is typical for introverts. I deal with it, and I initiate convos with people I don't know.

but one thing I've noticed is that most in uni (even fellow freshmen) seem to be juggling 3 internships, an EXCO position, a boyfriend, several Instagram accounts, hall life, and multiple CCAs.

Hot daaaaaaamn why is everyone so involved in everything? I went for o'week and while I enjoyed it I was noticeably weird compared to my OG, who are very sporty, active people, many of whom are trying for NUSSU, and already have a slew of CCA interviews.

I used to be heavily involved in CCA activities/competitions, but that was only cause I legit liked my batchmates, otherwise I just don't have event planner energy. It's not that I want to laze around, in fact I don't do that, but I just tend to my own hobbies and keep up my acad work. ever since Jc I've already stopped doing all these events because it's too taxing and I hate being in the public spotlight running for this or that position. 

I'm just wondering why the majority of people are so ""on"", it makes me wonder if there's something wrong with me. I understnad that uni is the place to step out of the comfort zone and try new things but man, it seems like everyone here posts daily updates about them building an animal shelter, interning at a big firm or some other grand plan like that. Meanwhile I'm just kicking off my freshman year and already trying not to fall behind in Econs lectures.

Tf? IS there something wrong with me? Am I taking life too slow? I'm still here tying to figure out which aspect of my major I want to specialise in when the time comes to pick spec, meanwhile got people already lined up their career path and scholarships alr. I legit feel damn intimidated when my new friends ask me if I got Insta then i'm just like um no sorry i have no life 

e: also how are people getting into relationships? I mean I'm gay which prolly doesn't help but quite a few of the new tutorial mates I made alr got gf and im just like... woah dude... how'd you do that"

It was alright, but I got super unlucky and was one of the 5-10 help desk technicians who had to work every weekend. Same 5-10 people. After that contract job ended, since I didn't have a degree or more experience, no one else wanted to hire me. So basically, I ended up wasting over a year and a half trying to go the trade school route, only to have to go back to the college route.

What I learned is that trade school is ideal for people who have the ambition to start their own business with whatever trade they had. I had no such ambition. Frankly I just wanted to put my 40 hours in, do my best in that time and live my life after that. However if you do have that ambition, by all means, go to trade school. Otherwise, to work for most companies, you will need to earn a degree. At least with IT, I'm not so familiar with other trades, but I feel it will be the same if you try to work for a medium/ large coorparate company, or you'll need other methods/experience to stand out.  

Regardless trade school isn't some quick / easy ticket out of the world of 4 year unis. That's the important thing to take from this. You are going to come in the work force, in many cases at a disadvantage frankly in many situations and will need to fight tooth and nail to earn the privilege to work. A fight that's not as hard for those with degrees, though there are still challenges.

Sorry for a downer , I just, saw someone talk about finishing uni and at age 24, I couldn't help but get a bit depressed about the crazy path I took due to how things played out for me, (which I've explained multiple times on this board) so I wanted to give out some truth for people considering going down the path that was, for me, a mistake. Trade school can be a good choice, but actually look into what types of jobs you can get with your trade and what they will look for."

I got an offer for their internship program which trains candidates for 10 weeks and then puts them on a project at which they have to work for a little over a year.  I noticed that there are a bunch of good reviews but also a bunch of bad ones stating that they have employees fake good reviews or they pay people to write good reviews for them.  Is the pay rate that they give you during the training and during the project good?  How is this internship, as they call it, compared to a normal boot camp?  All in all, is this worth it to commit to as someone with a bachelor's in applied math and master's in analytics looking to work as a data analyst or software engineer?"

But here is the situation. I have completed my bachelor's degree and working full time at an MNC. During my college, I used C++ for coding and I had a solid grip on it. But after working in the industry I see that for development Java (Spring, ElasticSearch etc.) is used. Now I am starting my prep again for intern after masters degree. Java is universal but it is too verbose. It will take more time to write same code in Java than C++. So I think in coding rounds I will be at advantage if I use C++. But Java will be used more in companies. So will I be at disadvantage if I use C++ instead of Java in coding round as I will have less knowledge about Java language?

cu0ryh,1,2019-08-22,Is this normal?,brunommpreto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cu0ryh/is_this_normal/,"Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this text as short as possible...

&amp;#x200B;

So in late may this year I was looking up for internships in the CS field, and applied to about 30 jobs, Got decline in about 20, and 10 did not get a reply... Mostly because in Europe they often look out for people that hold the title of Bachelors. In one of the declines, I got a chance to do a Skype interview, in others too, but were not that important.

So in that interview the recruiter said I couldn't work there 'cause I don't hold a bachelors degree, but he was super nice with, and we kept talking... I found out that in Europe we can do internships under the Erasmus + program, so I asked him if that would be an option, he thought about and said yes. I was super but extremely excited, I mean I already worked, but not in my field... 

So now it's been like 45 days in the internship, but I feel lost. I mean I got a chance that most people seek, but I feel so F\*\*\*ing lost, like I'm a perfectionist person so everything I do has to be perfect, or I just can't do it, as if it doesn't look perfect I get super mad at myself. I really fear I'll disappoint the person that gave me this opportunity. I mean he gave me a shot to prove my value, yet I feel sad, 'cause I feel like, I can't fail, I can't fail, that sentence gets in a loop inside my brain. I can't leave a bad image of myself and the university I come from. I have to prove my value. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone ever felt like this? What did you do. I mean I'm afraid of asking questions, I want to be able to have a fluent conversation with my employer about the field he hired me to work on... What steps should I take? How to overcome this fear?"

Background content:
A friend, his band and some other musicians and friends made a little open air last we. So he asked for help and I'm usually going to help bc we were a crew with like 1 year inactivity till now, bc of intern problems. So I knew she was singing in this band bc I saw the band like a year ago and it's like a perfect side affect so maybe I could talk to her or at least I will see her again xd
I was ripping my arse of, bc I love to create love and change the world, and this was the perfect opertunity.
So I waited for a good mood and some nice moment with a good convidence and a smile on my face and talked to her, told her what a beauty she is and for real I was doin great, but shit.. here we go again. ""And when u are such a beauty, u will have a Boyfriend or?"" I asked.
Ye ofc she has and I asked: ""and are u happy?"" She said: ""yes"" after a very very short time.
Now I fuck up every time, hard to say it short. I'm very sensitive and think to much about every little bit. Not only that 2 or 3 girlfriends cheated on me and I know how it feels to lose ur love. I'm maybe to real or to good and just don't want to destroy anything when some1 is happy and blessed with a working relationship. And so I'm crying inside..
But hey I go around the corner and look another great girl, straight out of Moskau just smiling in my face and ye she was interested in me xd so nice we danced talked and had some little hugs but ye I'm fucked up from this situation before, feel like I could take her ez but only to fuck that's what she wanted I guess, some speed and sex xd and then there are these 2 girls trying to get their ass close to my BD xd so nice but my mind is so fucked up and I'm not looking for a fuck I'm looking for love. And always I end up alone crying in my bed and ask what did I wrong or what is wrong trying to be a ""good"" guy?

I feel great I'm super strong, good looking and convident and I'm just amazing. The one guy at the party just told me I look like ""ein Mann wie in Stein gemeißelt"" a real Chad under the incels. but ye all this shit out of my past just comes to me in every night whenever I can't sleep and don't find peace. And I also ask my self if I chose the wrong way. 
For 1 year now I try to always say the truth and without a handful times it works. But now all problems I didn't want to solute are coming back. 
I'm smoking weed everyday for over 10 years. 
Btw I was 3 sec from suicide for years and lost a good friend for 2 years. Also I didn't had sex in 5-6years and no girlfriend

TL;DR :
Talked to a perfect girl at a party she had a boyfriend, I ended up in my bed alone like every time. I will just die alone."

First it was a hand lightly on my buttocks as I leaned over a desk (as though she was helping me keep my balance, though she wasn't) and again with her fingers down my spine as she walked by me standing in a doorway talking to a coworker.

This is a predominately-woman workplace, and aside from executives and IT, I'm basically the only guy who works here. While I'm kinda middle-management in terms of title and responsibility, the nature of the office means I'm often taken as clerical help, and am johnny-on-the-spot when schlepping happens, so I'm pretty low on the totem pole.

It doesn't ""make me feel uncomfortable"" in the sense that I don't feel obliged to do anything or feel any more of a sexual object than I do when a grandma at church rubs my arm a bit too long after a handshake (which the boss in question has also done) or an older gay man might linger his hand on my back after a hug ... like I'm a little flattered really, if also kind of feeling reduced to being my body.

Either way, I know it isn't really appropriate touch in the workplace, and if I touched the intern that way, I bet I'd get fired. Honestly, I'm more offended by the way the other women in the office always call on me to lift and carry heavy objects when there are plenty of other able-bodied people who could also do that or the way they act surprised when I'm answering phones or that I can type quickly.

I told my girlfriend about it, and she got kind of protective and said I should tell someone. That it isn't really something to be taken lightly (I was literally laughing it off). I honestly don't know if I'm minimizing and justifying the lady's bad behavior or if she is just being grandmotherly and feisty in that way for her age. Like, it's pretty easy to dismiss because despite all her power over my career, she is really such a sweet little old lady, and I don't think she means any harm by it.

I am needing help seeing what my best option is in regards to a financial situation. Bare with me as I don't post often, especially with text.

I'm currently working part time in retail and am going to college. I have been with my current company for about four years, and I'm on my last semester set to graduate in December. Additionally, I had an internship last year with a company, and was offered a full-time position with them starting sometime in January.

Now, the issue I'm having is that I'm needing a little more funds to get me through to December. My current job is a decent paycheck for a college student, but I'm needing more due to having to pay out of pocket for my last semester of school. I have enough experience in my field (Computer Science) that I have received offers from a handful of companies, which obviously will have higher pay than my current job. I'm just conflicted if I should try to pursue these offers even though I will be moving for the full-time job from the internship in January.

I think I can ride out with my retail pay until December, but if they cut hours then I might be in a tough situation. I'm just needing advice in regards to pursuing these opportunities until I move even though I will only be staying for 4-5 months. Thanks in advanced!

I applied to a decent number of jobs, but did not spend a huge amount of time searching because I felt a need to hurry up and gain experience/make money as soon as possible. To be honest, the job that I have is challenging, interesting, and I am learning a lot too. I make really good money for a single guy and I am grateful that I landed this opportunity. It feels wrong to be complaining in my situation but I am struggling to be content. I think there are a few things holding me back:

1. More than anything, I love backpacking. There are plenty of places to do so on the east coast, but I have lived here my whole life and have already fallen in love with the Rockies. I can't seem to get my fix out here and its killing me. I think I need to be close to mountains to be truly happy. I dream of living in CO.
2. The people I work with are much older than me. So far I like my coworkers but many of them are double my age. There are a few people closer in age but they work in software, which I am not involved in right now.
3. I feel like there are no young people around me in the area, period. I know this isn't true, but I am pretty far away from anything at the end of a peninsula.

I would really like to go back and get my Master's degree in Computer and/or Electrical engineering as a full-time student. I think I might really enjoy a career more focused in robotics, and a higher degree would probably be necessary to move into this field. I also really enjoy being a student.

As far as my financial situation goes, I have 20k in debt and a few thousand in the bank. My parents definitely helped me out financially during undergrad, but they did not have to pay my tuition. They claim that once their house is sold, they will help me out with a big chunk of that debt. Even if they don't, I feel it is still very manageable even if I did go back to school for a bit.

I always said I would work for a year, maybe a year and a half, and then go back to school. But now that I have been living and working here in southern MD for about 3 months, I feel lonely and impatient.

Three months is such a short amount of time working as an engineer, that it's basically an internship. Realistically, I can leave after 6 months when my lease is up, but would I be making a huge mistake in quitting after such a short period? I feel confident I could get into a good school or land a new job based on my abilities. What I am unsure about is whether this short employment will be an unsightly smudge on my reputation and if it will hurt those odds. If that is the case, maybe I should invest more time and energy trying to meet young people outside of work, while accepting that my dream lifestyle out West will come in due time.

cu66ij,0,2019-08-22,One BIG dilemma about being black in tech...,lanaguerre,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cu66ij/one_big_dilemma_about_being_black_in_tech/,"is figuring out whether or not you were denied for a job, without even starting the interview stage because you just weren't good face value compared to other candidates. Lengthy I know, but hear me out for a sec. I'm a staunch independent, I strictly believe in the idea of personal responsibility, and believe in erasing that victimhood personality. I have 3 internships, and while they're not FAANG, they are recognizable - 2 are fortune 500 companies, one is a unicorn. I also attend a no-name school, but have a good gpa. I honestly despise those SJW buffoons who use the race card to get what they want, because it looks bad on those who are earnestly working hard to succeed just like everyone else.  

One thing that I am struggling dealing with is rejection. It's one thing if I didn't pass the interview stage, however it's completely different entirely when the company doesn't even bother to check me out even when I have more than enough experience and meet their requirements. Furthermore, when looking through their company photos on Glassdoor, LinkedIN, etc. it's discerning when you barely see one black person in those photos, if any at all. I wanna know what you guys think. 

Am I becoming something I claim to despise? Am I being a hypocrite or entitled? Does tech really have a diversity/racism problem?

All answers are excepted. If I am being a hypocritical ass, please let me know. I also wanna know the struggles you guys faced when dealing with rejection."

Getting into College?,aulei,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cu75ni/switching_schools_getting_into_college/,"I'm having a really hard time in high school. I started freshman year at  our local high school BHS. In November of that year,  I went to a  residential treatment facility because I was really depressed and  suicidal. While in residential treatment, I decided that I couldn't  handle going back to BHS. The bullying was horrible, and there were just  so many reasons why I knew it would be bad to go back. Because of this,  I decided to finish out the year on Connections Academy. I finished the  year in Connections, but my parents weren't a fan, and nether was I, so  I started a fresh year, Sophomore year at a local online school, as  opposed to Connections. I did that for all of sophomore year. Now, I'm  starting out junior year, doing the same program. I really don't like  it, and am considering switching to a different school called Big  Picture. It's an ""alternative"" school technically, but I feel like it  would suit me well. I really want to get out into the world. With Big  Picture, it's internship and project based, so I would complete 120  hours of an internship, as well as projects to demonstrate my learning. I  really like this idea, however it would mean switching schools again.  Online school I just find to be really isolating, and it's also really  hard to motivate myself with it. Also, last year I really struggled with  a bit of cheating on assignments and tests, because I was so  overwhelmed and couldn't keep up. I feel horrible about it, and I really  want to start over. Please here me out though. I'm sure right now I  sound like a horrible kid. I know cheating is horrible, but please here  me out. I've gone through a lot of trauma. When I was about my mom  started really struggling with alcohol. She ending up really getting  bad. I have multiple horror stories from that, to include seeing her  passed out on her bed, watching my dad restrain her while she was drunk  and almost overdosed on pills (she wasn't normally suicidal, but the  alcohol interaction with her meds caused it). Anyways, my dad would be  off at his job, and my sister and I would have to deal with it. My mom  ended up getting a DUI, but fortunately following that she went to  treatment and turned her life around, and has now been sober 2 1/2  years, and I'm really proud of her. Anyways, in sixth grade my sister  (twin) started self harming, and became depressed. She then developed  anorexia. She went to multiple residential treatments and was very  severe. She ended up going to the ER multiple times, as well as the  hospital. In fact at 15 she weighed only 68 pounds, and her liver and  kidneys were failing. So I watched that. I also started self harming,  and attempted suicide about ten times or so because of being so  extremely stressed. Anyways, her anorexia lasted about five years, until  last month, she was in a tragic ATV accident and died at 16 (my only  sibling, my twin, gone at 16, which is hitting me really hard). My  depression still continues. I've also gone through, as I mentioned, a  ton of bullying, as well as being very traumatized in residential  treatment. To top all of that I'm also autistic. I say this, because I  want you all to know that while all of my school switching sounds  ridiculous, and that my cheating was horrible, I want you all to know  how desperate I was. I do assure you that I haven't cheated at all this  year, and I am really focused on turning everything around. Anyways, I  figure my transcript is already pretty crappy, but my question is,  should I transfer to Big Picture? I really think it could be good for  me. Also, will colleges get worried because of the fact that it's a so  called ""alternative school""? I'm not a bad kid. I've never been  rebellious, or done anything illegal, or anything bad, aside from the  small bit of cheating, which I feel terrible for. Is there any hope for  me? The college I want to go to has an 80% acceptance rate. I'm really  hoping to get in. Thank you all so much."

Just a few quick things I wanted to mention:

* I technically do have 5+ years experience with programming, but it's not like I've been programming every day for those 5+ years. There was a gap year (namely from 2017 - 2018 when I was working as a ship data analyst) and several months where I didn't do any programming. So with that in mind, I don't know if it's still a good idea for me to mention it still. I put in mainly because most cover letters start off with ""I have X years of experience as \[position\]"". Considering I'm trying to get my first SWE job, would this still be alright? If not, what would you recommend replacing it with?
* I wasn't too sure about the section mentioning to make 1-2 statements about who you are, what you love, and what you believe in....but I wrote down some of my core values and adjusted the way it a bit so that it would sound more professional. If anybody thinks that this section isn't necessary, please reply with what you think it should instead be replaced with (if anything).
* If I'm being perfectly honest, I don't know what values Esri has, but I would assume that the values I listed are generally accepted enough such that most HR managers wouldn't raise an eyebrow if they saw it (keep in mind that I'm doing this because I want to be able to keep the cover letter generic enough that it's easy to apply for other similar jobs). Please let me know if this isn't true.

As the title suggests, I am transferring to a four year university this semester. I went to a community college and had a thoroughly good time and I think I grew a bit as a person as well. I participated in clubs/organizations and even got an internship in IT. It's been 2 years and I'm finally transferring after some initial trouble. 

I'm excited but I'm also quite nervous. The Computer Science program is pretty huge at the school I'm going to and it seems a bit overwhelming. I really do want to succeed here and I would appreciate any advice you can give. 

A little bit about myself. I really enjoy CS but it can be frustrating at times. I'm no genius but I like to think I'm smart. I'm very lousy at studying. I often procrastinate and I have very little discipline. 

How would you recommend I go about ensuring that I stay on top of things this upcoming year? If you have any of my habbits and have found tricks to help you, I would greatly appreciate it."

Some context, I just graduated at a law college on August 1st this year, and I had internships during most years that I’ve been in college, BUT most of them were in the public sector. I just went for the private sector in my last year of college and I was fired from it due to poor performance (and I felt useless, depressed and the whole “getting fired” package).

 I would like to point out that the college that I studied is regarded as one of the best in my country but that doesn’t seem to help with anything at all. Also I was not able to get s very good network because most of the students there were kind of rich kids and I got there through a scholarship. I also only studied law to get a good job, never liked it.

So since February when I was fired from my last internship, I haven’t been able to find anything, I only did 2 interviews since then and the situation is starting to look hopeless. So I decided that I needed to do another graduation, but I was faced with a dilemma and the main question of this whole post.

Should I go for a degree in an area that I like, but has a more restricted market and the entrance exam is very hard, or should I go for an area that I don’t like as much (like the law degree that I got) but it has plenty of job opportunities and an easier entrance exam ?

Any tips are welcome, I need some help with these problems. thanks guys"

Background: I've been struggling with anxiety since taking a gap year after after graduating high school and isolated myself at home. Needless to say, I was down after being rejected for several rounds of interviews (like more than 20 or so) for both jobs or scholarships. I did decently well though in both my academic and extracurriculars though I was bullied a lot from young so I think it all came to a boil this year. I let it burn me down repeatedly that my other peers are doing way better and dont have to go through this anxiety. They can survive just on connections alone and have moved on to be very successful high-flyers and left me (painful stories I will not repeat here haha). 

TLDR: I am a mess but luckily, a very good childhood friend of mine sat me down and recommended I seek help. 

But anyway, besides me reaching out for therapy, I have slowly dragged myself to go for tech events and workshops. Problem is I always coasted by socially in just doing well at school or internships and people do respect me for it and leave me alone. Some do pick on me. 

But, since these people have moved on from me and I'm starting from scratch, I realise I have crippling anxiety talking to someone new like at networking sessions even though I would LOVE to know what their thoughts on some projects are like. When I do get the confidence,  I either meet someone who just ghosts me immediately or starts putting me down. 

I am always afraid of being wrong or shut down as I have been going through that experience many times. :/ I have little place at any discussion table and I wish I could practice having a say in things.

So my question is: how do I overcome that fear of approaching them? Are there practical guidelines in handling conversations especially if the other party has become very mean or rude? How do I identify problems with myself? I can't help being in those situations where I feel small and think something is wrong with me and the world is right about me being weird and all without a clue. 

Sorry for the long wall of text but thanks in advance!"

I've been working on Leetcode problems lately and to put it frankly I'm pretty bad. The problem is that most Summer 2020 internships (for Big N and most worthwhile companies) wrap up recruiting before Winter, and in that time frame I don't think I would be able to improve enough to pass the technical interviews assuming I would even get that far.

I was debating on staying another year at Community College and using the time to finish prerequisites and improve my DS&amp;A knowledge and potentially work on some personal projects. My stats and extracurriculars are pretty good, and if I spent another year at CC I'm fairly confident I would sweep the UCs.

However, Berkeley is basically the only school I'd pick over my current one, and if I get rejected or unable to declare Computer Science (3.3+ GPA at Cal), I'll have essentially wasted a year of my life not to mention the opportunity cost of a year's worth of salary from an earlier graduation (100,000-200,000$). I'm pretty happy with my school's location and curriculum, and I think the opportunities are comparable to Cal, especially for the top brass (which I am unfortunately not).

Should I bite the bullet and transfer, taking a Summer 2020 internship from the best company I can find, or stay back another year and focus on getting better? Another option would be to take Fall or Winter 2020 off for an internship, which would delay graduation. My CC starts class on Monday so there's not a lot of time for me to decide.

TL;DR too bad at CS for good internship, stay another year at CC to get better and transfer to Berkeley?"

They offered me to stay/come back a couple times and I said yes, but didn't want to sign a contract yet (mostly because I didn't know if I want to create my own company instead).


Now I want to work there part time while studying physics. Since a couple of friends work there, I know that I'll get 1250€/month which is about average for a junior position in this area. To fully cover my expenses I need 1500€. 


I know some basics about salary negotiation, but I'm afraid that they are not willing to increase it because when I asked around about entry-salaries everyone said pretty much the same number. Also, a friend had 2 offers, one was 300€ more then what they pay and they didn't raise it (don't know how hard he tried to raise it tho).


How should I go about getting my 1500€? Do you think its even possible?


TL,DR; Want to get 1500€/month but company usually pays 1250€, and seems reluctant to raise it."

First off - I will not be naming the name of the company or exact offer extended to me.

I recently completed my summer internship and was given the offer to return as a full time hire. The position is as a Field Applications Engineer and I really like both the role and the company. It's a unique role as an EE to be in as you get to work with outside companies and not focus too hard on a singular device. Overall, it's an interesting diversity within the job and allows travel (something I really want to do).

The offer is quite generous sitting around 80k without including the sign on bonus, relocation bonus, 401k matching, and profit sharing. 

I'm torn between accepting this offer as it expires prior to my Fall career fair or searching for other similar roles. I really want to see what a job search is like and I feel like sometimes that is best done while coming out of college. I'm of course going to be asking for an extension, but need to figure out the best way to phrase it to the recruiter. 

Overall, I'm just looking for some advice from fellow engineers who had to make similar decisions. I feel like I'm deciding on what college to go to again!"

I went back to what I knew best which is waiting tables. Don't get me wrong I make really good money, like in the upwards of $70,000/yr but with no insurance, no benefits, nothing. But right now, I feel like I'm going nowhere.

After five years, I now started to reapply to front desk agent positions and I landed a job on my first interview. Now comes the dilemma part.

This job is unionized, but starting at $18,50/hr and going up to $20/hr after the first year with full benefits, insurance, yadayada...

The Director of Operations strongly suggested me to go finish my diploma, which has maybe like 3-4 classes left and a final internship to do. I see a potential evolution and growth in this hotel but I lack the courage to jump ship. Start all over, go back to school, those are TERRIFYING things to do at 27 years old.

Found a higher paying gig, more demanding but pays almost double.

I stuck to it. But now it feels like I'm screwing up.

I do the dishes, clean the house, water the plants and some other chores. Then I write. My whole day is pretty much over and I'm tired.

College is shit. They don't teach or care and just extort money. Feeling the pressure from there as well, they want 75% attendance. (Classes 6 days a week, 7 hours a day)

Currently, because of my situation, I wouldn't graduate at UIC for 2 more years, but if I went to DePaul it could stretch to 2.5 or 3. This is due partly because it seems like most of the gen eds here are specific to the school and around 7 of my classes are only counted as ""extra credit"". So I'm just wondering if it's worth staying where I am or shelling out more time and money at DePaul for a ""better degree"".

All in all, is it better off to just stay here a year and a half? Or go to DePaul for 2 1/4 years in terms of career opportunities and outlook?"

Because if not, or if it would only help very little, I may choose to wait a month or two to apply to give me time to feel I can put these side projects on my resume.

EDIT: I should also add another reason is my university offers a Leetcode class. This is for an HFT firm so taking this class will be extremely useful during the interview—I want to get in to the class a month or so, so I can get some more practice and feedback from the professor, because this firm WILL ask some hard leetcode questions.

A bit of background: I am a rising Junior at **school X** \- I transferred from **school Y**. At this point, I should've taken Data Structures and Algorithms, but I didn't want to waste money taking the course at **school Y** since it didn't transfer over to **school X**. With that being said, I will be taking Data Structures and Algorithms in the Spring 2020 semester because I need to complete a pre-req course before taking it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have applied to a bunch of Data Science/Product Management/Business Dev internships and have gotten several Hackerranks. The problem is, I don't have the slightest clue about Data Structures and Algorithms, and, as a result, can't even attempt the Hackerranks. I know how to code in Python and C++ - but most of the coding work I have done revolves around data analysis and data visualization.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, are there any good resources that I can study to help me learn Data Structures and Algos? Thanks."

cumxb0,7,2019-08-23,TIFU by renting a room without contract,antarticbjr,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cumxb0/tifu_by_renting_a_room_without_contract/,"This starts about 3 months ago. I was going to do a summer internship in another city and I had to find accommodation there. I got accepted for this internship only one month before I started it and it was in a big city, so it was hard to find accommodation and I didn't have much time to search because my finals were close.

After two weeks searching I found this apartment with 7 roommates. It was close to my job, the people there seemed nice and it wasn't too pricy. 

Of course I decided to took it, but things got weird one day later when the roommates sent me an e-mail. I hadn't have much time to talk to them the day I visited because I had to catch a train back to my city.  They sent me this e-mail saying that the landlord is crazy and they didn't have a contract. She was proposing a solidarity contract, the roommates had to pay together 5000 € even if there were empty rooms.  She was letting people in without the contract and some of them didn't want to sign because the contract made no sense. They were in this situation since October and she wanted to engage a trial against them because of that.

At first I was surprised, because the landlord was very nice to me. I didn't know what to do, I didn't have many options, I had found only one other apartment, but it was too tiny and the shared toilet was disgusting (it was Turkish style). At this time I only had two more weeks before the beginning of my internship. So I decided to took the first apartment with the 7 roommates, even with this situation, I thought to myself ""I'm going to stay for only 3 months, it's not a big deal"". 

This is when the most fucked up happens. I didn't have a guarantor, so the landlord demanded me to give her two cheques for the two next months plus a security deposit. It seemed reasonable, so I gave her the cheques and transferred the money, even without  a contract and the roommates warning me she was crazy.

Fast  forward two weeks, I need a proof of accommodation because I'm a foreigner and I needed to to renew my visa. I sent a text message to the landlord but she didn't respond, then I tried to call her but she didn't answer. I was starting to find this very weird, then a couple of minutes later she sent a message. She said that she couldn't give a certificate of accommodation because we didn't have a contract. Total bullshit. I reply respectfully saying ""of course you can give me a certificate, you're the owner, you can say that you accommodate me"". Then I discovered how crazy she was, she replied blaming me for the situation, saying things like ""you did not fulfill your obligations"" and ""if you want to stay illegal you have to face the consequences"", which was totally no sense, because I said that I wanted to sign the contract, but she would only accept if all the 8 roommates signed the contract together and there was people there that didn't want to. This moment I realised she was never going to give this damm certificate, even so I tried to argue with her but she said that I should discuss about this with the roommates.

I thought about convincing the roommates to sign the contract, but I was ashamed because they were very honest to me since the beginning, warning about the complexity of the situation and that some of them would never sign the contract. I talked to them and they told me they had the same problem with this proof of accommodation.

I spent the next month stressed out, worried about losing my visa and having to drop out of university. I couldn't rent another apartment because I had no more money and my appointement to renew my visa was next month. I was very sad and I didn't have any close friends or relatives in this city to talk to.

 I called the international student secretary of my university and explained my situation. The lady told me se was going to see what she could do. Fortunately she called me a week later and told me that se sent my application to the prefecture (it's the university that deals with this paperwork) with a proof of accommodation of my earlier apartment in the university residence and said that I should rent a new apartment for the next semester as soon as possible. OMG I felt so relieved. This lady literally saved me, if I wasn't her I don't know what I would do.

TLDR: Rented a room without a contract, needed a proof of accommodation to renew my visa, which the landlord didn't want to give me without a contract and the other roommates didn't want to sign it."

I know in advance I do not want to go directly into grad school if I do decide to go that route (which I likely will) so I want to take some time off (\~3 years) to support my wife while she is in law school and take my time considering my options.

I have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to interpersonal interaction, so with that here are my desire and interests: Find anything I could do in the CS field remotely making 60+ a year post graduation. I have some time to grind while still in college to get my name out in a field that may support that. I am doing research in both biology and computer science and will be completing a thesis that includes computational genetics analysis and visual image analysis - building a software that detects and measures a particular specimen, accepting a microscope image as data. Remote is also helpful as I will be able to stay at home more often and take care of my likely stressed wife.

Any suggestions or ideas?

I've researched stuff like freelancing and remote work a bit, but would like to know hear opinions on my specific situation - reposting due to only receiving one response from someone who didn't read my entire post. I do have decent CS experience so far - including my thesis, I have 2 CS internships under my belt and a yearly tech support job at a hospital."

I only chose to start with C++ because I'm going to be taking a ""programming fundamentals"" class that utilizes C++ this fall. I'm having lots of fun learning. It's frustrating but rewarding when you understand the concepts. 

My plan is to learn C++ and utilize it to contribute to some open-source music software (Audacity, Max4live) as well as program some basic VST plugins using JUCE. I'm about to start my 2nd year in college and i'm going to be grinding the entire year focusing on school and C++ (might also pick up HTML/CSS/JS along the way to familiarize myself with front end development). 

My main question is..What types of projects should I aim to accomplish by the time I finish my 2nd year? I learn best when I set goals but considering i'm a newbie to programming, all the information is so exhausting. I plan to get an internship by the time I finish this year and so any input would be greatly appreciated. I'm committed to putting as much time as I can into this because I truly enjoy it.

The internship provides a monthly stipend and accommodations. I was stoked about this incredible opportunity - until I moved in and saw the house.

Now, I wasn’t expecting anything luxurious about a shared, free internship house, but I was confronted with appalling conditions.. Every square inch of the house is filthy, with black-stained carpet and walls . Food is left rotting on the counters. The fridge and sink are stuffed to capacity with unwashed dishes and old food. There are bugs crawling over the walls and floor.

I am immunocompromised (which means I can’t fight off infections as well), so this is a huge concern for me. Therefore, I am experiencing excessive amounts of anxiety over my health. I feel like I can’t handle living here for a week, let alone a couple of months.

What should I do? Should I try to see if I could rent an apartment? Should I just try to stick it out? Or something else?"

However I have held multiple internships over the years and other software related jobs, have interned at the company for 2 years, and have been doing CS for the last 10 years before school. My coworker on the other hand has not, but worked in an unrelated industry for 20 years with no degree. We both interned for a year together and got offers at the same time. 

I found out today that we both received the same offer but he was able to negotiate for nearly $10k more than me, even though I'm more experienced and am more efficient (my coworker agrees with this and so does the rest of our team). So clearly I messed up during negotiations. The problem isn't my coworker, the problem is I undersold myself and took less than I know I'm worth.

I'm currently working with my manager on getting a promotion, but I know they do raises via percentages so I know I'll get less of a raise than my coworker would if he were in my situation. How should I go about getting paid what I know my value is? I like where I work so I don't really want to leave right away, and in April our contract is up and I will be looking for new opportunities in or out of my company. Not really sure what to do about this, I'm just frustrated I guess. I knew the company was giving me a software level lower than I really am because of policy, but I took it anyway because I liked the job. But now I'm annoyed and am not sure what to do about this, so any advice would be appreciated."

I can't eat (today I only had a cup of tea, half a piece of toast and a piece of pizza), and finding myself out of breath because of shorter breaths. I'm trying to take more deep breaths but it's not working bc I'm just so scared of all the changes. I've moved before, but this time, I'm moving to a new city for the internship. So packing to move has been overwhelming for me right now, since I live at home during university and live in the comfort of my home. It's a new city to navigate, and I'll be on my own to figure out routes and transit. I'm not familiar with this city this time, so it's a bit more stressful. No friends will be in the city too, so there's a sense of lonliness too.

The other thing is that I'm TERRIFIED of messing up or not meeting the standards of my manager at my placement. I took a leap this time, and through my university's job matching system, took a job that's quite different from the role and industry to what I've done before. So I'm terrified since I don't know what to expect and I have VERY low expectations of how everything will play out. I have major issues with self-confidence, feelings of not being worthy, VERY scared of screwing up, I'm not outspoken, introverted...etc the list goes on.

There's just a lot going on in my head and leaving the comfort of my regular routine living in the comfort of my home and attending classes at university makes me really terrified and prevents me from getting proper sleep and eating right. I'm panicking for no reason but still very scared and sometimes find myself on the verge of having crying outbreaks. Any advice for me? Thank you"

Because of this, I have some confidence I may get this job, but now I am not sure if I should bother beginning the internship if I may have to quit it in just 2 days or so after I start it. 

The unpaid internship is a 40-60 min drive and I am scheduled to come in on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays for 3 months. It could lead to employment after the program, which is why it intrigued me, but it is not guaranteed. Now that my interview is on Thursday, though, I'd have to tell the internship company that I can come in only 2 days next week. However, I don't know if I should even come in as I may have to end the internship after those two days depending on the results of my interview on Thursday. Is it worth the drive and time to meet the employees there if I may quit the week afterward?

I could ask to postpone my internship start date to Tuesday the 3rd, in order to give me time to figure out if I got the paid job, but I don't know.

Ideally, I'd like to just go ahead and email the company to resign the internship position just to save me a headache, but I know that if I don't get the paid job it would suck not having it. I really just don't want to meet new people who I may just have to say goodbye to in a couple of days.

TLDR; I am supposed to start an unpaid internship that could lead to employment after it ends in 3 months, but now that I have been invited to interview for a paid job with another company, I think it may be a waste of time to begin the internship if I would just quit it shortly after due to me getting a job offer.

Sorry, I don’t know where else to post this, but I need advice.

This week, I met someone that can help me land an internship. We got to chat and his friends that was with him found out what I was finishing in school and suggested that he should help me out since I’m looking for an internship. He gave me his work email and told me to send him an email and if I have a resume send that too.


First question:
Should I make it formal email or semi-formal? We were casually talking since it was a golf outing . However, he’s a big deal kind of guy in my field. 

Second question:
Me and fiancé were going back and forth on when to send it. I was thinking Sunday evening because he probably doesn’t want to deal with work on the weekend and I just don’t want it to be buried in his inbox. My fiancé said just send it as soon as possible.

Third question:
What kind of subject line would you suggest in this kind of situation?

TLDR; I am supposed to start an unpaid internship that could lead to employment after it ends in 3 months, but now that I have been invited to interview for a paid job with another company, I think it may be a waste of time to begin the internship if I would just quit it shortly after due to me getting a job offer. Should I ask to postpone the start of the unpaid internship in order to wait out the results of the paid job interview? Should I bother coming in the next week at all?"

I'm currently at an internship - and.... I really hate it. It's horrifically boring, and I dread going every day.

I was supposed to work there for about 2 months at the beginning of the summer - and then the extended it to last until the end of the summer.

Now, I am going back to school and I asked then what the plan was - and they wanted to keep me for the school year. I would have to do a 20 hour week, with a 2 hour commute (there and back, with really bad traffic). No flexibility on the schedule, and no working on weekends. Plus, I cant miss a day, I have to make up any and every day I miss.

Now, I do get paid at this internship (abou $1300 a month). I'm not in a situation where I like, absolutely NEED the money, but I mean, it would of course be nice to have it. (But I mean, I could get a different job if I wanted I suppose?)

I want to quit - I am going to have several government/law classes, and I want to enjoy my last year in school, see my friends, and really work on improving my mental health.


Now, my parents are really pressuring me into keeping it and like, ""really thinking about it before I make a decision.""

I'm surprised, my dad almost sided with me when he learned I had a two hour commute and inflexible hours, but I'm not sure. They brought up the points of maybe them offering me a job later and being connected with the company I'm at.

Also, hah, side note: I'm scared of what will happen with my parents if I quit. :')


Any advice?"

First time around i didn’t feel it working that much at first, got the nausea and the loss of apetite but otherwise when it kicked in it was nice time. I wasn’t as focused as I was on Rubifen, but the stimulants made me a little unstable with the anxiety so... 

Flash forward to this year, last semester of college, right at the end when all i had was exams and a final presentation, some stuff happens and i go into this trance of depression so basically no meds for like 2 or 3 weeks and i knew that i couldn’t just pick it back up. Boy did I EVER regret thinking strattera wasn’t doing its job properly, i procrastinated to a dangerous point almost ruining all my hard work on my internship but alas i made it all work in the nick of time (thanks to 17 years of undiagnosed adhd i know how to unfuckitup last minute). 

Aight, doc puts me back on it slowly and i’m almost 3 weeks in, 2 weeks on the final dose. The side effects hit me like a train this time: nausea in the morning, lack of appetite, actually pain if i ate more than half of the usual, lots of sleeping and being totally inside my head after i took it. Those eased but now, i am. Electric. I feel like the stereotype of adhd at this phase, i will vomit words if given a chance. Also my memory is worse. 

So did i screw it up and now strattera is saying “you did this, find a new mans” or am i just going through a different spell of it before it normalises? Can’t take any other non-stimulants bc there aren’t any in my country and stimulants have me on schedules to take them (plus i also need it to socialize bc well 17 years of being my full adhd self and i can’t even have a beer on it)

Tldr: was on strattera, stopped cold turkey bc reasons. Back on it with more side effects than ever, fearing it won’t work this time. Starting masters soon and lawd knows i need it to work"

Going into ece was kind of a shot in the dark and I kind of just wanted a job that makes good money. 

So far idrk how fond i am of this major but i do like embedded systems so the plan was to become an embedded systems engineer after graduation. I still haven’t gotten an internship and i’m not as passionate as everyone else so it’s kinda discouraging. 

Lately though i’ve been looking into Actuary stuff and i think it might be a better fit for me.  i’m definitely more interested in math and it seems lower stress too. 

Therefore I’m considering double majoring in ece and math so i can choose between computer engineering or actuary upon graduation. I’m just at a crossroads bc the double major would be a ton more work (especially since i’m already a junior) and idk if i’m making the right choice.

So here are some of my more important factors for each job (i’ve researched a lot online but i want to hear first hand)

- How stressful is the job (actuary seems to be less stressful)

- How much take home work do you get (I want a job where i can come home and relax)

- Which pays better / is it easier to get promoted and make money ? 

I’m really sorry if this post seems a little annoying or sm btw it’s my first time posting to this reddit and i could use the advice 😂"

I wanted to know if you could help me with something related to bioinformatics. 

I am currently a major in analytical philosophy and specialized in epistemology and mathematical logic (in a Master program). I have a pretty good future ahead of me in the field and my research director is dope.


However, being relatively happy with my cursus (got crazily bored actually) I decided to start an undergrad program in science in parallel of Philosophy. Precisely, I would like a priori to pursue a career in bioinformatics and research (thanks to my best friend who just came back from an internship in Montreal) but the uni where I am only proposes a program in biology or in computer sciences, distinctively. For now I am engaged in the computer sciences program. 

So what do you think I should do? Biology hence shift or computer sciences and stay with what I barely started?"

While I am grateful for my parents' hospitality, I am extremely unhappy, depressed and can't see the point in life any more.

Been doing an internship at a reputable company over the summer - so at least that's something. I was lucky and landed a paid internship which adds valuable experience to my CV. But this internship finishes in two weeks' time and I've yet to land a graduate job. So there is no end in sight to living with my parents.

I have basically zero social life - the only good friends that live nearby are a married couple and whenever we hang out I feel like I'm getting in their way/a third wheel, so I've been spending less and less time with them recently. I have many acquaintances from the internship and in the neighbourhood, but we aren't quite on the same wavelength and I don't want to force friendship where there isn't one. I'm not close with my family - they all live hermit lifestyles and don't like to spend any time with each other or me. Loneliness and isolation is really taking its toll.

As well as this, I'm single. Never had a serious relationship because I always get broken up with after 2-3 months of casual dating. I've given up on meeting someone in a serious capacity and feel it isn't worth the heartache any more.

I struggle with my mental health anyway, but this is really bad. I feel depressed, lonely and incredibly bored and can't see a way for it to get better any time soon. I'm applying for jobs and trying to channel the negative energy/use it as motivation to prepare for job interviews, but it's still really hard. I have no joy or excitement in life - every day I spend alone either in my bedroom or at the local library on the computer job searching. I've tried exercising (running, going on long walks, swimming), reading books, browsing dating sites, learning to cook new meals and practising gratitude, but nothing seems to help long-term.

Just needed to get that out there and wonder if anyone could offer any advice..."

So a little backstory, I'm curently finishing my 3rd year of UNI (yaay just 2 more years to go 😂) and since my literally ancient Lenovo Thinkpad (something something) just turned 11 (yep he old) and is on the brink of retirement or death idk whichever comes first, I'm in dire need of a new laptop for UNI stuff (classes, asignments) and for work related stuff ( I'm planning to start my internship in October/November). Oh yeah I'm a law student so a lot of text documents surfing on the internet and some powerpoint presentations etc. Basic stuff, however I do enjoy some light gaming from time to time  and am interested in music ""production"" and light video production (basically I would like to record me playing a guitar directly to the laptop via BOSS Katana amp (sound part) and my nikon d5100 (video part) not sure if I can actually call it a production). 

My birthgivers and I agreed on a budget of 900€ or roughly 1000$ and I am contributing the forst half of the budget or 450€ and they are contributing the rest (a 50:50 split was my demand since I'm trying to be a ""responsible adult"" and not too much of a burden to my parents). 

But there's a catch! I can either choose a new laptop for 900€ or I can get my fathers ""old"" laptop - Asus ROG G771 JW, for free and save 450€.

Total budget and country of purchase: 
CoP: Europe (Slovenia)
ToB: 900€ (roughly 1000$)

Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. 
Good battery is a plus, or best specificatons for the money

How important is weight and thinness to you? 
It's not that important since I would carry it from my flat to UNI or from my flat to work which is less than a 20min walk

Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux. 
Windows or Linux

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. 
15"" minimum if possiblle

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. 
Light gaming, music ""production"" and video editing (Boss tone central, Abbleton and a basic video editor (I dont really know any tbh)

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? 
Star trek online (xD ), Flight simulator (xD) Hearthstone, RTS (AoE, C&amp;C, 

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? 
N/A

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. 
Should I choose a new laptop for 900€ (like for example Lenovo Yoga 730 15"", or any Asus vivo book/zen book, maybe a dell xps) or should I save 450€ and get my dads Asus Rog G771JW (mint condition)?
Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)"

Anything else to know about you:
I plan to do my AP Research project on the recent gentrification of a nearby city and will most likely be contacting a prof as a mentor or on maths education and lesson structure

I've been looking at schools in Boston, so the northeast is really where I'd like to stay but I've also been looking pretty intently at UF, so really east coast. Not looking for a huge party scene but a school with lots of clubs and student interaction is a big plus. Campuses near a city are great, but as long as there are things to do I don't mind either."
cuv9bp,1,2019-08-24,Can you help me? I am about to lose my dream,baklund,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cuv9bp/can_you_help_me_i_am_about_to_lose_my_dream/,"So I am an aspiring Entrepreneur and I started my software company back in March this year. I started it with elder brother and we had this dream to build something from scratch and take it as high as we could. We initially started with a small pool of money which my father gave as starting capital. We had our dream project in mind and we started working on it. Slowly we realized we need more people (freelancers) if we really wanted build a proper brand and market it. And to do that we needed money. We decided to look for investmentand found someone who was interested. The guy was a big shot investor who built a startup and then sold it to a fortune 500 and then started investing and consulting in upcoming startups. So I meet the guy and explain the product. He said to me that the product is good but he is more interested in one module in particular and wanted a different application for it. But I said that we have a plan and the plan is to first get this product out so that it generates money to fund that application. Because the application was a very heavy project in itself. He said he wants to invest but will need a second meeting where we discuss terms and valuation. He asked me to prepare for it and meet 1 month later with a demo of that application. Me and my brother we built that demo and god it looked beautiful (people in data analytics would understand). But I never heard from him again. I was heartbroken. But we now had a product which 20% complete and we were feeling the money slowly slip away. We decided to do something and found an opportunity at my dad's office, they were looking for a software that could do certain things and they said that they would recommend this to all their contractors. We saw a lot of money in that software. We stopped the main project and started working on this new software. In the meantime one of the freelancers he said that he knows an investor and he has discussed the product with him and he is very interested in investing. He setup a meeting but before the meeting he preped me as I was inexperienced. He asked me how much are you asking I said 100,000$, for how much strictly less than 25. He than boasted a lot about that guy and made me feel like nothing and he belittled me and said that you need to be a little flexible because the investor has a lot of contact etc. Fast forward to the meeting. I explain everything he says he's interested and he asks how much do you need and how much equity im willing to give, And I said 28%. That just slipped out of my mouth and it felt justified at that time. But I knew something was not right. We decide to have a second meeting. Before the next meeting this freelancer again prepping me. He says he thinks for the value the investor is bringing and the hardwork you have given in his opinion the investor deserves nothing less than 40% but dont worry he wont take control of your company. 49% is his limit too. Now I became sure. He aslo said to me that the shortcoming of the team is that I am not providing the company with anything. My brother is the developer so he is building the product as the CTO and I am not giving anything to the company as a CEO. Now does this with me and my brother on separately and makes us feel bad about ourselves and he said that if the investor is in then he would want him to be part of the management team because he knows his work and me and my brother are strangers. Now we fly to a different city book a couple of rooms in an expensive hotel and then the meeting starts. I and my brother start verbally attacking them because we realised that they were after our company. They got scared and apologized and the meeting got over. The freelancer was angry and he then started delaying everything and still charging more money. He drained a lot of money from us and wasted some more. By thr time we could recover from that our shipment which was suppose to come got stuck due to floods in that state. When the devices came they were all defected. We were planning to launch 1 of our project with those devices but now it was ruined. We incurred heavy loss. Also the dad's office project was complete but we now have to build a license software so that we can license it and not allow piracy. We tried the license options but they were too darn expensive for a small company like ours. So we had no option but build one. Meanwhile our intern was working on our main project. Now, the current state of affairs is that we need a couple of people more to complete our main project and some time to build that software license. But we will run out of money by next week. My brother is working hard on the 2 projects simultaneously but I cant help them with code. I decide to look for a remote job or freelancing but i could not find work. Since I still am a student and have no relevant experience. I work hard, I might not have any hand in the development of the product but I acting as the product owner and guided the development team and the design team to make them understand the vision. I was the person who called 50 people a day to ask whether they want any service when we started having money problems. I could ask my father for money but that would mean that I have failed as a leader. I want to fight, I want to hang in there. But nobody is ready to give me a chance. Trust me, right now i will do any job just to make sure that the development does not stop. My company will go bankrupt, please help."

I'd really be interested to hear some of your stories. Obviously, things will vary based on your city and employer, but I'd like to hear what your experiences have been, to get a general idea.

In Montreal, video game devs complain about being forced to work crazy amounts of unpaid overtime. Would mobile app developers suffer the same kind of crunch culture? Or could I reasonably expect a 40 hour week?

Do devs typically jump from contract to contract or is it more common to get hired as full-time employees? The program coordinator at the bootcamp says it's slowly shifting towards the latter, but I'd like to hear about your experience.

How does the work environment (assuming you're working in an office, not at home) compare to other office environments?

How long could you see yourself staying in this job? Where would you go next? I'd like to get a sense of how long-term this career could be.

What are my options in the tech industry?,PhdDropoutThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cuxwc5/cs_phd_dropout_with_not_a_lot_of_dev_experience/,"Hello guys. I am in a very tough situation. Four years into PhD, I have decided to dropout due to burnout (which took a huge toll on my mental health). I understand that this deep into a degree, the best career move would be to persevere and finish my degree. But this post is to specifically ask about my options given that I will be dropping out. 

Some background:

* 2 software engineering internships at Big N-ish companies. I am currently doing my second internship (I am officially on leave from school).

* Course instructor for undergrad algorithms course at my university with excellent reviews.

* Mutiple TAships for a wide variety of courses (mostly upper year and grad courses)

* Since my research area doesn't require a lot of coding, my coding projects are from the courses I took.

* The school I go to is a top 10 CS school.

* I already have a Masters from the same school. So exiting the program now will not give me a new Masters degree.

I am primarily looking for software engineering positions in the industry. However I am not sure what level I should be looking at. Not a new grad since I won't be getting a degree. My total dev experience as an intern is close to a year, so I cannot look for more senior roles. So my questions are as follows

1. What kind of roles should I be targeting in the industry?

2. How do I make myself attractive to recruiters? I believe being a quitter is viewed very negatively by recruiters. I spoke with a couple of recruiters (after referrals) and they both decided not to move forward after hearing my background and my situation. I am not sure if my situation was an automatic no-go or maybe I didn't sell myself properly (I am very low on confidence since this is my first big failure in life).


I honestly believe I will do well in programming interviews as I am very good with programming puzzles (plus I've been practicing leetcode a lot). But my problem is getting an interview in the first place. Any advice will be much appreciated. I can pm my resume if needed."

Now I have bunch of mental issues,GeRa12081010,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cuy7h6/i_was_a_victim_of_sexual_assault_and_sexual/,"On my 16th birthday, I went for drinks with my cousins wearing a skirt and on my way back home (it was August, and 6 PM so still daylight) I was followed by a man who grabbed my bottom and my boobs while trying to kiss me. I managed to ran away but I never told anyone about it because I blamed myself thinking I deserved it because I was wearing a skirt.

When I was 21, 22 I had an internship in an embassy offered by a married diplomat whom I've known previously. When I started the internship he started to threaten me that I should sleep with him or I will 1) lose my internship and 2) he'll tell everyone we had sex anyway. So I slept with him. It was my first sexual experience and I hated it. I was forced to orally satisfy him and sleep with him.  He would call me names, yell at me when I didn't want to meet me, touch me while in office, force me to kiss him, send offensive messages whenever I did not respond, be extremely jealous.  It all lasted for approximately 6 months after which he was replaced to another country. 

I spent years blaming myself, feeling disgusting and ugly for what I have done. I've spent years thinking that all the bad things happening to me are happening because of what I have done with that diplomat and because I hurt his wife to the point that he even forced me to meet with his wife so that no one will suspect. 

I just turned 26 and recently I discovered that I am suffering from anorexia, depression, anxiety, PTSD, low self esteem, self destructive behaviour and possibility of developing OCD and dependent personality disorder. I started therapy and I hope that it will help me to move away from my past but I am afraid that once I stop it everything will be the same as before."

I was extremely depressed in school, and once I left it was even worse.

My family is pressuring me to use my degree and get a job. I have a bachelors in Journalism but I don’t have experience outside of classwork. I chose my major late, I never got an internship and I don’t have the money or a vehicle to move to another place to start as a small town reporter.

During this year I’ve been trying to get internships in my city. I’ve been unsuccessful. Every internship said I was too inexperienced or I didn’t have the skills they were looking for. Eventually I stopped trying and decided to just focus on getting my mental and emotional health together.

Now I’m trying to figure out my next step. I start therapy in two weeks. I finally found a low cost therapist. I’ve been saving for a car and I plan to go back for my masters and focus on Communication.

My reasoning: It’s already been a year and two months since I graduated. I’m not a recent graduate anymore, so no internship will take me. I don’t even have the skills they want. I can’t move for a job because I don’t have money for a car or an apartment just yet. I don’t want to get out to a small town with nothing. If an internship won’t take me then a real job in the real world mostly like won’t either because again, I don’t have enough experience skills. And by the time I gain enough money for both a car and a future apartment, while paying all these bills and therapy, it’ll be well into next year.

My family doesn’t agree. They think I should go to my school and ask them to help me find a job. But how can they help me if I don’t have what jobs are looking for? How can I even get to job if I have no money for transportation or somewhere to live.

I feel stuck in a never ending cycle. Going back to school seems to be my best bet. Anyone have any suggestions?"

I gave my original account the name I use for nearly all my social media, first letter of my name followed by my last name. I’ve been on reddit for a couple years now and it’s never been a problem. However this year I’m taking an internship course at my school where I get to leave school to go to an internship of my choice. I made sure to set my Instagram and others to private, but Reddit doesn’t have this feature nor can you change your name. So me being my naive self just left it alone hoping no one would see it. My reddit account wasn’t terribly offensive or anything just a lot of “edgy” humor and questionable posts. So when I went in for my mock interview with the teacher in charge of the course at my school everything was going well until the very end. She gave me a few pointers on what I should do for my actual profesional interview and then pulled out her computer, and showed me what happens if you search up my name. My stomach sank as she scrolled down clicked on my reddit account and asked if it was mine. Being too ashamed to lie I admitted it was, luckily she was extremely relaxed about it and just asked me to private the account so the company I’m interning with can’t find it. Fast forward a day, and I had to purge the account and start over unfortunately.

TL;DR: My teacher found my original reddit account by searching my name, luckily before my professional interview later this week. Account was burned and now I’m starting over.

Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the Platinum, definitely gonna turn this dumb fuck up into a chance to ace my actual interview."

I think I will get an 8/10 for Bio. I go to his room after school a lot for help on organic chem, and I really liked his class last year.

Essays I haven't started yet, but I'm thinking about a 7/10 or an 8/10 if its especially good. I have a pretty unique personality I feel. My friends would probably describe me as eccentric.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I would appreciate it a whole lot if you guys could give some tips and chance me for the above colleges, and any others that are good in computer science."

I hope I can explain it well for everyone, and that other's perhaps can relate and discuss how they've dealt with similar issues.  
I've been slowly realizing that I have a terrible habit when it comes to debugging when I hit a wall, especially when I'm looking at a new codebase for the first time. Basically, as I try to figure the problem out, my view becomes very narrow, I'll basically do a kind of ""depth-first"" search and when that doesn't work I'll quickly turn to others for help. So if it's not mentioned in the error message or in the same file I'm working on, I won't even give myself a chance look at it in an attempt to fix my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: In an open source project I'm just starting to work on, I was trying to set up a bot in my dev environment. It didn't work, I tried a few things, then gave up and spilled all my trials and errors in the dev chat. Someone said ""did you try a different bot?"" Of course another bot worked. I hadn't even checked the docs of the bot I was trying.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a repeated issue for me. It even cost me a job offer at the end of an internship I had last year, they said I wasn't learning fast enough. I'm trying to contribute to open source projects now to regain my footing and get a job, but I'm making the same mistakes. Perhaps I'm too used to being a student and always being able to turn to my professors for help, and I can't seem to adjust to the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear from anyone who understands what I'm dealing with."

cv1b3a,2,2019-08-24,Advice on coping with a previous layoff and now having a job that I’m not sure about,skinstartswithin,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cv1b3a/advice_on_coping_with_a_previous_layoff_and_now/,"In late 2017 I was laid off from a job right around Christmas that paid really well (large company) and was close to home. I was there for just over a year. I was still in college when I started, and was laid off after I graduated. It was a planned RIF because there were new management and a business merger.

From that, I had a really hard time finding a job in the field that I was once working in, especially since I went to school for something more general. Anyways, I had to look for jobs. The time of year was horrible because of the holidays and the winter season. I was getting interviews, but no job offers. After three months of no success, I decided to take a part-time internship with no pay because I needed to do something while looking for a FT job. It overall took me 8 months to *finally* get a FT job offer (I got a few offers). However, the whole process was very difficult for me for a few reasons. The first thing is school - I went to a state school; where I live in people aren't fond of state schools as much since it implies that the people aren't as smart (I live in a county/state that is very wealthy overall). The other thing was that I majored in a broad subject/concentration/field, and I didn't have over 2 years of work experience in the field because I changed my major/career quite late. And the last was that I had a hard time in interviews - some were really good but I made too much, lived too far, or my experience was on the light side. Some interviews were horrible, and the interviewers were very annoyed with my responses or my candidacy in general. A few of them were very bad, and the interviewer even told me I should consider really changing my life trajectory (his exact words) because I'm not meant to be in (X career). That pretty much ended the search in the field I was once working in, since I didn't get anything in 8+ months even after having experience but not a lot. I decided to go into a slightly different field, and had a lot more luck with it and eventually received a job offer.

However, I feel like I've had some severe ""side effects,"" or in other words, I felt I was really impacted by this whole experience. I barely made money for 8 months and suffered a lot financially and had to move back in with my parents. I also suffered some health issues too which drained more money. But, I feel the mental effects have been more severe than initially thought. It's now been over a year since I've got a job, and I have severe anxiety about even thinking about job searching. Unfortunately, the place I work at has high turnover so everyone is always on edge. It makes me extremely anxious/nervous and my stomach always hurts thinking about getting fired/laid off. I tried just like looking at open jobs and I couldn't get myself to even apply to them because I felt distressed, frazzled, and immediately went into a stressed/autopilot mode because it brought back all those emotions and memories about being jobless and not making money for 8 months.

After I got a job last year I was so done and exhausted from job searching that I deleted all my LinkedIn/indeed/zip recruiter accounts so I can stop this period of my life and move to a new chapter. However, it seems these days without these profiles you don't exist for the job market. I recently tried creating a LinkedIn again, and it took me over a month to gain the courage to create it again. When creating my profile, it made me super stressed and lost thinking about things like networking because I feel as if I was like putting myself out there, and I'm not really proud now of my career/schooling choices and being laid off had a huge part of it. Even in my current position, I feel like I don't handle things as well as I did in the past because something is wrong with me. I am trying to work on it because I've never spiraled down the drain like this before. Don't even get me started on interviewing; I'm really afraid of it now. What makes things worse is that I am not 100% sure what I want from my career and I have no motivation to like take classes to improve in the field I'm in now or just like do the things I see a lot of people doing. Thinking of networking freaks me out and I would feel really fake doing it. I probably wouldn't have the courage to go to a networking event. It just has been a huge trickle-down effect and downward spiral. I have also considered changing my career quite a lot lately and going back to school. 

I just feel like even creating a LinkedIn profile, talking about jobs, career, and school, all make me really stressed out and distressed internally I try to avoid it as much as possible. I think there is something not right."

My contract says that I work 9-6 Monday through Friday. 

My boss is a very rich lady who thinks that everyone owes her everything just because she has money, but I learnt to ignore that in the process. The issue is, now she left to her home country for a month, leaving the company in the hands of the three of us. The time difference with the UK is 7h ahead, and she clearly knows that. However, she feels like she can text me literally 24/7 with huge amount of tasks and gets pissed when I don’t reply. Once I woke up at 3am on a work night from her text thread to me. 

I would just wait until the morning to reply, but this Friday things got out of hand, at least in my opinion. We have a long weekend, and it was discussed prior with my boss that all of us will have a day off. On Friday at 6pm she texts me if I could send her notes from the meeting 3 weeks ago, and even though it’s after my hours I send everything I’ve written and tell her to have a good weekend. I get back endless amount of accusations that she can’t understand my notes (she barely speaks English), nitpicking every single one of the points and telling me to write emails/send her images/etc. It’s 7pm by now. The conversation god this way then (considering her past rudeness and constant texting): 

Me: I will note all of this down and will get back to you with all of this on Tuesday morning. The book that I wrote everything in is in the office. However, now the workday is officially over and it’s the weekend

Her: bank holiday is not for interns normally. Follow all the things you’ve done on Tuesday, not me tell you all the time. 

Me: Have a good weekend

At the moment, I'm taking a step back from practicing in Kali and learning cryptography in my spare time since that topic seems to be blocking me most (i.e. cracking files). After that I was going to learn Python then C/C++ and work on some challenges like hack the box, and CTF's and go from there.

I don't understand how's possible ? For bomgar we have a users management on the computer with the client installed, we don'have the hand on the RDP. It's just a button using the protocol to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both are multiplatform (idk for wallix, but bomgar work VERY NICE on linux debian/ubuntu &amp; mac os). Bomgar seem's more popular (20k company use it -&gt; wallix 770). 

I'm not for change a working solution, i m curious and fear a bit cause my coworker would maybe change it.

If someone know Wallix, i m curious to understand how it work ?"

I briefly participated in a skills course through my university (a top U.S. university) and did a Data Analysis internship this past Summer, after completing another course preparing me for it. In college I took several coding classes and my internship last Summer involved code optimization.

I didn't start looking for jobs until I began my internship, since I knew I wanted to enter data and wanted to use that experience as leverage on my resume when applying. It has been brutal; I feel like I have filled out hundreds of applications, most of them being ghosted or auto-rejected, and only got two interviews. The first interview I was obviously underqualified for, the second one I had earlier this week and I just didn't get it. I am very dissapointed in this whole search process, although I know it usual is like this. However, I was offered a position from said Indian consulting firm. After learning of my starting salary and benefits, I believed it wasn't too bad of an option, since it would be IT related and would involve training (although its in a city I wasn't really interested in living in; I mostly applied to jobs in the major U.S. metro areas.) After doing research on the company, it seems as if the company has a bad reputation and often having it on your resume when applying to future positions can result in it being thrown out completely. This has certainly disheartened me and I have spent these past couple in constant worry for my career. 

How should I feel, and am I potentially making a huge mistake? I feel like I fucked up throughout this whole process; I should have applied to positions while recruiting was happening on campus, I should have done a second major in CS, I should have tried networking more this Summer. I'm just a young postgrad trying to make it.

Sorry for the lack of detail in this post, I don't want to reveal too much information and end up ruining something that actually could be good for me."

I am glad to finally (3 days back) have received my working contract which I have signed and sent back and everything seems to be in order. 

Since I am not a Mauritian Citizen, I need to obtain a working Visa for the duration of my internship. This requires a handful of supporting documents, including a medical exam. 

This is where my issue arose. My internship is starting October 1st, however to both integrate and solve some logistical barriers to and from my workplace we decided to book a one way ticket for the 1st of September some time back. (Before receiving a job offer as we had verbally arranged an opportunity through contacts)

My dilemma is that there is no way for me to obtain a medical certificate by any doctor before my flight to Mauritius meaning I will have to enter the country on a tourist Visa with the intent to complete the medical exam, obtain my working visa and not return back before starting work on the first of October. 

I am afraid that I will break laws entering under false pretences and could have issues obtaining a Visa at all.

cvg7tf,25,2019-08-25,Tickled pink,Saucesourceoah,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cvg7tf/tickled_pink/,"When you hear the phrase “tickled pink”, it doesn’t exactly strike fear or inspiration. This was the issue I was faced with as my employers laughed hysterically at my resume, pounding the table in jubilation. 

My dream has always been to join the United justice front, or ujf, “protect those less fortunate, not blessed with the gift of our powers”, a phrase I now know is bull shit. Just do as the corporate egg heads say and do not fall out of line. 

Now, I say “our powers” like mine could compare to quasar, the celestial man of might himself, or cartor, the half woman, half jackal hybrid who fought for justice and equal rights. In reality, to them my power was no more than a joke, ironic in itself as my power was to make whomever I touched laugh for as long as I see fit. Of course this wasn’t a useful skill and most of the time I hid my possession of this as long as I could, but that wasn’t possible if I wanted to join ujf.

I had always envisioned myself as a caped crusader, fighting for justice. This dream evaporated with the boiling coffee quasar poured over my head on the first day. “Initiation” they called it. “For our brave new recruit”. I joined the ujf, but due to my powers pathetic nature, I was given intern status and told to do as the “real hero’s told me”. 

The public image of the hero’s is impeccable, riotous, courageous and incorruptible. My vision of this shattered for the first time when I watched cartor, the symbol of justice and mercy for women everywhere, snap the neck of an ice cream vendor when he was out of vanilla, laughing and slaughtering anyone unfortunate enough to witness it. 

I was tasked with disposing of all the “criminals”. Those the hero’s killed at their whim. Be it those dastardly villains who cut in line, scratched their car, or god forbid had a reservation at a packed restaurant, none were shown mercy, merely executed for their treason and lack of morality. It didn’t take long for my resentment to grow, exacerbated by the incessant torment by the hands of my peers. This was merely resentment until the poacher crossed the line.

Now, for a name like The Poacher, you would expect him to be an animal hunter, perhaps someone who scours the globe for the most sought after trophy animals. In reality he was the lowest of the hero’s, watching police scanners like a hawk. Just before they apprehended big name criminals, he shows up and poaches the kill, sniping them and collecting the body for a bounty later on. Now he was a hell of a shot, but one of the few who didn’t have any powers beyond being an ex military sharp shooter. 

I was never on his bad side, hell not even on his radar, until I brought in Sam. I may be a lowly intern, but I was still working at the most prestigious company in all of North America. Because of this I wanted to show it off to my girlfriend Sam. We were high school sweethearts and she wanted to see my work, even if I hated everything about it at this point. I intentionally brought her in when I knew no one would be around. Just a quick look around and we leave, that was the plan. This changed when we stumbled into The Poacher.

We entered the break room as the last stop on our quick tour, hoping to just convince Sam it was boring and she shouldn’t see it again. Unfortunately when we entered, our eyes were greeted by The Poacher, his back to us, making wet, squelching noises. I tried to back out quietly but no noise escapes his god damn notice. He whipped around bewildered, his hands clutching a lump of meat and hair. It took me several seconds to process what I was seeing. A man I recognized as the security guard on level one was lying at The Poachers feet, looking peaceful, save for the fact his head was nowhere to be seen. The Poacher, as it turns out, has a habit of keeping and skinning the skull of his trophy kills for some sick obsession. Clearly his image of being the mighty hunter of villains would be tainted if the public knew what sick, twisted shit this freak did. In that moment when he saw us, he knew, and we knew that he wasn’t going to just let us leave.

I could take a lot. I took torment, names, abuse, borderline torture for the full 7 months I worked at ujf. But seeing the glee in the eyes of this man as he dashed across the floor, seized Sam, and broke her spine effortlessly made something in me snap. The way he did it so mercilessly and callously. The way I couldn’t react quick enough to stop it. The way I had to listen to my soulmate shatter and leave me behind. I was beyond being human, I was nothing anymore. 

My name I had chosen when I signed up was the joker, cool, edgy and fit my powers well. It wasn’t until my first day that Quasar has dubbed me “tickled pink”. I guess in retrospect I should thank him, it did make me sound harmless after all. Did you know however, that laughing consumes a hell of a lot of oxygen? Well dear old Poacher found out as he turned to me, clutching my everything limply in his hands. As he turned he grinned. “Ay, come on now pinky, you know the rules. None of these sheep can see us ow we really is, this’ll be our dirty lil secret”. I took no time to consider the consequences. Lightly touching Poachers shoulder, he began convulsing. Wracked with spasms. I walked away, outside the building, into an alley and vomited my guts out. I lay there shivering. I didn’t move when I heard the screams from inside the building. I didn’t move when I saw them bring out the seizuring body of the Poacher, foaming from the mouth and still braying like a hyena. I didn’t move when he flatlined in the parking lot. I only moved when I saw the utf trucks pull up in the front.

I was used. I was abused. I was forced to watch my world be shattered by a man who wore the word justice like a fuckin cloak. No more. Now I have the most powerful collection of super humans after my head for killing their comrade. I relish the thought of this though. Bring yourselves to me, I will bring an end to the phony masquerade you have fooling everyone. Justice will be when I stand atop the ujf with a pile of hero’s bodies beneath me. As I write this, Chiron, the freak from the depths, and Abyssal in all his hentai bordering glory are being sent after me. The trick is, no mater how super, they’re still human. Ironically, after what I’ve done, I don’t think I am."

cvh8y5,14,2019-08-25,Great tips gathered online to help with your next interview,stephen301,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/cvh8y5/great_tips_gathered_online_to_help_with_your_next/," 

Want to ace your next interview and land that [**open job**](http://www.experisjobs.us/experisjobs/job-search.htm) you’ve been seeking? Here are 20 tips to help you prepare.

**1. Research the industry and company.**  
An interviewer may ask how you perceive his company's position in its industry, who the firm's competitors are, what its competitive advantages are, and how it should best go forward. For this reason, avoid trying to thoroughly research a dozen different industries. Focus your job search on just a few industries instead.

**2. Clarify your ""selling points"" and the reasons you want the job.**  
Prepare to go into every interview with three to five key selling points in mind, such as what makes you the best candidate for the position. Have an example of each selling point prepared (""I have good communication skills. For example, I persuaded an entire group to ...""). And be prepared to tell the interviewer why you want that job – including what interests you about it, what rewards it offers that you find valuable, and what abilities it requires that you possess. If an interviewer doesn't think you're really, really interested in the job, he or she won't give you an offer – no matter how good you are!

**3. Anticipate the interviewer's concerns and reservations.**  
There are always more candidates for positions than there are openings. So interviewers look for ways to screen people out. Put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself why they might not want to hire you (“I don't have this,” “I'm not that,” etc.). Then prepare your defense: “I know you may be thinking that I might not be the best fit for this position because \[their reservation\]. But you should know that \[reason the interviewer shouldn't be overly concerned\].""

**4. Prepare for common interview questions.**  
Every ""how to interview"" book has a list of a hundred or more ""common interview questions."" (You might wonder just how long those interviews are if there are that many common questions!) So how do you prepare? Pick any list and think about which questions you're most likely to encounter, given your age and status (about to graduate, looking for a summer internship). Then prepare your answers so you won't have to fumble for them during the actual interview.

**5. Line up your questions for the interviewer.**  
Come to the interview with some intelligent questions for the interviewer that demonstrate your knowledge of the company as well as your serious intent. Interviewers always ask if you have any questions, and no matter what, you should have one or two ready. If you say, ""No, not really,"" he or she may conclude that you're not all that interested in the job or the company. A good all-purpose question is, ""If you could design the ideal candidate for this position from the ground up, what would he or she be like?""

If you're having a series of interviews with the same company, you can use some of your prepared questions with each person you meet (for example, ""What do you think is the best thing about working here?"" and ""What kind of person would you most like to see fill this position?"") Then, try to think of one or two others during each interview itself.

**6. Practice, practice, practice.**  
It's one thing to come prepared with a mental answer to a question like, ""Why should we hire you?"" It's another challenge entirely to say it out loud in a confident and convincing way. The first time you try it, you'll sound garbled and confused, no matter how clear your thoughts are in your own mind! Do it another 10 times, and you'll sound a lot smoother and more articulate.

But you shouldn't do your practicing when you're ""on stage"" with a recruiter; rehearse before you go to the interview. The best way to rehearse? Get two friends and practice interviewing each other in a ""round robin"": one person acts as the observer and the ""interviewee"" gets feedback from both the observer and the ""interviewer."" Go for four or five rounds, switching roles as you go. Another idea (but definitely second-best) is to tape record your answer and then play it back to see where you need to improve. Whatever you do, make sure your practice consists of speaking aloud. Rehearsing your answer in your mind won't cut it.

**7. Score a success in the first five minutes.**  
Some studies indicate that interviewers make up their minds about candidates in the first five minutes of the interview – and then spend the rest of the interview looking for things to confirm that decision! So what can you do in those five minutes to get through the gate? Come in with energy and enthusiasm, and express your appreciation for the interviewer's time. (Remember: She may be seeing a lot of other candidates that day and may be tired from the flight in. So bring in that energy!)

Also, start off with a positive comment about the company – something like, ""I've really been looking forward to this meeting \[not ""interview""\]. I think \[the company\] is doing great work in \[a particular field or project\], and I'm really excited by the prospect of being able to contribute.""

**8. Get on the same side as the interviewer.**  
Many interviewers view job interviews as adversarial: Candidates are going to try to pry an offer out of the interviewer, and the interviewer's job is to hold onto it. Your job is to transform this ""tug of war"" into a relationship in which you're both on the same side. You could say something as simple as, ""I'm happy to have the chance to learn more about your company and to let you learn more about me, so we can see if this is going to be a good match or not. I always think that the worst thing that can happen is to be hired into a job that's wrong for you – then nobody's happy!""

**9. Be assertive and take responsibility for the interview.**  
Perhaps out of the effort to be polite, some usually assertive candidates become overly passive during job interviews. But politeness doesn't equal passivity. An interview is like any other conversation – it’s a dance in which you and a partner move together, both responding to the other. Don't make the mistake of just sitting there waiting for the interviewer to ask you about that Nobel Prize you won. It's your responsibility to make sure he walks away knowing your key selling points.

**10. Be ready to handle illegal and inappropriate questions.**  
Interview questions about your race, age, gender, religion, marital status, and sexual orientation are inappropriate and in many areas illegal. Nevertheless, you may get one or more of them. If you do, you have a couple of options. You can simply answer with a question (""I'm not sure how that's relevant to my application""), or you can try to answer ""the question behind the question"": ""I don't know whether I'll decide to have children in the near future, but if you're wondering if I'll be leaving my job for an extended period of time, I can say that I'm very committed to my career and frankly can't imagine giving it up.""

**11. Make your selling points clear.**  
If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound? More important, if you communicate your selling points during a job interview and the interviewer doesn't get it, did you score? On this question, the answer is clear: No! So don't bury your selling points in long-winded stories. Instead, tell the interviewer what your selling point is first, then give the example.

**12. Think positive.**  
No one likes a complainer, so don't dwell on negative experiences during an interview. Even if the interviewer asks you point blank, ""What courses have you liked least?"" or ""What did you like least about that previous job?"" don't answer the question. Or more specifically, don't answer it as it's been asked. Instead, say something like, ""Well, actually I've found something about all of my classes that I've liked. For example, although I found \[class\] to be very tough, I liked the fact that \[positive point about the class\]"" or ""I liked \[a previous job\] quite a bit, although now I know that I really want to \[new job\].""

**13. Close on a positive note.**  
If a salesman came to you and demonstrated his product, then thanked you for your time and walked out the door, what did he do wrong? He didn't ask you to buy it! If you get to the end of an interview and think you'd really like that job, ask for it! Tell the interviewer that you'd really, really like the job – that you were excited about it before the interview and are even more excited now, and that you're convinced you'd like to work there. If there are two equally good candidates at the end of the search – you and someone else – the interviewer will think you're more likely to accept the offer, and thus may be more inclined to make an offer to you.

Even better, take what you've learned about yourself from your MyPath career assessment and use it to explain why you think this is the job for you: ""I've done some careful career self-assessment, and I know that I'm most interested in \[one or two of your most important career interest themes\], and – correct me if I'm wrong – it seems that this position would allow me to express those interests. I also know that I'm most motivated by \[two or three of your most important motivators from your MyPath assessment\], and I have the sense that if I do well, I could get those rewards in this position.

Finally, I know that my strongest abilities are \[two or three of your strongest abilities from your MyPath assessment\], and I see those as being the abilities you most need for this position."" If you follow this tip, you'll be (a) asking for the job, (b) explaining why you think it's a good match, (c) displaying your thoughtfulness and maturity, and (d) further disarming the tug-of-war dynamic that interviewers anticipate. You'll be making the strongest possible ""close"" – and that's worth a lot!

**14. Bring a copy of your resume to every interview.**  
Have a copy of your resume with you when you go to every interview. If the interviewer has misplaced his or her copy, you'll save a lot of time (and embarrassment on the interviewer's part) if you can just pull your extra copy out and hand it over.

**15. Don't worry about sounding ""canned"".**  
Some people are concerned that if they rehearse their answers, they'll sound ""canned"" (or overly polished or glib) during the interview. Don't worry. If you're well prepared, you'll sound smooth and articulate, not canned. And if you're not so well prepared, the anxiety of the situation will eliminate any ""canned"" quality.

**16. Make the most of the ""Tell me about yourself"" question.**  
Many interviewers begin interviews with this question. So how should you respond? You can go into a story about where you were born, what your parents do, how many brothers and sisters and dogs and cats you have, and that's okay. But would you rather have the interviewer writing down what kind of dog you have – or why the company should hire you?

Consider responding to this question with something like: ""Well, obviously I could tell you about lots of things, and if I'm missing what you want, please let me know. But the three things I think are most important for you to know about me are \[your selling points\]. I can expand on those a little if you'd like."" Interviewers will always say, ""Sure, go ahead."" Then you say, ""Well, regarding the first point, \[give your example\]. And when I was working for \[company\], I \[example of another selling point\]."" Etc. This strategy enables you to focus the first 10-15 minutes of the interview on all of your key selling points. The ""Tell me about yourself"" question is a golden opportunity. Don't miss it!

**17. Speak the right body language.**  
Dress appropriately, make eye contact, give a firm handshake, have good posture, speak clearly, and don't wear perfume or cologne! Sometimes interview locations are small rooms that may lack good air circulation. You want the interviewer paying attention to your job qualifications -- not passing out because you've come in wearing Chanel No. 5 and the candidate before you was doused with Brut, and the two have mixed to form a poisonous gas that results in you not getting an offer!

**18. Be ready for ""behavior-based"" interviews"".**  
One of the most common interview styles today is to ask people to describe experiences they have had that demonstrate behaviors that the company thinks are important for a particular position. You might be asked to talk about a time when you made an unpopular decision, displayed a high level of persistence, or made a decision under time pressure and with limited information, for example.

Step 1 is to anticipate the behaviors this hiring manager is likely to be looking for. Step 2 is to identify at least one example of when you demonstrated each behavior. Step 3 is to prepare a story for each example. Many people recommend using SAR (Situation-Action-Result) as a model for the story. Step 4 is to practice telling the story. Also, make sure to review your resume before the interview with this kind of format in mind; this can help you to remember examples of behaviors you may not have anticipated in advance.

**19. Send thank-you notes.**  
Write a thank-you note after every interview. Type each note on paper or send them by email, depending on the interviewers' preferences. Customize your notes by referring specifically to what you and the interviewer discussed; for example, ""I was particularly excited about \[or interested by, or glad to hear\] what you said about ..."" Handwritten notes *might* be better if you're thanking a personal contact for helping you in your job search, or if the company you're interviewing with is based in Europe. Whatever method you choose, notes should be sent within 48 hours of the interview.

To write a good thank-you note, you'll need to take time after each interview to jot down a few things about what the interviewer said. Also, write down what you could have done better in the interview, and make adjustments before you head off for your next interview.

**20. Don't give up!**  
If you've had a bad interview for a job that you truly think would be a great fit for you (not just something you want badly), don't give up! Write a note, send an email, or call the interviewer to let him or her know that you think you did a poor job of communicating why you think this job would be a good match. Reiterate what you have to offer the company, and say that you'd like an opportunity to contribute. Whether this strategy will get you a job offer depends on the company and on you. But one thing's for sure: If you don't try, your chances are exactly zero. We've seen this approach work on numerous occasions, and we encourage you to give it that last shot.

If you follow the above 20 strategies, you'll be as prepared as any candidate an interviewer has ever seen. Check out our [**Open Jobs** ](http://www.experisjobs.us/experisjobs/job-search.htm)to start your new career today. Good luck!"

Hi! This is my first post on Reddit and I have little idea on how it works, so please bear with me.

I am 25F with a 6yo daughter, and my boyfriend is soon to be 24. He is getting his bachelor's degree in computer science, which can eventually lead to a financially stable life for us. I am super excited for him but I cant help but to feel jealous.

I got pregnant with my daughter the summer after I graduated high school. My life has been tough ever since and I never went to college. Now I am safe, and financially stable for the most part.

I work while my boyfriend goes to school. I work full time as a CNA, providing support to adults with developmental disabilities. As great as it is, I'm not sure it's the job I want for the rest of my life. Boyfriend says he will appreciate it if I stayed a fulltime employee until he completed his degree and internship, then I can be a stay at home mom and not worry about work anymore.

On the other hand, i like making money of my own, too, but i want a career. I want to go to school. But I also want to be a stay at home mom so my daughter can participate in extra curricular activities such as girl scouts and soccer.

My boyfriend will support either option I decide but I am so confused; and really just seeking advice. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Be a stay at home parent, or go to school for 4 years and work afterward?"

My course-load isn't super tough, I'm planning to take 2-3 classes depending on what I get off the waitlist for. Right now, I'm enrolled/waitlisted for CogSci 190 (seminar), CS 160, Philosophy 12A, and CS W186.

I'll probably have to drop 12A since it's 3 days a week (unless someone knows if attendance isn't mandatory). I've heard 186 isn't super easy. 


So I guess my plan is to take 160 and the seminar (if I can get off the waitlist for 160), so that's 7 units total. Does this sound reasonable or am I committing suicide here? Please advise, thanks!


Also, seriously, if anyone has taken 12A, let me know how mandatory attendance is and if it's webcasted!"

cvibzs,1,2019-08-25,Average time to hear from a company after applying? (Applying for jobs and I've encountered a bit of a anomaly),KimboSlicedOranges,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cvibzs/average_time_to_hear_from_a_company_after/,"So, a bit about me. Mid-twenties, been a software developer in NJ working for a very well-known company for about 4+ years (1.5 as an intern while I finished school, 2.5+ since graduating) and I've decided to apply for other companies in search of better opporrunities.

I applied to a rather well-known company (Hint: Streaming music... lots of green...) beginning of July, got a call back a week later for a phone interview with the recruiter, then a phone screening/technical interview two weeks later at the end of the month.

Tech interview went rather well, although I could've done better. The interviewer and I got along rather nicely. It was an hour, solved both the technical question and coding prompt, so I was feeling pretty good about myself.

...and that was it. It's been more than a month since I've heard back. My application on jobvite still says ""In Progress""... I even emailed the person who coordinated the phone interview and she says she'll email the recruiter... that was two weeks ago...

I'd like to say that I've been rejected, but upon asking for that info, they still haven't gotten back to me....

I've applied to other places and have either gotten a quick turnaround time or no response at all... this one strikes me as weird as I had two interviews with them, and now they decide to ghost? It's quite confusing. Out of all the companies I applied to, this one I'm particular excited about, but obviously, it would be foolish of me to solely wait on this job when there are plenty others out there, but my fear is I accept another job offer and then they FINALLY decide to have me in for an in-person interview... It's honestly stresssing me out...

Thanks in advance to anybody who responds. Any answer is sincerely appreciated

I’m in college still and in my early twenties. Over the summer I interned at a company in a position in my field, and they have given me a full time offer that I accepted in which I would start next week. The full time position however is not in my field, and is completely unrelated. I really liked the company (culture, people, etc.) and don’t want to do them wrong.

But here is the kicker: I received an offer for another internship that IS in my field, doing the same work I was doing at the other company (what I intend to do when I graduate). I won’t get benefits, but the pay is double and this is a reputable company that is well-known in the industry (international and Fortune 500). They have let me know that when I graduate they are looking to hire me on full time when the internship finishes.

I can’t let the company I originally interned with this summer know quite yet because I still have to pass the BG check (This company deals with federal contracts and I have a misdemeanor juvenile arrest they’ll 100% see as its a federal check. I’m not sure if it’s an issue yet, nor did HR).

What do I do here? If I didn’t have to worry about the BG check I’d just let the company I plan to work full time for know, but I can’t risk unemployment if I end up failing the check. On the other hand I’d feel like a garbage person if I screwed the first company by working for a week or two and bailing, but I think this might be a better career move (and a girls gotta eat). I’d also like their references, which I may or may not lose out on.

Anyone have any advice for a youngin who has no idea how to navigate the job world quite yet? How bad would this look going forward if I do end up screwing the summer internship company?"

The reason I would be doing it is finding  a job more easily, since I want to find job in UK/Ireland and I've been trying without much success.

Do you think a MSc will be useful for this? Or should I stick to my current job until I have enough coding experience to be considered? Issue is that the jobs I've applied too are junior jobs with no special requirements, so I thought that it could be because competition with many graduate degrees. (Also my BCs is a bit weak..)"

cvmakm,0,2019-08-26,Are these languages taught in my course enough?,stillscottish1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cvmakm/are_these_languages_taught_in_my_course_enough/,"So for my first year in university, we got taught C and C++ but weren’t expected to do anything more complex than a program that takes scores for a tennis tournament and displays them. But from next year onwards, we’re only getting taught Java and Python with some SQL and a bit of Haskell. I’m kinda worried these languages may not be enough to future proof me plus I want to go into a safe industry of system engineering but it seems C and C++ are best for them. Also, I can’t learn these languages in my free time because my course requires 60 hours a week from me and my holidays need to spent with internships to ensure I get a good job after uni. 

What do I do? Should I just be happy with Java and Python and let them be my languages until I get some free time after university and in my job in software engineering to learn other languages or should I ask to transfer to something like Electronic and Electrical Engineering which has quite a bit of C and C++ (there’s an entire module in final year called Programming in C++) which may not be as good as my Computer Science course because my course includes a lot of theory which I like and we do spend more time programming plus I don’t really like the huge amount of mechanics and maths in EE because I mainly want to go into systems engineering. I’m in the UK btw

cvmxco,0,2019-08-26,Software engineer position,al95eng,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cvmxco/software_engineer_position/,"I have an interview this week with a fairly large company for their software team. It's a junior role, which apparently involves writing documentation, testing software, and analysing software and fixing bugs and so forth. They told me they think I would be a very good fit. The ad listed C# as their main language, with C++ and database knowledge being advantageous, and that knowledge of at least two different languages is required.

Now, they listed any CS or IT degree as a requirement, but I am about to finish with a BE BSc in Electronics Engineering and Physics. I have used Python extensively, a little bit of Java in my degree. I've also worked with C/C++ and microcontrollers during an internship. I am also self-taught in C# .NET over the last several years, including both WPF and WinForms, LINQ, and a little bit of Lambda expressions, regular expressions and multithreading. I have worked on some projects with this, involving Sqlite and Mysql databases. I love documentation, and I thoroughly documented these with clean and commented code, lots of class diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. I have a thorough grounding with OOP and UML.

So given, I don't have any paid commercial experience besides internships, how can I sell myself?"

So for the past 4 or so years I have been struggling with anxiety with it going up and down in intensity. I have been living with my girlfriend for about a year and a half now and everything is great between us. We travel, we go out, we have dates, all in all it’s amazing. 

This past month she went back home (belgium) to work and I remained in Italy to finish an internship. I have not felt this lonely in years and it’s scaring me a lot. Having trouble sleeping, some panic attacks here and there, so not a nice experience could say. 

One of my biggest struggles right now is that there is no one one the city, I have one friend here but he owns a bar so works from 7pm-2am and I finish work at 6. So needless to say there is no time for us to meet up or hang out. 

I have spent the last month stuck in my apartment with barely any motivation to do anything, even eating becomes hard for me as my mind just thinks of getting sick when the thought of food comes up. It’s hard for me to wake up for work, even when I’m trying to get myself to wake up early to go tot he gym.(I thought paying that much money for the membership would force me to go) 

So long story short, I wanna know if you guys have any advice for me or if there’s someone out there going through the same thing. 

Anything is appreciated as I’m getting desperate and feeling more useless by the second..."

I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I am thinking about the future. If I make it through this semester and next semester without dropping a class and enroll in a class for Summer 2020, I will be halfway complete with the program by the end of the Summer.

Coursework specifics aside is ""half a Master's degree"" a good point to likely get an internship? I am likely going to pursue CS specialization in order to round out my skill set, flavored with some ML/II electives. 

Are Fall/Spring internships common? I was able to work full time Fall and Spring semesters in undergrad (a different field), and I would like to either try to go full-time student and take 3 classes Fall 2020 or try to stick with the two semesters, get a Fall/Spring internship and finish the program Summer 2021. 

Any insight from folks in the program would be appreciated."

Landed my first IT job at the start of 2018. It's a general IT role, doing helpdesk support for 2 offices of a total of 250ish people, along with doing a bit of sys admin &amp; general work - routine server checks, data backup &amp; restores, file permissions (ISO27001 standards), hardware refreshes (with win7 going EOL most PCs in the office needed replacing). Everything I currently work with is Windows, both desktop and server, and we use zero cloud architecture, everything is on-prem.

I was doing this support role with 1 sysadmin and 1 other IT support, but around 6 months ago the other IT support guy left the company and hasn't been replaced. I was given an intern to look after, but only had him for 2 months, so am the sole IT support. But that's beside the point.

I taken it upon myself to do the Google IT Support Professional Coursera course, and the company recently paid for me to do the ITIL foundation exam.

I would class myself as a jack of all trades at the minute, having had a huge interest in computers &amp; all things tech since a young age. I pick new things up fairly quickly. I would prefer to stray away from helpdesk support at this point, I find it very monotonous and the days are starting to drag.

What would be a recommended route to take from here?

cvtg9m,2,2019-08-26,Transfer Advice for CS Community College Student,falcon_IX_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cvtg9m/transfer_advice_for_cs_community_college_student/,"Howdy, I'm currently starting my second year of college at a local California community college, and will begin taking major prep/prereq. courses for Computer Science. Ultimately I'm looking for advice on how to focus my efforts for the remainder of my time at the CCC level of education and properly prepare for transfer.

I spent my first year of school trying to determine what subject I wanted to eventually major in and pursue through transfer to either a CSU or UC, and I ended up spending the entire first year of college taking random IGETC classes to fill out my general education requirements. As a result, I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and I've begun to focus on majoring in Computer Science, as its something I've grown quite fond of, and eventually transferring into a four-year institution to attain a Bachelor's Degree.

I am unsure as to which school I'd like to focus my efforts on and attempt to transfer to after my time at the CCC level is complete. It will likely take me this school year, along with an additional school year to finish all of the courses necessary for transferring into a UC for CS. I had my sights set on schools like UC Berkeley, as I feel that my drive and determination so far in school should help me in being able to finish all of the requirements for transfer. However, I've also been considering a number of other schools such as Georgia Tech, UofW, UCSD, &amp; UCI to name a few.

The requirements for transfer into CS for a school like Cal is fairly rigorous and includes natural science courses such as Cellular &amp; Molecular Bio, Multivariable Calculus, and Physics courses. I am aware of how prestigious UC Berkeley is when it comes to CS, and I understand why these prereqs are in place, but my question is whether it's worth my energy to focus on meeting these requirements and aiming for acceptance to Cal, or if transferring to the other schools mentioned above would be acceptable.

For example, several schools I mentioned such as Georgia Tech, UCSD, and especially UCI have fairly lax prereqs. Some of these schools do not require transfer applicants to have taken any natural science courses, physics courses, or even multivariable calculus. While I am willing to attempt the courses that are required for transfer to Cal, it would certainly be a tight squeeze fitting all of those additional courses into the two years I plan on being at my community college. 

Overall, essentially my question is whether it's worth aiming for transfer to Cal over the other schools mentioned. I know going to Cal for CS has its perks for internships, interviewing and being employed by FAANG companies, etc., in comparison to some of the other schools I have mentioned. I would appreciate any feedback as to whether it really is worth keeping my options open and taking those additional classes, or avoiding them and focusing more on transfer to some of the other UCs or even out of state schools.

Several of the recruiters noted that I performed exceptionally well in my interview but it wasn’t a good fit regardless. 

I don’t have a good relationship with my parents and my unemployment has let them down greatly. For the last two weeks my dog and I have been living in my car.

cvv3yl,2,2019-08-26,Want to get into data field with no job experience and only receiving interviews for other positions,angeloand,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cvv3yl/want_to_get_into_data_field_with_no_job/,"Recently graduated with a B.S in Economics with no internships or past related job in the field that I want to get into (analyst). I have no SQL, tableau knowledge, and minimal coding experience(intro java, c, c++, c#, javascript, mobile app program classes from college).

In the past week I've been putting in hours to learn SQL and python. I've learned the basics and syntax of both. Finishing w3school, standford online course, and code academy course on SQL. Then going to follow advice on reddit on how to continue afterwards.

I've only gotten two job interviews and neither of them are for the career path that I want to get into (data analyst). I have not heard back from any of the companies' in where I applied to an analyst position.

So here is where I am at a struggle of what to do. Right now, I am fortunate enough that I do not absolutely need to find a job (no debt and living with parents and 30k saved up). Both job interviews led me to the second phase of each process. One is a ride-along with an employee to see what the position does and the second is an in-person interview after completing their phone interview. I don't see myself in any of those positions long term and see it as it slowing me down in terms of finding a position in my ideal career(less dedicated time to learn and experiment with SQL, tableau, excel, and python).

So I am thinking about letting both those interviewers know that I would like to withdraw because I want to pursue a career in data analyst, thank them for their time. Is this a stupid thing to do, should I go along through the interview process and if I get an offer, accept it? If I do withdraw would it be disrespectful or a bad idea to mention that if they have a data analyst position open up in the future to let me know? Neither of the companies have a analyst position as they are relatively small but I feel that many sales businesses after growing will eventually need an analyst.



TLDR: Received job interviews from two companies, moved on to the second phase, for both positions that I do not see myself long term. Should I move along through the interview or withdraw both to save my time and the interviewers time while continuing to learn the tools and skills necessary for data analyst role? At this time I do depend on a job for my survivability. 


Also for anyone in data analyst or analytics, any advice on ordering of what I should learn? I was told Excel- SQL - Programming language - Tableau. Also what would be the best way to learn SQL as I have heard that working at a company with large amount of data is the best and fastest way to learn, any alternatives?"

I'm thinking of going into aerospace engineering so I can end up working for NASA.

GPA: 3.95UW/4.35W   
  
SAT: 790M/760E (superscore)  
  
Awaiting Math 2 and physics scores  
  
State: VA
  
ECs (not that good tbh): was part of an FRC team in 10th where I had somewhat of a leadership role (I had to move), I have a job working at a STEM school for kids (probably my best one), and I'm applying to volunteer/get a job at the closeby air and space museum.  
  
Here are my preferences:  
Location: preferably somewhere it snows, or California  
Small, academics-focused school is my ideal school but in willing to compromise on this  
Not above $35k or so yearly in cost  
It would also be amazing to get into a university close to a NASA center (DC metro area, Bay Area, LA, Houston, etc) so I can get an internship.  
  
Here's my list:  
  
Safeties: Capital Technologies University, my local CC (it's extremely difficult to find good safeties since AE is a rare major and many of the ""safe"" schools are OOS and expensive).  
  
Targets: VT, UVA, CU Boulder  
  
Reaches: UMD, Purdue, Rice, UMich, Georgia Tech  
  
Upper reaches (impossible to get into schools, but I would like to): Stanford, MIT, Caltech  
  
I kept cost, AE rankings, chances to get in, and proximity to a NASA center in mind while I made that list.   
  
  
I do have a few questions:  
  
How different are AE and ME? I was thinking that if I couldn't make it into any of my AE schools, I could do ME at GMU or something and do a Master's in AE.  
  
Does getting AP credit reduce tuition cost? From my understanding, you're charged by year, not by credit.  
  
Is the NASA pathways a good option for me?  
  
If I don't get into NASA, and don't want to work for the defense industry, what other options do I have?  
  
I wanted to minor in CS, but my dad is suggesting a double major with AE and CS since he's scared AE will be too difficult for me and that the job market for it is really competitive.  
  
On that note, how difficult is AE compared to other engineering majors? 

What do you guys think of my list? Any additions/advice would be welcomed.   
  
Thanks in advance!"

I studied at a top university. I did quite well my first year and a half, but I made a rash decision to quit my former major in favor of something with more stable job opportunities (and completely unrelated to my former major) that I thought I liked. Within a few weeks of switching to engineering, I decided to apply for a few internships over winter break, and I secured an offer by January-end from a great firm due to my high GPA at that time. Later that spring, however, I struggled with some serious mental health issues and even had to miss a fair bit of college to recover from a suicide attempt. 

I bombed a lot of my classes because of it all, but I recovered in time to still take part in my internship that summer. I earnestly followed treatment options, started feeling better, and performed incredibly well at my job. I enjoyed the type of work, and I thought that the high-demand work culture worked very well for me. The company was so impressed that I was given a return offer for the next summer, which I gladly accepted. 

I knew I would be placed on academic probation for my multiple failed classes, so once the school year resumed, I took steps to mentally stay afloat; however, I slowly started realizing that my interests in the field were extremely underrepresented in my school's department. I really cared for a certain division of work within my field, but the majority of the classes for that major at my school primarily focused on very high-level math and physics. I did pretty well my first semester of my third year, but, come second semester, I started being unable to handle spending all of my time and energy on upper-level math and physics throughout the spring. I know that I am capable of performing well at a wide number of things, but I was just unable to both keep myself mentally healthy and manage 18 hours of course load that I did not care for. I ultimately just pushed too hard and ended up half-assing both things. 

It was also slightly worse in the spring because, at the time, I felt like I had to concentrate all of the upper-level requirements into a smaller number of semesters because I had switched into engineering very late and stupidly still wanted to graduate on time. There are a lot of parts of this story that I wish I could do over: changing the major in the first place, not realizing that I needed help earlier my sophomore year, and being so naïve about how long I should stay in college. 

Even though I slipped academically during my third year, I never slipped as much as I had my second year. I never failed another class, and my grades did slightly improve each semester. I also made sure to use my second summer at the company to show them that I am capable of good work by being a motivated team member and detail-oriented in every task. I made sure that those attributes were reflected in the quality of my work. I worked hard, and, by the end of my time with the firm, I seemed less like an intern and more like a full-fledged employee. This time, I was given a return offer for a full-time position. They even happily accommodated for a delayed start date so I could partake in a passion project after my graduation. I gladly signed the offer. 

My marks did get reasonably better for my fourth year. I excelled at senior design and left good impressions on most of my professors, but I still struggled to get higher than a C for the few remaining upper-level physics and mathematics courses. Even with the improvements, I ended up barely scraping by with just a 2.5 GPA. The huge drop that my GPA took from my second year proved to be much harder to recover from. 

**TL;DR:** At this point, it's important to note that the company is located in North Carolina, which has at-will employment. Even though I have signed an offer for employment with the firm, I understand that they have the ability to terminate that for whatever reason (except for race, etc.). I felt confident in my future with the firm, but I always had this fear in the back of my head that they would want to know my final GPA before I joined. Now, two weeks before my start date, the recruiter for the firm wants me to fill out a ""reapplication"" form of sorts. The form has an education section on it with a spot for GPA. 

Am I completely boned here? What are my options? As I mentioned before, I sincerely don't think that my GPA is representative of my actual work ethic, which I have demonstrated through my multiple internships to be great when it comes to the work that the company does. However, I'm still extremely worried that providing my GPA on a form like this might draw attention to my poor marks, and my panic-stricken brain is expecting the worst. I have admittedly even considered leaving the spot blank or filling in the form with something unrelated in the GPA section as if by accident. 

I've always been a very truthful person, and I am more than a little shocked that I have even considered these options, but I am truly at a loss... I figured I could reach out to the Reddit community to get some good advice and/or tough love. 

Also, if I include my GPA on the form, how should I approach answering any questions from the firm about the GPA? I have gotten a wide variety of answers from my friends, and I am too anxious to feel like I will think clearly about this."

I’m a 17 year old (almost 18) in high school. I am about to go to college at Western Kentucky University. I have a 30 ACT and a 3.7 unweighted GPA. I am good at every subject but math is my weakest point. I have used a computer since I can remember. I built my PC and game on it. I know a bit about software and hardware. 

My passion is history. I love to research and learn about cultures and languages and all of that. My dream is to travel to other countries with doing something with history.

The problem is, there is no money in it and I don’t want to waste my life with a sales job (I currently have one and holy crap it is horrible). I am not all about money, but I want a stable enough job to be able to travel when I want to and to be able to get a job in the first place. I would also like to work remotely at some point so that I can live where I want to.

I did an internship at a company in my city a couple of years ago. They made me code a game along with providing instructions on how to make the game. The purpose of this was to provide it for their coding academy for kids. This would have been fine, if I knew how to code. I went in there telling them I didn’t know how to code and that I did video editing and a bit of animation and came out wanting to never code again. I was left alone by them with my questions not being answered or there would be a few days delay whenever I would only go there once a week (remember that this was also only a month long internship). So that made me hate coding.

Recently I have become more open into doing coding as it will be a stable career in the future. Should I pursue Computer Science? My dream would be to work remotely at some point (obviously not at the start or for a few years). I would also like to work at the Big 4 for obvious reasons. I don’t care about making a lot of money, but I want to make at least $70,000 a year. I appreciate any and all answers and advice. I already know that people will tell me that I am only in high school and I shouldn’t think about this now because my path will change, but I want to know my options for the future. Thank you, and I’m sorry for my rant."

I’m in college still and in my early twenties. Over the summer I interned at a company in a position in my field, and they have given me a full time offer that I accepted in which I would start next week. The full time position however is not in my field, and is completely unrelated. I really liked the company (culture, people, etc.) and don’t want to do them wrong.

But here is the kicker: I received an offer for another internship that IS in my field, doing the same work I was doing at the other company (what I intend to do when I graduate). I won’t get benefits, but the pay is double and this is a reputable company that is well-known in the industry (international and Fortune 500). They have let me know that when I graduate they are looking to hire me on full time when the internship finishes.

I can’t let the company I originally interned with this summer know quite yet because I still have to pass the BG check (This company deals with federal contracts and I have a misdemeanor juvenile arrest they’ll 100% see as its a federal check. I’m not sure if it’s an issue yet, nor did HR).

What do I do here? If I didn’t have to worry about the BG check I’d just let the company I plan to work full time for know, but I can’t risk unemployment if I end up failing the check. On the other hand I’d feel like a garbage person if I screwed the first company by working for a week or two and bailing, but I think this might be a better career move (and a girls gotta eat). I’d also like their references, which I may or may not lose out on.

Anyone have any advice for a youngin who has no idea how to navigate the job world quite yet? How bad would this look going forward if I do end up screwing the summer internship company?"

I've mainly been doing manual qa and sometimes I'll execute automation scripts. They give me more than enough tasks to do. There's maybe a day or 2 where I have nothing to do between testing cycles.

My manager has 3 co-ops, me and person A were hired at the same time and another person B has been here for a year. We all have the same job title but they both got moved to a different team that is agile and they seem to have a lot more opportunities to do different things. Person B eventually became the front end developer/ automation guy for the team.  But he is about to leave so person A is gonna take over for him. Now this makes me quite jealous and seems kinda unfair and want to speak to my manager.

However I'm not sure if I should bring up my frustration/jealousy when talking to my manager or if I should just say something like I've already learned all that I can from manual testing is it possible if I do some automation if there are any opportunities in the future."

cvzgu0,2,2019-08-27,I created software that would save my company $100K+ a year and I started as a Full-Time Employee a month ago. Should I ask for a raise/promotion?,RipNPiza,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cvzgu0/i_created_software_that_would_save_my_company/,"Hi all!

I work at a worldwide tech company. Long story short I worked at the company for 2 summers as an intern and now out of college they hired me full-time (hooray)!

There are workflows we use to do our work and one of the tasks is very tedious. About 5+ hrs of work.

The software I developed (some python scripts) cuts that time to about 2 minutes.

After doing the math. My boss said the python scripts would save the company over $100K+ a year. He and others were very pleased by my work.

I already feel underpaid a bit at my job. I did my research before I took the offer and knew I was being underpaid (about $15K less on average)

If the software I make is going to be used by all other employees, should I be expecting a raise or promotion?

No one else thought of doing this and I developed it on my own. Just trying to gauge if I as a brand new employee have that power or if I should take a back seat for a while.

Any advice helps a bunch! Thanks!"
cvznfg,3,2019-08-27,I feel like shit and the only thing that gives me joy in life are my sighs,DutchFarmers,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cvznfg/i_feel_like_shit_and_the_only_thing_that_gives_me/,"A friend of mine told me I should talk to somebody about my situation. 

I've always been an anxious kid. My self confidence isnt very high and I have always been on the lower end of self esteem. Recently I've been really concerned about my mental health. 

My mental health took a serious hit during college when I started thinking about who I was, what I was doing with my life, and where I would be in the future. I was working in a lab at the time and the constant anxiety of whether or not I did my experiments right really hurt me. It got so bad that I had to start going to therapy just so I could unload my stress and feel ok. I eventually quit because my anxiety was just too much and I wanted to pursue a different path. During all of this I was smoking weed pretty much daily to cope with my feelings of hopelessness.

Fast forward to today. I've graduated college with a degree in a decent field and I work a low wage job. And I feel absolutely fucking miserable. Today was an especially bad day. Part of it is work anxiety. My boss has a short temper and he is prone to make mean-spirited comments whenever anything goes wrong. This pisses me off but it also makes me hate work and results In me becoming depressed whenever it's time to go to work. The fact that a lot of my friends are successful (med school, tech internships, grad school, etc) just makes me wonder what the hell went wrong or if I was destined to be this way. I should count my blessings considering my family isnt struggling and I graduated from a good school with a degree in a respected field. But at the end of the day I feel like shit and sometimes I wonder if my life will end with me committing suicide.

I feel like the ugly duckling. 

I've never been ""cool."" I've always been the awkward one, the one that never seems to ""get it."" It just feels like I was made to be the one who fails because that's how it seems to end up. Am I just not trying hard enough? Am I just lazy? These are the questions I've been asking myself for a long time and I just don't know the answer or maybe deep down I do but I don't want to admit it. 

All of this anger, self hatred, and general sadness has resulted in me becoming a shitty person. I'm bitter and jealous all the time. See a post about how a friend got into med school? Fuck 'em why couldnt that be me. Sometimes I assume the worst about people. Coworker corrects me on something? Fuck you, you know it all bitch. 

When I'm at work I just want to go the fuck home. My boss says I need to smile more but fuck I just can't. What is there to smile about? The one thing that gets me through the day are my sighs. Sometimes I think they're the only thing empowering me. Every work day seems like a torturous slog with the added risk of getting yelled at by my boss. And on my days off I watch the minutes pass by with increasing dread before I have to go back to work.  I can't even escape through my hobbies because it feels like I don't have any anymore. I used to enjoy things but I don't anymore. Recently I've noticed that I'm spending more and more time just sitting in bed watching YouTube or standing on my balcony smoking weed while watching youtube. 

There are times when I just want to scream at the top of my lungs and break things in a fit of despair. 

I've since cut back on my weed use. I haven't fully quit yet but I hope to stop using someday but unless something changes for the better I don't know if I can. There's something nice about just being able to light up and fucking forget all of my troubles for a couple of hours. I'm lost, drifting through life with a vague idea of where I want to be without any hope of getting there because of my own flaws and the hand nature seems to have dealt me. Why me? 

It gets so fucking dark in here sometimes. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TL;DR I have anxiety and I worry about my future all the time. My boss is shitty and makes my anxiety worse which leads to a vicious cycle of hating life, my boss yelling at me, and making me hate it more. I have also developed into a bitter fuck who hates everyone and everything."

Learning a language: although I'm indian, I've had to self teach myself Hindi and punjabi. Right now I'm trying to learn Urdu, but I'm probably not going to list that in my application.

I do some other things like coding and other computer things (not like fully building a computer, don't have the funds to build one, although I do consider myself a ""tinkerer"")

Are these things I should mention in the activities section as something I did all 4 years? Is there anything else I might be overlooking i.e. reading or running (are those things I could put down if I have spent enough time doing them?)

I also had an internship sophomore year at a company for like a year before moving before the beginning of my junior year.

My junior year I don't have anything in scho or out of school (long story short I had a difficult time adjusting and had to deal with a heavy course load)

cw62dm,1,2019-08-27,Transfer to Computer engineering,sjrhee,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/cw62dm/transfer_to_computer_engineering/,"Hi guys, I had posted for transferring ti Computational Media major, but now I also wonder to transfer to Computer engineering. 
I am an international student and currently I am attending at Georgia State Perimeter College. I want to be a software engineer and I am considering to transfer to computational media, computer engineering or mathematics major. I hope I can transfer to computer science, but it is too competitive, so I might not consider that major to transfer.

I heard if I take REPP pathway, then I will get more chance to transfer to Georgia Tech. But when I saw Georgia Tech's Computer Engineering degree requirements, REPP courses have some courses which does not include Georgia Tech's Computer engineering degree requirements. REPP courses includes ENGR 1603 (Intro to engineering), ENGR 1211 (Engineering Graphics &amp; Design), ENGR 1671 (Computing Fundamentals for Engineers) and those are not in the Georgia Tech's Computer engineering degree requirements. It seems if I use the REPP, I will get high possibility, but I will waste my time. Am I right guys? 

I will finish just normal transfer degree requirements in this fall semester. I will apply next summer term as a normal transfer student. My GPA might be 3.7 with 50 credit hours. I will write my resume that I can do Java, C, C++, HTML, I got an internship when I was in Korea, some leadership program and volunteer works.
How do you think my possibility and which major will give me much high possibility for me to transfer at summer term between Computational media and Computer engineering? 

Also, I wonder does Georgia Tech will ask or require me some proofs of my activity and internships which is written on my resume? 

Please share your experience and give me advices. It will help me.

To give you some context, I'm currently enrolled in 2 master programs (one in applied maths and one in data science) in parallel. So far, I have passed all the required exams for both masters (tbh it was challenging, a lot of night and week end studies to catch up classes I've missed because of the mismatch schedules).

One of my master requires me to complete an internship, which I'm currently doing, and to write a report on the internship. The other master requires me to write a research thesis. Meanwhile, I started applying about 2 months ago to look for a job after graduating. At that time, I was pretty confident about completing both my masters, so I put both of them on my resume with the expected graduation date (this september).

However, despite my efforts, I can't say I'm happy with the way my master thesis turned out, and I know my supervisor to be pretty strict in terms of grading. It is probable that I end up failing my master thesis. On the other hand, my internship went really well, and I do believe I have a really good internship report, and it is very unlikely that I do not end up graduating for this master. Tbh, I do not really care about the research master; it is from a much lesser known university than my other master.

The thing is, I've been invited for a last HR interview after passing all the previous technical interview. Should I let them know I might not graduate from one of my master ?"

I attend a 3-year university and I am doing my bachelors in Computer Science. I had no programming experience before I joined the university and also I was diagnosed with ADHD in my first year of uni - it took me the end of the first year to get help and am currently in the process of finding my medication and the dose that works for me. I struggled a lot during my first year because of my ADHD as I couldn't concentrate in class and couldn't sit still while learning programming language. I was able to get average marks in my 1st semester but things started going downhill in my 2nd semester, I was really struggling things started taking better of me and I was depressed. I am taking medications for my ADHD now and am ready for my second year but the thing is that second year is like the toughest year and to add more load I still need to give two exams of my 1st year in 3rd and 4th semester.  
In my summer break I took care of myself (I was suicidal, my parents have invested a lot for me to attend this university and not being able to perform well was making me suicidal) I am better now I am on talk with a psychologist for my ADHD and will be joining university soon, I need to work on these things during my 2nd year:  
1) Be a better programmer (code, code and read book by Stroustrup to be a better programmer)  
2) Do well academically ( I need to ace this year academically, I will have 3CS modules)

3) Find an internship for next summer  
I have identified my problem the main one being ADHD but I will be grateful if you could provide me some tips to do well academically and in terms of programming. It would really help me

I am a faculty member in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Cal Poly Pomona and I recently started an audio podcast titled, ""The Engineering Student Experience,"" which explores topics that are relevant for current and future engineering students. My goal is create a resource that will allow high school students to make a better-informed decision about whether to pursue engineering in college and, if they decide to pursue engineering, to better prepare them for a career as an engineering professional after graduation. You can subscribe to the podcast on most of the popular podcast apps such as Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Google Play Music, and Spotify. You also can access the podcast here: [https://theengineeringstudentexperience.podbean.com/](https://theengineeringstudentexperience.podbean.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, five episodes have been released and I plan on releasing a new episode every month or two. I'm posting on this subreddit to promote the fledgling podcast and elicit ideas for future episodes. Here are some ideas I will explore in upcoming episodes: 

\- Explaining the different types of engineering majors (e.g., Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, etc.)

\- Interviewing professional engineers in different companies (e.g., Boeing, Raytheon)

\- Explaining basic concepts of university life (e.g., how is a typical university structured, what do the different titles of instructors mean)

\- Preparing for entering the workforce (e.g., how to get an internship, how to write a resume)

&amp;#x200B;

If you are current engineering student, let me know what topics you wish you knew before coming to college and what topics you would like to know more about before entering the workforce. Since this is a side project for me, I can't promise that I can fulfill all your requests for episodes before you graduate, but it could help a student a couple years behind you.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Dear mods... I realize that this post may violate Rule #5, but I cleared the idea of announcing the podcast on this subreddit by mod /u/labtec901, with the stipulation that I do not post excessively."

Hello Redditor,  
 

I don’t really post, but I was told and have seen some really good advices that can come from a global view on things, as such, I wanted your input on how I should go about with my life.  
 

General background of who I am (26M) living in Toronto. I currently (in my opinion) face a lot of anxiety and depression of my everyday life. I have previously self-harm and tried to commit suicide, as such, the idea of these things is not new to me. I recently started to see a psychotherapist to try to help diffuse my mental issues because I have honestly been thinking a lot about suicide and self harm again. A lot of these mental heath issues, I would think pertains to family, money, and career

Starting off with my family, I grew up in a loving but tough household. My parents try to give me the best that they could, but at the same time, failed to be responsible as an adult. They have incurred a large debt (mortgage, credit card, etc). Our family has discussed and argued many times on the idea of money and saving; however, it seems to never really stick. My dad is currently in this phase in which he isn’t really speaking to anyone (family wise) and become shut off from the world (not the first time). Any approaches to understanding or even discussing the situation is often disputed as ‘nothing is wrong’, when clearly there is something wrong. My mom on the other hand just goes about her day, accepting the fact that my dad is like this with no discussion or engagement to my dad. Whereas, my sister lives with her boyfriend, but chooses to spend money on the credit card under my parent’s name.

For me, you can imagine how much of a toll this takes out of me and my ability to really function and look on the positive side of things. I recently graduated with a Master’s along with roughly $44,000 of student debt. Fortunately, I did a lot of internship with high pay that has allowed me to accumulate roughly $36,000 to pay off my student debt. So, you can imagine that my bank account right now is roughly in the low 000s to ensure I am able to pay the monthly minimum for OSAP. This is really all the money I have, no additional saving, no stocks, etc. However, I do believe I am a frugal individual who will not spend beyond his limits. I am currently trying to pay rent as well, roughly $800 per month to live at home given my understanding of the debt my parents face and my responsibility as a young adult to pay for a portion of my share in living.

At this moment, I am leaving a permanent private company job, for a contract public job (with potential of full-time in a year). In comparison to the pay, it will get relatively less at the public job. However, I choose the public job because it aligned with the work that I foresee myself being interested in doing, while also working in a significantly less stressful environment (manager wise). 

My hopes from this thread/post is to gain people’s opinion of my next steps in life. I do not want to be in a situation where I am sacrificing my future for my family, when at this time I feel like any contributing help to their spending or behaviour is just lost cause. In addition, am I in a good place at all in my current financial state, and hoping to live independently soon, or are there things that I should be considering to better build a more positive future for myself, even if it means separating from my family. I would love your opinions, and try my best to reply and clarify anything for anyone."

I’m also pretty overwhelmed now looking at all the things I need to prepare for.  

Right now I have a number of projects on github and I did GSoC this summer and that’s about it. I’m comfortable programming and I believe myself to be a really fast learner and good at applying things, but the knowledge component is pretty tough.  

Like if you give me a data structure that I don’t know the time and space complexities for I could figure it out based on how it works, but then of course I don’t know it off the top of my head. I’m really comfortable with using lists, trees, maps, hash tables, etc., but I don’t know the different kinds off the top of my head. I understand that a red black tree is self balancing and I can probably think about the strengths and weaknesses with other data structures, but it will take a little and I don’t usually know it off the top of my head.
I think I have good foundational knowledge which really lets me do pretty good work, but I refer to documentation and such a lot when I’m working.  

There’s also databases and system design which I have close to no idea about. I’ve wrote a couple lines of SQL, but I really don’t know much of the theory behind what actually happens behind the scene when those lines are executed. And system design I’m in the dark about no matter how much I seem to look it up.  

Anyone able to give some advice on how I can help myself to become better at these things?Thanks!  
  
Edit: also big data methodologies?"

I'd work five semester and graduate in five years instead of the normal 4. I was wondering if such a program would be worth it since I'd have to start interviewing for my first co-op term in about a month and a half so that I could start working next spring semester.

On one hand, I feel unprepared to work next spring. I had a research internship in my school this past summer, but I didn't really learn too much from that and I don't really have any coding experience outside of what I've had to do for school and over the past summer.

On the other hand, I'm a bit scared to search for internships for next summer for the same reasons and because I feel like it would be harder than searching for a co-op where my school would be able to help me more.

For context, I am currently starting my second year and at about a 3.8 cumulative GPA. Whether it be co-op or internship, I'd be looking for work in the New York City area."

cw8sa9,1,2019-08-27,I'm leaving an internship from an startup and my professor who referred me to it wants to drag me back.,MistorMiss,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cw8sa9/im_leaving_an_internship_from_an_startup_and_my/,"My professor in college referred me to a software startup to work as an intern. Since the get go I had my doubts, and this led me in two occasions to talk with the two members of this startup. Both times they somehow got me to repeal my decision and stay. However, yesterday I finally hit the tipping point and gave them a definite statement that I'm leaving.

Coincidentally, my classes started yesterday too and the professor for one of these classes is the one who referred me to the startup and it is important to note that he supports very passionately this startup. Up to this point he didn't know I had tried to leave in two iterated occasions in the past, but I felt the need to notify him that I was definitely leaving this time. In short his reply was that I am doing the wrong choice and that my future lies in that startup and that the startup life lies in my hands.

Those conversations, both with the startup guys and my professor, happened through text messages, and I know this is the worse way to deal with situations generally, but I have my reasons. I have personality problems that causes me to try and avoid displease in other people. When I am in person any negative reaction from the other people makes me throw sound judgement out of the window, so I decided to do it through text.

Tomorrow I have class with this professor again, and my fear is that if I state my case to blandly, I might have to resort to aggressiveness to push my point through because I am definitely not going back a third time to the startup. I don't want to have to end it in bad terms that because I don't want to take the chances of putting my grade for that class in jeopardy. Also, I am not saying that this professor might be the kind to retaliate with students, but I don't want to take chances. I would appreciate some advice to state my point in good terms and strongly.

Just for reference here is an overview of my reasons to leave the startup:

1. Usually internships help you build the skills that you would use in the workplace. I am basically on my own.
2. I was never given a clear clue of when this internship would end, and I would start getting paid.
3. At one point the two members of this start up discussed not-so-legal ways of promoting their app.
4. They are really nice people to talk to, but because of the previous point now I have really weird gut feelings towards them.
5. My economic situation is bad and I'm already juggling with my free time. Just allocating time to code or go to their office is a hassle.

**TL;DR** I'm not sure how to talk to my professor that I left a startup he referred me to as an intern. I fear that my grade in his class be put in jeopardy due to this.

cw9o12,1,2019-08-27,Afraid of quitting university.,Jwooj,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cw9o12/afraid_of_quitting_university/,"I (18M, going to hit 19 on October) am wondering what the fuck i'm doing with my life.  


I just started university (i'm from Brazil) at a public uni (that on my city it's the most difficulty uni we have) last year. I've got a internship program (dunno if it's the correct term) last year and i'm working at this place for about 1 year. I was in the second semester of Uni. A few days after I've got my job I just locked the course.This semester, I tried to return on my studies. But I just can't. I try everyday to go but everyday I make an excuse to myself to not go. I already accepted that I don't like my course that much (i'm coursing System Analysis and Development). No, it's not like I don't like my course, I like programming and IQ things, I like coding. But, on the first semester I missed a few social encounters for the freshman year on the first month, so everyone knows everyone but I don't know no one. I've missed the first month of study too (I was assaulted and my mom, since I was 17 and legally underage, didn't let me to go to Uni cuz she was afraid the two that tried to rob me would try to find me again cuz I had beat them), so it was hard cuz I didn't knew what was going on and didn't knew no one to ask; later i've managed to acquire some friends on my class and somehow I passed to the second period. Then, I locked it.

After I locked it, I started doing drugs and going on hang outs with my ""friends"". Got addicted to cocaine. Few months later, I've managed to get out of it and started going to gym. Man, I never felt so good as when I was doing regularly gym. I've felt so nice like I never had. I didn't felt sad like I've always been, I felt confident, I felt me, I could finally be myself. But it's not like I wanted to make money from gym or go on competitions. I just felt so good doing it, didn't matter if the results would impact my career or my studies. I was, for the first time in my life, able to say that I was truly happy.Then, I lost myself again on weed, turned on a lazy person, and stopped going to gym one month before returning to the studies. When I saw, all my life was focusing on weed, getting the better pot, going on hang outs with the same old friends that I've promised myself I wouldn't go, just cuz ""now i can control myself"". Sure, i've never got close to cocaine again (and i'm sure i'll never do), but, focusing my life around weed and hang outs made me feel very empty, like I have nothing to show, i'm just a empty shell that goes on social hangouts, smoke weed, hear some music and then go back to home to go work on the other day.

At the begin of this month, I've unlocked my course (I said to myself I need to finish it if I want to make money, cuz here on Brazil, if you only done highschool, the jobs you can get are very poorly, so i'm just trying to not get a terrible job). So, i've promised that now I would finish this shit, but as the first weeks gone, I started missing class to hangout with friends, to smoke weed, to play some dumb shit I don't even want to on my computer.

I want to lock the course again and start gym again. But if I do, i don't know if I can complete it before they kick me out for being ""afk"" when I return. I don't know even if I'll return. And I'm afraid that i'll lock it up and one month after gym i'll start droping to smoke weed again and start spending all my money on hangouts and pot again. For sure I can control myself better now than one month before (this entire month was a fucking introspective fight to reassure my relationship with marijuana, i can't tell you guys that i'm not a addicted anymore, i'm afraid of my old habits, but i have a better control at myself now).

I can't even control my money. I've been spending near to my entire salary on hangouts or weed-related things. I'm trying to upgrade my PC specs and buy a TV for my bedroom for eight months and I didn't saved not even $30. And I'm always promising myself that I'm going to give a break from hangouts, that I'm going to deny some parties, but when they call me I always feel like I need to go (after some research, I think that i'm suffering from FOMO). On this part of my life, I can affirm I don't know how to control myself. I've tried so many times, but then friday comes and here I am at another party.

I just dunno what to do. I need another perspective. Another way to see things. I think i'm so close into these things that i'm missing others POVs. I need advice and help, I know it's hard to tell something just by what I told you guys, and that I should go to therapy (It's not like I can't afford it but I don't have much money and this would suck at least 70% of my free money, I dunno if the investment would be worth it), but I really don't know what to do anymore, and after some things that occurred last year I can't openly talk about this to any of my friends."

I had it down(ish) in undergrad, but this is different, I can’t just walk things in sometimes and expect good grades. 

On top of all the work and our internships we need to network! I want to do extracurriculars and shit, school council and meetups and mentoring, but I did not have time for any of that in undergrad because the aforementioned toddler-level of care my freakin brain needs to not scream 24/7! 

If I do not do the networking and stuff, I will be far less likely to get a job, and therefore faaar less likely to ever pay off my gargantuan student loan debt! “It’s the most important part of your education” 

!!!!!  ?!?!!?!??!!!   

I don’t know what to do, what if I can’t do this and I’m spending all this money only to fail out? I’ve flown too close to the sun before and tried to do things that were not compatible with adhd and my other mental health problems. Did not pan out! 

Please!!! Please, if you went through this, if you know someone who did, please please please give me some advice or reassurance. Especially if it didn’t work out and you needed to quit your program. I know it won’t be the end of the world but I worked really hard to get here. 

TLDR: I’m scared this is too much for me to handle. Please words."
cw9su3,3,2019-08-27,I’m about to lose my internship...help,lskye01,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cw9su3/im_about_to_lose_my_internshiphelp/,"Last January, I met with an organization that’s heavily involved with legal affairs. They said they would love to have me as an intern if I started a chapter of their organization at my school when senior year began. 

Well, senior year started. My school sent out an email saying they’re ready to take club applications, but we need an advisor first. I went to the mock trial coach because I thought he would have the most interest in it but he said no. He said it would distract his members from getting to states again this year (I had asked if I could speak to them about the organization’s mission to see if any of them were interested in joining).  That kind of blew a hole in my plan, but I tried some other teachers and every single one of them had either hit the max for clubs they can advise or said no. 

So now I can’t start a club because I don’t have an advisor. What should I do? I really want to keep this internship but the whole point was for me to start a club at my school. Should I just tell them I was unable to find an advisor and see what they say?"

I really just need to rant and throw up my feelings... and seek for some real advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Background Information?:

22F and hopefully about to finish my undergraduate. Degree: Psychology B.A (yes, tons of regrets).  Typical Asian-American born with tons of low self-esteem issues. Hatred for myself, etc. Also an only child.

My parents are quite old... my dad is 71, but on his documents/passport he's ""65"". Mother is 60. Mom works in retail and dad is a machine mechanic (basically a manual labor job of sorts with a fancier title). My mother is a buddhist, so I'm constantly hearing things like ""your dad treats me this way because it's my karma from past lives"", ""it's possible for him to change, he just needs to listen to some buddhist teachings"", ""you should never think those things about your dad. he works hard"". Is it really wrong for me to be upset that my dad uses the excuse ""I work hard. You wouldn't have a house or car to drive if it wasn't for me"". I thought parents are obligated to love their children and provide for them, much like how that will also be my obligation when I have kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Not really sure where to start, so I'm sorry if this post is anything but cohesive. I've always had family problems growing up. Parents who don't get along, a loud manipulative, control-freak, uneducated father who yells at his wife and daughter every chance he gets. A mother who stays silent and puts up with him, occasionally yelling back if she can't put up with it any longer. She's always telling me to put up with it, because at the end of the day ""I wouldn't be here/exist without him"" and that everything we have - home, cars, etc. are because of him. I really think their relationship was doomed from the start.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom was educated with high moral standing. Someone who easily puts others first instead of herself. She was a biology professor back in her home country. My dad barely finished high school and was forced to be in the war. She was mid 30s, still unmarried and desperate to go to America to make money and send back home to her mother. Her brother had gone to America years ago and she was hoping he'd manage to start papers to bring her over. Unfortunately, with no luck. They met through family friends or something and about two weeks in, they married. My dad was an American citizen at that point and about a year later managed to bring her over to America. I was born about a year after her arrival to America.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom was enrolled into community college, hoping she could score some decent office job after finishing. She was educated and did very well in school back home, so she was hoping the transition wouldn't be that difficult. Unfortunately, I was born and my dad said that she needs to start working because he can't afford for everything on his paycheck. She dropped out of school and washed dishes for nearly a year. Not sure what happened after, but she was forced to enroll into nail school (?). My dad heard stories that woman make tons and tons of money if they were a nail tech. She didn't enjoy it at all - too many chemical hazards and she wasn't that great at it. Eventually, she settled for some random job with excruciating hours. Not sure if this is a good spot to put it in, but my dad wasn't happy that I was born a female, so he forced her for a son. No luck and it left many miscarriages and scars for her. We eventually moved to a different state to be closer to her relatives.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I was born, my dad was already abusive to my mom. I don't think he has hit her, but has made gestures as if he was going to. Has called her awful names and said that if she more willing to take risks, more social, etc. she could be making tons of money making his life a lot better. My childhood was really on and off. At moments, I felt like I had great parents. We'd go out and eat time to time, we'd go on a vacation every few years, and I had some toys here and there. At the same time, I remember my parents yelling at each other, my dad being upset at me because I did something that wasn't okay to him. I've always been studious, introverted, and tried my best to obey. Fast forward almost a decade, I became extremely depressed from the age of 15 - 17. Started to starve myself, harm myself, and had tons of suicidal thoughts. I was lethargic. Slept at strange hours during summer break and just hated myself so much. I think a lot of this began when my parents would tell me I was chubby and kept comparing me to my male cousin who was ""much smarter"", ""much more talented"", ""healthy and fit"", ""more attractive"". I remember telling a ""friend"" in high school that I've been having these scary thoughts and just wanted to disappear. I think she panicked and informed the counselor. I was immediately called into their office and had these ""therapy sessions"" or whatever. Since I was a minor, they called my mom and work and all hell really broke out. She was having a hard time at work and hearing the school call her really made it worse. A few weeks after, she got so upset and started to hit me.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually senior year came around and I made the decision to go to school about four hours away from home. It was in the middle of nowhere, but I was excited. This meant I wouldn't have to see my parents daily, I wouldn't have to hear my dad tell me why he rather raise a pig than me, that I wasn't good enough. That I was too ugly and ""difficult personality wise"" or that I'm so disrespectful because I sometimes voice my opinion for something he does or says that I'm not okay with. This was my big break. It was really nice to be away form home, but the downside was - I was in the middle of nowhere. Had no car and I was really second-guessing my major, and my health was getting worse and worse. Eventually became diagnosed with PCOS which takes a toll on your hormones, weight, and makes you extremely fatigue at times. It was difficult to manage my health and grab prescriptions when my PCP was back at home. After two years of being away from home, I made the decision to move back. I knew what I was getting myself into. I was returning to an abusive household to ensure my physical health would be better. It's still a decision to this day that I'm doubting.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that if I've been putting up with an extremely verbally abusive dad for over a decade, I should be used to it. But, I'm really not. Each and every time he calls me useless, disrespectful, ""piggy"", ugly, ""should've been born a son"", etc. it hurts. I've come to honestly believe everything he has said about me. I can't even look myself in the miror without cringeing at how ugly I am. I don't even take selfies and I hate being in public unless I need to. Out of fear that everyone else believes the same thing that he does. I really don't have many friends, if any. I like to keep to myself, but I've actually been in a LDR with someone for over three years now. We've done multiple visits, even my close friends and cousins know about him and have interacted with him. He's a really great person. We actually just did a week long visit where I flew out to him last week. Of course, I lie to my parents during these visits and say it's for a ""school trip"". The guilt really gets to me though. I wonder to myself it's okay for me to have someone care about me and if I'm worth their time. Sadly, this relationship is still a secret. Since according to my parents ""you're not supposed to be dating until youre making 6-figures and are at least 25"". Not only that, this person isn't Asian. They're American which is supposedly a sin to Asian parents. But, this person means so much to me. I know they full-heartedly love me and support my endeavors; I plan to pursue a pharmD (not for my parents, but for myself. They're someone I want to spend my future with. They show me it's possible for me to love myself and that I'm not as bad as I think.

&amp;#x200B;

God. I'm so sorry if everything has been whiny. I know there are people who aren't fortunate enough to even go to school nor have shelter. I know I should just be happy, but it's so hard... but back to the question I wanted to ask... what should I do? I saw on the subreddit that a lot of people made the decision to move out and struggle financially. I'm not sure how realistic it will be given my degree. I know most people with this degree make 16$ an hour. Can I survive on that? I don't have much saved either from summer jobs that I've been doing. My bf won't be able to move until his internship is over which won't be until early next year (2020). My bf is set on moving to where I am, because his home environment isn't that great either, but due to his more individualistic mindset it's easy for him to just leave his family. I feel like I will be tormented by guilt, ""ungrateful for what my parents have done"" and that I will get bad karma.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still very financially dependent on my parents, so moving out now is not an option at all. Plus, my dad has a lot of health problems so he's only working until I finish school. He's hoping that he can return then and have me start paying the bills...

&amp;#x200B;

My background is in chemical engineering and I had no real project management experience before this was dropped into my lap (with no raise). This is a multi-disciplinary project that will cost &gt;$5MM when everything is finished. I don't like what I do, and before I was asked to fill in as a project manager I was developing an exit plan that coincided with my wife finishing grad school in May, 2020, 8 months away. At which point I will try to make a career change, we will likely move from our current town, and I will leave my company, this project, and chemical engineering behind me. 

This past month I started an online Master's program in Computer Science. This has been a pretty long process that started over a year ago. 

If I was single I would have quit a long time ago, and tried to get a job in the software world. This would likely be a paycut as an entry level position, but once I have some experience the upside is greater than if I stayed in the chemical industry. Unfortunately, I am not single, and taking a pay cut would likely mean putting savings (both cash savings as well as retirement) on hold. This is not something I wanted to do just yet, it would be much easier once my wife graduated and was bringing in income which is part of our plan. We have a lot of cash saved, fortunately. Enough to cover almost two year's worth of our expenses with no income. But this was for an eventual down payment on a house, eating into it would not be easy. 

However, each week I feel less and less enthusiastic about my job and the project I'm on. I'm stressed about the budget that my predecessor left me with. I'm stressed that we won't meet the aggressive schedule she committed to and this will have effect on other production units in the business. I am stressed that I am slowly ruining my reputation with my coworkers as a consequence of being unqualified to manage a project of this magnitude in the first place. After a few particularly bad days I have come home and submitted a few applications to some other jobs, less than 10, but I have only gotten a few responses. Nothing promising. 

I guess writing this out is therapy on its own, but I am looking for some advice. Should I stick it out for 8 more months, do what I can to stay sane, and keep saving? Should I more seriously look for entry-level or internship jobs in a different field and eat the pay-cut? A lot of days I think I would be happier with an internship or entry level job, despite the lower pay, because I would feel like I am one step further on the path to the future I am planning for myself. 

Any input would be appreciated."
cwbp1r,1,2019-08-27,3rd follow up with employer,InfinityR319,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cwbp1r/3rd_follow_up_with_employer/,"Three weeks ago on Friday I have interviewed with an agency for the position of visual designer in Portland OR over on Skype. During the interview we have a great conversation, and the HM even hinted about an opportunity for internship. In the conversation he mentioned that there were 4 other candidates currently lined up, and one of whom has already entered the final stage of interview. Towards the end of conversation he told me to touch base with him mid-week on the week after, and I obliged. 

I sent a thank you note on Monday, as I was too anxious to do so over the weekend. Then the week rolls by and I send my first follow up email on Wednesday. He told me that they will need a couple of weeks to go through the current lot of candidates before making a final decision, so I wait for another week and send out a 2nd follow up email last Monday, but this time he didn't respond. 

I should also go without saying that the HM has mentioned that the previous designer has to leave the role due to his visa is about to expire, and has decided to go back to school to extend his stay since they cannot afford to sponsor him. 
It's late August now, and school is about to start next week, so logically decisions should be made by this upcoming week. 

As I've stated multiple times in my posts in this sub, I'm on my post completion OPT, and that means if I can't find employment I will be ""deported"", which is the last thing I wanted given the current political unrest back in Hong Kong. This position seems like a great fit for me, and the interviewer seems to be impressed by me as well; so my question is: should I follow up? If so, should I send him a email or give him a phone call? Right now I'm at the crossroad that I have to make a swift decision to either stay in Portland, or relocate to elsewhere in the US. Stakes are high on this one, and I don't wanna blow it."

Why I won't to drop out: the tuition alone is $60k over 3 semesters. Rent in NY will be another roughly $20k in Harlem (to live in a 8x10 room). Paying off $85k seems really scary.

From a career perspective, or if I just want to optimize my expected earnings while staying close to jobs related to machine learning and big data (sorry to use buzzwords), is this a bad move to make?

I'd be willing to take on the loan if I knew that the opportunity cost is worth it, but I'm too naive and inexperienced about the industry to know whether this masters degree will pay enough dividends to be worth $60k tuition + living costs of NYC."

cwdrwl,3,2019-08-27,Roommate Took Master Bedroom Without a Heads Up,woodwardgates,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cwdrwl/roommate_took_master_bedroom_without_a_heads_up/,"I've been living in an apartment with a roommate for about three and a half weeks. Second month of rent is due this weekend.

My roommate and I both moved into this apartment to relocate for work at the same company. We had been friends during our internship at the company last year, not close but amicable. 

We decide to split a place for the first year, 2 bd 2 bath in the city. My mom and I found the place, and since it would be my first apartment my mom signed on as the only guarantor. From the floor plan, it looks as though the bedrooms are similar and both bathrooms are public. Neither of us know the specific building we'll be working at but either way this place will be close. 

My roommate-to-be visits the city a couple weeks before move-in. We use the opportunity to have him deposit first month's rent, so he tours the apartment and deposits the first month (split 50-50 between us). 

Fast forward to move-in. We get in on the same day, he arrives a bit earlier that day and moves in to one of the bedrooms. As soon as I arrive I see that there is a significant discrepancy between the two. My room is probably two-thirds, maybe three-fourths the size of his, and my bathroom is public (guests will be using mine). He has a walk-in closet and private bathroom. 

I don't say anything since I didn't want to engage in an argument the very first day, but neither did he. He didn't let me know when he visited that there was a difference in the bedrooms, and he hasn't said anything since.

There are some things that lean my way, though. My walk to work is 5 minutes. His walk is around 15. I can come back during lunch and eat at my apartment, whereas he stays at work. Additionally, he brought his car so he has to pay ~200$ a month for his parking. Finally, he brought a small couch, TV, and pots and pans that we're both using right now. I should add to this last point, though, that I'll be buying a much nicer TV for the living room, and we'll be splitting the bill for a bigger couch, a dining room set and barstools. I may also be buying my own pots and pans since he scratched the teflon on the new set he brought.

I plan to talk to him on the day of our first paycheck (which is before the second month of rent is due) to discuss terms. I'm not intimidated by him in any way but I'm worried about giving myself a bad roommate situation for the next 11 months. Should we change the rental split? Should we split the time spent in the master bedroom (he gets 8 months I get 4 -- I let him have extra time since I do live closer to work)? Am I overreacting?

All help is appreciated!"

Before started my undergrad in CS, my only programming experience was doing most free online courses (like codecademy) and reading books on how to code. Had an okay IT internship, didn't really get much mentoring because their IT was contracted but learned about how servers and office computers/software/networks are set up.

Did well in programming subjects in uni, but ended up with a really average gpa (65%) because I tried to major in electrical engineering but I didn't like the engineering courses. Also a bit of ADHD/depression due to some events during uni.

Got one internship in the final year, which turned into my full time job for a year since, which paid just okay according to Australian wages livable but no savings. It was mostly Javascript with a bit of SQL (lots of reading through code in other languages though).

I've lost that job so now I'm considering doing better this time around, and hopefully working at a real company with chances for promotion rather than a startup like before where you couldn't really expect more than yearly inflation based raises."

This was quite a big deal and I had to jump through several hoops to get this of the ground. The idea itself and the smarts it took to get this company going are great. It was a great experience and I learnt a lot about the real world. This will prolly be my essay story.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

My new highschool (I switched in 10th grade) did not offer any extra curricular activities. No clubs or tools or really anything. So, I started my high school's very first club in its 20 year history - the robotics club. The club will be sending 5 teams to the WRO National Level just this year! I am mentoring all five teams. It’s going really good. 

While i always wanted to start this club in my school so that i could continue participating in extra-curricular activities, the reason that triggered the founding of the club is kinda crazy. There was an overlap in the Midterms college exam dates and the WRO nationals. I couldn’t do anything about it alone and I probably had to chose between the two. But, to be able to participate in both I got almost 30% of PACE kids to participate in the WRO under the guise of a club and once so many ppl were participating, PACE was forced to postpone the midterms😂😎 Even crazier is that this club was kind of a success and it has let of a chain of over 5-6 clubs being founded at PACE in the last week or so. The club has snow balled into a hub for innovation and creativity and all of these PACE kids are applying their JEE knowledge for the very first time.

2 teams are participating in the WRO Open and both are looking really good. I had a few extra ideas so I shared it with them and they have added on a lot of their own ideas. They have built something really cool. Both are looking to get patents. 

It took a lot to convince the PACE heads to found this club and to convince so many kids to take time off of Indian Entrace Exam, but somehow they did. From knocking on door to door to get people to join, we have come to a point that way may have to hold interPACE competitions so select fewer people. It has become a fierce competitor to all the robotics workshop biggies in India. We might send more teams to world than OMO(Biggest Indian robotics workshop) this year. It is absolutely insane!!

 The robotics club has some really cool systems in place for management and to remain sustainable - for it to last once we leave PACE next year. I was appointed president of the club and “honorary” Vice President for the other clubs that were founded as a result of this.  What is weird tho is that I am having to use my 10th grade Civics knowledge in weird places to keep this club running. Applying all the union territory and lower-upper house system knowledge in running the club. Never thought that history and civics knowledge would come in handy...

Outreach in High School: Taught 2  students that failed science. Got them to not only pass, but top the class!

Built a Virtual Reality game that helps ppl do physiotherapy at home at a low cost and went out and got ppl to use it for extended periods of time. Great success! Learnt coding VR apps through this process.

Built a Robotics arcade game that helps teach english to students diagnosed with dyslexic and went out and got ppl to use it for extended periods of times. PATENT pending on this.

Built a computer programming talent search website to find and help talent across india. When I went out to teach the underprivileged programming, At first I thought they were really bad at coding. After week of teaching they would use the for loop for a decision making statement(instead of if). After a period of analysing their mistakes, I realised that they were having a really hard time with syntax than they were with logic! They were having a tough time with big huge English words, as that wasn’t their native Lang. That was great. I decided to come up with a Java layer, with special syntax which allowed these students to write code in Hindi and then my program would convert that to java and run the code. If  ==  ugger, etc. BOOM! Several could code now! I also created an image processing app to allow children to draw a flow chart on paper and then convert it to code by clicking a picture of it. This allowed 10 kids to share one PC! Another problem faced was that these kids didnt have computers or had never used one. So when teaching 30-40 students it was impossible to give each and every child a computer. Even if we were to find so many PCs, they were impossible to teach how to use and very difficult to transport. The image processing app solved this and a couple other problems. 

Car honking is a massive problem in India. You cannot work or study in peace because of constant noises coming from the street. Birds have started chirping weirdly as a consequence of honking. Its bad. You cant just ban car honks, cuz in some situations they are actually kinda important. There is no way you can educate billions of people to not honk or really, do anything against them. This was getting annoying and I couldn't study well because of this. So, I decided to come up with a totally lateral solution to this problem. I built the first ultrasonic car honk! The idea seems kinda obvious once you say it, but its nothing like anything ever done before. How it works: The driver would honk, it would send an ultrasonic wave to the car ahead and would trigger the speakers of the car up front to make a honk sound. This would allow the honker to alert the driver without disturbing the surrounding. Its a really simple, yet novel solution and that, IMO, is what makes it great. PATENT pending on this and in talks with Tata(India's biggest car manufacturer, owners of Jaguar, Land Rover/Range Rover) to install these in cars. The unique honk now gave the car ultrasonic transmitters and receivers, which allowed us to add a host of security features in the car.  

Already mentioned two of the patents I have, but I am currently working on a third one right now. This one is also ground breaking, but it is a little complex to explain in text. This third one, isn't exactly outreach per se as it doesnt really solve any burning problems like dyslexia or cervical spondylosis, but it is a great idea. 

Total - 3 patents pending.

Essays - So my main goal, like everybody else's, is to show who I am via the essays. 

My characteristics I wanna bring across in the essay- 

1) I NEVER give up. I just don't. Sometimes it is a bad thing, but it has helped me throughout my life - in winning international level competitions, starting companies and making a difference to my locality. I like to fight any injustice or bias. Unlike most tho, I dont like coming up with random problems and rallying against them. I like to spot problems and then using my knowledge and creativity  to come up with a solution for the problems and then fight for the employment of the solution.


2)Creative and curious. I am good at solving problems and building devices in a unique manner. I am also extremely curious, something that helped me win so many quiz competitions. My curiousity drove me to learn way beyond what was expected. 

3) Business - Throughout my life I have been starting little businesses and companies. When ever I spotted a demand with low supply or something I would swoop in and figure out ten ways I could make money out of that. While I never quite cared much for money, I am pretty good at making it. I have made a few thousand dollars over the years. This might be normal in the USA, but in India, kids making money, is looked down upon as it somehow means that the parents are too poor that they have to employ their child to make money. India is kinda weird, but I didnt let tha stop me from doing anything less. 

I had a severe lack of opportunities, like any other international, but throughout my school I never let that stop me or become an excuse for achieving less. That what makes me me. I took a sliver of an opportunity and turned it into a lot more for myself and my peers. 

4) I am a leader. I am that guy that automatically assumes leadership for everything, no matter what. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I sound like a saint right now, dont I 😂? I really am not. I have these 4 good traits, but a bazillion bad traits which come along with it. But obviously, I am going to focus only on the good. So far, I have felt awful about myself every time I have read a Chance Me. Reading about all these perfect people kinda annoyed me, but now that I am doing a chance me  myself, I get it. I too look perfect in this, even though I really am not. I feel a lot better, and I hope you do too.


Also, I wrote this chance me while listening to Time-Inception. So, if this entire post sounds over dramatic, don’t blame me. Blame Zimmer"
cwg0f0,2,2019-08-28,Is it useful to have a computer science minor as an engineer?,NinetalesNomad,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/cwg0f0/is_it_useful_to_have_a_computer_science_minor_as/,"For context, it's 12-15 credits a semester without the minor and 15-19 a semester with a minor. I can (and have) handled 19 credits, but at the expense of free time and mental health. I have pretty severe anxiety and I'm wondering if it might be better to focus on my mental state, rather than coursework. 

I am currently a junior in aerospace engineering and have plans to complete a minor in computer science. After getting to college I realized that I really love programming and have a knack for it. I know that I want to work with code in my career, but I'm not sure the stress of extra classes is worth it. I have jobs and internships on my resume that show my coding ability and I have some coursework (maybe 2 classes) on my transcript already. Is it worth the extra stress to complete a minor?"

This summer I work as an intern at GOOGLE.

But my project is very boring. My job is not very hard that makes me feel like if someone knows c++ and some algorithms, they could replace me. I felt like my job is easy so that anyone with c++ coding experience could do it.

After talking to a few classmates about their internship, they learned lots of technology, such as Splunk, Kotlin, pandas/scikit-learn, and etc.

Some terms I don't even know.

Have you had the same experience that you might feel frustrated when you see someone name a lot of technologies that you don't hear before?"
cwh1el,3,2019-08-28,Stuck in a rut,cappyhat,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/cwh1el/stuck_in_a_rut/,"After graduating and doing everything that was asked of me years ago, I felt like I’d finally accomplished something worthy of acknowledgement...but one can only hope right...?

Unfortunately my parents still act like it’s about time that I’ve finished, and I’m doing them a favor by getting somewhere in life. 

Things have been going well in my life, I’m finally in a healthy relationship with someone really special. I just got an internship to work at a nonprofit, and that’s what I’ll be doing in the next few months.

However, because of my parents... I feel like I could be doing better. My current situation with them is, I’ve been living under their roof over 20 years. I wanted to leave and go away for college, but I wanted to be wise and help them save money. So I went to a community college and transferred to a four year university later on. Now that I’ve finally done what they’ve asked, they constantly beg me to move out. They say I am a burden and have been for a while now. 

There’s a cultural conflict between my parents and I. They want me to be more like them and always home, caring about the family. They view anything I do for myself like going out or being “out” in general is selfish. I feel like this is common in the Asian community. Since I’ve failed to abide by their strict rules like being home at a certain time, fixing them lunch whenever I’m home, or catering to their every need, I’m deemed worthless and useless. There are many other rules I am apparently “breaking” by living my current lifestyle. I am 23. I believe that I’m pretty fair with how I spend my time. I mostly work and when I’m not, I try to allocate my time to either my partner or my family. 

I constantly feel like I am the problem. Like nothing I do or have ever done will ever be enough. Not even staying out of trouble, making money to save and so they don’t have to worry about me, and even the little things I do. 

So recently, they keep saying that I am a bad role model for my brother. They say I should leave and I do nothing but cause them trouble. I have tried my best to help them and whatever I can in the time that I can. But they don’t appreciate any of it. On top of that, they have strict rules and curfews that restrict me from living my life. I’m tired of it too but I feel like I’m not financially ready to be on my own. I can however work on paying off my debts and try to buy a car and move out. Currently, my parents allow me to use a car they bought a few years ago, which I thought was for me after graduating high school. But they told me it was for my younger brother, and I am just borrowing it for now. Even though I care for it, take it to all the necessary appointments and all that. He’s only 14 right now. 

Basically they just want me to get out of their hair and get my own car, my own place and leave them alone. I’m a little confused on why they hate me so much. Is it because I’m a girl? Just curious what your thoughts are in the reddit community... please share if you have any similar issues."

I'm deeply sorry to bother you with my problems in this sunny  day... But I'm desesperatly seeking some advice.

One  year ago, I've had a very troublesome relationship that put me in a  light depression. To get out of that first hole, I was seeking new  experiences and I wanted to train muay-thai (my favorite sport) in  Thailand, where my older brother (30M) lives. Things didn't go as  planned.

Basically,  my brother pushed me to sleep with prostitutes, even though I said I  didn't want to before coming there. The whole trip was around that,  basically. I had to stay multiple time at the appartement to not go to  ""dirty places"". The girlfriend of my brother asked him multiple time if I  was gay because I didn't want to reiterate the experience. Even my  brother tried multiple times to make me ""fall"" again. According to  him,sleeping with prostitutes was a ""quick way to personnal  developpement"".

I've  tried multiple things to get ""out of my hole"". Hypnotherapy,  meditation, sport, therapy (seen more than 5+ therapist),  antidepressant. Nothing really works. I still feel dirty, weak,  humiliated,  hypocritical to my values. I don't know what to really do  anymore..

Now,  it's pretty funny, because everything apart from that is going fine in  my life. I have multiples friends. I meet success in my field of  engineering, and I'm gonna be published in a scientific journal for my  studies during an internship and work in space robotics that year (on  the ""next curiosity"" robot). Surprisingly, even though if I'm socially  ankward, I've meet multiples wonderfull girls. I didn't had a proper  relationship with them because I fear intimacy right now ( and I don't  think going into a relationship in my current state of mind would be a  great thing), I quite enjoyed my time with them.

I  just feel... dishonored. Even more, I feel just...  pathetic to have a depression for that. I mean, a lot of peoples have it  worse than me on a lot of level and are still level-headed. But, I  can't help myself... I still feel like if my past  was stained in black, which again is ridiculous logically speaking.

To relieve the stress, anxiety towards the new culture, Work Permit, S Pass and traditions, we came with a real-time work experience of the employers at Singapore. 

  Without dropping a second, let’s jump into a blog to fade your nightmare.

Every work culture will differ from all other places. Before you start venturing any new place, you should get explicit information about it. People are different simultaneously their culture too. After a deep research, people are dumbstruck by the Singaporean Workstyle. Singaporeans are much focused on Teamwork and Collectivism. Many companies look for and value for Individual’s development alone but, distinctively they heed to Teamwork and its progression.

Singaporean professionals often strive and thrive in their work together, share both responsibilities &amp; recognitions and achieve rewards together. The work timings are too strict in flexibility and punctuality. Moreover, to meet the deadlines, they add on more works on an Intern. But Collectivist theory plays a dramatic role in this scenario. Not only pile but partially all the co-workers share workloads on the Intern. 

Easily Foreigners can adapt to the Work culture &amp; transform as an Adept."

The thing keeping me with GE is that they have me in the pipeline for their 2 year leadership program, which makes you EXTREMELY hirable coming out of it. If you go through the program, though, it’s kind of burning a bridge not to stick with GE for a while after. What I’m after is advice on whether I should stick in this program/pipeline or try to land an internship in a tech hub/with a faang/etc. Also any other general advice would be amazing.

cwlyo8,0,2019-08-28,Question about Value of Particular Double Majors,wariotime9994,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cwlyo8/question_about_value_of_particular_double_majors/,"Hi! At my university I need to double major to graduate. I've read a lot that to be the best programmer possible, I should double major in CS + Math or CS + Stats and that CS + Stats was best for ML and AI. Both of these fields interest, but I've also read that it's damn-near impossible to get a job in these fields if you don't have a Masters or PhD (and I do not want to do either of these).

Anyways, personally, I have a lot of general difficulty with CS. The field interests me as a whole, but I have severe brain fog (I am doing my best to fix this) + some other conditions that make getting a good GPA in CS difficult (which I consider to be \~3.0) and I have to put insane amounts of time into these courses. I find Statistics interesting and the overlap between the majors means I only need to take 9 total extra Statistics courses, but all of these seem quite difficult and time-consuming. I was planning to double major in Psychology because I would say I'm just as interested in it (vs. Stats)  and because I find it much, much easier and not nearly as time-consuming as CS (I have a 4.0 in all Psych courses). I don't think majoring in Psychology will help my odds of getting employed, I am mostly only doing it because it's easy to be honest.

I read that the time I'd spend getting a difficult double major would be better spent working on personal projects and that I should prioritize my mental health. I was wondering how detrimental it would be to my odds at getting a CS-related job (and the salary I'll get, more importantly) if I chose to double major in Psychology (+ extra time on personal projects) vs. in Statistics. I think I could handle Statistics (would tank GPA a bit), but I may have to spend a full extra semester in university in order to get it (that's how much difficulty I have with these types of courses) and would mean less time for side projects.

If the extra information is useful, I will have one 12 month internship by time I graduate only, I have no side projects yet but will start one later this week. I also care a lot about the money because my family has a lot of debt and because I like money. The university I go to is probably roughly valued right under that of a USA ivy-league I think, in global recognition for CS/ other programs.

Thank you for your help, can answer any questions you have."
cwm5yl,3,2019-08-28,Mistreated by University or Normal Experience? Field Placement Internship,djnotpocket,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/cwm5yl/mistreated_by_university_or_normal_experience/,"Hey everyone,

I have been doing an online Masters of social work program for the past few years part time while working full time. I chose the school because it seemed flexible in my ability to spread classes throughout a few years, it seems like they have good name recognition, all reviews online seemed positive, and the cost seemed OK (about $600-650 per credit, totaling about $35K for all of the Masters program).

So until this summer, the experience was overall positive. It turns out online grad school is really difficult and you need to be extremely self-motivated. I was pulling it off though, and I have about a 3.8 GPA. It wasn't until I needed to start my field education that things really seemed to take a turn. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for an MSW program, you need to complete two internships, each one being 480 hours total. So I arranged it for my first internship to be a block internship, meaning full time. I arranged to intern at a children's hospital psychiatric facility about four months in advanced. I scheduled my last day of work to be on a friday and I'd start the internship on a monday. A few days before the internship began, I get an email from the school saying that they haven't completed the contract with the hospital yet, and that I wouldn't be able to start on time. I had my timing down perfectly to start a new Job and internship very shortly after this internship, so that meant a lot of trouble for me.

so since I had to start ASAP, I was frantically calling everyone in the school I could get a hold of that could help to push this contract through, but I basically kept getting voicemails, and super curt emails saying to stop trying to contact them and that I just have to wait. A week later, they told me I had to just find a new internship on my own. They hardly seemed willing to help me find a new one, and said that they just have too many students to deal with to help in any way basically. So after two weeks of contacting any local mental health facility in the city like a mad man, I finally located an internship at a nonprofit that wouldn't really be the area I wanted to go in, but I had to do something! I am super thankful for the nonprofit that took me on and basically saved me. But then the school was unwilling to let me work overtime to complete my hours in time, unsympathetic to the fact that I was on a tight timeline. All this while for some reason paying the university thousands of dollars for the opportunity to intern (why am I paying the school?)

All the while, I was moving cities at the end of the summer, and trying to locate a second internship in my new city- also they were unable to help me (it seems this is the disadvantage of online programs- you need to find your own internships). I found an amazing opportunity at a college counseling center- exactly what I want to be doing- but they don't have an MSW on staff, only a freaking Harvard trained Clinical Psychologist to be my advisor. the school said my advisor MUST be an MSW- so according to their field placement handbook, you can have weekly telephone meetings with an MSW as your field advisor that is offsite. So I found a willing MSW/LCSW who would take the time to advise me. He filled out all the paperwork, made a connection to my field placement, took an online course to be my advisor, and I made sure everything was set up months in advanced.

&amp;#x200B;

I start this internship next week. LITERALLY two days ago, my school emails me and tells me they noticed that, though they already approved this person as my off-site advisor,  now they realize he is out of state and I need to either find a new MSW advisor or find a new internship on my own. A WEEK BEFORE I'M SUPPOSED TO START. They were compeltely unapologetic and unsympathetic towards my situation, and basically just told me to deal with it- even though this is completely their fault and I tried to do this all months in advanced. I tried finding numerous solutions with them, but the only solution for them was for me to just find a new MSW to be my advisor and figure it the fuck out.

So in short, my Masters program's field placement team has caused me an extreme amount of anxiety (ironic in that they all are social workers and should probably know better) and they basically told me they have too big a student population to deal with and I can more or less fuck off. And then for some reason I'm paying the university $6000 for this semester for the privellage of doing this all on my own. 

This is so frustrating and I wish I knew what to do- I don't know if there is some external board I should reach out to or a higher up at the school- I just don't want to jeaprodize everything further. Is this just the kind of thing I need to accept and deal with, or is this really an abusive situation and my school is just not keeping their end of the deal?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Masters program keeps seeming to undermine my ability to smoothly do internships, unwilling to be of much help and are seemingly indifferent to the anxiety that they are causing me. Accept that this is life or is there anything I can do about it?"

Hi interneters! First time poster and I need some advice

I have worked for Company X for 4 years (2 years as an intern, 2 as a full time analyst). In January, we were acquired by Company Y, a similar sized company in another city. Most of the executive team has left and frankly its been a bit of a shit show here at Company X. We're very out of the loop. Well, last week my manger &amp; director both announced they would be leaving at the end of this week (8/30). Company Y is scrambling to keep things running smoothly as they still have no visibility into the financials of Company X without us.

With my two team leaders leaving, Company Y has offered me a considerable retention bonus. If I stay until the end of January and help transition the analysis we do to Company Y, they will pay me the same salary for 5 months after I leave. It sounds great, I could take a long vacation while getting paid and have plenty of time to lock down the next gig. The problem is I will be totally on an island for the next 5 months with no real growth in my career skills.

My other option appeared in my inbox this morning: I have been offered a position at a company closer to my house, for a bit more money (\~10% higher), that would give me the opportunity to continue to grow and get better at what I do. I am torn.

I know there really isn't a bad decision here, both options have their positives. What are your thoughts? What would you do?"

What are options for fast-tracked entry level positions in IT for jobseekers?
What should one do to get those positions and where should they look?


I am a college senior studying Mathematics looking to explore my options for entering an IT career during the upcoming job application season. Much of what I read for career entry is targeted at individuals with 0 experience and often no college degree so I am looking to find information for myself and people in a similar situation. 


At the time of my graduation I will have my BS in Math, a certificate from my university in Computer Science, an internship doing non-technical sysadmin work, and two years doing helpdesk/desktop support (imaging, managing user accounts, desktop troubleshooting, network troubleshooting, the works). 


The way I see it there are a few options presented to me and people in my position:
Junior Sys. Admin
Desktop Support
Junior Operations Analyst
Junior DBA


My concern is that I have some degree of qualification with my studies and experience but no direct experience. So my interview would be something to the effect of ""I've never done this before, but I promise I will be able to within a week, trust me?"". I hope that my recommendation letters from my employers can help fill this gap. I also worry about being underemployed as I see a plethora of posts about people getting paid little hourly as an entry position which wouldn't work too well with respect to my college debts. My final question then is, is trying to get into IT right now a mistake? Should I try to pursue something more applicable to my degree? I really do enjoy IT more than I enjoy doing math/statistics/data analytics but the entry point just seems so intangible and odd.


Thank you."

Now that I have the focus, could someone suggest what I could do to maximise my chances of gainful employment. I'm focused on JS &amp; Python at the moment - don't want to cast my net too wide.

I have been with a growing company for a little under a year, started January 1st, but I'm labeled an independent contractor for the company. So that means no benefits, and  even though technically no job is ever safe, I really don't have job security. My title is intern but in reality it's more along the lines of ""Tech Guy"". So excel reports, web page management, Active Directory know-how, basic help desk; anything that would involve a computer, I help cover. I didn't fuss for a while because they said ""You'll be an intern of sorts to prove yourself before getting hired on."" It's been 8 going on 9 months.

I'm fed up with their excuses of why they continue to push back the hiring. They obviously like me where I am and so my thought process is if they hire me they'd have to specify what it is that I'll be doing. Pay is great, but I'm saving for a house and I've been told tax management as a independent contractor is hard to apply for mortgage loans. But this is where my problem lies. I've already made up my mind that they'll continue to delay until I'm no longer needed, so I'm applying to other jobs(500 applications at least since I started/ 15 applications a week). But I've been looking rigorously through all websites and locations and the jobs I can apply for honestly I'd be taking a pay cut which would kill me in bills and honestly probably means I'd have to move back in with the parents. And they jobs that have my pay (equal to what I'm making, not trying to find higher) require experience that I don't have yet.

What should I do? Even waiting for a year in full with this company wouldn't provide me with the experience needed, but I can't afford a pay cut so I can't start over with a different level 1 help desk position.

The options in my head are either stick it out until they throw me out. Build as much experience as possible and once I leave find a temp job like retail until something pops up and I can begin again in the IT field?

Or keep applying and hope to god someone responds?

Last bit of information is that there is a slim chance that my job actually grows into something. Me and my Boss are the only members that are IT and with a rapid growth rate in the company they'll eventually need more.

TL;DR - I can't lose pay, but all jobs that match I don't meet the criteria to honestly apply. What to do?

I'm scatterbrained on this so if there is more information needed or certain questions answered I'd be happy to provide more, but as of now this is all that comes to mind."

Hello, so I have looked at many posts on this subreddit about how nobody should ever take an unpaid internship, however, I think I seem to have a somewhat different position. I am will be sophomore CS major starting this fall and I was thinking about taking a remote unpaid internship for the fall while being a full-time student. The company is named Groceristar, which is located in Ukraine. I know this seems suspicious, however, my supervisor seems to be very proactive in checking progress and assisting if I need help. If I do take this internship, how would it look to employers if they see that the company is in a foreign country, such as Ukraine?

I would like to treat it as a personal project, in the sense that I can learn more and further better my skills. Obviously I do not want it to interfere with my academic performance too much. I am thinking of just quitting if it severely hurts my academics. In my perspective, I do not think I have much to lose, because I can basically quit if I want to at any time. Of course I will use more of my free time doing work for this internship.

I would love to know your honest opinion about this position"

I just need help figuring out whether it's my perception that's skewed, or if I really should  ""have no trouble finding a job"", as my academic advisor (who wrote me a letter of recommendation), professors, past colleagues (one of whom wrote me another letter of recommendation), (now-employed) classmates, friends, and family have all told me and continue to tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;BEGIN BACKSTORY

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR because it became a bit venty: I feel legitimately confident in my ability to start my career as a developer even though I recognize my current shortcomings and small volume of experience, and I do everything I can to present myself in a coherent, competent, cooperative, and professional manner, but in spite of this I get nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated this last May, and I had had two internships during the year, but only one worth talking about. I'm going to keep the identifying details vague.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I was contacted by an organization that needed someone to help with modernization of their data systems. At the time, the department of the organization I was working at had no software developers, and had in the past hired independent contractors to get things done. In other words, the entire development team when I was working there was myself and another CS major.

&amp;#x200B;

So, together, we spoke with the people of the department to understand what problems they were having and what they wanted to do in the future, and we learned to understand the challenges they were facing which were unique not only to their industry but their specific organization. Once the other CS major and I figured out what we thought would be best for them, we convinced them of this fact, but not before educating them on all the upsides and downsides of databases, and how they work. We became trusted advisors to them in matters of computers and data storage. Finally, we worked over the semester to migrate every one of their old (and frankly terrible) systems into the single unified database by designing and then normalizing a schema to BCNF, writing scripts to clean up the old data, and then deploying the database on their own system. (The semester ended then and their funding got cut, so we couldn't get to any of the cool \*actual applications\* that we had intended to use the DB as a springboard for, but I digress). We even presented our work alongside them at a regional (as in many states) conference where industry leaders meet so our work could serve as a model for the rest of the industry (which largely struggles with being unmodern). To me, this seems like a reasonably significant accomplishment, and (as the letter of recommendation reads) ""work that is on-par with that typically produced by hired professional contractors"". It suggests to me that I have ""strong interpersonal and communication skills"", ""a passion for quality work"", and ""the ability to work effectively in a team"", as well as whatever rehashed phrases relate to having baseline competence in MySQL and Python.

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said. Not one of the applications I've sent out has even gotten me a phone call. I tweak my resume for every company, and every position that I apply to within that company. ONCE, I used the same resume/cover letter for two different positions within a company, and it's because the job descriptions were identical, but I included a little note saying ""hey by the way I used this same info on the other position"". 

&amp;#x200B;

And if the application accepts one, I \*always\* write a cover letter that's completely customized to the position, and then I edit it and trim it until it's as packed with information on why I want to work there, why I would be an asset to them, how I look forward to hearing back soon, and all the other information a cover letter needs as I can possibly get it while keeping it under a page. And then I submit it through the company website, avoiding LinkedIn if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I apply for entry-level positions and ""entry-level positions"" (you know the type: 2+ years of experience, ""demonstrated proficiency in A B C D ... X Y and Z"", etc...) that I meet 75% of the ""requirements"" for, plus or minus two years of experience, so I don't think I'm applying too high above my skillset. I \*legitimately\* feel prepared to enter these positions, even though I recognize I don't currently have the exact skillset, standards training, etc etc etc that I would need to make meaningful contributions on day 1 (another thing I try to make a point of in cover letters).

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;END BACKSTORY

&amp;#x200B;

So is it my perspective that's wrong (i.e. graduating a full year early, having experience personally working with real clients, and also having a variety of well-made and significant school projects worthy of showing off \[e.g. a full 50+ page website with reasonably polished/styled pages, flashy clientside scripting features, meaningful database interactions, all running on a node.js server\] DOESN'T make me qualified for even the most basic development role? Or have I just been having shit luck, and I ""should have a job within a few months out of school EZ""?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be willing to share some of the resumes and cover letters I've sent out, if anyone wants to see them."

My background is that I always in a literary background since high school (this means that I effectively did not have to do any math at 14, and I was already BAD before that). I wanted to become an english teacher and things happened that made me disillusioned with the education system in my country and I gave up. I was sick of doing translation work and I did something foolish and applied for this computer science two-year degree. I wanted to make something that helps others and I have a plan for it, I just need to build skills. Well, I was accepted to my surprise.

But my deficiencies in math is catching up to me hard. I don't even know how I managed to obtain this first year. My lack of understanding of math in general makes me feel like it handicaps me in understanding programming languages too. Not to mention that the impostor syndrome I feel makes me fall apart whenever I am in front of a paper and asked to write code next to all those folks who took the right path in their education.  I started with Python, I was able to barely get by, then Java hit me like a truck, Assembly too, and now things like database languages like pgplsql are straight up gibberish to me. What really helped me were all the subjects around communication, marketing and economy, because it flows more naturally to me. Web programming was fine too.

As a point of reference, I had to re-acquaint myself with the order of operations in maths, I didn't know how to solve a simple equation. That's how bad I am. I tried holding myself up in discrete maths, but linear algebra threw me off from the start. Weirdly enough, I was able to catch up in graphs and network, mostly because I only had to apply specific things, whereas other subjects asked from me to use everything that they expected me to learn in high school.

Where should I stand now? I'm not thinking of giving up, but I'm not sure if I can stand the onslaught. I've been trying to catch up but I obviously need time. Also I would have to work as an intern for two months and I'm like holy shit...with my skills no one will accept me and those who do won't make me last long. I'm trying to think of a strategy that would benefit me and I need more insight. I could still redo the year if it fails, that's not an issue, but I wouldn't want to fail that too if I'm not prepared for it.

Any advice? I love what I'm doing despite the intense amount of stress I'm going through. I love creating new things by coding. I know it's beginner level but I was super proud to make a chess program in Java despite my struggles. Building a project, making a spreadsheet, sticking to my goals on time, that was fun. But maths, man. This will always be the sword above my head."

Obligatory this happened at the end of May.

So I go to medical school in a country that isn’t the United States. The system here obviously works a little differently, but I’ll try to explain it as simply as possible: school here is 6.5 years. No MCAT exists, just 3 years of the equivalent of US undergrad and 3.5 years of the equivalent of US med school. In our last year and a half we do 6 months of electives, 6 months ‘internship,’ and 6 months rural work. The electives are always the first six months of our 6th year, and the latter two are interchangeable (half the students start with internship, half start with rural), which is decided during our elective months, and is chosen by GPA.

So some backstory, my (now ex) girlfriend (25f) and I (24f) had been together since July 2017. In the beginning, all was great. Super attentive, caring, loving. You name it, she was it. Even went as far as to inform my psychiatrist of my mental breakdown last year as it was happening, arrived to my location, and dragged me to said psychiatrist because she didn’t want me to do anything to myself. If she hadn’t done that, I probably wouldn’t be here today. This girl was everything I’d ever asked for, and more.

The only catch? I never fell in love with her.

A saying we have here is ‘un clavo saca otro clavo,’ which literally translates to ‘one nail takes out another nail,’ which loosely translates to ‘using someone to get over someone else,’ or in English slang, the rebound.

So here I am in July 2017, not really pining over the ex that things never worked out with, but not 100% over her either, right? Well then this girl comes along. We’ll call her María. I know she’s gay, she knows I’m gay, but we never really talked to one another. But in 4th year when you start going to the hospital, everything changes. So we start seeing each other more often, even though we’re in different rotations. She knows I hate physical contact, so she teases me by hugging me when she sees me, that type of stuff. Long story short, we start going out. Great, right? Sure, except for the fact that the intensity I felt with my ex (or I guess ‘ex ex’ now) wasn’t felt with María. Kisses with María? No butterflies. Hugs with María? No butterflies. About to go on a date with María? No butterflies. But hey, it happens. Not all relationships are the same. I still enjoyed the time spent together. I genuinely liked this girl.

Fast forward to May 2019. We have to choose internship or rural for July-December 2019. At this point things are kind of off, a little awkward. Our personalities aren’t really complementary, and it’s starting to show. I don’t need physical contact, and she dies for it. Our love languages are the complete opposite. But I still can’t imagine these next six months without her, I think. She chooses rural with her friends; I’m between rural with the gf or internship with the best friend. Then comes my turn to yell out what I want (head doctor was calling our names out by average, and I’m after her), and being the idiot that I am, choose rural at the last second, much to my best friend’s dismay, who had chosen internship.

The house we choose (provided by the university) ends up only having 3 rooms. No problem, our other two housemates (and María’s best friends, might I add) get their own room, and she and I share. Here’s where I fucked up.

The first few weeks are awkward, but bearable. She’s happy, so I’m happy. We’re trying to fix things. We’re able to sleep in the same bed in peace (her parents are homophobic, so I could never even go to her house before now). But then she starts getting mad at little things. Not enough kisses? Gets mad. Not enough hugs? Gets mad. And don’t get me wrong, I was trying. We’d had conversations about this before. We kind of agreed that I would try to give more attention and she’d try to demand less. But I guess living together made her expect more and more, and it became too unbearable for me. So comes the first fight. And another, and another. Til finally we are no more. That’s ok, right? We’re adults. We can be civil.

Until the following Monday when I see her tongue fucking another classmate at a birthday celebration, which brings me to what I forgot to mention.

One of our classmates (in our class of 12, no less) has tried to get with María since 1st year. María continuously turned her down and has always told me she’s never really liked her, even though she went through a short rebound phase with her after María’s first gf cheated on her, and despite everything, they get along really well with each other and have really similar personalities. About a week before María and I break up, this girl we’ll call Janet, calls her and tells her they need to talk about something important. María asks if I’m ok with them hanging out, and I tell her ‘go for it,’ since I trust her and all. Apparently Janet took her to get ice cream and confessed her feelings (once again), and I guess because of the attention she wasn’t receiving from me, started paying more attention to her. Eventually we break up and she jumps at the opportunity for a good rebound fuck with Janet, and I guess to get back at me, has been VERY open with their relationship, going as far as bringing her to our house, to OUR room, while I’m in the living room. Kisses and intimate hugs in front of me, phone calls while I’m right next to María, and Janet has come over almost every day since then.

Un clavo saca otro clavo.

We share a room until rural work ends at the end of December.

Don’t room with your partner, kids. Especially if everything’s bound to fall apart sooner or later.

Sorry for making this so long.

TL;DR chose to room with my gf for 6 months despite going through a rocky phase. We broke up. Now she’s fucking another classmate and isn’t doing anything to hide it, going as far as kissing and intimately hugging in front of me. They're actually in our room right now 6 feet from where I'm sitting."

I'm a 2nd year computer eng student trying to get my resume ready for software internships next summer.  I did not learn coding in first year courses (except C++), and decided to learn some stuff this summer, including HTML/CSS, JS, and Ruby. In this learning journey, I created some projects including a calculator, a sketching game and a type speed test (using languages above). Also, I made a static site using Jekyll, added my own content and added/modified the existing template.

I'm not sure if Hiring Managers will be interested in any of these projects , I know they are nothing spectacular but mostly I just want to show that I have the ability to be self-directed, take initiative and am willing to learn. Are these projects going to make me look better or will they think that it's too elementary?"

I am a very motivated individual and my dream is to land an internship at Goldman Sachs / JP Morgan, however I'm not sure what I should do. I know that if i have good experience they may consider me more, but is there a step by step guide anyone can recommend as to how i can land interviews / internships with top investment banking companies? I know networking is crucial, my resume formatting is really nice and I have a few connections (one from Goldman Sachs and one from Amazon Corporate) who have helped me create a really nice resume. If anyone could help me out by telling me what jobs / internships I should look for currently to give me experience needed for being considered for Goldman / JPM or what else I can do I would greatly appreciate it and I know many on here would too.

cwthkp,17,2019-08-28,Baffling spread of mis-information in class today...,swe2020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cwthkp/baffling_spread_of_misinformation_in_class_today/,"This week I began my final year of college. I'm not sure if this is the case for most other CS programs but at my (not top tier) school, my hardest major courses took place my Junior Year. Now I am largely taking CS related electives, doing research, and working part time with my company. Well anyway, today I had the first meeting of a class called ""Web Applications Programming""...

&amp;#x200B;

This 4 credit ""course"" which for some students can cost upwards of $5000 is taught by the department head who is 65+ and has never worked in the industry and attained a PHD in 1990. I was told to take it by an adviser who said it was ""possibly the most valuable course we teach here taught by one of the greatest professors"". Well shucks let me give it a try!

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have done full stack engineering as an intern, then a junior dev, and now an Eng II with my company while going through school and I like to think I have gotten pretty skilled. I worked with a lot of great people from all different backgrounds and various ages and I have never seen someone be so unqualified to be teaching anything in my life than I witnessed today. So no I am no ageist. 

&amp;#x200B;

She begins class with the syllabus and I already know it is going to be a rough one. At the top of the page in bold letters and the largest size font she writes ""ABSOLUTELY NO BOOTSTRAP OR CHEATER FRAMEWORKS (REACTANT,  ANGULAR, ETC)"". Yes you read that correctly, ""REACTANT"". She requires all students use a version of netbeans with a web bundle  which is 6 generations old because the new software is ""funky"" and does not do what she wants it to do. We are to hand code HTML/CSS, only write javascript in line so as to not have ""too many files to keep track of"", and only use Java/MySQL on the back end because anything else is ""not safe practice"". Literally her words.

&amp;#x200B;

Students asked her why frameworks wouldn't be allowed and she said ""There is no use learning them, they are here today and gone tomorrow. By the time this class is over another will already be the gold standard!"" I don't even have to explain how this is nonsense anyone with an ounce of common sense today should understand. To cap all of this off she says ""All of your tests will be on paper and your documentation for any of your code is to be printed. That means no comments in the code! That makes it far too cluttered"". This among a few other statements about the industry which were true 20 years ago and have no basis in fact today.

&amp;#x200B;

It is amazing how many students most of which were Seniors were taking notes and diligently intaking all of the garbage she chose to spew today. It amazes me that I have to endure this to get a diploma. It amazes me how someone can use a platform like this to misguide so many young people and be so inconsiderate of the world evolving around you. To all my fellow senior students, stay woke. Good luck"

However recently I've been thinking about pushing graduation back a semester and finishing next December instead. The primary reason for doing this is that I think I think another internship next summer could be valuable and help me decide exactly what I want to do (neither of my past 2 internships provided much clarity).

However I am concerned that the job market wont be as robust in January for graduates and that opportunities wont be present in January that might be there if I were to graduate this May.

Was wondering what your guys thoughts were, is there a difference in graduation or am I just overthinking it."

I am currently living in California, and I am just beginning my junior year.  My major is computer science, and I am definitely interested in machine learning/artificial intelligence.  Last spring, I finished taking a data structures course, and during the summer, I finished up all of my lower division classes.  Fortunately, I was given the opportunity to have a mock interview with a Lyft Engineer.  I’m proud to say I did fairly well, but I still lack confidence.  I am currently working on a project in C++.  It keeps track of my budget, saves it, and I can open it to update it.  Finally, I am currently working as a server, and have two years left in school.  My expected graduation is *May 2021*.    

**My Goals**    

* Review my Resume and start applying to everything

+ Install Linux on a spare laptop (first time ever using linux)

- Learn Python.  My Compilers class provides extra-credit for coding in two languages.
* Do one LeetCode problem on my weekend/finish my Budget Tracker project/Go through Cracking the Coding Interview book.
    
**My Ambitions**
    
* Summer of 2020 -&gt; Internship

+ Summer of 2021 -&gt; Big N Internship
    
**Questions**    

* Am I on the right track?  I ask because I understand I don’t have any projects.  I am trying to post some homework problems I had from class, and I also am posting this project that is not currently complete.

+ I’m not expecting, but I would hope to land a big N internship in Summer of 2020.  Are my chances low?

- If I get an internship Summer of 2021, would I push back my graduation to Fall of 2021 (I don’t mind)?
* Any advice that you have for me that I haven’t mentioned?
    
Thank you for your advice.  I’m aiming high after graduation, and am just a bit worried.  I’m sure it’ll be okay, but advice, and guidance would surely be appreciated.  Thank you again!!"

I don't really have any professional experience, so I wasn't sure if I'd make the cut. I tried to make up for it with my projects, but not sure if that's enough.

Also a bit concerned about the layout.

Regarding getting feedback from companies, how can I express the obstacles that I encountered through my journey? Since it seems like recruiters look passed all the details in the resume.

I guess I dug myself in the hole and nobody seems to help out. Maybe if I can get the slightest of help, that can help me out since I have been struggling mentally. It devastating that I can't show that I'm worth more than what my resume speaks. I don't want it to get to the point where I don't want to get out of bed. It's really been bothering me so much. I'd say I get upset but i looked at my symptoms and apparently I am depressed from my current situation. 

It frustrates since I am unable to help out my parents. They have done so much for me that I need to help them out and I hope I can do that before they are gone. I hate to see them work so much for very little money and barely get by paying the rent and groceries. They sacrificed half there life so I can get a degree and be jobless.  Will anybody even listen to me and help out?

I don't know since I do have trust issues. It's ironic I know. Always never had friends to talk to. Don't have siblings. Parents have enough to deal with so I don't to bother them with my ""issues."" It's true  I have more than they ever had. I shouldn't be feeling ungrateful. It's impressive that my mental health has been able to endure all of this, that I haven't thought about ending it all. 

The end of the day, I'm just talking to myself. I want someone to help me out but in person. It's no point online, right? Maybe I should just quite now. I can't land my dream job, can't help out my parents. Plus nobody will notice I'm gone. I have no friends anyways. Only my parents and some relatives... nah that might not be the solution... I need to get out of this hole  but I need somebodies help. Who though? I have no one to talk to. Only myself. I am put to suffer and to try to overcome this. I've been through worse situations. I've worked full-time and went to school full-time. What can be worse than th- oh wait. my current situation is worse. Why can't I see the way out right now? Only thing that kind of works is to be fake with the people I work with now, which my the way is the coworkers at a job that is completely not related to my degree. 

Why am I a failure? I will overcome this. I am talking to myself in my mind, the same way you are reading this if you even read up to this point. Nobody cares about how I feel. Sure my parents kind of care but they don;t know hoe frustrated I am and they really can't help me out right now... 

I need to vent more. I am feeling a bit relieved but why? I'm still jobless and a bum. Wow, this is really how I think of myself. Very pessimistic and low self-esteemed heh? But I know it's only now that things aren't going my way. Once I get what  want, I will firstly be grateful to the Man above that He helped me out of the situation. Let me see... what else...? I don;t want anti-depressants since like I mentioned before I know this feeling will go away. I hate going into this sob stuff. Once I am out I'll be enthusiastic again. Is that too much to ask for? 

Oh birthday coming up and I don't have anyone to celebrate with. WOOOOOOOOO. It's better that way. Less drama with unnecessary people. All people can be toxic. They only use you for their own benefit. Once they use dyou, they'll forget about you like your a child in car seat in a hot summer day. Noticing my fingers can't keep up with my racing thoughts. Wow also looking back at my post, I felt like I typed more than I did? Maybe I should write a book? But that will take time and money will be lost there. Plus writing isn't for me. My grammar is so poor for English.

I'll stop here. If you actually read all of this, I really appreciate you but I know no one would have read all this. Nobody will help out but I hope someone responds. Idk why I want someone to respond if I know no one will. OK i'll stop. Thanks for reading and hope to get help from someone about my initial paragraphs.Hope I didn't lose your mind or mine as well, but I think I lost my mind a loooong time ago... k bye"

cww5cs,1,2019-08-29,Work advice for a formerly homeless foster youth with no support system who is living out of state by themselves and scared to become homeless again *long read*,i-am-okay-today,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cww5cs/work_advice_for_a_formerly_homeless_foster_youth/,"\**throwaway account because I know lots of ppl don't like sob stories and I don't want this traced back to my normal account. The main reason for all the text is to give some background so you understand why I am so anxious and kind of scared about this decision*\*

**If you were in my situation and have multiple job offers, how do you choose which one? Based on pay, benefits and other perks, schedule, prestige/job title?** 

I've been working since I was 14 and always just took the first one who offered because I had bills to pay (long story but my foster parents charged me for everything including rides to school, using their laundry machines and showers. Social worker thought it wasn't a big deal since we were  being fed and not beaten lmfao). No matter the pay or how hard the job seemed I just took what I could get.

When I aged out of foster care at 18, I was given a check of a few hundred dollars and sent on my way. My job was a hostess at a chain restaurant , no one would hire me to serve without experience. I was homeless for a bit, sleeping on the all nighter bus and trying to save my money from my job instead of paying a motel. Eventually I got into a shelter. shelters are rough! Especially as an 18 year old female. I don't want to go into details but I ended up having to leave in the middle of the night for my safety. When I came back in the morning all my possessions were gone and the police weren't much help at all. I started couch surfing for a bit until I moved in with a guy I met, who was sweet and generous. Turned out to be a drug dealer and went to prison after only a few months, which left me homeless again since I couldn't afford the apartment by myself. I went back to couch surfing.

That spring, I enrolled in a CSU (California state university) and majored in business with an accounting option and moved into the dorms (I had okay grades, a C average, plus I was in AVID and being a foster kid helps with the admissions process and financial aid). I worked as a waitress during school and eventually got an internship with the county. I was placed in the office of agriculture/weights and measures doing admin work. After that internship ended, I wasn't offered a job because they didn't have a permanent opening. I started working at the library during the week after class and waited tables on the weekends instead. After graduation, I continued those jobs until I kinda got pushed out of the SF Bay Area due to the cost of living. The room I was renting was $1200 with no kitchen access, no guests allowed, only one 20 mins shower allowed a day and just was super uncomfortable.

So I relocated out of state by accepting a job on [coolworks.com](http://coolworks.com/) as a server/bartender. I was promised a room to rent for $125/week, free food at work and $5/hr plus tips. Well guess what? Every paycheck was wrong and they would pay me only a penny per hour and it would take weeks to get it corrected. And they would give me the difference in cash instead of a check with a stub. And the owners would come in every night 20 mins before closing to eat and get drunk. When it came time to pay they would never tip. The housing had a roach and beetle infestation and our windows were busted so we had to use blankets to keep the cold air from coming in. one of my coworkers/roommates was an alcoholic cook who showed up to work so drunk that he fell asleep on the line and burned his hand. Instead of getting help for his burnt ass hand, he went to the bar and grabbed a bottle of wine. He drank the whole thing and fell asleep again! We were looking for him for almost an hour until we found him knocked out in the storage room🤦‍♂️Then my other coworker/roommate got drunk and verbally attacked our other roommate and called her racial slurs and threatened to rape her. He was arrested but at that point I was ready to get far away from there.

I left there and settled in Las Vegas. I've been here 2 weeks. At first I was sleeping on the couch of a girl I know from college but now I am renting a room. I applied to 68 jobs and so far had 8 interviews and 5 job offers. More places contact me everyday which makes it even harder to make a decision.

Right Now I have like 5 different companies who have sent me solid job offers via mail/email and need me to complete background checks and drug screening. I don't want to make the wrong decision. Seems like such a basic question but I never had anyone really teach me what to look for and I don't have any older, more experienced people to ask or any type of guidance. I just feel like my decision making skills aren't the best and I don't have anyone to turn to for this type of advice so I that brings me here :)

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Executive assistant $18/hr at Gentleman's club**. crazy hours, some days graveyard, some 7am-2pm. The job includes not only admin work but also basic accounting work and doing stuff the managers can't get to including auditions, ordering furniture that break like broken lockers and poles, chairs and glasses for the bar as well as ushering ""entertainers"" out of the building when they get terminated. It's a 30 min bus ride from my house and I get to wear what I want. It's considered one of the higher end clubs in the city if that means anything
2. **Call center agent $9/hr plus commission**, 9-5pm, full time with benefits. Taking inbound calls from ppl who need assistance with the federal student loan forgiveness programs. 1 hr bus ride from my house. Business casual dress and the quota is 2 sales a day. After 5 a week, I get a commission off each ""sale"" that I make. If I don't make quota I could lose my job? The management does seem like it would be typical call center shenanigans though. For instance, during the second interview I overheard someone cursing someone else out because they ate their lunch.
3. **Bartender at a resort (back in CA) $12/hr plus tips**, seasonal gig (late september until May 2020). no benefits but comes with dorm-style housing at $70 biweekly. I obviously have no choice on who I get to share a room with but my current rent is $600 a month so I would be saving money. I am afraid though because living in the dorms was hard and crazy so I am hesitant to live with strangers again.
4. **Financial Operations Clerk $16/hr at a local credit union**. Full time with benefits. Behind the scenes finance stuff like processing overnight mail transactions, ensuring transactions are posted correctly, remote deposit capture review (reviewing mobile deposits). This one was appealing to me because I think it would be nice to have a non-customer facing job even though I don't mind it. let's be real, after a certain amount of time you need a break from customers. The only issue would be they are asking for a credit check. Mine is terrible :(
5. **Teller at check cashing store $14/hr** and is right across the street from my apartment, so no having to take the bus or take uber/lyft. Full time with benefits. No set schedule. Does have sales quotas for payday loans though and I am assuming there could be some safety issues because there's bullet proof windows and a man-trap to get in.

Any advice, tips would be appreciated. I want a job where I can stay for a while, get on my feet financially and will look good on a resume. I want some type of stability for once on my life. I'm sick of moving around and job hopping!"

I’m an EE major trying to transition to become a SWE. I have had 2 EE internships, one at a public utility company and one at Boeing. I did some coding in Boeing proprietary programming language for the Boeing internship for a Monte Carlo analysis. In terms of classes, I’ve taken 3 Java classes (including data structures and algorithms). I was thinking that it will be easier to get a SWE internship than try to apply as a level 1. Assuming that a company would accept a new grad, should I do this or just aim for SDE 1 positions? I’m located in Seattle if that makes a difference"

cwxjpf,1,2019-08-29,How valuable is getting a CS minor in this situation?,mar7y,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cwxjpf/how_valuable_is_getting_a_cs_minor_in_this/,"Hello,

I'm just starting my senior year of undergrad, where as a freshmen I was majoring in CS and finished the freshmen level requirements. I then switched my major to MIS because I felt like it was a better fit. This past summer I did a Backend Web Development Internship where I really worked on my programming skills and I'll be returning as a junior dev. (Mainly C#, SQL, APIs)

It didn't occur to me until now that I could still get a CS minor with only 3 more classes. The problem is, those 3 extra classes (9 credit hours) would put my spring semester at 22 credit hours which is stressful and would cost an additional $1,860 because any credits past 18 is $465 each. The thing is, 2/3 of the CS classes for the minor are nearly identical to 2 MIS classes that I already took. (Literally the MIS course is called ""Web Programming"" and the CS course is called ""Web Programming 1"", with the **exact same** course content.) This brings me to the question of whether it's okay to put on my resume if I have the skills but technically not the same classes. (but on the flipside those classes would be easy but costly to complete) 

What should I do in this situation? 

1) Is the additional time and money worth it to add CS as my minor? Is it possible that I get higher salary offers by completing the remaining 3 classes?

2) How bad would it be to put Computer Science minor on my resume even if I don't technically have it but I have the skills? Could a potential employer find out about this? (I'm an ethical person I promise, but seriously would this be that big a deal?)

My future career interests are in: Business analysis, product management, Backend web development, and C# application development if this helps at all. Thank you so much."

It is a marketing internship, but when I joined they had someone that was slacking doing their marketing and they eventually let him go leaving it up to me the marketing to pick up slack. I’ve done marketing plans, budgets for marketing department, continue with a half-assed list they made for companies and influencers, social media plans and more. 

Over the summer, I did some remote work because I got an amazing offer in NYC that was paid for. I did some work here and there, but with being in NYC I had to get a small part-time job too (which I did communicate with the first place and they understood) so my work was getting done just slower. Now I’m back at school and completely over not being paid. There is another “intern” who was there before me and still isn’t paid but does more work than I do and had to travel there. I tried to go by today because I told them I would and no one was in office all day of course. I messaged one of my bosses and he did not respond which slightly scares me. I have the slight feeling they’ll let me which wouldn’t be the worst but no one wants to be fired. 

I’ve put in a lot here and I know they discussed having me on full time before I graduate this fall, but I don’t think I can wait to be paid for that long for the hours they want. 

What should I do?"

There was no reply and I had sent him weekly reminders as well. But after 2 reminders, there was no reply either. So I tried again after a couple of weeks and he said that he can only meet me regarding admissions in November, but I think that'll be too late as I'm also expecting to get an LoR from the professor. I mailed him stating the importance of the work I did with him for my essay but he says that he doesn't have any advice to give regarding essay writing.

cwyevw,20,2019-08-29,Inhale. Exhale. I repeat these words only to remain alive.,SatanLovesJello,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cwyevw/inhale_exhale_i_repeat_these_words_only_to_remain/,"This is my first submission. Feedback welcome, suggestions encouraged.

(Exhale, inhale.) This is going to sound like complete insanity, and I suppose in a way, it is. However, insane or not, the simple fact is that if I do not continue to put words into writing, I shall die. As you may or may not have noticed, in order for my lungs to continue to draw and expel breath, I must not forget to write or type those commands.(Exhale. Inhale.) I can only imagine what you must be thinking, but I can assure you that I have no choice. I've tested the boundaries of this sudden affliction, and I am convinced that I am not suffering from any sort of mental malady whatsoever. 

(Exhale, inhale.) I've been maintaining this pace for nearly 48 hours, and in that short amount of time, I've learned that there are some fairly straightforward rules that I must adhere to. The first rule is obvious. The second rule came as something of a relief: I can copy and paste, and the commands will be executed.

(Exhale, inhale.) How quickly I have mastered the art of keyboard shortcuts! At first, the connection between the written words and their necessity was discovered by an urgent text I began to send to my daughter. When I had typed in the words: ""I can't catch my breath! I can't INHALE! "" I was suddenly able to greedily suck in a gasping gulp of air. I sat, shaking, on the edge of the bed for a moment, wiping cold, sweaty beads from my forehead with the cuff of my nightshirt while silently laughing to myself; believing that I must have had a nightmare and simply awoken in that strange sort of paralysis that most people have experienced at one time or another in their lives. (As I wrote this paragraph, those actions occured at precisely the moment that I typed them. Lucky me. But just for safety's sake...

...exhale, inhale.) Very quickly I discovered that my lungs were now refusing to deflate. It amazes me (especially now) how mindlessly we all take such autonomous and effortless bodily functions for granted. I quickly entered ""Now, I can't exhale.."" And just like that, I forcefully expelled two lungfuls of carbon-dioxide laden air into the quiet and still bedroom. (Inhale) I remained on the edge of the bed that I had shared with my wife for so many blissful years, waiting to see if my lungs would continue. They did not, and it was at that exact moment that the primitive part of my brain that concerns itself with nothing more than survival sent a memo to that other part of my brain where logic resides. (Exhale) Curious, frightened, but forced to make a decision I typed ""Inhale"". Once again, as I type that word now, my chest expands as if for the very first time.

(Exhale, inhale.) The next few hours were spent feverishly laboring to establish and maintain a rhythm sufficient to provide some semblance of comfort, and to assure myself that I was indeed alive, awake, and coherent. (Exhale, inhale.) Once I had regained my composure, (assisted by my very good friend, Jack Daniels) I sat at the small table in the alcove near the kitchen, pondering. (Ramona had lovingly called it her ""Breakfast Nook"", but over the years it had become a sort of catch-all room.(Exhale, inhale.) Her sewing machine and a wicker basket full of cloth, patterns, pins and thread occupied a permanent residence on one corner of the small table, and a sizable quantity of her beloved Danielle Steele novels were neatly stacked on one of the vacant chairs, presumably within easy reach if she were to pass by with a cocktail on her way to the sunroom.)

(Exhale,inhale.)  I kept the Samsung smart-phone in my right hand, with the notepad app opened. I manually typed in my life-support commands for about half an hour before that logical part of my brain reminded me that copy-pasting existed in the literary world of Android. (Exhale,inhale.) I don't recall that I had ever used the function for anything other than sending a longwinded text (with an attachment of an animated kitten doing something cute that I found amusing) to my wife and daughter. I'm fairly adept with most modern technology, but I never could quite get the hang of forwarding a message. So, I copy-pasted.

(Exhale, inhale.) About an hour into my ordeal, the Samsung emitted an impatient little chirp, reminding me that the battery was now at 21%. I hadn't considered that I would need to charge the blasted thing, so I resigned myself to spending an hour or so in the recliner, watching an old Eastwood western. I would press and hold my thumb on the notepad, and paste the necessary words every 10 seconds or so. Google helped with that. (Exhale,inhale.) Thank God I was finally able to dig this old laptop out of the closet. It hasn't been used since my wife was still alive, and if I weren't a hopeless romantic at heart, this rugged and worn IBM ThinkPad would have been discarded or liquidated at the garage sale I held in October. She would have killed me if she'd known I had quit writing.

(Exhale, inhale.) I'm certain by now you've come to realize that  my current situation is somewhat difficult, and I feel that my time is dwindling quickly. I'm not sure how long a person can go without sleep before finally collapsing from exhaustion and I suppose I should explain the events that have led up to this point so far... (Exhale,inhale.) Not because I feel that it's necessary to document what may be my final moments, but because I worry that at any time maybe my eyes or my fingers could follow suit. Since I have to type to breathe, I might as well add something meaningful to my unfortunately repetetive but necessary narrative, and hopefully I can provide some insight to the situation as I now understand it.

(Exhale,inhale.) Before I continue, yes, I've given thought to calling 911, and having an ambulance scoop me up and whisk me away to the emergency room. I've considered the uncomfortable hours of being poked and prodded by a myriad of physicians, and I've also searched online to learn if anyone has ever needed lifelong artificial respiration although being otherwise healthy. (Exhale, inhale.) The answer to the latter is no. I think once I've completed this document, I will see if I can force other bodily functions into effect. Particularly, the one that occurs when one closes their eyes and dreams of their lovely wife and child.

(Exhale, inhale.) My wife Ramona and I celebrated our “Silver” 25th anniversary back in February. The 14th, actually. (I told you, I'm a hopeless romantic) It was a lovely affair. We flew with our daughter, Megan to Oahu, Hawaii. I had purchased  for Ramona an exquisite Harry Winston silver-and-diamond jewelry set that included earrings, a necklace, two bracelets and an anklet. (Men, it's true what they say about jewelry. When in doubt, shell some cash out!) We had an amzing time. Snorkeling, dancing in the sand by moonlight to a traditional Hawaiian band. (Exhale, inhale.) Megan's twenty-first birthday had been in November, but due to her internship she couldn't return home to Maine to celebrate with us. Ramona and I had a good laugh after Megan had a few too many Mai Tai's, and she eventually had passed out in a lounge chair, right on the beach. Her deep red hair was mussed and glimmering in the sunset while Ramona took a couple of selfies with our beautiful and precious, yet deeply unconscious daughter, smiling wildly with a peace sign up, and her tongue out. I eventually had to carry Megan to her room.

(Exhale, inhale.) It was truly magical. We shared a beachfront room in a quiet villa so close to the breakers that we could hear them all night. We made love by candlelight, and whispered our own renewed vows to each other. That woman meant the world to me, and until now, only she could take my breath away day after day.

(Exhale, inhale.) We returned home, and as husbands, wives, and daughters must do, we returned to our daily lives. Ramona had her various clubs to attend to: Friends Of The Library, The Women's Rotary Club, The Knitting Needles, and a few others. Megan, of course had to return to her internship. And I, well, I went back to my writing. (Exhale, inhale.) I've been a writer for many years. You've may have read my work, and if you haven't, the odds are that someone in your family or circle of friends has. I'm a fictional novelist, and my genre of specialty is horror. How ironic that I now find myself forced to write for my own survival, when my despair only futhers my desire to write no more.

(Exhale, inhale.) Ramona got the call in April. It was a Saturday, and it just so happened that we were sharing it together. Just two old lovebirds, keeping each other company on a cold, dismal and rainy day in our home in Maine. Neither of us with any plans, save for catching up on some Netflix later. (Exhale, inhale.) I was at the sink, preparing to dice some vegetables for a stew that Ramona was going to fix. There's nothing like a hot beef stew or a steaming clam chowder on a day like that. I'm partial to chowder, but when Ramona's in the kitchen, it's almost always going to be a stew. I think she just never really liked my chowder, but was always too polite to actually say so.Such was my Ramona.

(Exhale, inhale.) Her phone had begun to play a musical and raucous tune. Something by Reba McEntire if memory serves correctly. I looked over my shoulder as she picked it up, and I could see her looking at the screen apprehensively. Frowning. I whispered “who is it?” to her, but she waved me off and pressed the button to receive the call. (Exhale, inhale.) I went back to the vegetables. It wasn't unusual for Ramona to receive a call on a weekend, but when she answered “Hello, Dr. Chalmers? How are you today?”, I immediately knew something was wrong."

https://increment.com/testing/i-test-in-production/

A few quotes picked out by myself:

&gt; Startups don’t tend to fail because they moved too fast. They tend to fail because they obsess over trivialities that don’t actually provide business value.

.

&gt; The fact is, distributed systems exist in a continual state of partial degradation. Failure is the only constant.

.

&gt; A system’s resilience is not defined by its lack of errors; it’s defined by its ability to survive many, many, many errors.

.

&gt; And because we’ve systematically underinvested in prod-related tooling, we’ve chosen to bar people from prod outright rather than build guardrails that by default help them do the right thing and make it hard to do the wrong thing. We’ve assigned deploy tooling to interns, not to our most senior engineers. We’ve built a glass castle where we ought to have a playground.

What are your thoughts on testing in production and the feelings that we have around doing so?"

I’m currently a 16M studying for A levels in the UK, Doug SATs most likely (achieving top grades consistently). I would like to know what the best way is to begin as an analyst and eventually end up as a manager in a hedge fund in the US. I’m quite into programming, and have already worked a paid internship at a tech company, so believe that being a quant or the like is not out of the question.

I would like to know whether getting into big Ivy League unis like Yale or Columbia which have good econ/finance degrees will make a difference in hiring opportunity, as well as the right course to take as an undergrad. Since I have to do 2 years of National Service out of high school, time is a constraint for me, and therefore I am unsure of majoring in a more general course such as economics  (and perhaps double majoring in computer science or finance, something recommended to me by others) or just directly doing a course for quantitive finance or similar.

The context: i work for a tech consultant in the marketing team and my direct boss is the owner of this company and of the holding the company belongs to. Together, all the companies generate some millions.
Its my first time having an adult job, after finishing college two years ago and trying but failing to have a career as a dancer. I have been here for 5 months now. When me and team arrived (we're all juniors and they are great) there was no marketing department, after my boss fired all the previous employees from marketing because he was unhappy with them. We had no one to guide us until he hired an external consultant who is here 3 times a week (and that he also bullies).

The problem: my boss is constantly dissatisfied with my input at work and to be able to do all the things he wants i would have to work from 8 until 11 in the evening. I don't anymore because after 1 month of summer peace (we had 3 interns in our department and the between the four we would do all of my work), i frankly don't want to anymore.  

He was never happy with me and my work and he is very savage in the way he says it. Sometimes i dread going to work. Its horrible to work somewhere where your boss thinks little of you.

Should i just suck it up and be an adult about it? He has said multiple times that our 'mindset' should be to work until the job is finished, no matter how long that is. But f*** after 8 hours at the office im done. I can do 10 hours but thats it. We receive a little bit above minimal wage and i want to go home and go to the gym, and prepare the next day."

Recently switched to CS after one year of being a wildlife-biology major. I'm currently taking 15 credits and the following classes (ecology, calculus, Intro to Python, Into to Web development). 

I'm a bit nervous to starting this trek, I'm obviously far less experienced and a bit late to the game. I'm wondering what's the best path to an internship and to graduate with as little debt as possible. 

I wasn't the best HS student and currently attend one of the lowest-ranked state schools. I had straight A's last year and am hoping to study abroad in the spring (one of my biggest dreams), following a transfer to a private school next year.

I'm projected to spend over 120k for my education, which is a bit concerning, considering I know jackshit about computers or math. 

Too late to drop, too late to transfer to a community college. Honestly I'm digging myself in a deep hole but am too apathetic because I seem to be F***ed either way. 

I still want to preform well though. But it will probably take me 5 years to graduate. 3 semesters at a low ranked school. 1 semester in Europe. 3 semesters at a private school.

I have almost no work experience.

I applied to a few dozens job offers, I'm getting interviews for internships and full-time jobs.

I'd get paid 25-40% less as an intern.

If I get a job, I can still go to school part-time, I could also quit after 6 months or a year and go back to school, without loosing anything(my school is tuition free, and pretty flexible).

Will I learn a lot less as an employee?Or is it essentially the same thing with better pay and a different title?

&amp;#x200B;

My goal after college(in 16 to 28 months) is to work part-time or as a freelance, and bootstrap my own projects the rest of the time.

I work in a professional field and have a shared computer. It has been found that interns are watching youtube videos on the shared computer and have even installed some video games. Clients have caught them playing games and youtube videos at full volume at certain times of the day, especially after-hours. 

At first I unplugged the speakers, but as it turns out, the HP Prodesk PC has a decent internal speaker that I'd like to disable.

Note: these interns could easily bring a laptop and play whatever they want in a back room. What I'm asking for is not overbearing or dictatorial. I feel like I'm having to treat them like toddlers by disabling the speakers, but alas.

If its possible to block certain apps, so that emails can give a little ""ding"" noise that would be amazing, but just disabling or password blocking the internal speakers would be okay. I'd be very thankful for any advice.

I'm also prepared to crack this bad boy open, but can i do it while the PC is ON? this PC cannot be turned off."

My university just started offering a BA in CS. It’s obviously a little less math heavy than the BS, but both programs are within the College of Engineering. 

I’m back in school for a second Bachelor’s Degree - with my first being in Communication and Business Management. I’m realizing I should have been in CS all along.

I really think I want to focus on Cuber Security as a potential career field, and I’m looking to be done with school as soon as possible without killing myself with classwork on top of being a working adult. 

The BA would offer the ability to be out in 2-3 semesters from now, where the BS would take 4-5 more semesters. 
In the end, is it worth an extra year to get the BS? Or does it really matter? I’ve been browsing posts here about the topic, but wanted a fresh take that wasn’t over a year old. 

Follow-Up Question: 
How much importance is placed on internships for hiring? I’m hoping to get one eventually if it’s needed, but that would probably mean leaving my current, fairly lucrative position. 

Thanks in advance!"

I am currently a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer, who did three Internships prior to graduating from undergrad.

One of these Internships involved using C++, and the other involved using C.

That was almost 3-4 years ago. I have forgotten most of what I did with C / C++, and nowadays know that I want to focus directly on JavaScript and Python.

So I'm wondering: Should I take those two Internships off my resume?

Or should I keep the Internship experience and just remove C, C++ off my resume completely?

Or would it be better to add a special section that says done a tiny bit of C/C++, but definitely not 100% proficient in it?

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this is the right place to post. Just wanted to seek advice regarding improving as a programmer. I started as a business major and took a programming course (in Python) as an option and instantly fell in love with it. As a result, I changed majors after my first year to CSC. Taking my second CSC course, I struggled mightily with learning Java and OOP and got carried by my group in order to pass the class. The next CSC class I took was data and algorithms where I just barely passed the final and passed the course though I didn't feel as though I had a strong foundation with these concepts. I also took the intro course to software development (in C &amp; Python) but C was so confusing that I banked on Python to pass the course which I did. Now, this summer I took Operating Systems and failed miserably as I had no clue what was going on and how to program anything. So my question is, where do I go from here? Do I retake the courses and start over again or are there resources that can help me catch up? I understand Java but can't program/solve any algorithms given parameters. I'm also trying to obtain an internship for January as well so I was planning on taking Databases and OS again in the Fall.

Any and all help is mightily appreciated!"

I really want to work in SF, as it provides a huge learning opportunity, and I think it would be a great experience, working on some meaningful projects.

However, I am confused regarding how to apply to these internships. I have applied to maybe 20-30 internships online this August, and have been rejected/ghosted by all of them. Which makes me reconsider whether applying online is the best way to go.

I heard that people have better results by getting in touch with CEO's of startups or recruiters, however, I am in Canada and SF recruiters don't visit my campus or city. So the only thing I can do is email, however it is difficult to find those emails.

I was curious, what should be my action plan? Should I keep applying online, or also keep emailing recruiters and CEO's? Also is it okay if I apply online, and still send recruiters/ceo's emails?"

Why so difficult?,douglaslabigalini,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cx5mpo/future_decisions_did_my_father_is_right_law_or_a/,"Ok. I'm in a stage of my life that **I NEED** to take some decisions. I'm asking you guys here cause I need some external help. 

I have 21 years old. When I was ten my father puts me in a music conservatory because since I was a little boy I had a lot of interests in music things (We always listened to Pink Floyd and Beatles together). He putted me in that conservatory because he always wanted a 'family band' (He plays guitar, but stopped because of his work). 

So, I entered the conservatory and that thing just blew my mind. I was there for two months and I had learned A LOT and being as more productive in studying as I could. After some years, my childhood friend and I set up a band with other 2 guys and we're playing since then. 

So here the problems begins. When I was in high school my father always told me *'oh, douglas, you need to do a Law University because you will earn money. Stop with the music'*. I was young and don't stopped to think about what my real ME really wanted, so I entered a law university then and I'm in the 4th year. 

When I was a teenager I went to concerts hidden from him, because he saw me doing the thing as a work. A few years ago, when my father took sense and saw me running by my on legs doing music, booking shows, travelling, recording and growing with this, he just asked me to stop. Simple as throwing a piece of paper in the trash. Simple as that.  

Now, I'm doing an internship in a law office writing this and I'm not happy. I could study 10 hours a day to be the best drummer I wanted to be. But, man, I don't understand how his opinion shakes me at the point I can't just say to him 'Ok dad, I don't want to be a lawyer, neither a Judge'. My father is a difficult person. He yells with me and make pression when I tell him I'm not gonna leave the music just for study law. He keeps saying things like *'Ok, you won't use the car anymore or You're disappointing me. It's not that I wanted for you. If I had the opportunities to study as you can when I was your age I was jumping of happiness. I'm SAD for you'*. I have my 2 bands. I have my own projects. I'm trying to study a lot hidden because I don't have money enough to leave my house and live alone. I know if I tell the truth for him he won't talk with me for a great period of time. It's difficult to do this because I really love being and talking with him. Well, he's my best friend and my father!

I know the life of a musician isn't easy as a lawyer is (in terms of making money easily - at least in the country I live), but, I think a lot in things like 'Man, did I need to leave this life I really want for me, for my future, for my healthcare and for my happiness because of money?'. I know if I dive in the law universe I won't be the same musician as I always wanted...

What can I do? **Can you give me some advices?**"

When I interviewed for this position, the Sr. Database Engineer tested me on simple Q's like what is an index(name the diff kinds), what is a P.Key/F.Key, and had me do a simple left join query to join 2 tables. Since joining the job this week, he assigned me a lengthy course dealing with stronger SQL Database Optimization concepts like multithreading, locking, concurrency, transactions, etc. You know, the stuff dealing with optimizing DB performance and so on. Mind you i've never seen nor dealt with this stuff before, and I kinda got thrown into it head-first, with no knowledge of the syntax that accompanies with it, nor how everything flows/connects. On top of this material, the Directorial manager wants me to learn like 2 of their business platforms that that all the analysts use at the company on a daily basis to deal with tickets/reports/etc. And he's asked a couple times this week when i'd be able to sit down with the other analysts to get acquainted with those...

I honestly feel overwhelmed and concerned that I won't meet their expectations. It seems like a huge disparity from being interviewed on very basic sql concepts and jumping straight into advanced SQL techniques and practices, none of which i'm familiar with. The Sr DB boss that I report to, has been out all week and he comes back after this holiday weekend so i'll see what is in store for me once he's back...but I feel like i'm out of my element here and i'm struggling to understand all these concepts while not even having practiced/implemented any of them yet at all.

How would I approach this situation? I know i'll be studying this weekend in prep for the coming week with my boss returning..but I honestly don't know how i'm going to pick up on all of this as quickly as it seems like i'll need to...

I'm currently doing my bachelor's in CS (final year) in India . However I've always wanted to pursue higher education in the US. Considering that I have already written my GRE (161Q 157V) and performed other required steps as well.

However, I talked to a senior of mine who worked in India for 3 years went on to do his master's from SBU and now is currently working at a FANG company. He suggested that although finding jobs for freshers is not impossible, it is hard and that if he were in my position he would work for a couple of years before doing masters.

Can you guys on the ground level please let me know if it's realistic for freshers to find a job? I'll be attending a University in NY, California or Seattle if it makes a difference.

Additional info:
I currently have a offer from a startup with a compensation of around 10k usd, which is actually quite good for a fresher in India.

I will be having around 8 months of internship experience in India, and will probably be able to do atleast a 3 month internship while studying in US.

The way student visas works is that, after graduating I will have 90 days to find a job. If I'm not able to do that I will need to return to my home country.

If you just want the situation, look further down:

I graduated from college in 2015 and have had four jobs since then (not including my college research and internships during that time). First one was at a marketing agency, where I interned originally, as a Full Stack Dev that later went bankrupt (I left once the signs were evident). Then, I went to a startup where the abusive management long hours, low salary, along with homophobic jokes from management (I was in the closet at the time) caused me to leave. I received an offer to become a contractor at a retailer in their architecture team, developing proof-of-concept applications, managing interns because of the manager's busy schedule, and bringing in some domain-specific knowledge to help their team during a modernization campaign. 6 months later, new management ended the campaign, rendering my services no longer necessary. They interviewed me to come back in a full-time role, but then their CTO and top VPs left, so there was a question of whether the position would still receive approval.

The agency I was with was able to reassign me to a major manufacturing company as a Senior Software Engineer, under a contract to hire agreement. The position has its ups and downs: there is strong work-life balance, a really great manager, high hourly rate with merit increases yearly, and I still get the architecture component by serving on a design authority group for a major product. I also have to deal with significantly old technologies, inflated processes and pointless meetings, slow innovation, and a business team that focuses on new feature development over hardening and tech debt - some of the code is still 20+ years old and has not been touched since.

The Situation:

Okay, so now that you know about me, now more about my situation. This morning, we had our usual stand-ups. Our scrum master also serves as our manager's right-hand, helping manage day-to-day items and taking over when he travels - which he is this week. She joins our huddle and, unusually, offers to go first.

Suddenly, the words come out: ""I have an organizational update for everyone. Our top management is calling for a staff reduction. Sadly, this means we will need to say goodbye to A and B from this group. Please gather any information you need from them before end of day tomorrow."" Both A and B are contractors like myself. We continue the standup as usual. Shortly after all the teams have had stand-ups, an email goes out telling everyone that contractor C (another Scrum group) will also be leaving the following day. Needless to say, I'm scared shitless and email my agency rep asking for more information on these layoffs.

I work during the day and head out early for a doctor's appointment. While in the waiting room, my phone goes off with a e-mail from Scrum Master. It says ""The communication this morning about a staff reduction was false. If you have told anyone that is not included in this email, please tell them there was confusion. A, B, and C will continue their contracts with us. I'll be in conference room DCF to chat from this time to this time if you want to talk further."" I communicated this to the agency rep, who told me they became concerned with my first communication as they were unaware of anything going on and glad it was just a mistake. They said my company is good with communicating these details to the agencies that serve it. I was out of the office when Scrum Master was in the conference room. 

So, it looks like a mistake was made. However, this begs the question about what is going on behind the scenes and that some discussion on staff reduction took place. I'm feeling a bit uneasy and concerned. Should I be? I'm hoping more experienced people in this area can perhaps provide some insight or advice. 

Regardless, this has given me a wake-up call to blow off the dust from my personal website and resume and start casually looking for opportunities. I also suddenly lost my parent's insurance so I now have $400 a month in Obamacare to pay, so that's adding onto things - agency only offers minimal ACA coverage.

Thank you so much!"

cxbdbr,3,2019-08-29,I really hate my co-worker's sense of entitlement and how she tries to put me down.,throwawaysonataferry,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/cxbdbr/i_really_hate_my_coworkers_sense_of_entitlement/,"So I'm a Software Engineering intern and so is this co-worker.  I have a little amount of programming experience that I gained from doing projects outside of my academic schooling (meaning that in my free time, I pursued these projects of my own volition).  I don't have a degree in engineering or computer science.  In contrast, my co-worker has a total of 5 years of schooling, 4 for her undergrad in Computer engineering and 2 years for her masters in Computer Engineering.  She complains about how competitive other students are in her program and how no one wants to work together.  She also complained to me about how she, as an international student, couldn't get a job in the U.S. because many of the companies wouldn't pay for her sponsorship.  That's her problem, whatever.  But then, she starts telling me ""you're really lucky to get this internship"" and says it not just once, but twice.  She was also very nosy about my work, constantly asking me about what I was doing.  When I asked her back what she was working on, she was very tight-lipped and I only heard about the details when she talked about it during our meetings with our manager.    When the manager talks to me to get my update on my work, he sometimes throws out a compliment or two.  She overhears that and goes to me to say ""wow you must've done a really good job"" sarcastically.  She also goes home early by 2 hours, not having the will or desire to stay to work, always complaining about how she's bored and should've became a historian.  Shes very passive-aggressive in her actions.  She has an attitude problem.  She also smells bad.  Good luck getting a job with those problems if you're going to treat your co-workers that way."
cxbg1s,1,2019-08-29,Interviewing advice,fishster9prime_AK,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cxbg1s/interviewing_advice/,"I am a civil engineering major in my second year. I have worked for several small construction companies in the past, and my main interest is construction and contracting.

I will be applying for my first internship in a month at a job fair on campus. This is a job I really want to get.  It is the closest internship to my home, it is in my preferred field, and it is a company I would like to work for after I graduate. Also, my brother has worked for them in the same position I will be in, and may be working for them in the future.

My issue is, I have very little experience interviewing for jobs. All the positions I have held have been obtained from family, friends, or mutual acquaintances. I have never had to interview, or even submit a resume. The one time I did a interview was for a student desk job. The interview was over the phone, and I was traveling at the time. Needless to say, I was very awkward, blew the interview, and did not get the job. This was huge blow to my confidence and self esteem, and I began to question my ability to even get a job.

So my question is, how can I prepare for this interview? I believe my resume is very good, considering my construction experience, and my brother will recommend me for the job, so the only thing standing in my way is a successful interview."

cxcdrw,2,2019-08-30,Is it really worth it to ask for opportunities in person?,Raeleenah,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cxcdrw/is_it_really_worth_it_to_ask_for_opportunities_in/,"A lot of motivated people seem to claim I don't want something bad enough because I won't ask for jobs and internships and such in person. I always doubted their thought process because almost everything is online. But, I am still jobless after 3 months so I tried it out three times.

The first I applied online but went to a workshop where they spoke to their potential clients about their methods. I called ahead of time and the receptionist enthusiastically said it was okay for me to come even though I just wanted a job so I could see what they stand for. I listened attentively, took notes, then quietly left after thank the speaker at the end so actual clients could as their questions. I would have been great for the job, if anything I was overqualified. I didn't even get a call.

Then the second two I basically just went to the hospitals in a business casual outfit and asked if they had internships or, at the very least, some volunteer work I could do. Each one had me speak to people in different departments so in total I talked to 6 people in 5 different buildings. All of them except one said to look online then dismissed me, but that one seemed to be overly optimistic and didn't really call the shots for what I was looking for. I admit I got some extra info along with ""it is online, you can apply there"" like my chances of actually getting in (which were all relatively low for the internships). 

So what I guess I am really asking is this: is putting in the effort to make them see your face before they know anything about you really worth it? Am I just going to the wrong people? Or the wrong setting? Am I supposed to make it feel more casual? I've noticed that this comment comes from older people, is it just that times have changed and they are going on past experiences? What am I supposed to be doing to make this a successful career move??"

My day to day tasks consist of performing internal audit reviews, cleaning up audit directory for inactive users, directing some outsource calls(HCL), performing QA test on pre-leased updates/patches on Sharepoints, O365, Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Anyone can suggest or point a direction where I should take to be employed/received an offer before graduation?

I know some people got into Oracle Business Development Consultant position, but from what I heard it is a gimmick job with low pay/long hour/cut throat sales objectives to make. Had a few friends got in without any previous internship/experiences or technical background.

I am attending the University of Georgia with a 3.2 GPA. I know it is low, and the only folks who get good jobs are people who love talking and are working as advisory/associates at the Big4. I do not think with my GPA I would be able even to get a first-round interview. These state schools are so competitive. So many students with very few positions open every semester. The school is great at advertising how great this major is. I know the professors here don't even have professional experiences. I was too far deep into the program to change to CS. I love doing internal audit/security related work. I just do not know how to properly set up my resume to make it sounds enticing to HR. Any suggestions will be helpful.

I would say I'm decently knowledgeable with C++, I know how to use it, and would know how to tackle most problems with it. I'm also somewhat familiar with C#, python, and SQL.

My problem right now is I just don't know where to go from here. This might sound weird but I don't really know how some software would utilize something like C++ (or whatever coding language) as it's backbone. I've played around with Unity and I understand how it utilizes C#. However, for something like web development or say, just creating an app, I have no idea how to connect programming and making it actually useful. It seems like there is so much surrounding knowledge depending on which project I would want to take on. What should I familiarize myself with in order to create projects with the least amount of obstacles (aside from the actual coding) that would impress employers?

I want to pursue my bachelors but I was hoping I'd at least land an internship or something by now. Any advice?"

I'm currently considering applying in the USA. For that I need to take the SAT  which is not available in my city, so I will have to take it in another city(which can be a bit expensive because of the SAT costs and the costs of transportation and the hotel room). So I'm asking you if I stand any chance of being accepted in order to decide if I will take the SAT or not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics:**  international, white, female, from a country in Europe.

**Income:** I need a lot of financial aid. I don't think I could pay more than $2-3k per year(even that would be a lot)

**Intended Major(s):** Computer Science

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1500+ SAT (if taken), 700+ Math II and Physics (if taken) 

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** I'm not sure how to translate it to american GPA, but if 4.0 is the maximum score, then my GPA is probably 4.0/4.0. Rank: 1 out of \~400.

I'm going to a public high school, but it's one of the best in the country.

**Coursework:** we don't have that there. We can only choose to have 50% of our classes in English, which is what I chose.

**Awards:** National Math Olympiad, National Physics Olympiad, Regional Debate Competition, Regional French Olympiad (french is not my first language), Merit award from the mayor. 

**Extracurriculars:** Internship at an IT company, published research in a sub field of computer science, 300+ hours of volunteering (including long term projects about orphans and the environment), extra classes at the local university, unusual foreign language(not french) course, math summer camps, different coding projects/exercises, online courses about computer science and I've read a lot of books related to computer science.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Very good LORs and let's assume that my essays are well written and interesting.

**Schools: Amherst, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, MIT** (main ones),

Stanford, Columbia, Williams, Cornell, Upenn (low chances probably since they are not need blind)

I will also apply in the UK (since I'm from the EU): **Oxford**

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot! I'm really worried and I need to make a decision about applying soon.

Also, do you think it would be a better idea/easier for me to go to grad school in the USA?"
cxft0l,7,2019-08-30,TIFU by holding on to a fake memory,Blubber28,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cxft0l/tifu_by_holding_on_to_a_fake_memory/,"The summer holidays are coming to an end in most countries, if they haven't already. Same here in The Netherlands; schools started last monday. Not for me however, since this year I'll be doing an internship that starts on the 9th September, which means I have two extra weeks. I've done almost all the paperwork but had to do some final documents today.

For those wondering, I will be doing an internship with bacterial profiling at the Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam. At least, so I thought... Usually the punchline comes at the end, but not this time: I had a fake memory that my internship was in Rotterdam, while in reality, it's in Utrecht.

When I sent my application e-mail to the professor in Utrecht, I mentioned it was in Utrecht. When I filled in the forms necessary, the forms said it was for the University of Utrecht. The e-mail adress ends with .uu (which of course means University of Utrecht). Everything was filled in for Utrecht. Except in my head, somewhere along the way, it switched to the Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam. Even last monday when I mentioned to friends from school I was gonna be in Rotterdam with that professor, and someone mentioned they had the exact same professor in Utrecht, there were no alarm bells, just me thinking ""huh, funny coincidence."" This is a problem because 1. It's quite embarassing because I told everyone it was gonna be in Rotterdam and, the most inconventient one, 2. Utrecht is quite a bit further away. Rotterdam is a little less than an hour by train for me, and Utrecht is 1:45h... 

I saw it this morning when filling in the last documents and I was absolutely shocked. I was so sure it was in Rotterdam. My mind was kinda blown XD.

So right now I'm browsing rooms available in the general Utrecht area, but it's very likely the first week is gonna be tough...

This is just my normal account since my friends are gonna find out one way or another, might as well give up anonimity to them.

TL;DR: I had a fake memory and thought that my internship is in another city. Now I've got to find a room soon in order to not get sleep deprivation..."

This summer I was an intern at a company and really clicked with someone in another department I have interest in. He was extremely helpful and took quite a bit of time out of his day to meet with me and help me. 

The company encourages employees to reach out to people across departments and have coffee chats, and when I initiated, he was very receptive and offered to help me if I want to enter his department. After our initial interaction we met up a few more times, for about an hour each time. I bring this up to show that this individual has already spent considerable time meeting and talking to me within the context of work. I was always careful to try to respect his time, gave him the option of corresponding via email but he opted for in person meetings and didn’t mine if they went significantly over in terms of time we scheduled. 

Now, I’m returning to school for my final year. I was offered a job at the company and have more questions regarding his department. He also offered to give me advice on some academic research and I’d like to hear more about that. 

Since I left the internship we’ve corresponded on LinkedIn and he has responded to inquiries promptly, but I am going to be back in the vicinity of the office and I would prefer to speak in person. I’m hesitant to reach out because 1) he has been so helpful I’d hate for him to feel obligated or unable to say no 2) he never formally agreed to be my mentor. It’s just been casual help 3) I don’t want to seem presumptuous in asking him for his free time now that wouldn’t be built into the work day. 

How could I ask him to meet up in person without him feeling uncomfortable or forced into saying yes or simply not replying? How do I know if I have the right to ask?

TL;DR 
How do you ask someone to meet with you outside of work without pressuring them or coming across as too forward?"

cxgrcb,1,2019-08-30,Study abroad or no,BackupAccountIncase,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cxgrcb/study_abroad_or_no/,"I LOVE where I go to college. I love the campus, my friends and roommates, the sports, everything. But this is my junior year, and I feel like I’m running out of time to take advantage of studying abroad. There’s a few reasons that really tear me both ways. 

I’d love to go to Ireland, and there’s a program that allows me to take courses in Dublin. From there I would love to take trips to England and maybe other parts of Europe. This has been something I’ve wanted to do almost forever. Luckily enough a friend of mine is most likely going to Ireland too to study abroad, which would be great.

But there’s also some things that really make it hard. I have a girlfriend of 2 years. She encourages me to take this opportunity, but it would feel weird just leaving her For so long. Secondly, I’d miss out on so many spring semester memories at school. I turn 21 in March, baseball and basketball season, and spring partys. I also have a great group of roommates, and it just feels weird going “hey btw I’m actually only gonna be here half the year see ya”. Lastly, I worry that I’m going to miss out on the opportunity to expand and grow into my career. We have so many great opportunities here to get involved and network with important people. I unfortunately havnt had an internship yet, and I’m hoping to get one this summer. But I feel like being out of the country this spring might limit my ability to get one. 

All in all, I’m pretty torn, and I’m not sure how long I have to make this decision. To anyone who’s gone/considered going abroad, and has maybe had similar feelings as I have, what did you do?"

I am a senior at a top public university, and my background is primarily in accounting. I have prior tax internship experience at a Big Four company. For accounting internships, interviewers typically conduct behavioral interviews so I have mainly prepped for  behavioral-based questions for last 3 years of my college recruiting.

I'm a 19yo F in my 2nd year of college (medicine). So far it's been alright. Many days were a struggle because of my social anxiety but I got through somehow. 

I recently joined an event in a medical student association (IFMSA if anyone heard about it). I was the photographer. I chose something lowkey so I won't have to really interact with anyone or present or any of that. I don't even know why I signed up I was just bored but little did I know how amazing that event would be and how much of an impact it would leave on me. I made many friends whom I still talk to and meet in other events. 

Everything sounds great so far so what could've possibly went wrong? Well, it's me. I always hesitate before joining any event and start overthinking everything that could go wrong. I usually just run away and convince myself I don't really want to go but I immediately regret that decision. Every time I see pictures of the event posted and see those familiar faces having fun and moving ahead while I'm stuck in the same place. They keep moving farther and farther away while I'm stuck in the same spot until they become out of reach. 

I know that I'm going to regret this later. I want to leave a mark in this place but at this rate I'm going to be forgotten. Especially now that I'm still young and have a lot of time in my hands. I feel like if I don't use this time now I will be filled with regret in the future because once I start my clinical phase I'll be consumed with studies. Students that have graduated and are doing their internships or specialty still attend those events because they left a mark that big on them and I can totally understand why but because of my social anxiety I don't think I'll ever reach that stage.

I can't even do a simple stupid presentation or public speech I feel so pathetic and weak. I hate it so much but I'm too scared to even try. I'm too scared of embarrassing myself and I just overthink how others would see me if that happens. I hate this stupid anxiety and irrational fear. I tried therapy once but I got anxiety during my sessions and I couldn't open up so I made up some excuse to my therapist and never went back. I feel really pathetic and stupid.

I don't think I can even be a good doctor if I carry on like this. I've fallen in a deep hole of depression and self pity/hate and this is the only place I currently feel comfortable to let it all out."

What should I do?",6c796e78,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cxi6zt/im_17_and_here_is_a_tldr_about_my_situation_what/,"*Edit: I hope the ""Advice Received"" flair doesn't stop people from commenting, I didn't know that it would appear*

---

I'm 17, live in Germany and graduated from school in 2018 and started an ""Ausbildung"" (Education and training) in companies IT department where I learned a little java and also started to get my first ever pay checks. **And** i also got my first ever girlfriend at the same - until now, life was pretty amazing 

However, I fucked up my Job by not being able to differentiate school from work, I also wasn't learning fast enough, and they thought that I wasn't fit for the job. 4 months later (December) they kicked me out.

---

**January -** I was given the option to still go to school for one month on a ""voluntary basis"" 

---

**February -** Searching for a new company that would hire me, obviously no one wanted someone like me

---

**March -** This is the part where the relationship with my girlfriend went to shit, im guessing she lost attraction to me since she didn't want to come over anymore and also stopped being as affectionate towards me.

This together with me losing my job really stared to affect my mental health. I was always the optimistic person in my friend group.. I never thought that I would ever get depressed. I didn't feel any kind of motivation to do the things I used to love.

And going out with your friends on your birthday while feeling dark and alone is really an intense experience.

---

**April -** Life wasn't really at its peak right now, so imagine my reaction when my girlfriend told me that she accidentally cheated on me. hahah and the best part is that I didn't even break up with her.

---

**May -** She stared to treat me like shit, so I finally broke up with her. She was very sad (ans so was I) but 2 weeks later at a friend's birthday party she made out with a random guy in front of me. So yeah, that was also pretty cool

---

**June -** basically just recovering from the breakup, and still being unemployed. 

---

**July until now -** Life actually improved, im not depressed anymore and I'm back to my normal and cheerful self, im still unemployed but im planing to work on that, I also started to work out every day I can.

When I talked to a friend (22yo) he told me that he could get me an internship at a very good software development company (that he currently works at), if I made a portfolio site in 2 weeks, so for 2 weeks I taught myself web development and finished the site (if anyone wants to take a look, [here is the link](https://isthisgood.netlify.com/))

I thought I did an alright job, but he thought it was terrible and told me the site ""missed the mark"". Hearing that almost took me back to the time when I was laying in my bed stopping myself from crying.

Yesterday he gave me another chance, and told me if I could make fully functioning site that he has a written down concept for, so a giant project, that he could get me an internship.

**So my question now is:**

- what are your thoughts on all of this (I feel kind of alone with all of this so heading just your thoughts would be **incredibly** helpful)

- what should I do? Should I try applying to another company for an intern ship or should I do this big project?

---

*also, for some reason im also a little glad everything happened, because I learned a lot at a pretty young age, maybe in the future, I'll even be able to help someone in the same situation.*

Northrop Grumman Hiring Boom,Jumbo_Banana_Peels,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cxilkl/want_a_job_northrop_grumman_hiring_boom/,"Hey everyone, I'm an Electrical Engineer at Northrop Grumman and I am helping the Director of Hardware Engineering for my region recruit candidates for the next year. We are looking to hire over 5,000 people over the next year, and I figured r/EngineeringStudents would be a great source for potential candidates as I used to be a part of this community myself. I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible, so I'm sorry for any excess in length.

For anyone who is not familiar with Northrop Grumman, we are one of the top defense contractors in the nation that provide solutions to a myriad of customers, but mainly United States DoD. This was my first job out of school, and I must say that this company is such a pleasure to work at. You work on really cool, state-of-the-art technology, your managers give you work that you want to progress into as an engineer (I've been working here for 5 months and am already designing my own digital circuit), and the executive level genuinely cares about and invests back into their employees (all executives have open door policies, and I have good relationships with several of them). Northrop Grumman is a place you will just genuinely enjoy working at, from the benefits to the material to the company culture, it's just a big team environment here and it feels like a professional family who you know will have your back.

So if you're a Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Computer Engineer, Software Engineer, or Computer Science major graduating in December 2019 or May 2020 please send me a PM. Please don't be afraid to contact me if you think your GPA is too low or if you don't have any internship experience, like I said we are looking to interview anyone and everyone who we think would be a good fit for the hardware roles that we have open all across the country. So if you want to work for one of the top defense contractors in the nation, and still rapidly growing into the best, contact me and I will forward your resume along to upper management.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers everyone, and good luck this semester!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Everyone who has messaged me, I will get to them as soon as I can. Currently at work right now but slowly but surely replying to everyone. Thanks

EDIT 2: Anyone who I have replied to or am replying to or am going to reply to via PM, please follow up with me via the email I sent you. I promise I will get to everyone, I just have over 300 messages so it will take a little bit of time. Please send me your resume and/or any questions to the email I linked you to in the PM. Thanks everyone

EDIT 3: Just got through all the chat messages, I'm going to get to the other 256 private messages over the weekend. Please be patient, I promise I'll get to you! Thanks everyone"

I graduated with a 3.47 GPA (3.8 major gpa) and the field I want to go into is something that has to do with my degree, operations management. I fell in love with the path as it has just resonated with me for some reason ever since I took that first class. So I've been looking for and applying to jobs like business process analytics, supply chain management, shipping logistics, six sigma, quality control/assurance, inventory analysis, etc etc. 

During college I didn't manage to get any relevant internships because I just got rejected from all of them, generally without even an interview. Out of college, the same thing has been happening for the last 9 months, being systematically rejected from every job and internship without an interview, maybe due to my resume itself being unimpressive compared to similar individuals my age with relevant experience. 

Currently I have a six sigma yellow belt certification with ASQ, good foundational skills in Excel, SQL and Python/Pandas for data analytics, and matplotlib and bokeh for data visualization. I'm willing to learn anything else that I need on my own time to do well in a position. I live in NYC, and would prefer to stay, however at the end of the day I'm not too picky on where I work, though if I can stay in NYC I don't mind a far below average salary since I would be living with my parents in an easily accessible neighborhood. It's approaching a year since my graduation and I'm getting really nervous about becoming stagnant and not part of the workforce, so any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I can't achieve job security as a software engineer and need help fixing it.,nojobsecurityswe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cxk51d/i_have_an_unusual_career_problem_i_cant_achieve/,"Hi, I'm a 37 year old software developer that got his start in this career at age 25. I only get hired with low-ball offers. I'm paid so low because any companies that provide average salary, benefits and vacation time, you know the standard stuff, reject me. And nowadays it's only for part-time work. I can't maintain job security in one of the hottest professional fields in the country and want to know which strategies to take to fix this. 

People with similarly humble starts of low salaries etc. usually go on to make $100k a few jobs later but not me. 12 years and several jobs later I am barely cracking $30 an hour as a 1099, and even then it's only for part time work. Over the years, my time being employed has been reduced to a trickle. I spend more time being out of a job than in a job. Also I have zero liquid assets.

And I also build projects to keep my skills current. But for what? I still cannot get any good offers. I am just burned out for doing more projects and interview practice and more projects at the moment. 

I've acquired many tech skills over the years but seem to be getting nowhere with my career. When I get my resume reviewed or mock interviewed by peers, they conclude that I'm still a junior developer.

I don't work too much on Leetcode problems because it's not needed for the majority of Midwest developer jobs.

Despite my income situation, I'm not homeless. My mom's currently taking me in to live with her. 

In my first three years I was living by myself, able to rent my own apartment then it went to shit when I lost my job two years later and went down a long job search that ended me going to just some part-time freelance thing.

If I cannot even maintain job security in software engineering, am I just simply being too lazy? Do I have a wrong attitude towards being a responsible adult?

I have decided on three options:

* Do something, whatever it is, to fill some important skills gaps that can help someone like who is downtrodden but is facing competition from more confident candidates who are not downtrodden because they didn't experience what I did. Maybe find a company that doesn't mind that you are ""ten years a junior"" and focuses on your pragmatic motives, which is to make money to become self-sufficient and grow in your career.

* Join one of the Indian consulting firms like Infosys or TCS since they seem to hire any warm bodies with little relevant experience, and stay there for a year or two to save up some money, pay off debts and use it as a stepping stone for a more substantial job. I'd rather get paid consistently, even if it's still below average, than go many months of no work and then a few months of work repeatedly.

* The nuclear option, return to college. I know that my degree *shouldn't* matter for an experienced developer, but I also know that [path dependence is a real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence) and decisions I made in school or early career might still be affecting me today, even if past circumstances are no longer relevant. The goal here is to major in CS, take classes, get references from professors and whatever else it takes those students do that get great internships at top places, and then have that internship convert to a full-time offer upon graduation. 

For some, the self-guided route to that goal makes more sense, but I find it hard when I cannot talk to anyone. For me it's easier if I had a framework and real-life community already in place, and college education gives me that framework."

So I’m a CS undergrad who is doing a second Bachelor’s in CS. My original degree was in Economics, but I realized that I have no interest or future with that major so I reenrolled in school pretty much right after graduation. I just finished my university’s Data Structure course and am now starting to do personal learning/projects to list on my resume to try to land an internship for summer 2020. Im learning HTML/CSS/JS right now and my plan is to make very simple websites as personal projects using those three, then reading coding books to practice for interviews. However, as I look at others’ resumes, I’m seeing that most people (many of whom have landed big 4 internships) dont even know HTML/CSS/JS. I have difficulty in understanding their project descriptions and am confused how you have projects outside of frontend webdev. I’m also more interested in algorithms than design so I feel that following the footsteps of those people may be better for me. So I guess my question is, where do I go from here? Am I doing the right thing in creating very simple, nonfunctional websites with HTML/CSS/JS for my resume? Or should I explore backend more, and if so, how do I even do projects? Also, a bit off topic, but id appreciate any advice on how to manage my time in terms of projects vs interview prep as someone who has not done both and is trying to start applying September (latest October).

**Research:**

* Research with a local professor on the impact of stock buybacks on the market (intentionally ambiguous). Most likely will result in a research paper; at the very least we will send one in for peer review.
* Conducting basic research with another local professor about AI in business (intentionally ambiguous again) about which we might publish SOMETHING, not sure how much will be done by application season, if any.
* Above project is an extension of the “research” I did for my county laureate program, in which you basically research a topic all year, write a long paper, and present your analysis in the auditorium to a panel of judges and whoever wants to come (it’s not for a class or anything, just to be clear).

**Summer Activities:**

* University of Houston Bauer College of Business EXPLORE Energy and Sustainability Camp - a one week all-inclusive camp/competition with &lt;5% acceptance rate. Summer before 12th grade.
* Every summer between high school grades I’ve taken at least one online course semester, as well as done sports (like XC or basketball offseason training).
* Summer before 11th and 12th grade I am working for my dad’s law firm as a typical paid intern. I also somewhat work throughout the year but my hours are very minimal.

&amp;#x200B;

**LOR (which should I use?):**

* Maybe the DECA Advisor/Entrepreneurship Coordinator/former business teacher at my school. Never had her as a teacher though (even though she taught at my school until junior year) so can I still use her as a teacher recommendation? She is still our DECA advisor.
* Maybe the professor I am doing the buyback research with.
* Maybe my APCSP teacher (11th grade). He was the advisor for my laureate research essay and the teacher contact for the app challenge.
* Maybe my APUSH teacher (11th grade). She's the NHS advisor.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Info:**

* Somewhat competitive public high school
* Somewhat started a business (maybe more of a small unofficial nonprofit?) that has a website, a couple hundred monthly users, and won the app challenge thing. It’s focused around mental health and school specifically in my county so should I / how should I include this on my applications? Basically it’s a glorified grade calculator (but my county’s weird with grades). Maybe not even a glorified one lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So... what are my general chances to be accepted to Stanford if I apply REA? Whether or not I apply REA is up to a couple factors, so also please let me know my chances if I apply RD.

Also, what part(s) of my application should I try to improve most in the little time I have?

Thank you!

Edit: Does ROTC have any admissions clout? Like if I'm accepted for a full Army ROTC scholarship there, will that affect my admissions chances at all? Big thanks to anyone with information on this!"

I was initially going to apply to UIUC for CS and then just put econ for my second choice major (even though I probably wouldnt go for econ) until I saw that that they have CS + Econ. I have both CS and Econ related EC's and wanted to know if applying to CS+Econ will give me a higher chance of getting in. The reason im asking is because I know programs like Penn's M&amp;T and Berkeley's MET are extremely competitive and there is not a lot of info regarding UIUC's CS + Econ Program that I can find. So I want to know if CS + Econ is harder to get into vs regular CS.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as far as majoring in CS+ Econ, how would this degree look to an employeer. Would it be looked at as a Bachelors in CS or what? Would I still gain the skills to be an employable software engineer and be able to get software engineering internships over my summers? Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Is CS + Econ easier to get into than pure CS and will CS+ Econ still allow me the same opportunities as CS majors"

Fucked up on year and extended it to get an internship. I’m now only taking 1 class to get my computer science degree. However, instead of graduating this semester, I decided to add classes for Spring 2020. Now, I finalized my decision to graduate Fall 2020.

If I’m being completely honest, I like school and like learning. I am in no hurry to leave and start forever at a career so soon. I wanted to take a gap year but thought I’d be doing barely anything until next hiring season.

Is it reasonable to take another semester and instead graduate Fall 2020? I started my computer science degree rather late at Spring 2016 basically. I’ll be 25 by the time I get my first job with one really good internship under my belt and a minor in Chinese and Economics.

Any thoughts? I might want to travel this summer.

Took first one fall 2018 and second spring 2019. Found out I was pretty good at it so I decided to switch majors. Took Data structures and algorithm design over 2019 summer. Now all that is left to do is cram the remaining computer related classes into my senior year. I will be able to graduate on time but I'm concerned about where this will leave me in my search for an internship. Ideally, I would love an internship spring 2020 so I can use it for credits but I don't feel qualified. I've only  taken taken 3 computer classes and I changed my major late in the game. Looking at internship requirements depresses me since I've never even heard of most of these languages, much less am proficient at them. I don't even have any projects mostly because I'm not at that level yet and I don't even know what a ""proper"" project would entail. My resume is so bleak. All I have is unrelated random summer jobs, nothing that would indicate to an employer I know anything about computer science and programming. Any advice on what to do would be appreciated. How do I apply for internships when I have nothing to show for myself ? How do I even pass interview questions when I've only taken three classes? I'm afraid if I wait until the fall semester is over and I have more knowledge all the summer internships will be taken up by then.

cxpxdc,0,2019-08-30,Not sure if I can sue for wrongful termination due to hearsay (California),cookofthesea,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxpxdc/not_sure_if_i_can_sue_for_wrongful_termination/,"I just got fired from my job. Basically, due to hearsay. Another co-worker had told my boss about two incidents, none of which were true. The other kicker is that when these two incidents allegedly happened, was three weeks ago, so why was it not brought up immediately if I was going to be terminated? 

Trouble began about a month ago. My co-worker who I became good friends with, suddenly, out of the blue, started being very cold towards me, not talking to me, etc. So that made me sad at work and I had tried to figure out what I did and couldn't get anything out of her, so I gave up, but I was sad, and maybe that was evident at work that I was sad. 

About a week later, I got a security notification and saw someone in my house that I didn't recognize. My boyfriend had someone over and didn't tell me and I couldn't see my boyfriend in the frame which is why I thought that I had an emergency and stepped outside to make a phone call to my parents to have them go to my house but then also to my boyfriend to ask him if he was home. This took less than 10 minutes. 

The next day, I had to step out to make a 2 minute phone call because I forgot to turn something off in the house so I went out the office for two minutes because I wanted to call my boyfriend to see if he was home to unplug it. My boss comes to my desk and asks if everything is okay because he thinks I had been ""distracted"" and ""in and out of the office a lot lately."" I explained to him that I just had some issues come up and needed to step out to make a call to resolve it. He said it was fine but appreciated a heads up and I said sure thing and apologized. 10 minutes later, he has e-mailed everyone in the office with an office policy, focusing on phone usage. 

He goes on vacation for a week after that and then two days after he is back, he asks me for a ""quarterly performance review."" Not thinking much of it, I went into it not expecting him to say that he felt like I had been ""distracted for three weeks"" and up until ""recently"" he had been satisfied by my work performance but he wanted to make sure everything was okay and gave me the chance to explain myself. He said he had noticed I was on an ipad and my phone. I explained to him that no, it hasn't been three weeks of being distracted, it was ONE day and that I use my ipad to check footage IF there is a notification, but I apologized and said that I wasn't using my ipad to play games or not do anything at work, and if I checked it would be really brief, one or two seconds just to see and then stowed away in my bag, out of sight, but, I said I would stop altogether if that's what he wanted, and I abided that. He did ask if anything else was wrong and I mentioned my co-worker acting cold towards me and it made me uncomfortable. 

Since he talked to me about my performance, I worked doubly hard to show him I wasn't messing around and busted my ass to impress him and even worked into lunch just to finish up something. This was just shy of two weeks ago that I had a performance review. I had been e-mailing him at the end of each day what I had accomplished, was asking questions and I really thought that I was showing him my worth and he seemed satisfied with the work I was doing. 

But then today, he randomly calls me into his office, after being all cheery and friendly with me, and I think that he just wanted to ask me a question but told me that ""based off of what he had heard he came to the decision that it would be best if we parted ways."" 

He said that my co-worker (the one who was cold towards me) told him that: 

-I let an intern go home early one day when he went home early 

-I left for a doctor's appointment ""hours early"" when he was out of town and didn't tell him 

Both of the statements are false: 

The intern asked if she could leave early and I told her, I personally don't care BUT that she would have to ask someone else who wasn't there, so I said ""ehhh I dunno."" I told my boss this and he said ""it doesn't matter."" 

I don't recall leaving ""hours early"" for a doctor's appointment when he was out of town. Honestly, he is out of town a lot so it's hard to remember when he won't give me the date and time that I allegedly did this, but both ""events"" happened THREE WEEKS AGO. I'm not going to remember much from that long ago, but in regards to doctor's appointments, if I do them during work hours (he didn't give us personal time) I would work through lunch, take the latest appointment possible and then leave an hour early since we get an hour for lunch, so the time was made up. So even if I DID leave early for something, I know I would have skipped my lunch and made up the time and told him what I was doing, but he maintains I didn't tell anyone. 

I asked him, why was this not brought up immediately after you were told this happened? That it was unfair to wait three weeks to get to a point where people can't remember details to set things straight then and give me a chance to explain myself/improve if I really did do those things, and he didn't even give me and answer and then he went on to tell me that he had the performance review and gave me a chance...but then he backtracked and said that it wasn't necessarily the quality of my work that I was being terminated and kept focusing on the two lies my co-worker told him. 


I reminded him that I had mentioned that particular co-worker was cold towards me and seemed upset at me for reasons unknown, so I got the feeling she lied and he and my supervisor said, ""well, we'll talk to her too and if we have to fire her we will."" But honestly, why would she tell them the truth? She got me fired, and so admitting to lying about that would only get her fired. Plus, her being fired is not going to give me my job back, (at this point I wouldn't want it back). What good does talking to her now, do me, if they already made their decision?

The thing is, he didn't even bother to discuss these supposed incidents with me before firing me/giving me a chance to fix it or improve. If he wanted to fire me over those two false incidents, why not do it immediately rather than bring it up three weeks later as he is firing me when the context is lost? 

My work was good, and all of our work was done online, so there are timestamps of me submitting work, so wouldn't that be proof I completed work? 

So, is this a wrongful termination case since he fired me over two lies a co-worker told? And if so, what are my next steps in fighting this?"
cxr0xn,16,2019-08-30,What did i gain from my unpaid internship,abducool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cxr0xn/what_did_i_gain_from_my_unpaid_internship/,"I recently graduated (Bachelors of Science in CS) from College in Boston due to some family  and health issues i was pretty late to job searching that time we had a startup fair in our campus .During the fair i met with many companies owners but one company owner showed interest and scheduled a date for my interview.

I visited the company and was impressed by what there were doing and tech team were really nice. After the interview owner told me that since they are a startup internship its going to be unpaid internship and if i proved myself he would hire me. I told him that i would get back to him after a week considering i had no job offers and informed the owner that i will start internship.

During the two months of Internship i was basically part of the QA team  assisting them .Since the Manager who was supposed to give me the access to Codebase was under medical leave . After Manager was back from his leave he gave me access to the code base and setting up the environment since setup (README file) was 5 years old took me another 3-4 weeks during this time since most of API libraries were outdated and i had to research compatible libraries for My OS  since the README had only instructions for  MAC . i am not going to complain about the Dev's majority of them used mac and they tried their best to help me.

At  the beginning of the third month of the internship  i scheduled a meeting with the manager to ask him if he could assign me some front end/back -end related .He assigned me and other intern a  project to work that would get us familiar with front and back end framework that company uses . We finished that project up in two weeks and after that we were assigned the task of  fixing few small front end related works but i requested that i wanted to get some experience working on Back end too .Manager said i could work with an other dev on their project he just told me to check with the developers.

When i was checking with the developers most of them said they were finishing up a project or where working on something that was complex . But there two developers who always acted like they were interested in having work along with them and told me they would get back to me but they never did. At end of internship period the owner said he would let me know if he would hire me ? Last week  he told me that he cannot hire me because he felt that i need to contributed more to Dev team . I was really pissed off because how could  i make any meaningful contribution when the Developers were ignoring my every attempt to work with them /putting me down and i just quit my internship today.

This Whole experience just made me realized that i was basically brought in to assist the QA team and how f \*\*\*\*\*\* exploitative startup company's are .I didn't gain anything from internship other than exposure too web technologies the part that has me most depressed is how my mentor's throughout this internship was people in QA team and i had no interaction with manager other than some awkward hello's or small talk.

Note: I know this is my fault for staying this long when i could have just left when there were not assigning me any development work . But i just had some believe that after some time they would probably assign me and i really wanted exposure to startup work environment ."
cxr29c,1,2019-08-30,"Not sure whether I should wait for the job response, or go back home to start my Master's in a few days.",bayolentez,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cxr29c/not_sure_whether_i_should_wait_for_the_job/,"Sorry this is a bit lengthy. I'm just so unsure and uncertain on what I should do because everything is so last minute due to unexpected events. Here's some background info:

 I am an engineer that graduated from schooling last year. I was able to get a job working for a small company last October, and I moved away from my home city that is 10 hours drive away for this role. I got this job through my professor at the University that I did one of my internships with, and he had also taught me. With that being said, we have gotten to know each other well, and we have a good relationship with each other. You can pretty much say were friends.

During my months of working for this company, I realized that it is not in a good spot and that I needed to look for a new job soon. After months and months (started in January 2019) of applying, I had no luck of getting any offers. Fast forward to earlier this month, I've chatted with my old friend/professor about potentially doing a Master's for him. As I previously said, I've worked with his research group during one of my coop/internships, so I am familiar with his work. He told me all of the cool projects that I would get the chance to work on. I got excited so I took him on the deal and initiated my Master's application in early-August to start this coming Fall semester (September 2019). Mind you, he had to pull some strings to be able to let me start in September because I applied late. But I also had to do my due diligence in order to get the application process going. Anyways, so we were all set and ready. It was perfect too because I was going on vacation from Aug 15 to 30th to use up my vacation days at work, and then plan my drive and move back to my hometown right after and get ready for school to start on Sept 3 (next Tuesday)

Then suddenly, a company I applied for back in June got back to me saying they wanted to interview me (at this time it was mid-August). I had to refresh my memory about the company and the role. Looking at the position again, it got me excited because it's one of my dream job and it's very technical as well, which is what I like. The HR recruiter wanted to schedule an informal 30-minute phone interview with me. So I did. At this time, I havent told my professor yet about it because it's just an informal interview and I am not sure if I am going to move further in their hiring process. I wasn't getting my hopes up just from previous experience during the times I was applying. So we scheduled it on Aug 12 (Monday). During this call, I made known to him about my travelling plans from Aug 15 to 30th. The HR and I chatted and I talked about my credentials. He has really expressed his appreciation of my skills, and that his team liked my resume and experience, and how it is a really good fit for their company. So after the call, he got back to his team, and they immediately asked my if I was available to do a skype interview. They normally do F2F interviews for anything past the 1st round, but due to my travel plans (and the fact that they're a 4-hour drive away from my current city), skype interview had to make do. To me, this seems like they really want to get to know me and chat with me, and I feel like I have a good chance in this role. So I scheduled a skype interview with them on Aug 14th (the day before I travel). Again, I feel like it went really well, and they said they'll get back to me if they want to proceed further with me.

At this point, I made my professor known about this unexpected prospect. I told him because I respect him, and I want to keep him in the loop because of all the things he did to help me get my Master's application process going. He's pretty chill about it so he just told me keep him posted. So I did. While this was happening, I was also ensuring that I didnt have any loose ends on my part for the Master's application. I haven't told the company yet about my Master's application because that wasn't really final until I started the application for it, which happened after the 2nd skype interview.

In the middle of my vacation, the company reached out to me saying they want to invite me for a 3rd round of interview. We scheduled it and this happened via skype again on Aug 27th (Tuesday). Again, I think it went really well. At the end of the interview, I told them about this prospect of mine about starting my Master's. I told them that I gave my two-weeks notice at the company pretty much just after 2nd skype interview after I started my Master's application. I told them that I got the letter offer from the University to start on Sept 3rd (This coming Tuesday, AKA in less than 4 days). I explained to them that resigning felt like the perfect timing because I am just coming back from vacation (so I'm using up my vacation days), my rent ends on Aug 31st (tomorrow), and school starts in September. Again, this was my plan all along before I got the unexpected job interview. It was all set in stone (or so I thought) when I started my Master's application.

After I let the company know about the Master's, they said they'll get back to me on Friday (today), which they haven't yet. Also, I sent them an email yesterday morning explaining to them the urgency of my situation. And I just sent an email to my professor about this whole situation as well just to keep him in the loop. Yesterday I packed all my things, and loaded about 95% of it into my car today. Right now, I'm sitting on my bed typing this as I am slightly getting worried about this whole situation. I move tomorrow and I don't know if I am moving back to my home city (10-hr drive) or to the new job (4-hour drive). They're in opposite directions from each other, so it'll be around a 14-hr drive if I decided to go to one and then move to the other. Another problem is that it's the long weekend where I am from (Monday is a holiday), so they might take longer to respond.

I've been considering my options and talking with my family/ landlords if I don't hear back from them today/tomorrow. My landlords are Godsend and are super nice. They're willing to let me stay until Sunday morning (Sept 1st). They would let me stay longer, but the new tenant moves in that day too. I'm fine with waiting out a few days here for company's response, BUT the problem is school starts next Tuesday! And I havent enrolled in courses yet because I am not able to register them on my schedule (probably because I havent accepted the offer yet). I want to get back home ASAP because it's a long drive, and I have to unpack, and I have to get my ducks aligned for school in less than 4 days! Again, if it wasn't for the school situation, I'd just stay at some friend's house here while I wait for the company's response. Worst case scenario is I drive back to my home city early Sunday morning and enrol for courses, then later find out that I get the job offer later during the week, which I would gladly accept. I'd drop my courses and drive back because this is a good job with a good company, and I see myself  professionally growing with them in the coming years. It would just be the most exhausting route to take. 

I really want to call the company tomorrow and get an answer. But first of all, I dont think anyone will be there to answer because it's a long weekend. And secondly, I dont feel right about pressuring them due to my situation. Like I already told them about it during the interview, and I sent them an email yesterday as well. Honestly, I dont even know what to do or ask from you fellow redditors. I feel just so stuck right now, and that I'm totally flying by the seat of my pants. I'm not like this at all and I plan all my things in my personal life, work, career, etc. ahead of time. It was just something unexpected came up."
cxr7mj,0,2019-08-30,CS Direct Admit first quarter schedule/other general advice,ahmetmakesyouwet,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/cxr7mj/cs_direct_admit_first_quarter_scheduleother/,"Hey guys,

I'm an incoming freshman DA and I am worried about the schedule I am registered for currently; I tried reaching out to a cs advisor but they haven't gotten back to me yet. I'd really appreciate any advice you have for me.

The classes I'm registered for now are CSE 311, 351, and 391, with a 7 credit Landscape Architecture FIG. The total credit amount is 16, but it will be 18 after adding the DA Seminar class. I'm concerned that this schedule would be very time-consuming. I know a lot of students take two CSE classes a quarter but 17 credits are quite intimidating. I was hoping to take a lighter course load for this fall quarter in order to get used to UW and the dorms, make new friends and have fun, focus on trying to get an internship, etc. What do you guys think? 

I am leaning towards dropping 351 and 391 and adding an easier general education class, but I wanted to know if I'd be alright for the future and not too overwhelmed with CSE classes. For reference, I am bringing in 105 total credits from running start/AP and would like to graduate in three years. I need 23 more credits of general education, need to take Phys 122 and Math 308, and then the rest are CSE classes. I want to balance how many CSE courses I take so that I don't take too many or too little in the 3rd year. I want to fill out the rest of my classes with electives in business, statistics, economics, communications, etc. to help me in the industry. I am unsure of double majoring/minoring. 

Finally, I want to get a new laptop for school and was interested in the difference between MacBooks and Windows laptops for CSE. Would MacBooks be easier? I heard they might because they are Unix machines but I have no knowledge about that. Do most students prefer one over another? I would love to buy a MacBook pro but they are very expensive, even with the student discount right now. Would a premium laptop be helpful with the nice computer labs in the CS buildings?

Do you guys have any other general advice for new computer science students?

Thanks

edit: I will be taking 18 credits because the DA seminar is 2 credits. So I definitely will have to change something."

www.techinternship.io

It’s a web app for helping students find summer 2020 tech internships. It has a database of hundreds of open internships with links directly to them. It also has a feature where you can subscribe to a company so that if their internships aren’t yet released you can get an email as soon as they are released.

The other main purpose of the app is for keeping track and organized with everywhere you’ve already applied and are interviewing at. It has a nice interface for each internship where you can select what stage you’re at, and see what the interview process looks like for that specific internship, and what percentages of applicants get to which stage. And then an excel like page with overviews of all your applications. It also has a lot of data like location and compensation (some of it is user generated and will grow as more people hopefully use it.)

I hope it saves people a lot of time in applying to internships!"

I did mostly automation for a bunch of teams within the Cloud and I made a bunch of dashboards for some other infrastructure horizontal teams at my company and long story short I was offered a position as a junior Cloud engineer with 1st year plan is to learn as much as I can. We use Microsoft Azure mostly and are migrating towards a multi cloud model with GCP because of a request from IA. 

I have been going through the Microsoft Azure training models and learning the fundamentals. I have also found a great website called katacoda.com with lots of hands on labs. I started with Docker and Kubernetes there. And I have a training in Terraform which is where I was told my first year will mostly be spent in.

Which leaves me to my request of this post! I want to get tips, advice and map a general road map for the next couple years. What should I learn, what are some good tips in this role. I want to know how to impress my company and succeed in my role as best I can! Any advice, insights or words of wisdom would be immensely appreciated!

I think this subreddit knows more about tech jobs than cscareers does about finance jobs, but please let me know if there are any subs that this would be better suited to. 

Background:

Education:
UK tier 2 University, 4 year Physics degree (I've completed all my courses and will graduate in January), masters thesis was programming orientated - applying physics principles to finance 

Experience:
Just completed an IBD M&amp;A SA at a tier 2 London BB (full time offer received), debt advisory internship and broking internships last summer, experience working for a very small student startup on algo trading over the past year, tech internship at a small software company year before, very strong extra curriculars. 

My full time IB offer is set to start next July, meaning I've got a year off now. Initially I had planned to travel for the year, but I've come to the realisation I'd like to use some of it to consider alternative career options and apply for jobs. I have also been considering taking a few months off to sit a GMAT to strengthen the academic side of my application and also make possible MBA applications in 4/5 years' time easier. 

Although I did enjoy the IB summer, I didn't feel like I was utilising my mathematical skills whatsoever and couldn't help but think I might be better suited elsewhere. I can manage the hours but they certainly aren't preferable, especially given the comp in junior London IB BB is by no means exceptional. 

The main career moves I am considering are:

Apply to T1 IB (off cycles or FT), 
Apply to some sort of quant role, Apply to tech, 
Entrepreneurship 

T1 IB apps seem obvious just because there isn't much reason not to if I'm going into IB. This would be with the intention of exiting after a few years. 

I really like the quant route but I'm not sure how I would stand in the application process. I think I've demonstrated a good range of skills (maths, programming, finance) although none of it is ""T1"" experience and from what I can tell these roles are extremely elitist, particularly in HFs. Also, although I have got a range of programming experience, a lot of it is not recent and I don't think I would fair well in an interview that focuses on it without a good amount of self learning. This is one of the main reasons why I'm not keener on pure tech - I have good python experience and a little bit of php and java but certainly not enough to do well in a programming test. That being said, the environment/comp/lifestyle of tech is certainly appealing over finance, and I think it would be a better utilisation of my skills.

Finally, I think starting your own business is one of the most inspirational things you can do - but feel like this is the riskiest career move and might be better to pursue a few years down the line. That being said, I could try and use this year to do something like that and then fall back on my BB offer depending on how it goes.

I'm interested in all of these careers and think I've got a good skillset - I'd really like some advice on how and where I can best use them, and also what my best strategy might be for the next year (plus if now is a sensible time to sit a GMAT). Probably more interested in quant/tech advice because I know what IB is like and that it is viable for me, but maybe not exactly what I want to do.

cxtico,5,2019-08-31,Internship as a senior with no experience,7thGrandDad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cxtico/internship_as_a_senior_with_no_experience/,"Title is pretty self explanatory. I'm a senior CS student (kinda, gotta take an extra semester cuz of some transfer credit stuff) and I need an internship 1, for my own professional development purposes 2. for my capstone. 

The issue that I'm having is that I'm not sure where to start. I only started CS in college (as opposed to most of my peers at school who've been doing this since high school). On top of being a student, I work full time to stay afloat financially, so I haven't had the time/energy to do any personal projects. My GPA is pretty low ~2.9 after a rough semester last fall (lotta bullshit between accuqaintances dying and losing friends over a girl). The class I tanked in most was computer architecture so my major GPA is even lower haha. 

I've asked advisors and professors for advice and they've said to ask my peers but I don't really have any close peer friends. I know it's stupid but I feel a little embarrassed asking ppl in my classes (mostly the year under me) whove had years of experience for advice on getting my first internship as a senior. 

I guess my biggest concerns are that I don't really know what resources to use, and that I'm worried about how much my shitty GPA is gonna limit my options. I come from a working class background and am beyond confident in my ability to thrive once I get into the workplace setting,  I'm just mainly worried about getting to the interview stage as a senior w now experience. 

Any pointers are greatly appreciated!"
cxtony,629,2019-08-31,Why does it seem like some CS YouTubers try a little too hard at grabbing attention? The click baiting is out of control..,eakjotsworld,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cxtony/why_does_it_seem_like_some_cs_youtubers_try_a/,"Sorry to rant, but I’ve been feeling this way since a couple months ago when I felt the need to subscribe to people in my intended career field and see how they go about their lives. From what I found, I became very disappointed. The state of computer science vlogging on YouTube is so unauthentic and goofy. And I want to make this clear before I go any further: this is not every YouTube channel. I actually came across a couple of accounts I liked, such as ForrestKnight.

What really grinds my gears are the insanely-titled, blown-up stories that make you feel stupid for clicking on it by the end of the video because you realize that they tricked you into clicking on the video then tried their best to keep your attention. Another thing I noticed about these guys is they hop to each other’s videos and they are even featured in the videos of brand new CS creators on YouTube. It’s almost like they recruit early just so they remain in the loop and look as sort of reference points for these newer creators, building a false credibility for themselves. 

Now... I know I’ve been saying “they” and “these guys” a lot without really referencing to any real examples so I’m going to link a few for those who haven’t noticed this in these videos yet.

Example 1: Click Bait
Joma Tech titles this video [Guy with 2.9 GPA now makes $300k as a SWE (Software Engineer)](https://youtu.be/YGflHj1SjA4).  The reason this one bugs me is because of the false impressions that it gives off. The thumbnail of the picture shows a young man, he supposedly did bad in school and now makes a shit ton of money... sounds like the same formula “Get Rich Quick” schemes use to attract people. 

Example 2: Making Babies
Clément Mihailescu is a perfect example as a clone of these guys. This guy started THREE MONTHS ago, beginning with videos talking about making $40k per month (featuring Tech Lead, who is a post by himself) and then how to get a SWE Internship (featuring Chris Jereza). He takes on the formula above by talking about how he learned programming in 6 months and got hired at Google, and then takes on what Tech Lead loves to do, which is talking about why he quit from some people’s dream jobs. 

My full-hearted hope is that instead of hopping into each others’ videos to share viewers, I have full faith that if these group of guys were to team up and create one channel of content, it would have potential to be a true and honest representation of a fun, lively representation of the SWE lifestyle. If it does fall into place this nice, I can only hope that the replacement is a better one."
cxtxea,0,2019-08-31,Internship communication issues. Some Coworkers treat me poorly for no reason. Stressing me out.,Smithyweather,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cxtxea/internship_communication_issues_some_coworkers/,"I want to preface this by saying that I’ve tried to change my thought process on this and forget about it, but it is upsetting me big time. I keep mulling it over and over. 

So, I had an Internship at my University. This is now over. Throughout the Internship I had a terrible communication with the other members.

Three of the members are dominating, talk incessantly, over me and always nominate themselves for the task. 

I think two of these people do not like me. Why? They talk over me, change the conversation when I am talking and never actually talk to me. At best they are indifferent to me. 

Also, at the end of the Internship my manager says to me that I need to improve my communication because they said that I don’t talk to them enough. BUT in reality, they barely ever acknowledge me when I am in the group and they themselves don’t talk to me. As in they don’t reach out to me at all.

So you know they’re playing a part in that.

So, we have an event at the end of this next week (that I have to travel to). The group chat is up and running. We’re back to the same nonsense where the two gals ignore me, talk over me and change the conversation.

I am at my wits end with this. I mentally cannot cope with it anymore! 

I am trying really hard to fit in socially, yet they exclude and ignore me FOR NO reason. 

I can’t cope with this anymore. I don’t have the skills to deal with it and it’s making me feel uncomfortable."
cxtzxf,7,2019-08-31,In need of career advice,universal_solder,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/cxtzxf/in_need_of_career_advice/,"I've been working as an ASIC designer at a startup for several years (&gt;5). This is my first professional job out of college and I generally enjoy the work and my coworkers. Working with systemverilog and most of the design process was a natural fit for me. It's an extremely demanding position though and I've been unhappy with how far away from my family and friends I am to work here. I would like to move closer to home but the company doesn't allow remote work and there are no hardware jobs of any kind or even low level software jobs anywhere close.

In my search I found a company just outside my hometown that recently posted an opening for an entry level Java position. I liked my Java courses in college but I haven't used it since then and I had never even heard of some of the skills that they're seeking. I have a very basic understanding of a few of the things on the list like HTML and SQL. I sent the link to a friend from college currently working in a nearly identical role to the one in the opening and he thinks it's worth it for me to pursue it. I also connected with someone I went to high school with who has been working in the IT department at this company since she was an intern and she also encouraged me to apply. 

I realize that it would be a big step backwards on my career path at this point but it looks like my only option for moving back home. I'm open to making the switch to software and based on the current outlook for hardware positions it may be the right long term choice anyway. I don't know anyone who has made a career change like this so I could use advice from other engineers who have or just have tips for starting out in software.

How should I present myself in my application in a way that won't make it one of the first ones tossed out over my lack of direct experience. The listing says none is required but fresh CE or CS grads are probably more appealing than I am due to my situation. How can I highlight my hardware skills in a way that would make them want to hire me? Has anyone made the switch from one side to the other in the middle of their career and how challenging was it to start over from the bottom? If I get an interview how should I be preparing? 

I've been struggling with this a lot so I would appreciate any advice I can get."

Embarrassed myself because I couldn't think straight. Worried about what he thinks of me now and that he won't talk to me anymore.**

I feel like crying rn and just need to vent. I'm currently doing an internship with a newspaper and I'm staying in a hotel nearby. I just went out to get lunch and was heading back to my room, when I heard someone calling my name and I turned and it was my colleague in the hotel cafe.

I should say now that I'm 21f and have been shy my whole life. I've never been formally diagnosed with social anxiety, but  I have quite a few symptoms related to it. For example, blush way too easily, feel very nervous speaking in front of group of people, even my friends sometimes, find it hard to talk to new people, and sometimes 'go blank' when put on the spot or caught off guard in conversation. It got worse at university because I was meeting new people. I think the people in the office have (unfortunately) caught on to the fact I'm pretty shy and quiet (and this is exacerbated by the fact they're all older than me) but it's okay for the most part because i can kind of get away with it.

Anyway I have a bit of a crush on the colleague who was in the cafe (not that I would ever pursue anything) so I'm already shyer around him than the rest. He's attractive and very very nice and makes and effort to talk to me if we see each other.

I didn't expect to see him at all in the hotel so already I felt a bit caught off guard. I went over and said hi and he offered me a coffee. I felt so awkward though I immediately declined (much too quickly, because I was nervous) and he kind of just gave me a blank look (probably thinking 'what could she possibly have to do' because it's the weekend). I immediately felt like kicking myself because I actually am doing nothing and should've just sat and chatted with him. There was an awkward silence and I kind of just floundered, wringing my hands, and didn't give any excuse, just said something like 'oh yeah I'm living in this hotel' as if that was an explanation. Then he asked me for how much longer I was staying with the newspaper to do the internship and I kid you not my mind went completely blank and it literally took my five seconds of uhm-ing and ah-ing to answer him :/ I could literally see him staring at me like 'what the fuck'. He asked me with section i was working with and thankfully took charge of the convo and started talking animatedly about things (most of which went in one ear and out the other because I was still mentally kicking myself). Anyway then at the next awkward silence I said I hope he enjoys his lunch and that I would see him soon and I left.

I just feel so awful because a) I haven't embarrassed myself that badly in front of someone in a while and b) I hope it didn't come across like i didn't want to have coffee with him because ironically I did and I hope he wasn't offended. The thing is, I've talked to him before and been way calmer because I anticipated the conversation and so could prepare for it. He must have been surprised to see me in such an awkward state and it sucks. I feel like now he won't really bother to make conversation with me. He was also probably thinking 'wow, she's an intern with all my expertise at her disposal and she declines?!' - like he could've actually taught me a lot and I know he's had an interesting career and ughhh I feel so shit right now. Also, I hope he didn't catch on that I have a crush on him, that would be horrid :(

But what I want to know is if there is anything I should be learning OUTSIDE of school that is finance related. 

I am unsure of what exactly I'd like to do as a career in finance, but I am leaning on financial analyst for now. So I hear a lot about Python which I have never used. But I do think it is something I should be getting SUPER familiar with.

Those kinds of things are what I am asking about. So excel, python and what other programming languages (I think they are called languages?) should I be focusing on and learning on my downtime to maximize my value?

Is there anything else not mentioned I should be studying also?"

My question is, should I include the job with nonprofit on my resume? Will employers look down on it since it's with a conservative group? I feel like leaving it off would look a bit odd since I would have a summer gap of no employment."

I am a Computer Science undergrad (Graduating May, 2020) and was planning to apply for Fall 2020 intake with a mediocre profile (some research experience without any publications, two mini projects pertaining to two relevant Internships and an overall 3.2 GPA). But a few days back I got a semester long research Internship offer for spring 2020 at one of the Harvard University's research labs. And that has got me hanging between these three options:

1) If I should wait till I complete this internship and then apply for spring 2021.

2) If I should try to find another research Internship for fall 2020 and then apply for Fall 2021.

3) If I should go on with my MS applications right now and indicate about the research Internship I'm gonna do in spring 2020.

Questions:

a) From the above options, if I go with the 1st or 2nd option would that be enough for a PhD application, or even an MS application?

b) With regards to second option, is it possible to find a research Internship after you have already graduated?"
cxxw5c,0,2019-08-31,MS in ME better than the industry experience after graduating?,theverby,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/cxxw5c/ms_in_me_better_than_the_industry_experience/,"I’m currently in my senior year of Mechanical Engineering. A couple of days ago, I received an offer for graduate school that is essentially a full-ride. Surprisingly enough, I’ve been fairly hesitant to say yes to it. I’m having trouble weighing out the pros and cons because I’ve been lucky and grateful to have amazing opportunities with undergrad research as well as internships. I’ve read a lot of opinions online. Both sides (master’s or no master’s) seem to weigh out equally. After reading what some people think, it almost sounds like getting the master’s would almost hold me back. I wanted to give you all an idea of where I’m at experience-wise and gauge whether or not a masters will truly give me an edge (if any) when I enter the full-time workforce. 

On the work side:
During my undergrad, I’ve been working part time during the school year and full time over the summers gaining industry experience through R&amp;D, mechanical design, software implementation, and controls engineering. I couldn’t have asked for a better internship for those reasons, because my experience has not only been specialized in many cases, but spanned across all fields of engineering. Having these opportunities has already set me apart from my undergrad colleagues, and has given me the opportunity to help others learn techniques I did through my experience. 

On the research side:
Since my sophomore year of undergrad, I have been doing additive manufacturing research in FDM and WAAM processes. This involved development mainly in the realms of electrical systems and coding as well as examining micro structures and various materials testing. The master’s offer I have would be a continuation of this where I would be doing primarily microscopy-related tasks, which would likely place my specialty in the realm of materials engineering. 

On the hobby side:
There’s also a lot of projects I do outside of work/school. A lot of them involve mechanical design and hobbyist-level controls such as Arduino’s and Raspberry Pi’s.

In the end, I’m held up on whether or not a master’s would be worth it. I’m all about trying to stand out on resumes because I know how the field is extremely populated with bachelor’s degrees. I also understand that with a lot of what I do, there are other people just like me who have the same types of experiences. I am definitely torn on the decision since it is a full-ride offer and it would only take an extra year of school. There’s definitely just a lot to weigh out. I appreciate any insight to this as well as your time to respond! Thanks."

I would like to eventually go into artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning (which I plan to go to graduate school for). I know that one of the very important stepping stones to getting into a CS career post-college are internships during college. My question is, when should I start looking into them? Like I said, I'm a sophomore, and have little programming experience beyond a few months of self-teaching python (Just finally met my pre-reqs to start my CS program this year). Everything I can find is about how to start looking for internships, and where to look (Career fairs is what I see as the best place?) but nothing on when is too early in your education to start looking. Should I start now for an internship this coming summer? Should I wait until I am more experienced and can actually... do things?

Here is my profile:


Ethnicity: Indian


Income: $125k - estimate since my parents have changed jobs a lot so I can't give a very accurate figure, this is ballpark estimate.


SAT: 1350 [700 reading, 650 math -rip-] (hoping to raise it in October, but just use this score)


GPA : 3.8 (my school uses a weird system so I'm not sure if this is weighted or not, my score is like a 93.28). Coupled with moving a lot it's kind of wonky.


SAT subject test: : ( bio-670 [oof], taking others in november )

(Edit) - course rigor:


Freshman year: 
Introduction to physical science,  english, geography, honors geometry, physical education,  band, spanish 1

Sophomore year: honors chem, honors bio, physical education (moved to NY, so it was required), spanish 2, english, algebra 2


Junior year: AP bio, AP euro, AP lang, finance, honors precalc/trig, health (required), computer science, spanish 3


Senior year: AP chem, AP gov, AP lit, AP calc, spanish 4, senior project (school newspaper)


EC's: so, moving a lot, I have very inconsistent extracurriculars, but this is a list of them:


Freshman (new school): school band (played the trumpet, still do), temple volunteer, helped start a political discussion club, but it wasnt really a formal club and it doesn't reall exist anymore so I am NOT including it in my app.


Sophomore year (new school): internship at an ambulette company (that's it sophomore year)


Junior year (new school): Nothing. It's a long story, but it was rough (details not important), so I didn't have any clubs or jobs junior year


Senior year: Model UN, debate, starting a school newspaper as a part of my senior project, and a young Democrats club.


(Edit): over the summer I've started volunteering at my local library, but we only set up for events, so I did one event in the summer, and I'm doing some in the fall and winter.


My LOR's: I've only been at my school for one full year, not including senior year, but I feel like they will give me pretty good reccomendations. I'm not one to overestimate, in fact I think it's best to brace for the worst, but my optimistic guess is a 7-8/10


Essay: I'm working on it, and honestly I'm not going to grade it because its subjective, as all things are.


Note: things I did despite my moves - playing the trumpet, learning languages, running in my freetime (lost about 50lb). 


I also shadowed an er physician (I'm not sure I'll include that just because I've heard it doesn't look good to colleges, but it was the only thing I was able to manage, what with the moving and all.)


I intend to major in political science. Please reverse chance me for some reach/match/safeties in preferably the northern United States. North meaning states from the northeast to the midwest to the northwest.



I would like a school which isnt very focused on partying or sports, but not completely focused on academics and isn't competitive to the point of being filled with ""gunners"". While I appreciate genuine interest in academics, I would like a good social environment (not a big fan of sororities or fraternities but don't mind them as long as they don't have a dominating presence on campus). Not a big party person, but I don't want a completely dead campus. I want a school that has access to places like musuems or shops (like groceries or shopping centers in case I needed something and didn't want to go to the bookstore). A nice campus would be ideal, but I would rather have a school with a good campus and great academics rather than a school with an amazing campus and mediocre academics.


Schools I have in mind: UCONN (in state), st lawrence u, st olaf, and kenyon. that's about it lol.


I know that these schools are very different, but 
I felt in place when I looked at them. I stayed at uconn for a week through a scholarship I won for the summer program (not a full ride, but it made it a hell of a lot more affordable, otherwise I wouldn't of even considered it lol)
(should I include that in my awards section?)


Any advice would be appreciated."

cy0r5w,5,2019-08-31,I didn't get the return offer and I couldn't sort out my feeling yet,asfsdasd,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cy0r5w/i_didnt_get_the_return_offer_and_i_couldnt_sort/,"Yeah, I got the email today saying that I would not get the next summer internship during Italy trip.

Well, I couldn't sort out my feeling yet, and to be fair, I didn't try. I didn't want to get distraught, but now that I am in my bed, I want to share my feeling.

It's hard to tell. I can't say what I'm feeling now. There are so many emotions going on my head, at least when thinking of it (I am trying to focus on my trip.)

There is an anger. Not toward the company I was working with, but more toward myself. It was a big corporation, it was the chance to start my career on high hill. Then, I screwed the opportunity. The fact that I could have done better, and the fact that I didn't meet company requirement hit me hard.

There is also betrayal with my company. I should say that they did everything they can do for me. Assign me with an awesome boss and I could work on cool projects. However, they weren't relevant to my major. When I apply for the internship, they simply stated that they are looking for chem e and chem majors. Well, I thought when I got the offer, my projects would be like that. It wasn't. It was in April, pretty late to look for another internship. And I was stuck with non-chem e internship. It felt like betrayal especially when they didn't offer me return offer. I know I shouldn't feel in that way. I should be still glad that I got that chance. It just hurts my feeling. I left my school early to do the internship.I took my final during the internship. I even had to finish my homework over there. It just...feels like they got me a crappy position as if they had no interest in me even from the beginning.

I guess I'm the one to blame. I thought I had it...My boss told me that it's pretty likely. I did fine the final presentation. The HR told me that I have a drive, and other positive feedbacks. Even after that presentation, my boss had a chance to leave a top review about me to those people in charge of recruiting (he confirmed me that mine was almost top)...

I guess that slacked me in the last week. I mean, in hind sight, I knew there is a decent chance not to get the return offer. I knew my weakness. I wasn't still ready for the professional level. I was unorganized. I was late for one hour at last day (I don't think HR knew about it and it was the first time, but still...) My work was good. I had a drive and want to get better myself. However, I was not ready.

I replied to HR requesting what I was lacking. It was a good experience with bitterness. I guess, it's time to look for another internship.

Sorry for spelling and renting. I'm a bit tipsy now."

My 24th birthday was two weeks ago from tomorrow and I celebrated it without anyone close to me. It was at that moment that I realized I needed to step up and actively combat my anxiety for my life to have any chance of improving. Still, I have a few fears:

* I only have one close friend irl at the moment and therefore, I joined two meetup groups in an attempt to establish better connections. Ostensibly, I’m a nerd and a gamer, but I fear that my potential new friends will judge me for not getting to play many games growing up and will think I’m practically an old man for my age. 

* I’m starting to date via apps such as OKCupid and did manage to secure one. I’m scared my dates will judge me for having relatively little sexual experience. (I’ve only had sex a few times) I’m also scared they will judge me for my living situation (more on that below).
* I live with my parents still, since my line of work is hard to break into (Writing). I did secure an internship from home recently, which has the potential to move into full time work. I’m terrified that a potential partner will judge me for this.
* I’ve come to the realization this last year that I’m fairly happy with only a close friend or two, yet I believe even an introvert should get out of the house semi-regularly. Can I balance both the loner and involved lifestyles?
* I’m trying to lose a lot of weight and so far have succeeded. I cut out all junk food, soda, alcohol and fried foods and don’t eat meat three days a week. I exercise by jogging 5 miles a day.
* I’ve re-entered therapy, since it’s extremely beneficial to my well-being.

Am I too old to gain a decent social life, partner and job? I mentally feel like a teenager rather than a 24 year old man and fear that I can’t make up for lost time. My only choice is to try now to secure a possibly better future, yet I fear I’ll fail in spite of my efforts. Any success stories?

Also, if you are suffering from anxiety of any sort, get it treated. The earlier you do so, the easier your life will be, potentially. Please don’t wait until you’re my age."

As i am unemployed right now he told me to send them an email to apply for a job, he told me they use a custom framework they have for .NET, so in order to get myself accepted what do i have to learn as a minimum? I did some C# desktop apps programming during my course and i know how to consume and create REST APIs in other technologies (php/java) i never did so in C# or .NET though, i asked my friend if i should look up a tutorial on how to create and consume REST APIs using ASP.NET but he said ASP .NET is far from what they do/use.
So i'm asking for advice from experienced developers on what should i learn? he might be wrong about what he said because we're both unexperienced since we're recent grads.

cy297y,5,2019-08-31,[Advice Request] How do you write cover letters for resumes and what do you say in interviews when you are dealing with issues of self-esteem from AP parenting?,EiffelNothing,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/cy297y/advice_request_how_do_you_write_cover_letters_for/,"TL;DR: How do you ""sell yourself"" to a potential employer when your self esteem is literally 0 and you don't see anything you ever did right or can sell? Do you tell them about you having struggle with this at all?

&amp;nbsp;

I've browsed this subreddit for a while, hoping to find some answers, but I guess this problem is quite specific so I wasn't surprised not find anything.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, I'm a lawyer, or basically recent law graduate with a practicing certificate in Australia. I guess it's not so recent anymore cuz that's about 5 months ago and I can't get a job as a Junior Lawyer or anything. Thing is, as an international under a Visa and with no self-esteem, what do you even say at interviews or write a good cover letter for your applications? My results aren't golden, but it's not bad, and I have casual experience with a law firm (partner is friend of my father's, surprise surprise).   

&amp;nbsp;

Everywhere I go, white people are like ""Aww, you're fine!"", ""You can't expect to know everything on the 1st try!!"" Like it seriously blew my mind. It was here when I started to slowly come out of my shell, but while I'm well-meaning and I hated studying law, I found a new breath of fresh air while working under an internship as part of the course in a real law firm. I'm socially awkward and being kind is about all I can ""brag"" on, and that itself feels so fucking wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm nearing 30. Yes. Nearing 30. And I can't seem to get a job because of my near-hikikomorism due to AP-grade parenting. All studies, no part-time job, cannot hang out with classmates, no birthday parties if it clashes with your tuition classes. Constantly told me I'm weird and ""why aren't you normal"", and tells me (still) I look like shit (although there's not many ways to look like shit in a suit and tie), never allowed me to take chances and now they wonder why I don't have any confidence, self-esteem, any friends or desire to make friends, why won't I go out, why I don't know how to find a job and why doesn't every fucking employer want this qualified lawyer?

&amp;nbsp;
  
I know at a certain age, vent and rage becomes whiny and cringey, but I'm pouring my heart out here. I literally wake up with no motivation in a foreign country other than to wait for death. I tried putting in applications and at a lot of the time I stop too because I simply cannot think to sell myself. I don't know how to and I simply don't think I have enough stories to tell these boomer partners who want me to play chess for fun and went to hell and back after slaying Satan and to be totally devoid of sorrow to be worthy of a job in his firm. I can't think of the last time I dared to like or love or have passion in anything.  

&amp;nbsp;

I simply don't have anything left, or I can't see anything I have in my pockets to sell. Self-esteem = 0 and if you don't have that even the bullshit you make up will sound untruthful. That, and I have to eventually pick up my parents' spam-calls and get passive-aggressived at and listen to them bring up people I do not know or care about on how they moved to my area in Australia or whatnot, like a stupid comparison thing that they never stopped doing. I am fortunately old enough to numb myself and just grunt at whatever they say but because I'm still under their financial support, I'll be lying if I say I'm not affected by all of this despite how cool I take it most of the time. After the calls (or before the calls), lately I get what I think are panic attacks (heart hurts, throbs, and a state of immense upset). I wake up and am so overwhelmed I can't get out of bed. I can take a lot of emotional hit but now I'm at a breaking point specifically with them.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be independent, and am ashamed to be continuously relying on parents on rent, but sometimes I don't even think there's anything to bothering to try anymore. I wake up with immense depression that I'm useless and can't do anything, while I actually CAN perform when I am actually put to work. I just don't have like a golden sun award that hangs on my head like a halo for anyone to say ""let's hire this person"".

&amp;nbsp;

To those who were in my shoes before me, what did you do?? Do you actually tell your interviewers that ""Oh it was difficult for me emotionally etc.?"" It's not a therapy session but I did overcome so much emotional turmoil to get to where I'm at!!

EDITS: Probably some typos and stuff from typing this in an emotional rush."
