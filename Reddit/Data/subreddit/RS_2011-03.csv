fw2bn,3,2011-03-02,Can someone give me some IT internship advice?,Lengull,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fw2bn/can_someone_give_me_some_it_internship_advice/,"So I'm a computer science student looking for an IT internship in the Charlotte, NC area.  Over February I've applied to eight different ones and only received one response back so far (it was a no).  I'm kind of nervous because I'm afraid this is going to inhibit on the plans I wanted to have come next summer...

I'm a sophomore currently and plan on studying abroad in Sweden next spring.  After my Spring 2012 semester is over I wanted to do some travelling across Europe for the summer.  I suppose there is still time to receive answers from the other companies I applied to, I guess I'm just freaking out because if I don't get an internship this summer and follow through with my plans for 2012 I wouldn't have completed an internship by graduation.

I was thinking of applying for a job at our student IT center this fall so I would at least have some sort of official background.  Would it really be the end of the world if I weren't able to get an internship or am I just freaking out?  

I've also been considering looking for smaller companies in Charlotte, but whenever I search online for IT internships it seems I can only find the major ones.  I'm afraid I've gotten past the point where it is too late to apply by now.

tl;dr  Sophomore in college unsure if he'll get an internship this summer, wanted to study abroad next summer - meaning he wouldn't be able to get a summer internship until after graduation."

fw1m8,15,2011-03-02,No professional references. ,jmn357,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fw1m8/no_professional_references/,"Hey there reddit,

So, as the title implies. I'm having an issue with ""professional references"" here.

I've been looking for a job for about a year now (graduated college last year) and today found out I have an interview tomorrow doing some part time tutoring work at a local learning center. 

They asked me to come down tomorrow for an interview (this was all left for me in a voicemail btw) around noon. They have my resume and cover letter, but they've also asked me to bring ""three professional references"".

Here is my problem. I really don't have any.

The last ""on the books"" jobs I worked were in high school (almost 5 years ago) and of those jobs one of them the store no longer exists and at the other one the manager is no longer there (he was fired for sexual harassment). 

The only other job I had was working at my familie's travel agency, but listing my mother as a reference seems like the worst idea ever. 

I didn't work during college except for the odd handiwork gig off of Craigslist or doing stuff like distributing flyers. So really I have no ""professional"" experience in that sense.

I didn't do an internship (I know, I know, I now realize how fucking stupid that was of me. My only defense was that I was undecided for awhile then picked a really generic major that I was good at: history). 

I know people say to put professors or volunteer work but frankly I haven't done any volunteer work, and as far as professors go, I never had any I was close to (I went to an incredibly large state school, so 95% of my classes had at least 150 people).

So I feel I'm stuck here. 

Do I just bite the bullet and tell them what I've told you?

Are they gonna laugh at me?

Dios mio Reddit.

[So this is how the interview went](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fwoa6/incredibly_unprofessional_interview_or_lack_there/).

fvm7o,1,2011-03-02,It's been a while since I felt this sincerely that suicide was a viable solution.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fvm7o/its_been_a_while_since_i_felt_this_sincerely_that/,"Normally I'd create a shell account so that this wouldn't be connected to my username. To be honest I'm past the point of caring. There won't be a Tl;Dr. 

I was born into poverty in BC to an alcoholic drug dealing wife beater and a woman who'd already had her self esteem destroyed by her father long before she married mine. They divorced when I was 4, just before my sister was born, but some one of my earliest memories remains hiding behind a stereo speaker watching him beat my mother black and blue in the living room.

My childhood was rife with anger management and attention issues. I ran away from school during recess in grade 1 and made it home without dying. I tormented my sister (already traumatized from court-ordered weekend visits with my father) to the point that she now (at 16) pretends she is a boy. My complete demon-childness lead me through numerous counsellors and, coupled with the tribulations of trying to raise 2 children on welfare alone, lead my mother to anorexia nervosa. We moved to a small town in the interior. I was expelled from school in grade 3 after breaking the nose of a student a grade below me, after a long year that saw me spending most of my time sitting in the hallway rather than in class. 

I was homeschooled till grade 7, which resulted in me knowing nothing about math and everything about history and the structure of society. During this time I managed to mature in some ways, but remained stuck in the mindset of an 8 year old in many others. When I re-entered public education I was a complete and utter mess with nearly zero social skills. As a result I was bullied to the point of a breakdown, at one point having nearly every male in my class surround me and pelt me with rocks. 

Highschool didn't get much better. I had few friends, and many of them were the kind of friends that only keep you around to mock you. My mother injured her back, but living in a small town she was socially ostracized and the doctors treated her as if she was simply suffering depression from being a ""Welfare Mom"" for 15 years. In an attempt to relieve crippling agony, she turned to alcohol. 

Unable to cope with the extreme bullying at school during the day, and coming home to an alcoholic mother at night, I started calling the cops on her out of spite. After two years of this my sister and I were put in foster care for several months while she underwent psychiatric evaluation. When we were returned to her care she went right back to blaming the families woes on my poor behavior throughout my life, and one day in grade 11 I simply couldn't take it any more. I left the house, unable to listen to her ranting, walked down to the river, and climbed a quarter of the way up a high tension power line. It was a sunday, everything was closed including the Police station. There was no one to talk to. I had every intention of killing myself that day. 

I found an old dump alongside the river. Ever since I first saw Raiders of the lost ark as a child, I wanted to be an archaeologist (I worked at the city museum the summer before, and the summer after this). Walking along the riverbank, I found a 1930's sprite bottle that had been cut out of the embankment, completely untouched by the ravages of time. To this day I'm very certain that if I hadn't found that bottle, I'd have gone all the way up to that tower and jumped onto the wires. 

Things got moderately better for a while. I graduated highschool, and moved to vancouver the day after I graduated to attend the Art Institute of Vancouver in an airheaded attempt to get a degree in video game design. I blew my small inheritance from my grandmother and 5K in student loans before I realized that I had no chance of paying the rest of the degree, let alone having the talent to get a job with it. I dropped out after 6 months. 

At this point, the depression returned. I was working at starbucks, making enough to pay the rent. I didn't buy groceries, subsisting off what I could take home from the pastry case every night. This was in January of 2009, and with everything that had gone downhill in my life I went a little crazy and firmly believed western civilization was collapsing. Many of my friends walked away from me at this point because of my crazed ramblings and general gloom. They didn't know I was contemplating suicide. 

One night I got out a meat cleaver and sat there, just looking at it, contemplating how efficient it would be if I tried to chop my own head off. Thankfully, I did not. 

I got an internship with a media startup a few months later, a job I hold to this day. It pays me well, I have stock options, I am putting money in the bank. I discovered St. Johns Wort in '10 and it made my depression, which had been deep for several years then, vanish completely. My life was, it seemed, on the upswing. 

But there was my family. My mothers family doctor was fired by the college of physicians for severe medical malpractice in 2009. My mother had no vehicle, and her back injury made it impossible to take a 5 hour greyhound ride, so seeking alternative care outside this town was impossible. As a result, she had not been listened to for 6 years (her injury was in 2003) and the pain she experienced persisted. Her doctor put her on a low-dosage version of morphine, the smallest dosage possible, and essentially just strung her along without ever doing anything, and then was fired. 

They recieved a settlement from an ongoing class action suit against my grandmothers employer (she died of asbestos related cancer in 2005) to the tune of 30K. This meant my mother was cut off social assistance, but we viewed it as a chance to finally try and get things cleared up and her life back on track. We purchased a vehicle, located a rental in Vancouver (the town went resort, and rents there were just as expensive as here) and moved her and my sister down here last summer, expecting to be able to find a doctor who would listen to her.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. Between the car and the move, my savings were drained to $0 and have only just regenerated. We've been unable to locate a physician who doesn't either look at her like she's crazy when she tells them whats wrong, or gets angry and accuse us of wasting their time to feed an addict. 

I went with her to a doctor tonight who told her that there could not possibly be anything wrong, refused to refer us to the spine specialist we asked for, and requested blood work and other generic items instead. My mothers morphine prescription, without which she can barely function, ran out at the end of December. Unfortunately, due to the volume of addicts of every creed in this city, even mentioning it has you instantly accused of being one (even with a pharmaceutical record of having been on it for 4 years, irrational to say the least). What boggled my mind was the doctor saying they weren't going to feed an addiction, and then writing a prescription for a faux-opiate twice as strong and 4 times more addictive than the morphine variate my mother has been taking. 

By this point, or if you've just skipped ahead, you're probobly wondering why this is in Suicide watch. Well, to be honest Reddit, I don't see much hope for my life, the life of my family, or society anymore. My mother can't get disability or welfare without a doctor, and no doctor will take the time to send her for imaging or refer her to a specialist. No walk in clinic will take you on or fill out the forms, and it is impossible to get a family MD in this city. Even if we could, nobody will listen. 

Which leaves me covering my own expenses, and those of my mother and sister. I'm 21. I can cover their rent for a month or two, but my savings are just starting to recover and they won't last long. One of my roommates is moving out at the end of the month and it's pretty hard to find replacements if the past is any indication, adding more burden to my finances. My sisters no help, she dropped out of school in grade 8 and is more concerned with sitting around smoking pot and being worthless than getting a job or going anywhere in life. Unemployment is high, nobody is going to hire a 16 year old girl who dresses like a thug.

I just don't see any solution to this, I really don't. I cannot, ethically or morally, let my mother and sister end up on the street, but I cannot keep them and myself afloat. I can't have them move in, welfare won't allow anyone in the household to earn income whilst you are on it so my mother couldn't apply. I tried an askreddit to see if any doctors in Vancouver would reply, going into detail about the injury, but instead just got a ton of people accusing me of trying to game the site for money or being a drug addict. That should have warned me."

I'm still in college majoring in CS and have one more year left.

My professor told us that even with just an Associate's and a CCNA we shouldn't have an issue finding a job. I find that a little off because every job posting I've seen (Monster.com and Dice.com) requires 3+ years of experience; although I did do a year and a half long internship as helpdesk before I switched into CS. 
I really enjoy CS and would like to do web applications, but the reality is that I love networking and security.

In foreign countries where employees are treated exponentially better, studies have shown they get just as much work done in fewer hours with less overall stress. These employees *want* to get their work done instead of feel like they're *forced* to get their work done.

So why is the only business goal in America to make money? Why not focus more on those actually making the company money? Higher quality employees will want to work for you and you can expect them to be more efficient, getting more work done in less time.

The exception seems to be small companies. I intern for a small software company and can take time off whenever for school, make my own hours, work on the tasks that I like, and enjoy benefits outside the normal range.

I have sent out numerous e-mails and phone calls to various companies of different sizes and responsibilities, ranging from Nintendo and Sony to Atlus and Aksys Games, to no avail.  Either I have yet to receive any information, or I have been given the runaround by the companies, starting over a week ago (so this isn't me being full of rage that no one has responded to my e-mail from 3 hours ago).  The only exception to this rule is Blizzard, who actually has an easily found portion of their website dedicated to something of this type.

Has anyone else here happened to find out any information on broadcast television licensing regarding video games?  I'm not 100% sure if it would matter, but our station is located in Wisconsin.  Any information would help as we are looking to do this within the next few months, and I feel as though we can actually do a decent job with it."
g1se7,2,2011-03-11,Hey Reddit: Help me out with a Job situation?,gr33nturt1e,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g1se7/hey_reddit_help_me_out_with_a_job_situation/,So i just recently got a job at ross but they only have me working 8 hours a week. it's pathetic and the money i get every two weeks is only enough to cover the cost of the gas i spend getting there and back every two weeks. I am going to school right now but only taking one class. I need to look for a second job while i continue to work at my current one but I don't like the idea of working with the public. I have only worked at a couple of other places and I can never hold a job for a year or more let alone 6 months. I go into a job thinking it will be fun and rewarding but it ends up being so shitty and almost not even worth it. I am going for computer engineering as my major and i am just looking for a part time job while i go to school full time so that i stay productive. I have been applying to a lot of places lately and most of them aren't willing to be flexible with my school schedule. I feel like i should quit my current job but some money is better then none at all. Where should i look for my second job? I was thinking a job agency. I would look for an internship but there are none whatsoever in my major where i live. I am sick of being with the bottom of the barrel jobs. I want to work somewhere that is a little more private like in an office for example. The only skills I have relate to customer service and computer software/hardware. I want a job that will give me at least 30 hours a week while i'm in school. 
g1nv2,6,2011-03-10,Help a potential transfer,[deleted],BostonU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/g1nv2/help_a_potential_transfer/,"Hey all,

I'm thinking of transferring to BU from Wesleyan, and I was hoping some of you fine folks would be able to answer a few of my burning questions about the school.

A little bit of background first: I went to Wesleyan dead-set on being an English major at a small liberal arts college in a suburban/semi-rural area. Now, I'm not so sure about any of that.

With the help of a great internship and a few film classes, I've become extremely interested in writing for the screen and the production of content for the Internet age. It looks like BU offers a progressive film program that suits my interests. My school has a film department, but it is very analytical and only offers a couple of production classes. It's not really what I'm looking for.

I've also come to decide that I miss having a big city at my feet. Middletown really does not offer much, and while there are things to do on campus at Wes, I do miss having plenty of restaurants, shops, a theater district, etc. close by.

Okay, here come the questions:

1. If anyone out there is in the film program, how is it? Could you describe it to someone who is used to a traditional, liberal arts course load? I really don't know much about it beyond what I've been able to read online, so I'd appreciate an insider's view of it.

2. I'm kind of a huge geek. I'm into comic books, video games, etc. Will I find people like me at BU, even as a transfer? I was lucky enough to find my niche early on at Wes, so I worry about having the same luck if I transfer.

3. In the same vein as the above question, I'm not much of a partier. Does the BU social scene revolve around parties, or are there people who prefer to go out to dinner/movies/theater/etc.?

Thanks for your help!"
g2dl9,69,2011-03-11,The house in Alabama,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g2dl9/the_house_in_alabama/,"This story takes place in Huntsville, Alabama in late 2004. My girlfriend at the time had moved down there for a semester for an internship doing social work for a low-income elementary school. She got the job through a family friend who also worked out a place for her to live while she was there.

It was a very old house occupied by one very old and cranky widow; I did not like the lady from the first time I met her and the house had kind of a creepy vibe to it. Everything was very old, old black-and-white photos on the wall, an old piano, old furniture and quilts, everything was just very... OLD.

The first night there I got in town late and slept in my lady friend's room with her (since the widow had already gone to bed, she was a conservative christian and was not happy about this). The next night I was to sleep in an upstairs guest bedroom across the hall from the widow. 

As soon as I put my stuff down and sat on the bed, something about the room just didn't feel right. This sounds very cliche, but it seemed to me like I wasn't alone in the room. I laid down and was having a hard time going to sleep because of this uneasy, paranoid feeling (which I'd never experienced before, I have sleep apnea and usually fall asleep right away). After over an hour of lying in bed, as soon as I finally fell asleep, I went straight into a dream (and I mean THE SECOND I fell asleep) where I was lying exactly where I was, except for in the chair at the foot of the bed was the widow's deceased husband, sitting there, completely dead. I recognized him from a picture I'd seen on the walls and was immediately horrified by this because I knew he was dead. Then I started getting this warm, pleasant feeling from him. He wasn't saying anything, he was dead, but I felt like he was giving me a vibe of being very friendly and harmless. Somehow, this calmed me down, so I laid back down and went to sleep (still in the dream).

As soon as I fell asleep in the dream, I woke up in the same spot and immediately checked the chair, which, thankfully, did not have a dead man sitting in it. After this ordeal, I felt at ease about sleeping in this room, and fell asleep without any more uneasy feelings (although still not feeling alone).

The next morning I describe this vivid dream in detail to my girlfriend. She kind of laughs it off, but tells me that everyone has told her how friendly and kind and jolly the old man was when he was still alive, and it's hard to explain but the way she described him sounded exactly like the vibe I was getting from him during the dream.

Later that evening my gf and I were sitting in the den watching TV. This is where it gets a bit strange. There was a fireplace in the room, and we had been sitting there watching TV for an hour or more, when all of a sudden, the fireplace doors swing open. Not slam open, not slide open slowly, but kind of open like you would open them to prepare a fire, smoothly and all the way. We both look at each other with a WTF kind of look. Without saying anything, I get up and go close the fireplace doors. About 20 seconds after I sit back down, they open again. Now we both have no idea what's going on and kind of laugh about it. I get up, close the doors again, and say ""meh, must just be a draft or something"", then look outside to see a perfectly calm, cool evening. I go sit back down and again about 10-20 seconds later, only ONE of the fireplace doors open, to which I immediately reply ""well, there goes my draft theory."" and the mood in the room changed to a more serious one. Something was happening that we really couldn't explain. I just left the door open (half afraid to walk back over there) but nothing else really happened that night and I left the next day.

That's where my story ends but my gf stayed at the house for several more months. For an entire month the widow went overseas and left her there alone. She told me many strange stories of lights being on she knew she left off, doors being unlocked which were locked, and some crazier stuff. She eventually moved out because of this one:

One day she gets up to take a shower, goes into the bathroom, turns on the shower, and nothing, no running water. So she checks the kitchen sink, nothing. She goes to a friends to take a shower and then calls the water company, who confirms that her water is turned on and should be working. She then goes back to the house to find a towel in the shower, so she picks it up and it's *soaking wet*, dripping water like someone had tossed it in and turned the water on. After that she walked out and never slept in the house again.

She also called me one morning. They had house guests and she was made to sleep in the room I had slept in upstairs. She called to tell me she knew exactly the uneasy feeling in that room that I had told her about, but she didn't have any crazy dreams.

I thought it was very strange, and still do. I still can't say I believe in ghosts 100%, but I definitely think there is something going on which we currently cannot explain. The fireplace doors moving on their own was weird, the water story gave me chills, but the dream is what really opened my eyes to ""the unexplained"" because it was such an indescribable personal experience like nothing I had EVER been through. So that's my story, not the most exciting or scary, but completely true and not embellished in any way.

edit: I no spell so good."
g2buj,1,2011-03-11,The Computer Repair Job from Hell threatens to ruin my day/week/who knows! Advice would be great!,ateatree,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g2buj/the_computer_repair_job_from_hell_threatens_to/,"*Pre-edit: I accidentally posted this in Self.self a little while ago, and deleted it from there, rather than doubleposting, when I realized what I'd done. I hope that's not too much of a problem!*

A bit of backstory, first. I've done computer repair, as a private enterprise, for seven or eight years now. I come over to your house, you pay me $25/hour for my time, I fix your problem. The story that follows is one of the first jobs I've undertaken in the Orlando area; I moved here four years ago to attend college. Previously (and on college breaks) I was doing such repairs in my hometown. So:

*Saturday*: I received an e-mail, after having sent out an e-blast to local contacts several months ago: ""I need computer help. Please call me."" Sweet, a job! Called her, set up an appointment for Monday after work.

*Monday*: Turns out her problem was rather simple: she couldn't get online. I head to her place after getting out of my internship and, as I expected, the problem was simply with her router/modem. Reset them both, everything's fixed. Wrote her a set of instructions on how to do it again, if she needed to. I charge a minimum of an hour, so I decided to spend the rest of the time I'd be there running [Stinger](http://us.mcafee.com/virusInfo/default.asp?id=stinger) and other basic utilities on her two computers.

The computer downstairs is a low-end laptop running Windows Vista. I check the Task Manager and cringe and the fact that it's straining under the footprint of 90 running processes... but if it doesn't bother her, I'd better not let it get to me. While I'm there, she asks me to show her how to do a couple of things she wants to do with Microsoft Outlook - change the view of some folders, regain her main menu bar. Easy stuff.

The computer upstairs is in worse shape. It's ""the first computer I ever owned"", she explains - given to her by her work, way back when. It's a Celeron with 128 megs of RAM, running Windows ME. Sweet Jesus. I pop in my flash drive and pull Stinger off of it, start running it. As I go to take the flash drive out, despite having told Windows to properly eject it, the BSOD pops up. **WARNING! THIS COMPUTER IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE!** If you touch it anymore,^Itmightjustexplode!^Andyouwouldn'twantthatonyourconscience,^nowwouldyou? Well shit. Ctrl+Alt+Del time, I guess. It chugs its way slowly back to the ~~Windowns~~ Windows ME splash screen.

It's been about an hour and a half at this point - the scans on the computer downstairs have finished without issue. I charge her for an hour and a half, and leave.

*Wednesday*: I'm home visiting my family, as it's Spring Break. Early this morning, I get another e-mail: ""Hi Casey (e: not my name), computer upstairs not working, and having great trouble with my laptop.""

""Okay"", I says. ""I'm sorry you're having problems. I'd be happy to come by Friday, when I'm back in town, to take a look at it (them).""

""I can't work without my computers. Need you sooner.""

*Thursday*: So I reconnoiter my plans. I come back into Orlando Thursday afternoon. She says she'll be there until 6, when she has to leave to go to [a neighboring city]. I get to her place, having left direct from my parents, at around 5, having sent her an e-mail or two that day saying I wasn't likely to get in really early that day, as she had been hoping.

I ring the doorbell. No answer. Call her. Twice - once on the home phone, once on the mobile. Nothing. Did she decide I wasn't coming and leave anyways? I grab some loose leaf out of my car and write her a note, assuming I did and asking her to call me when she can so we can figure this out.

*Friday (Today)*: 8am. I'm getting ready to head out to my internship, but I check my e-mail first to see if she's got any plans for how to proceed. ""I'm sorry for missing you! It was TODAY that I go to [neighboring city] at 6! I was gone all yesterday, with my phone off.""
I respond with an e-mail that essentially says that, as on Monday, my best recourse is to head her way after work. She calls, around 3pm. She hasn't heard from me! Am I still planning on coming?

""Why, yes,"" assures I. ""I sent an e-mail saying I would.""

""I didn't get any such e-mail.""

""Sorry to hear it! As soon as I leave here, I'm headed your way.""

And so I go, once more into the fray. This time, she's somehow managed to open 26 Outlook related windows. No WONDER she can't do anything on the laptop! I tell her this, as I go about closing the windows one or two at a time. She doesn't seem to understand this. She also managed to undo all of the Outlook view changes that we'd implemented last time. I explain all the changes I make as I get her Outlook (and overall computer performance) back shipshape (IE had locked up, also, and had to be closed through Task Manager. Again, trivial.)

So, back upstairs. Contrary to my suggestion, she's left the poor thing trying to boot into Windows ME for a week now. Probably not good. After a little further investigation, I'm convinced her Windows installation, if not her entire desktop harddrive, is corrupted. That is to say, I managed to boot it into safe mode and it could not read from the C: drive once it got there.

By this time her friends are here, and it's time for her to go out on her trip. As she's going, I tell her that I don't think there's anything else I can do for that poor upstairs hunk of electronics (in somewhat kinder terms) and that I just ought to send her an invoice for billable time once I'm done packing up and I take off.

""An... invoice?"" She seems incredulous. ""No, no - you didn't fix my computers the first time. You came back out here to fix them, and you didn't even do that. I'm sorry, but I'm not paying you.""

Now the incredulity is mine to have. She really doesn't understand the difference between network problems and having overloaded her laptop with running processes, despite my having explicitly explained them? I guess not - I found the e-mail I'd sent her that morning deleted and marked ""read"", meaning she'd somehow managed to delete it without realizing it (or that she'd read it and intentionally ignored it, who knows?)

At this point, she was already gone. I took the spare key she gave me, locked the back door, and left the house - leaving what was probably the last known partition running Windows ME trying desperately to boot itself on her upstairs computer. (I deposited the key where she told me to; I didn't take that with me.)

I'm all but certain she blames me for ""the computer that was working until [I] came here"", on top of not understanding the two distinctly different services I rendered to her, and being unwilling to pay me appropriately for my time.

**SO:** (whew) **What do I do?** I really don't intend to go back there. Her desktop was running WinME - it was going to go sooner or later, probably sooner. She gave me the run-around during my Spring Break and got six hours of my time, for which I was able to bill her 1.5 hours.

Do I just stop talking to her? Do I tell her ""sorry, nothin' I can do for you at this point - take it to someone else?"" Any advice would be greatly appreciated - I'm freaking out over how she might mis-react or overreact to this!


***TL;DR:*** Fixing tech-illiterate woman's computing problems turns into a nightmare; she doesn't accept that the two problems I solved for her are distinctly different. Furthermore, an ancient computer she owned bit it while I was working on it. She's about to get on my ass about it. How should I handle it?"

Luckily my parents had a college fund that will see me through 4 years of college without any debt. I'm trying to get a good resume built up and applying for internships like crazy. So that's my education story.

Politics: I'm a Liberal. I am very interested in politics, and would love a secularist country with more liberal leanings. 

Social Life: I'm into anime, video games, and movies. I prefer to have as little censoring as  possible. I would also prefer a city lifestyle, so that I could walk around and find things to do at my own choosing. 

Miscellaneous: I'm English speaking only. I would still be interested in politics even if I emigrated, so a country that would be more open to foreigners in office would be appreciated. I prefer moist weather, hot or cold wouldn't really matter, but dry weather can get me sick. I'd also want a pretty strong medicare system and a country with a well structured retirement plan.

g2vyx,1,2011-03-12,"Reddit, can a city/state just not be right for you?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g2vyx/reddit_can_a_citystate_just_not_be_right_for_you/,"I am a 20-yr old female who lived in Texas from 2006-2009. I loved it there. I had a bad ass pharmaceutical research job at the age of 18, I bought my own car, and I was going to school full-time. During 2009, I re-kindled a relationship with this guy I met while living in Dayton,OH from 2004-2006. (I am a military child, and always moved) When my family had to pack up and move to Texas, I was so relieved to be moving out of Dayton because I had experienced racism, no friendships, and the horrible weather that I wasn't used to. (My first winter with snow in 2004).  I've also never had any trouble making friends previously because I'm so used to moving to new places.

So we decide to do the long distance thing, and then I finally decided to re-locate to Columbus,OH, where he was going to OSU. Our relationship is really great, and I was so excited to be living in a new city. I applied to over 30 jobs there, to get no response within the first few months. I also experienced depression from not having any friends. I got an internship at an art gallery one month after living there, and the owner asked me to pose nude for him because he ""liked"" my ""skinniness"" to which I said no and instantly quit it. I met a few people interning there as well, and tried to get their numbers to hang out with them. They never replied to any of my calls or texts. 

A few months after that I am attending the community college and try to make friends there as well to no avail. Again, they did not respond to any of my texts or calls. I get really discouraged and then I find out one of my old friends from Dayton lives in Columbus. So I contact her and we make plans to hang out and again, she bails and never calls me or texts me ever again. I can't seem to figure out what is wrong with me at this point. I had a tough time finding a job, so my boyfriend's dad gets me an assistant job for one of his rich friends who lives in Columbus. At that job, they paid me little, treated me like shit, made me do heavy-duty work, gave me little hours, and it also required me to wake up at 6am to take their kids to school. So I was like fuck that, I need another job!
My boyfriend's dad says that he knows the owner of a local bank and could get me a job there. So I tell the people I need to leave the assistant job for the bank job, and they never responded to any of my calls or e-mails ever again. 
I had tons of hope for this bank job, because I'm in desperate need for money, and so I go in and they made me go through 8 interviews. Not only that, but they say they're going to pay me only $10/hr compared to the $15/hr I was making at the pharmaceutical job. So I take to job in hope that they will pay me more later. (I had a very bad vibe from the people who interviewed me) Okay, so I take the position they offer me, and it turns out all of the ladies who worked there were bitchy, stab-your-back kind of people. I came in miserable everyday, but still did my job well. One month later, they accuse me of coming in late, looking un-professional, not doing any work, and texting on my phone. (Even though other co-workers did it too) They also dug through my trash and saved all of my ripped doodles for 2 weeks as evidence against me. All of this was untrue, so I just quit that day and never came back. I left feeling very bitter and mad that they would gang up on me to kick me out for no reason. The lady told me I didn't have the ""banking brain"" 

There I was, hating everyone in Columbus in that point, hating all of the lies told about me at the bank, hating all of the people that did not respond back to me, and hating EVERYTHING in Columbus even more. EVERYONE I've met in Columbus has been the most flakiest douchebag ever. I have never experienced anything like this. So the boyfriend and I agreed to move back to Dayton in Feb. 2011, and so far I feel a lot better. The water and air here is less-polluted, and the people feel a lot nicer. (Trust me, there were a lot more people that did not respond to me, but this story would be even longer, so I didn't post anymore)

So could a city be that bad for an individual?

P.S. Sorry for the bad grammar, etc. And no, I am not a crazy person. Just someone who is nice and wanted friends. Sorry for the long post, and I really just want honest opinions and answers. It would really mean a lot to me."

g3zwr,2,2011-03-14,Master's Degree Holders:  Did you do internships while in school?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3zwr/masters_degree_holders_did_you_do_internships/,"Have a friend who recently completed a Master's Degree, but never did any internships in his chosen field the entire time he was in college.  He's been out of school for a few months now, and while he's had a lot of interviews, there have been no job offers.

I am afraid it might be because potential employers are looking at a guy who has a lot of education and a good but not great GPA, but no experience, and so it's hurting him in the interviews.

He thinks it's just because of the slow job market in general, and doesn't think the internships (or lack of them) matter when it comes to getting a job.

Who's right?  Or are we both wrong?

Thanks.

EDIT:  He studied electrical engineering with a concentration on Power and Control Systems.  His job experience in school was first as an operator, and then coordinator, of the on-campus computer lab."
g3z7y,2,2011-03-14,"I'm getting a promotion, how do I ask for more money, or am I expecting too much for a programmer?",penguinswhee,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g3z7y/im_getting_a_promotion_how_do_i_ask_for_more/,"I am a woman I have an associates and bachelors degree in computer science and I've been out of school and working as a web developer for the past year (not my favorite field of programming, but I haven't had any luck with software engineering).  Aside from professional experience with PHP and C#/ASP.NET MVC, I've been programming in C++ for seven years in my free time and programming is my primary passion in life.

My first job paid me a salary of $24k a year, and when I tried to ask for more money or less hours, they just completely wouldn't budge, so I left.

I've been at my current place about six months as an intern, making $14 an hour.  I am getting a promotion (from Intern to Programmer I), and my boss said ""I can offer you $16 an hour"".  I don't know what the benefits are yet, though some guys in other positions have health insurance and paid time off.  This place is kind of small, about 70 employees, but we seem to be doing excessively well financially.

I feel like this pay is really low.  Whenever I look at statistics websites or talk to people, it seems like $50k+ is the standard, even for entry-level people. When I talk to other programmers, locally and online, I always find my pay to be incredibly humiliating.

I think around $40k, while still kind of low, I feel like I can be happy with for a while, so I'm thinking of debating my boss to get $19-$20 instead of the $16 he is offering.

I'm compiling a list of the projects and responsibilities I've handled the past 6 months, as well as pay statistics I can find online, though I'm not particularly articulate and definitely not experienced in the professional world.
What can anybody suggest?  Am I asking for too high of a pay raise 6 months in?  If I don't get the raise I want, how should I respond?

Thanks guys

tl;dr: Woman with BS in CS, 1 year pro web dev exp (7 years hobbyist C++ exp), boss wants to give me $16/hr for Programmer I promotion, I want $19.  Unreasonable? How do I ask for a higher amount?"

About me: Recently I have decided to put preparations for grad school on hold and instead spend some time in the working world. It has been my dream to make a life in California and I'd like to start preparing for that ASAP. I am looking for any sort of tech work/job/internship in California in the hope that that work could turn into a full time job after I graduate in April 2012. If a full time job is not possible I would still benefit from networking and becoming acquainted with life out in California.

What I can bring to the table: I am a compulsive problem/puzzle solver and I hope to dedicate my life to that end. I have played sports all of my life and come from a large family so teamwork is something I am extremely comfortable with, but I also work well alone. I have a great work ethic and positive attitude. I consider this opportunity to be a stepping stone into my professional future so I approach this with a lot of hunger and passion to perform well and establish myself as a creative, clever and hard working force in the tech world. I have a very wide background in math and sciences which I consider to be an education in problem solving, I look at a challenge from many different angles and have a knack for finding where to pull at the to untie the knot. I am flexible on what sort of work I am willing to do, I'm not looking for an EE internship specifically (though that would be ideal) I am primarily looking for anything related to technology and engineering.

g57xy,1,2011-03-16,"I'm relocating from the East coast to the West coast, and my girlfriend is committed to staying on the East coast. Oh, and shes mentally unstable, addicted to Oxy and suicidal.",DurpAway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g57xy/im_relocating_from_the_east_coast_to_the_west/,"In the next few (6-10) months, I'm planning on relocating from Eastern Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, and I have not informed my girlfriend yet (who thankfully is not a Redditor, and will never see this).

**Some background:**
My dream and plan has always been to become a sound engineer/music editor/mixing engineer/etc. I know some of the right people one would need to know to really get ahead in this field, but alas, they all live and work in the greater LA area, and have told me that if I'm serious about it, I need to do two things; get out of Pennsylvania, and if possible, get to LA/LA Area. The reasons being that I cannot intern, or shadow people from PA, nor can I gain the professional relationships with these people being a ""ghost"" that lives in PA, and may occasionally go out to LA once in a while. 

I'm *currently* in **NO** position to move anywhere, with only a few hundred dollars to my name, if that. I do, however, have some assets that I plan on liquidating for a reserve (approx $8-10,000), as well as paying off my car, and the cost of relocating the car. (I believe its worth it vs trying to sell it ((ugh)), and buy something of equal value in LA) I also plan to search for a job and land one before doing any actual moving. I wont move until I have a job.

On top of all of this, one of my friends with similar aspirations (music composer/arranger) will be moving out there with me, sharing a place.

My issue is, how do I leave my life here, in PA, behind? More importantly, how do I even begin to bring this up with my current Girlfriend? Shes known that I may, in years to come, relocate, but its got to happen sooner than later. Shes going to be going to college (again) to become a vet tech, and will be here for a minimum of 18 more months going to school. Neither her nor I could handle or deal with a long-distance relationship, thats for sure.

On top of all of this, shes clinically depressed, and has ***EXTREME*** anxiety issues which cause her to become ""stressed out"" at the drop of a hat, and by are caused by seemingly anything. She has a TON of issues with her life, many of which were there before we began dating, and one of the major problems we face is that there are some times when I cannot emotionally be there for her due to my schedule (two jobs (70 some hours a week), a large side project which takes up 90% of my free time, and the overall exhaustion that goes with all of that). Shes also addicted to Oxycotin. She gets it from a friend of hers by the hundreds of pills, and crushes them up and snorts them daily just to be able to feel okay, and not have panic attacks. She takes up to 60mg a day.

Let's add some more into the mix: we're both recovering self-mutilators, I've been ""sober"" for about 5 years, whereas shes still doing it. Her arms and legs are covered in scars, and fresh cuts. She's only once tried to commit suicide via cutting once, and it didn't work (clearly). I'm afraid that she might seriously attempt if I try to leave.

Obviously, we're both kind of messes, and thats why we thought we'd work together, but there are two major issues here: obviously the relocation, and second, with all I have going on in my life, I am simply not in the position to give the kind of support she needs, nor can I actually deal with the drama. I need to get my life in order, and so does she, but I don't believe we can do this any longer.

So the question becomes, how do I even approach this? At first, I thought about not telling her until things were a tad more certain (job, money, etc), but Im feeling extremely guilty about that. It's lying by deception, and I cant imagine how much it would hurt to one day be like, ""ohai....um....bai"", and then leave. I'm thinking its better to just get it over with, but again, with her emotional state, I'm just worried about her. I do actually care about her - I've loved her for years before we dated. I wish I could see another way around this whole ordeal, but I don't, and I'm asking for input. Thanks for reading.

tl;dr - Im moving, I havent told my GF yet, and my GF is mentally unstable. I'm trying to become more stable, and shes still a mess. How do I approach the breakup?"

I was on a date with a girl that I had been trying to snag for a while, maybe 2 months.  Always swapping pleasantries, asking her out, getting subtly rejected ... until she was going to finish her internship and leave town, and finally gave in for a pity night.

We were supposed to go to a small theater show, and we did, but she asked if we could leave early because she said she didn't feel well.

When we stepped outside, it was a major blizzard - we were oblivious 20-somethings and lived in a city so who cared, right? - but there were no cabs really running and maybe a foot of snow had fallen since we went into the theater, so we decided to get something to eat.  We went to Wendy's.

Over mini burgers and chili, she told me she had chrohn's disease and that it was a digestive disorder that was different for everyone. She picked the tomatoes off her burger.  She said the doctors could never give a complete list of what's taboo.  Live and learn, etc. She said something was disagreeing with her.  

She mentioned that she had been sick for most of her childhood, and was ""maybe making up for it"" now, and that she hoped I didn't mind.  I told her that her playfulness was the best thing about her, and I didn't say anything else because I was worried I might come on too strong.  She was beautiful. Smart.  Just perfect.

She looked reassured and pulled out a bottle of pills from somewhere in her coat.  She took 2 or 3 of whatever it was but then immediately started to cry.  She was shaking.  I looked at the bottle and it said 'hydromorphone' - I only remember that because I later looked it up to confirm that it had to be some serious shit.  

She asked if she could sit on my lap, and I agreed, and she then asked me to pick her up because she could not move.  I did.  She was curled into a ball on her chair and when I put her on my lap she started to cry.

She confessed she never, ever ate greasy food like this but wanted to feel normal for once.  She also had something else that day to eat that was probably from the going-away party we always threw for the interns.  Whatever she started, she made it worse by trying to ""fit in"" for our ""date.""

She asked me to hold her and she just shivered and cried, and tried to breathe but it was all choking and coughing.  I was terrified. I screamed for someone to call an ambulance but she was in my ear saying not to do that.  I don't know why but I listened.  I figured she knew what she was doing.  She said she had to get home to get the rest of her pills.  She was trying to hold back her tears but she was in such pain she could barely speak.

All I could do was ask ""god"" for help.  In my head I started to plead for  help, for whatever could ""hear my thoughts"" to step in and help this, to stop this.  I was begging in my own mind to take her place, to have it switched.

Not a godfuckingdamn thing happened.  And I realized everything my parents said was utter horseshit.  

This happened years ago and I read up a bit and learned that my anger at my own helplessness could have transmuted into anger against my parents for equipping me only with false hope.  But fuck that, that doesn't change what I believe now.

In the end, I was able to get her outside and somehow find a taxi.  She threw up everywhere. I took her home and carried her from the car into her apartment and laid her down in her bed (her roommates let me in).  She asked me to grab her things from the bathroom off her closet-sized bedroom (this was uptown but still, she was an intern) and I found a forest of little pill bottles, latex gloves, creams, pill holders, and later on I would realize this was par for the course if you grew up without pieces of your intestines.

The **TLDR** is that I watched a girl I had a major crush on end up near-comatose from complications caused by [the diet she had that day while] going on a date with me.

Thank you for letting me vent.  I never told of this except in my journal.  After years, she and I met up again and she turned out to be really very selfish and such, and I moved on.  But anyway, I will now go outside and stand in the sun and try to have happy adventures.

g6awp,21,2011-03-18,"My mom is visiting me in Hawaii, and I'm crying in the next room. What do I do?",snozzcumber,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g6awp/my_mom_is_visiting_me_in_hawaii_and_im_crying_in/,"I am a college student finishing up an internship in Hawaii. I am so blessed to have gotten to spend time here, and I begged my mom to come visit for my last week. She is my role model and the person I love most in the world, but she has been through so much that she doesn't deserve.

When I was in high school, she was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian cancer. Thankfully they caught it just before it would have become stage IV, which is incurable. She underwent high dose chemotherapy, a more aggressive form of standard chemo, and lived at a hospital in another city for several months. She is a tiny woman, and the treatment seemed to nearly destroy her.

In addition to the cancer, I grew up watching my dad physically abuse her -- once even while she was receiving chemo (a long story for another time). Although things have been much better for a long time now, he still causes her a lot of emotional stress. When she isn't stuck in the house with my dad, she is working all the time because they co-own a business.

I thought she could really use a vacation, which is why I pushed so hard for her to come visit me in Hawaii. My dad booked her flight and everything was ready to go. Suddenly, a day before her planned arrival, my dad tells me they're going to cancel her trip. I ask why, and he says it's because she has a cold.

A cold? I insisted that she come anyway, because it's just a cold, no big deal. I push for my dad to let her go, and he gives in but seems really worried. When I went to pick up my mom at the airport, she looked terrible and seemed totally out of it. When we were walking, she would stop randomly and look confused until I tugged on her arm to follow me.

I kept telling her that she looked like she was on drugs, and she explained that she had taken some cough medicine on the plane. Then I noticed she was carrying several vomit bags and she admitted to throwing up on the plane from the medicine. She threw up again in the rental car as I was driving us to my apartment.

She refused dinner and is sleeping in the other room right now. Most of me understands that she probably does just have a cold and it's not much to be concerned about. But the rest of me is paranoid. My parents kept my mom's illness a secret from me for a long time. When it happened, they threw me into my school's boarding program without warning while they basically lived at a hospital out of town. They finally told me the truth after I found papers about cancer on my dad's desk.

By the time we got to my apartment, I was feeling suspicious. I directly asked my mom if her cancer had come back, and she hesitated for a moment and then said no in a soft, weird way. I can't tell if I was imagining her response, if she was just sick, or if I am spot on in my suspicions. Adding to my paranoia is that it's been five years since her treatment, and the shitty statistics for the five year survival rate for patients like her keeps swimming in my head.

My boyfriend is who I usually talk to about things like this, but we had a very bad breakup this morning on the phone (which is probably intensifying my sadness right now). We dated for two years, and around Christmas he admitted to cheating on me twice. He's my first love and we tried to work things out. No matter how hard I tried to be better, I just couldn't get over it and this frustrated him a lot. I broke up with him while sobbing yet again about a detail from his cheating. The last thing he said is that he doesn't care about me anymore and I haven't heard from him all day.

I rarely open up to people about my family issues, and I don't want to start now. I'm not very good at calling people out of the blue to just talk because I feel like I'm bothering them. Somehow even posting this on Reddit makes me feel like I'm being annoying. I'm sorry I'm not more eloquent and honestly I don't even know what kind of answers I'm looking for, maybe just assurance that everything is really going to be okay. All I know is that I feel sad and scared, and I want my mom to have an amazing time while she's here. It's already been tough putting on a smile when she keeps asking me how my boyfriend is doing, and now I'm really worried about her.

**TL;DR** Worried my mom's cancer came back and dealing with bad breakup. Crying too much. Advice?"

I was reading up on what CIRM does and came across the term ""job year,"" what exactly does it mean for CIRM to be generating 13,000 ""job years?""

Is the purpose of the internship more for research or, for example, pre-faculty training for the future as, say, a stem cell biologist, etc?

Is there work that may become available to the intern after completion of the internship?

Would I get to choose which facility I would be working at or is that determined by a necessity of workers at a facility? (there are multiple facilities that I can work at for this internship)

What is the mandatory minimum or maximum hours of work I would have to complete each week, if there is one, and are the hours themselves fairly flexible or should I be expecting a rather rigid schedule that I would have to plan my classes around?

What might you say would be the short and long-term benefits of working with CIRM?

Dear Sir or Madam, 

I am submitting my enclosed resume in hopes of furthering my work experience by securing an international internship in Oslo’s well-established IT industry.  I am currently in my final year of completing my bachelor in Computer Science (Software Systems option) at Concordia University, located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
In the last three years of my university studies and work experiences, I believe I have acquired the valuable skills and qualifications that your company may be looking for. In particular, I have excelled in my computer networking, software engineering and java programming courses. I have had the opportunity to help design two web-based applications, a content management system used to manage course registration, and a simple perl based poker game. 

In addition to my studies, I have also had the opportunity to work full time for two years and summer intern at a local IT security firm. My main position was as a full-disk encryption technician. My chief responsibility consisted of decrypting hard drives and troubleshooting software encryption/decryption issues.  In addition, I had the opportunity to intern at the same company last summer. This experience allowed me to get closer to the software development practice. During that summer I wrote various documentation and UML diagrams for an Android application. I was also given the task to reorganize and manage the SVN repository. 

I've taken great pleasure in Norway's diverse and interesting culture in my past travels and believe an international internship in Oslo would be a very fulfilling experience.  

If you have questions, or if you want to schedule an online interview, please contact me at . I look forward to meeting you to further discuss employment opportunities with company.

g8hde,1,2011-03-21,Lost in the world of I.T. and I have no clue where to go from here.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/g8hde/lost_in_the_world_of_it_and_i_have_no_clue_where/,"Hey Reddit, 

Let me just start by giving some background into my current situation. I am 25 years old, just about to graduate from my university in May. I got a late start into college due to some family and personal issues, but I finally made it through. I am majoring in computer information systems with a focus in network design. I have also been an intern at one of the largest investment firms in the world for almost a year now. Furthermore, I have been accepted into a very good grad school to obtain my M.S. in CIS as well. 

So what is the problem? Well, aside from me doing well in school throughout all my technology classes, and doing well in my current job, I just don't feel that it is right for me. I couldn't sit down and map out a network and know how to build it, I couldn't sit down and code out a new innovative product or solution, and I couldn't even begin to tell a company how to improve their processes. 

I have found that my education has helped me greatly in various aspects of my life, but I just have a gut wrenching feeling that while I know a lot about technology... I don't actually know how to do anything with it. 

I have great people skills, I've sat in and contributed to many different meetings within my firm, and I love technology. The problem is that I don't want to waste my soft skills behind a screen all day as I have found they are rare in this industry. I want to be able to make a difference, and I want to be able to still be involved with new rises in I.T. 

But where do I go in this industry if I don't enjoy the technical aspects of things? I don't find protocols, coding, or standards appealing in the least. I know what they are, but I certainly don't want to be analyzing those for the rest of my days. I have always felt my best attribute is being able to take technical tacit knowledge and explain it in simple terms to non-technical people and vice versa. I just don't know where the opportunity to utilize this would be.

I just feel lost, any advice?

TL;DR
About to graduate college with a degree in CIS, still don't feel that I have what it takes to be an IT professional. Not interested in the ultra technical, want to use my people skills within IT but I don't know where to go. "

BS in ElecEng, CompSci, Comp Eng, and MSEE; What now?  
Am I spreading myself too thin? Do I lack focus?  
What kind of salary is reasonable to expect?  
Whats your (success?) story?**  
  
The title pretty much says it all, if you can bear my elevator speech it should further clarify
my background.  
  
Elevator Speech:  
I have several years experience building, testing, and troubleshooting complex analog and
digital circuits, so hands on and problem solving are specialties of mine.  I have also
programmed complex (state-machine) LabView programs for test stands used by several technitions.
3 years ago had an internship at a top semi-conductor manufacturer troubleshooting bugs in
embedded linux kernels. I now consider myself quite the linux sysadmin. I can program in C very
well, from simple kernel level drivers up to complex executive programs as well as experience with
bash scripting, make and version control.  I wouldn't call myself a software architect as of yet
but if there were a position ""Junior Software Architect"" I am sure I could grow from that position.
I similar programming experience with Matlab as well.  I have independently designed and built
several electronics which included circuits such as switching regulators, charge pumps, current
limiting, MCU (8051) (which I programmed as well) and LED lighting control. All of these boards
were put to use in a research environment and had long life cycles with several still in use today.  
My circuits and programming are largely based around computer vision applications. As far as education
goes I have my bachelors in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science along
with a masters in EE last December. Also I am in the mid west and on the verge of 29 years old if it
matters. I am sure there is much more but you are probably getting bored and I believe this is
sufficient in what I am trying to communicate.  
  
  
Also, pre graduate school I was offered $65000/yr from two companies one in the midwest (good money),
and one from a company in an expensive area out west (not so great money), I took a third option and
joined a research group for a free ride through grad school + $28000/yr and 5% in a company that will
try to capitalize on the (if successful) research.  I now am staff working on the same research getting
$60000/yr with (maybe) couple months left until commercialization. Also I rarely put in &lt; 50hr/week,
though would prefer to work less. What sort of salary could someone with my expertise be commanding
in the private sector?  
  
  
As you can tell my skill set is all over the place.  Am I doing a great disservice to myself by being
so jack of all trades?  What type of positions are out there that I could further refine my skill sets?
What kind of position are there at all for someone with my educational background?  
  
  
So I feel I am at a crossroads, to see it through with this start up, or to continue to expand my skill set,
or to stop expanding and find a field to focus on already, should I get myself into the private sector to
start earning real money or is it unreasonable to assume I would be making that much more? Most people in
these fields must be very independent and while I have made all of my decisions on my own thus far, it would
be nice to have a perspective from someone with similar experience. Unfortunately for me, my network only
includes people with much more focused fields of expertise. Where do you people get your direction?
Should I be seeking some sort of a mentor?  
  
  
I feel I am well educated, skillful and hardworking.  Yet I cant seem to shake that I may be doing this all
all wrong. With no one to talk to personally, if anyone could offer any in sites from your personal
experiences into what I am going through it would mean such a great deal to me as I am going crazy without
legitimate insider perspective. Feel free to tell your story.  
  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

It's not awkward because of porn, by a strict definition it/s not family, and I'm not in the typical situation of being harassed by family

**Backstory:** One of my dad's coworkers, who we'll call Anne, has been very close to my family my entire life. As I grew up I would see her for birthdays, Christmas, events, to the extent that she wasn't Anne, she was Aunt Anne, and treated exactly the same as my real aunts.

Last fall the hard drive in her laptop crashed; Windows would blue screen before having a chance to finish booting. Of course, there were no backups, so she was looking to lose her entire email history (this was (is?) an old laptop). Since I'm studying Computer Science right now, she called me in the off chance I could help. She brought some pizza over, I booted up the machine, confirmed it was the hard drive, but wasn't able to get anything off. I decided to take the PC though, and was able to freeze the hard drive to get off almost all the data onto an external drive. I then helped her find a replacement drive and everything was back in business. For this, a couple hours worth of work, she paid me with pizza and a $100 bill.

Now, I was uneasy about this. This was someone who had been family for over 20 years. I mean, I'm not one to pass up on a good opportunity, but Aunt Anne is retired and this was the first time she needed technical help. If I were to expect anything from the beginning, I would be a selfish jerk. I'm also incredibly fortunate; I had a very well paid internship last year, and thanks to my parents, don't have any student loans; while money is nice, I am not in desperate need. I'm also relatively frugal, so it would go to savings anyways. But, she insisted, and it got to the point where I felt I would offend her if I rejected the money. I didn't spend it though; I slipped it into my wallet behind a couple cards and it stayed there since.

Fast forward to 4 weeks ago. I get another call that Aunt Anne's computer is acting up; every couple minutes it blue screens and reboots less than a second later. I stop by her house and try everything I can – boot to a live cd, run chkdisk, reinstall Windows: the works. Eventually I give up and suggest she get a new laptop, something that's not using the latest and greatest 60gb hard drive with XP service pack 1. This took a lot longer than before, but most of the time was spent waiting; running checks and installing Windows. Before I left, Aunt Anne pushed an envelope into my hands, using the same guilt trips on me again. She had already fed me lunch/snacks, and was even sending me home with far too much food to keep around, but insisted I take the money also. I relented, not knowing how much it was.

It was a $175 check.

I was flabberghasted. Most of the time was chatting around, catching up on life, waiting for installs to finish/tests to run. I even failed in my efforts, and was forced to suggest the laptop be replaced, as I had no clue. My work was certainly not worth that much, and certainly not to be charged to someone I care deeply about.

I really wasn't sure what to do with the check, but then got a call yesterday asking about recovering the data from the old drive to transfer to the new PC. Since I was at home on break with my parents, and Aunt Anne hadn't been to our house for a long time, I insisted she come visit and that we should go out to dinner. When she arrived I took the opportunity to sneak the check, now with VOID written in large letters on each side, into her bag along with a note explaining I couldn't take it, then turned to the computer After taking out the hard drive I realized I didn't have the right cables to read it (it was using a 2.5” EIDE interface, and I didn't have the adapter to a 3.5” one for all you geeks out there), so I took the drive and sent messages to a few friends who might have an adapter before going to dinner. She insisted on paying the bill. As a guest. Obviously this would not stand, and I instead used the $100 bill from before to pay the bill. Aunt Anne was furious, not only that I ignored her wishes, but that I had saved the money for her instead of buying textbooks or similar. She insisted that I count the hours it takes to transfer the data and left back home (after a lot of hugs and goodbyes to the family; not in a huff/abruptly).

She hasn't found the check yet, but I'm sure she will be incredibly angry when she does. This whole scene isn't about the money – Aunt Anne is living comfortably, in a nice house and with a (rather large) boat, and I am lucky to have a sufficient amount in savings, no student loans, and great job prospects. What I'm worried about is the argument putting a rift between us, and her following through with her threats not to call if she needs further help, instead going to Geek Squad (yikes!). This is someone who has taken care of me my entire life, and I feel I own more than a little bit of thanks to.

What should I do next?

**TL;DR:** Very close family friend is insisting on overpaying me for technical help, and I'm worried some of the fighting over it may ruin our relationship"

I will be spending this summer at a local business interning, then during the fall I will have an academic-credited internship with a different organization. 

I'm a communications major. I have a affection for technology and writing. I use Ubuntu Linux on my desktop, Windows XP on my laptop, Android on my phone, iOS on my iPad. I read Engadget, ars techica, and look for developments in the tech world on Reddit daily. I enjoy writing at great lengths about various topics and intend to self publish some of my more-interesting work through Amazon. If I really enjoy what I'm writing, I get a high off it. (High on writing?)

I'm obsessed with efficiency and order. Whenever I go somewhere or do something, I make an effort to determine the most effective way to accomplish tasks. I played a real-time strategy game, Warcraft III: TFT, for a long time during my teenage years, which meant performing a task in game as fast as possible was instrumental for being better than the opponent—it has carried over into my young adult life. I like keeping things organized, but often my room can be found a mess (it's looking good right now). I believe having things in order, ready for action, has a huge impact on efficiency. Often I'm only shaving minutes off of something—a huge savings (not really). Other times I can complete a task in an extraordinarily shorter amount of time than my peers, sometimes because of my tech advantage.

I am passionate and like the idea of enjoying what I do. Right now I'm a part-time employee at a dead-end-job organization. I go in each day upbeat and prepared to accomplish whatever task thrown at me by a customer, or client. I'm also humble enough not to appear cocky. I'm well aware of the balancing act involved in showcasing skills versus being *that* guy.

I don't know what field of work I would like to go into; I'm no engineer, developer, coder, or designer—many computer fields are out.

gc366,4,2011-03-26,How do I get over this defeatist attitude?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gc366/how_do_i_get_over_this_defeatist_attitude/,"The following is a bit of back story. I will try to be succinct. If you don't give a fuck about my personal problems go ahead and skip to the comments.

Last Spring I went on an internship in my chosen field of study and hated it. However, at the end of my internship I received a job offer. Feeling dissatisfied with my options I decided to take the GRE(Graduate Record Examination). For those who have not heard of the GRE it is the equivalent of the SAT but for graduate school.

Three weeks ago I finally took the GRE and did well enough that I believe I can do anything. It has always been a secret desire of mine to go to film school. Looking back I wish I had had the balls to apply to an undergraduate production program or two. Most MFA production programs require some sort of portfolio as part of the application process; UCLA being the notable exception. Luckily I received a fairly substantial (for me) tax return this year. It was a very tough decision to spend so much money in one place, but I decided to spend most of it on a semi-professional HD camera.

The camera finally arrived three days ago. I had been tooling around with it the last couple days; playing with settings and practicing different types of shots. The camera was amazing, I loved everything about it. I already ordered a larger battery (The internet said it helped with stabilizing shots as well).

I went camping this weekend and took the camera with me. Friday afternoon I hiked up to the site on the plateau where I had been planning to set up camp. I was the only person up there. I left my pack at the campsite and wandered around for an hour getting a couple shots with my camera. I started to get nervous about camping alone towards the late afternoon. I decided to hike down to the lower campsite where I had seen a couple tents on my way up. I took the short way back, it was only two miles but fairly steep and unfamiliar terrain. It took me nearly an hour. I got down there a little before 6 and set up my tent.

There was still a decent amount of light but there was some cloud cover rolling in. I was worried about it raining overnight so I asked the couple camping nearest to me to watch my tent. I loaded my camera and about half my food into the detachable bag on my backpack. I left everything else at the campsite and hiked a little less than a mile back to my car.

This morning, not long after I had gotten out of my tent, word made its way back to our campsite that about half the cars in the parking lot had been broken into. Of course mine was one of them.

I know whoever broke into my car was probably a lot poorer than I am. I know they were elated to find such expensive electronics in an otherwise nondescript car. I just wish they knew how much that camera meant to me. I know it is just a material object and I shouldn't be so upset, but I feel crushed. It was the embodiment of my objective. I feel like all my hope has been ripped away.

Even before my camera was stolen I had been feeling pressure to take the job from family and friends. It is a good job in a well-respected industry. Even the pay isn’t that bad. My friends think I’m crazy. My girlfriend says all the right things, but I know she thinks I should take the job. The pressure from my dad is the worst. I don’t understand why he can’t see my viewpoint. His story closely parallels mine. I went to the same state college he did and got the same degree he did. He hated it too and switched to a much more creative (and at the time groundbreaking) field. Now I’m sitting at my computer and I’ve somehow made myself cry in God knows how long. I feel trapped. I just want to give up and take the job.

When I started typing this up it was a story about feeling down after getting my camera stolen. I delved deeper into my psyche than intended. I don’t consider this a bad thing, but it ended up being much longer than I expect the average redditor to spend time reading. Thank you to everyone who made it this far.

Tl;dr: Expensive camera stolen. Feel trapped in job I don’t want. I want words of encouragement/stories about getting back up after life knocked you down. I know reddit isn’t the best place to go fishing for these kinds of things but I don’t really know where else to go."

I'm 21 years old and in my third year of Tulane University's five-year Master's program.  I am proficient in AutoCAD, Rhino, V-Ray, and Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.  I am currently learning Revit, also.

If my presence on Reddit isn't indicator enough, I am a bit of a computer nerd.  Not an IT expert by any means, but I promise I won't bother your IT guy very often, and I could probably help him out some if needed.

I am an Eagle Scout, and have spent 6 of the last 7 summers working at a Boy Scout camp (I am also a Vigil member of the OA).  The last three summers I worked as a COPE (ropes course) facilitator and director.  Last summer (the other 1 of 7), I coordinated out-of-town volunteer groups at a church in New Orleans.  I am currently being trained as next year's manager of my work/study job.

I've always loved building things; Legos were my favorite toys ever when I was a kid.  Architecture is kind of an extension of that, to me.  I want to be an architect so I can watch a design go from sketches on trace paper to a real-life building.  My interests definitely lean more towards the practical aspects of architecture (the getting built part).

My question is what the best way to proceed from here would be. Do I keep plugging along until I get a break? Do I try to take a summer course or two (and if so, which of the vast array of CS courses would be most essential)? Or do I go back to school full time for a BS in CS? Is there anything else I could and should be doing to increase my chances and legitimacy?

Thanks in advance for your advice and guidance."
gchbj,5,2011-03-27,South Korea Anyone?,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gchbj/south_korea_anyone/,"I've noticed that there are lots of posts regarding South Korea and teaching English, but didn't see much other than that.

I've a non asian american thats been toying with the idea of moving to Korea after getting my degree in Computer Science. I know a little bit of basic korean because I grew up with a few Korean girls who taught me some basics of the language.

What I'm mainly interested in are people's experiences uprooting themselves to South Korea outside of teaching English - especially finding a job that isn't based on teaching English. Are there any extra difficulties trying to live in South Korea as a non-asian individual? I just hear that some things are more ""foreigner-friendly"", but have no idea if thats in terms of perks or actual difficulties experienced.

I've been hoping to study abroad in Seoul and maybe try to get an internship with Samsung abroad, but may not be able to get around to it before I graduate."
gcfur,6,2011-03-27,Not sure what to do,fakethrowaway0,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gcfur/not_sure_what_to_do/,"A long time ago, before I entered HS, I was fairly confident of my self worth, and was doing OK in life. At that point, I started a slow downwards spiral as my emotions took hold of me. I felt less and less valuable as I failed, time after time, to enter a relationship. I almost killed myself 3 times, on one occasion going so far as to have a loaded gun in my mouth, but was stopped when a friend called me. I was going to go through with it for sure, no matter what anyone said, when I graduated college, as statistically, if I had not had a girlfriend by that point, I never would. As luck would have it, I entered a relationship with a wonderful girl about 3 months before graduation. I canceled the internship I had lined up that summer to spend more time with her, and she agreed to try a long distance relationship as I went off to grad school. I had lost all symptoms of my 8 year long depression, including the unstable sleep schedules, the self-esteem problems, and the the continual feeling that I was wasting my life and making horrible mistakes at every turn. Once at grad school, I did my best to socialize where I could. Unfortunately, most of the other grad students in my department are fairly isolationist, as many of them have preexisting social groups and relationships that they intend to return to. I made friends with a few undergrads through an old friend of mine who will be graduating at the end of this year, but these friendships are tenuous, as I know I cannot allow myself to become bound to the undergrads, lest I become a creepy guy, and also for purposes of avoiding rapid friend turnover. My research had some problems, but my project was ambitious, so this was to be expected. Regardless of all of this, I was in continual happiness, because I knew my girlfriend was there, loving me. I took off to go see her (on the other side of the country) frequently, more frequently than my advisor would allow in fact, making up artful excuses to hide my absences. However, about two months ago, she dumped me. She said I had done nothing wrong, and that I made her feel wonderful when I was there, but that the times when I weren't were too much. I offered to quit grad school and take one of the job offers I had recieved near where she went to school, but she responded saying she didn't want me to risk my career for her, and that if I did that to get closer to her, she'd never speak to me again. We've spoke off and on since, but things are understandably awkward. Since then, I'm feeling the old state of mind come rushing back. Unfortunately, while before I was able to easily get my work done (part of the reason I never sought help--I asserted that it couldn't be depression, as it did not affect my performance in normal tasks) I am now losing the ability to concentrate at all. Other than with mentally dissociative tasks (such as reading or watching a movie) I can't seem to last more than 15 minutes before my brain returns to how fucked my life is, how improbable it is I'll ever find another relationship at all, let alone as good as that one was, and how I'm probably driving my life down the shitter with every passing moment.

I don't know what to do.

Life without a relationship just seems entirely meaningless to me. We are entirely defined by our relationships with other people, and I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing."

Short introduction: I’m a 25 year old guy who lives in Western Europe. I started my own IT consultancy business almost straight out of college (nothing too fancy, it’s basically just me in the company, working freelance) and things are going pretty good.

Well, regarding my question: for some reason I’ve always been attracted to the United States. I’ve been going there since I was a kid and now I try to fly out there a couple times a year. From the moment I started working I regretted not getting an internship abroad when I was still in college. Today I still feel like this is something that I need to do soon, before the whole wife/kids/mortgage/mistresses thing comes up. Not necessarily moving to the States indefinitely, but rather working abroad for a couple of months or a year and then seeing what’s up.

What’s my move here? Applying for some sort of internship (if this is even a realistic possibility for a non-student)?
I would love to hear from people with some advice and thoughts on this, or of course some experiences regarding this matter.

Thanks so much, guys!

So for the last year I'll have been teaching, and previously I spent 5 months in retail sales, 7 months as an editorial intern, and for basically my entire life, at sporadic intervals, I've been the general ""computer guy"" for my mom &amp; dad's small (6 employee) business. That means I set up their small (4 computer) point-of-sale network and solve any weird issues that come from having Windows 95, 98, and XP computers networked together, dealt with any problems pertaining to their 1 machine with Internet access (read: remove malware, tell people to stop clicking popup ads), and all manner of desktop hardware repair and installation. I've been building computers since junior high school which is completely unremarkable to me and anyone else in the know but maybe it can be an asset for getting a very, very entry-level job.

Anyway, I have an English degree but writing and teaching are emotionally exhausting and I get a charge out of solving tangible problems, so I am going to try and get a super entry-level IT job and see where I can go from there. 

So:

* what job titles should I be looking at? Help Desk 1?

* I should take A+ as soon as I get back, right? I'm consistently passing practice tests with high scores, so it shouldn't be a problem. How about MCITP? The jobs I've seen ask for one or the other.

* Should I study for Network+ while I'm over here as well, or wait until I get a job? 

* How can I represent my ""computer guy"" job on my resume? Technical Support Specialist? What should I put for duration worked?

* When applying for an IT gig, is it necessary to enumerate all the programs I've ever used in a ""technical skills"" section of my resume?

* Do you think it will be difficult to land a $15/hr job? I'm short on certifications and all that, but I'm really good at solving problems and when I can't solve a problem I'm great at finding reliable information on how to do it. Now, how to communicate that to a hiring manager...

SO MANY QUESTIONS YAH I JUST WANT GET JOB. Thanks for taking the time. "
gekqq,4,2011-03-30,"[For Hire] Assortment of skills (Audio, Photo, Video, Web, etc.). San Diego preferred if IRL.",lolstebbo,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/gekqq/for_hire_assortment_of_skills_audio_photo_video/,"To prospective employers,

**TL;DR**: I can do audio work, photography, video work, web stuff, and UI design. I'm a gadget geek and am willing to travel but would prefer to reside in San Diego (or other parts of California).

I would like to submit my bid of candidacy to work for you! I am graduating this June with a Bachelor's of Arts in ""Interdisciplinary Computing in the Arts with an emphasis in Music"" from UCSD. I have an interdisciplinary and assorted variety of skills. Here's a rundown of what I can do:

* I've done audio production and sound engineering/mixing/editing with studio experience. I'm great at improvising when something does terribly awry (such as being completely locked out of the studio).

* I can do sound design, composition, and songwriting (I've gotten honorable mention in a contest for the latter!).

* I can also play a bunch of instruments (most standard instruments except for the Flute and its derivatives) if such a need ever arises. 

* I am a photographer (mainly portraits, landscapes, and events. And candids. I love shooting candids.) and videographer (more of an amateur for that one)

* I have some experience with web development, user experience/interaction research/design/prototyping.

* I'm pretty good with Logic and Pro Tools. I may not be familiar with FCP, but I'm damn good with iMovie '11. I'm also good with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

* I'm also pretty familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Flash. I also know how to use Dreamweaver, but I'd rather use Notepad++ or TextWrangler while spamming F5/cmd-R within Firefox.

* I can use HTML and CSS. I have experience with AJAX and Java, but I need to brush up on those. I also know a little bit of Python (enough to generate Fibonacci numbers).

* I'm conversationally fluent in Taiwanese Mandarin Chinese. I'm not too good at reading Traditional Chinese (even worse at Simplified Chinese), but my grammar's good enough that I've still been able to do Chinese-to-English translation work. I also know enough Spanish to ask where the bathroom is and all the Japanese phrases that get said in anime a lot.

* I have oodles of internship experience in Taiwan (so I'm totally okay with bridging the cultural gap), and I'm totally good for any jobs that may require travel to Taiwan and/or China (except for the work visa part). Actually, I'm down for anything that would require travel. May as well get it out of my system while I'm young.

* I have four years of experience in computer/electronics retail in the education market. I'm knowledgeable when it comes to gadgets and electronics and I can unload merchandise from boxes on pallets and onto shelves quickly and efficiently. I'm also great at leaving voicemails that sound machine-generated and explaining more difficult computing topics in standard English (I rely on a lot of analogies for that).

* I'm good with Mac and Windows platforms (and have had to provide basic troubleshooting for both), and can even handle navigating a Linux system in command-line mode.

If there's any skill I'm lacking, I'm a quick learner. I'm great for multi-tasking. I'd rather stay in the San Diego area (relocating to SFBA is fine, as well).

If, after that list, you've got even the slightest bit of interest, send me a PM and I'll respond with more information (However, I suspect that list above might actually be more elaborate than my resume)."

As I assume I will not have one this summer I am wondering if anyone here has any interesting projects that they would like help with? 
I am looking for something that:
* I would be able to mention on a resume (so almost anything)
* C# or Java would be preferred, but C++ would be fine too (Android would be amazing as i have been meaning to learn more about it)
Also are there any search tools specifically for people looking to contribute to projects?"

Have any cool ideas or stories about how you spent your time?"
