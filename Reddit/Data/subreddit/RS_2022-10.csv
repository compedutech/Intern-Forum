Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and/or advice. I think I have a better idea now for what my next steps should be. At the very least, I don't think I'll be attending a boot camp now. Hopefully, I can come back to update on my successes. 

**TLDR: Spring 2022 Grad, no internships, have applied to jobs, but resume isn't the greatest. To improve resume, decided to do impressive projects. Struggle with creating impressive personal projects, did not learn enough in/out of school to be job ready, Should I do a boot camp to make up for what I don't know? I am lost in what to do next.**

Hello, I got my CS degree back in May. I've been applying for jobs, but I am still currently unemployed. I'm aware of the state of the job market right now especially for entry-level / new grad so I'm wondering about the next steps I should take.

**About me:**

* I just want a decent job, I am not aiming for FAANG
* No internship experience (I know this is bad)
* School projects and mediocre side projects
* Confident in soft skills, leadership, teamwork
* Insecure in technical skills
* [Resume](https://postimg.cc/sQDGhjGy)

I've applied to nearly \~200 jobs and the numbers are low, but a part of that is due to how my resume isn't the best which is why I try to improve it with projects and learn technical skills to make my resume look better. However, I fall in a cycle of:

**Resume bad -&gt; learn/do projects to improve resume -&gt; fail -&gt; apply anyways -&gt; REPEAT**

**I have project ideas I want to do, but I have difficulty executing my ideas.** Since I do not have internship experience, I need better projects to make up for it. Following tutorial projects isn't the ""best idea"", so I decided to try to completely ""dive in"" and do research on my own as I work on a side project. However, I find it so difficult to know how to architect a project. How do people create a large project on their own? How do they even learn so many new technical skills on their own?

I was able to succeed in creating a personal project where I learned a bit of node.js, express, and javascript but it isn't really ""impressive"" or enough to stand out. I did it for fun and also to learn something, but it's too ""surface-level"". I don't know how I can build something full-stack, but I know I need to make an impressive project somehow or else I can't really stand out from other applicants who have experience.

**Coding and problem-solving in university was really fun for me, yet it's so different now that I'm out of school and on my own.** I never doubted my passion for computer science until recently after being unemployed for months. I just feel like I can't do things completely on my own. I feel like I wasted my time in university. What I've learned from my degree isn't enough to get an entry-level position. I applied to internships when I was in uni, but I didn't apply ENOUGH because I wasn't confident enough. Whenever I did self-study, it wasn't actually enough or I felt like I didn't gain much from what I studied and end up feeling like I wasted time.

I enjoyed the foundational cs concepts I learned in uni (I liked theory a lot), but I don't think I can do what is required in ""entry-level"". But I also don't exactly ""know"" what is required for the job (aside from the technologies listed) because I don't have any experience yet. I have plenty experience using Google to research for solutions when I've run into problems from projects I've done before, but when I want to build a full-stack application- I feel lost.

**I've been given the recommendation of attending a coding boot camp** (probably one with an accelerated program for those with more programming experience) in order to have a structured environment to learn what I didn't learn from my degree and also to learn better with mentorship. I think it might help me since I feel like I lack discipline and guidance in what I want to achieve. I don't really want to give up or think ""is this even for me?"" when I haven't even worked as a SWE yet.

**At this moment, I just feel lost and I'm looking for some guidance.** Any advice is appreciated. If more details are needed, please ask. Thank you."

xssb9g,0,2022-10-01,Physics master's in the Netherlands or Germany?,wxd_01,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/xssb9g/physics_masters_in_the_netherlands_or_germany/,"Hi everyone. A little bit of context and background before diving into the question:

I'm a senior year bachelor's student studying physics in the Netherlands. Besides my course work, I do research as an honour's student and I'm planning to apply for a summer internship next year. I've been thinking about the graduate school I want to pursue for quite some time along with my research interests. Though now that I have a little bit more exposure to both the field and life in the EU, I've narrowed my options down to the Netherlands and Germany.

My main interest lie in theoretical and computational physics (specifically QFT, many-body physics &amp; particle phenomenology, astronomy and GR-related physics). My main reasons for the Netherlands are some of the following: I am already acquainted with it and familiar with the system. I'm fluent in Dutch, have a stable mean of student finance and enjoy the predictability of the public transport. I know these seem like arbitrary reasons for some people, though lifestyle is really important to me. Though on a more academic and professional side of things, I know that Dutch research universities are internationally renowned. Leiden is one which I'm definitely considering for their reputation in astronomy and cosmology. And Utrecht and Amsterdam are also on my radar for their strong theory group. Amsterdam seems great for high energy theory and astroparticle physics. Especially with Nikhef. Though the city itself is very busy, expensive and chaotic. Which is not what I'm used to as I live and study currently in one of the smaller Dutch cities. Utrecht also has a good theory group (especially for GR and condensed matter), while also being less busy than Amsterdam. Which is very nice. Despite all of the positives, one of my main negatives with potentially studying in the Netherlands for my master's is that the tuition is relatively expensive in comparison to Germany. Despite being an EU student.

For Germany, I am mainly considering Heidelberg University and RWTH Aachen. Both universities are well-renowned and based in a student-friendly city. From what I understood at least (since I've only visited Aachen once). Not having visited Germany does have me concerned as to my expectations, hence this post. But I saw that Heidelberg, LMU, Karlsruhe, Hamburg and Aachen are all pretty good. Though from what I heard from some friends, Munich has some of the same problems I mentioned about Amsterdam. I've narrowed it down to Aachen and Heidelberg due to Heidelberg being very student friendly (from what I heard) and having a decent admission fee while still being quite well-known in terms of research done at the theoretical physics institute. A lot of the Max Planck Institutes seem also close to Heidelberg. Which seems promising for internships and jobs. Aachen I'm mainly considering for it being well respected in particle physics as well as being in close proximity to where I already live. Also, generally I've noticed that tuition there is better. Though the main cons are that I'm unfamiliar with the living conditions in the cities I've mentioned, and also I'm aware that I will have to be somewhat proficient in German. Despite master's being in English, I heard that the amount at which you need to know the local language is higher in German cities than it is in Dutch ones.

I know this has been quite a long post, but I do hope it gives you a genuine insight as to where I'm coming from. I look forward to hearing your advice. Thank you in advance."

A bit about my background: I am a senior computer science major. I have been working with the network team at my university for around a year and a half. This previous summer I interned as a network engineer intern with a very large oil and gas company and got some experience with OT/control networks in addition to earning my CCNA as well. 

I recently have been offered a position as a network supoort engineer at Cisco Meraki for this summer. It essentially is a TAC/help desk for Meraki users where I would troubleshoot their networks for them and escalate if needed. 

As for my previous company, I had a great experience last summer and would like to return, andI am just waiting for a written offer to be sent out to me (got a verbal offer on my last day). If I go back to my last company, I would likely be on the network security team and working with site-to-site VPNs, firewalls, and other access control related projects. 

I feel a bit unsure of where to go from here. While it would be nice to have Meraki on my resume, it does not sound like a position where I will be able to gain experience on designing networks, but being exposed to a multitude of different network issues would help improve my troubleshooting skills. I do graduate next December so my thought is wherever I intern this summer would likely turn into my first full time job post graduation. I have to respond to the meraki offer by Wednesday and I am still waiting to hear from my last internship for a written offer, hence why I feel some pressure on making a decision. 

If anyone with more experience than I in the networking field can weigh in, it would be greatly appreciated."

Before that i was working on my bachelors degree as a software engineer (im currently a junior) and worked at few leading fortune 500 companies as IT change coordinator (for few months) and technical support for a year. After that i took a career break to take care of my baby and now im back and looking for jobs for few months. So overall in reality i have multiple gaps between jobs and I took the longest time in college bcs i was naive and just went to school part time for no reason except that i did not want too much on my plate since i was newly married. After coming back from maternity break I want to stabilize my career as soon as possible and I want a stable career which is preferably remote since I have a baby. I tried getting into project management by adding experience on my resume (since i saw someone else do it and succeeding). I did study alot for the position and I was able to get multiple job offers but I couldn't go through with it because I could not pass the employment verification. That was discouraging, and rightfuly so. Another route I went after that, I started applying software development internships since I still am a college student but i still have no luck. I have only beginner level programming skills so i started working on improving my programming skills in python which feels like is taking me no wear since these development positions require so much knowledge and experience. I feel like I'm all over the place at this point. I dont want to go back to technical support since its low paying and i want to grow in my career. I also have unfinished degree which i am confused if i should finish or not since I'm 25 and i want to just start my professional life, I'm already 3 years behind. Should I finish my degree in the mean time not work (my husband already supports us, my income is used to support my parents back home which i've been doing using my savings) or should i keep improving my programming skills and look for an entry level position. (This option will take 5-6 months as well). Or an other career route I should go for? Any advice will be helpful."

I graduated during the start of the pandemic, so I am unemployed for nearly 3 years now. I desperately need a job and to start building my career.

I might have a few interviews this coming week and I need guidance on choosing if I am fortunate enough to be given an offer.

1. Tech company, provides IT services (data centers). I believe this is the final interview. Good starting pay, hybrid setup, classroom setup for 6mos, then work training for the other 6mos with a chance to be absorbed. The role is so-so, but under the specialisation I am aiming.

2. Mattress company (International) starting up locally. Only done an online assessment, so interview would be likely an initial one. What attracted me to this was the internship position and the specific job role. Also under a supply chain role. No other details available to me.

3. Consulting company. Only shortlisted, but no contact from them yet. Will likely be stuck in this highly specialised field if i entered it. Very good pay along the way, but hard. Not a lot of openings but also shortage of good applicants from what I've read.

Inputs are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I‚Äôve never had an internship and am a junior in college. This coming summer, I can either intern as a swe/data engineer or intern in cyber security. My thought process is that it makes sense to explore cyber security now because internships are relatively low commitment compared to a full on job. I go to a pretty good public school (ranked top 30). The cyber security internship I‚Äôm looking at will probably pay about $10 more an hour than the swe I might be able to get. Does it make more sense to try out cyber over swe for an internship this summer? Or is it just a bad idea since I‚Äôm certain I want to do swe and this is the last chance I have to get an internship? 

Cyber pros:
-explore a new field 
-pays better (just for this internship) 
-no experience needed

Swe pros:
-better suited to what I want to do
-makes it easier to get a good job out of college 
-closer to my home so probably wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for housing

-need more skills/need to prepare for interviews more

Although I do have a math degree, my CS experience is fairly minimal since I focused on medicine for so long, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to move into software engineering. I've taken two intro CS classes in undergrad (python and java) and used python in my bio research to do analysis and R in my current work in bio research after graduation.

masters in CS ( so I can apply to internships as a student)

BootCamp (I see Microsoft leap is currently accepting applications, but my math degree might disqualify me)

Personal projects (not sure how much companies value them)

more leetcode and apply anyways

But I'm sorta interested in cryptology (encryption and privacy are really interesting to me), and I want my job to matter somewhat, and have considered seeing if there's anything a CS graduate can do in nature conservation, or maybe ocean cleanup, etc. One thing I do know is that the idea of spending my life in an office, making software for banks, sounds like torture.

My thesis will be on evolutionary algorithms, but other than that, I won't have anything to show employers. I don't think programming is my passion though maybe I just haven't found my field.

I'm kind of just rambling. I'm worried about my future and don't want to end up hating what I do, nor do I want to have low prospects due to no projects.

xt8tmm,7,2022-10-01,Career Advice,Oleg-Fire,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/xt8tmm/career_advice/,"Hello fellow Canadians.

I am an iOS dev with 2 YOE and a couple of internships. Been working in one company for two years now, but because of absence of learning and relatively low TC (120k CAD) decided to interview with other companies.

Cleared interview for Amazon iOS SDE2 position. Unfortunately, team I interviewed with do not have open positions anymore. Recruiting manager proposed two other teams. I talked to managers of those teams and I am not really excited about joining them. My main concern that they do not have other iOS devs in the team so not sure what I will be able to learn there. Also, these teams have on-calls (AWS), which is another downside. 

Money should be good tho, I believe I can double my current TC. So not sure what to do. I see a couple of options:

1. Choose one of the teams in Amazon and sign an offer.
2. As inclined feedback for Amazon is valid for six months, wait for another team (maybe my initial team will get new positions soon) while interviewing with other companies (not sure which exactly).

I understand that Amazon will definitely give me a boost for a resume and TC, but not sure whether I should settle for something that I do not really like (at least from outside, maybe teams are great).

Any advice is appreciated."

I've done 2 software internships and some IT jobs (part-time helpdesk to part-time Asset Management Analyst) and I ended up getting promoted to our operations team full-time as a IT operations analyst (65k base + 10% bonus, Atlanta). The company currently I'm working for is a pretty large company.

My current responsibilities are Monitoring/incident reporting, some linux based stuff and level 2 tech support

The role I'm in now is nice, pays the bills, has a lot of internal growth but doesn't seem to further my career tooo much. In all honesty I didn't expect to get a role that's full-time in IT so most of my career research has been in software development. As a result, I just don't really know what's out there too much.

From my initial googling the best bet is to go for some certs, then leverage the experience + certs for a higher paying role/raise, but I'm not sure what roles or certs to even really aim for money/careerwise.  The other options that interest me is sales or devops but when looking into them I've heard those roles are really difficult to get into.

xtcmay,63,2022-10-01,How to get into financial crimes (for the government USA)?,Christy_2003,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/xtcmay/how_to_get_into_financial_crimes_for_the/,"I am interested in working in financial crimes. Being a Forensic Financial Analysis specifically or maybe a Forensic Accountant, etc. I want to work for the government compared to a bank for example because you gather and analyze evidence to help the law enforcement prosecute a case. To me it sound way more interesting and like an exciting career.

I am currently tailoring everything I do to this job, which is not a bright idea to be honest. I am obtaining a Bachelors of Science and Business Administration with a major in Finance &amp; Banking and a minor in Accounting. The only reason I am getting a minor is for this job because I think it will be vital. For this career you need a CPA and CFE license which I will try to obtain when I graduate in May 2023. I have also taken internships which would help me get this job (kinda). I interned at a bank over the summer. My thought was I could get my foot into the door for a bank that provides entry level jobs for this field even though I do not want to work for a bank. In spring 2023 I am taking an internship at a CPA office as a Tax/ Accounting Intern. The whole reason I took this is because I know you need 3 years of accounting experience for the FBI and I imagine other government agencies want experience in the field as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is what else can I do? Has anyone on here worked for a government agency for this field and have any advice for someone trying to enter it and how would I even go about doing it when I have no experience? Would also be interested in hearing what the field was like for someone who worked in it. Thank you in advance."

I‚Äôm in the final stages of my interview process at MIT LL for a software developer position and I‚Äôd like to know a realistic salary range expectation to negotiate with their HR department. I‚Äôd really appreciate input on this area (especially if you work/have worked there). What would be a healthy salary range for this?

Thank you! 

Some context:

I‚Äôm a system engineer but have coding experience in Python (mainly) and C++. I‚Äôm quite familiar with Object-Oriented Programming and I have some knowledge of software devlopment practices (agile, VC, etc). 

I have two years of experience as a system engineer at my current company and 3 internships experiences doing data science, math research and teaching. I have bachelors and a masters from great schools.

xtd0xr,1,2022-10-01,Not happy where I am.,BuritozSlayer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xtd0xr/not_happy_where_i_am/,"Despite what I say, I am NOT happy here.

Hey all. For some context, I am a freshman in college/university at the moment. I'd like to provide some background on myself to I guess further elaborate why I feel this way.

In high school, I was essentially the perfect student. I had a 3.98/4.0 GPA in the IB curriculum while also using my electives to take 6 AP classes (which I know isn't a lot if it were by itself, but IB crammed my schedule already and I literally couldn't fit any more). I also took a lot of IB electives, meaning I chose the hardest possible classes for myself in an attempt to stand out to colleges. Anyways, back to the stats: 

* 3.98/4.0 unweighted GPA
* 5.23 weighted GPA
* Class rank 20/796
* 36 ACT
* Captain of sports team, varsity athlete (24 hrs/week time commitment \[rowing\])
* 3rd place twice in the ISKA US Open in my age division
* Diverse background

I list out all these statistics because this is what I was told I needed to have to ""get into anywhere I wanted"" and surround myself by people that were of both my ""academic calibre"" and determination to succeed. I applied to around 12 schools. I was rejected by all except 3 state schools, two in my state and one up in New York (they were asking for \~350K over 4 years, so unfortunately, unable to go). I ended up picking the better state school of the two since I was eligible for a scholarship covering 100% tuition/housing costs. 

So why this post? Well, I fucking hate it here. I genuinely am not enjoying the school, the people, all of it. I guess I should provide further context. I aspire to be an investment banker in NYC for a few years before jumping ship and heading into private equity, hedge funds, or consulting. Unfortunately, already going to this school has put me at a disadvantage, and I'm now trying to kill it this year so I can get a chance at making it into this one very selective program we have that'll get me the best chance at placement in NYC. I've already been killing myself with stress over networking, maybe possibly hopefully getting an internship through a family connection (unsure if this is even likely) and getting a job ON TOP OF taking as many courses as I can and excelling in them ALL SO I CAN JUST APPLY TO A FUCKING PROGRAM IN THE HOPES I'LL GO SOMEWHERE. I'm not even halfway done with my first year here but I know once I get into this program I'll finally be at ease knowing I've at least tried to set myself up well. 

On to why I dislike the school.

The people here are not my crowd. I know how pretentious and shitty this sounds, but everyone's idea of having fun here is getting drunk, high, or both and going clubbing. I'm all down to do that maybe once every so often, as I'm not the biggest fan of intoxicating myself, but this is every. fucking. weekend. And I'm sick of it. I'm sick of my place hosting a bunch of drunk ass people so they can get even more fucked up before heading out to the club. I'm tired of it. I've joined clubs to try and get out of my apartment as much as I can because I genuinely hate this fucking place and am desperately seeking distractions. 

The city I'm in is a college town, or more specifically, the DEFINITION of a college town. There's jack shit to do here besides go out to bars or clubs, there's maybe a few outdoors activities to do (which at the moment I need to try and get people together to do), and on the weekends there's football games to watch. I enjoy the football games a lot, and it's nice to be in a group with people, but immediately after everyone wants to get drunk and I'm sorry but I've already had to take care of so many drunk friends I'm not sure I can keep doing it. This ""city"" has jack shit to do and I actually hate being here. 

What's crazy is this isn't even a bad school, it's a top 5 public, but holy shit do I fucking hate it here. I'm entirely convinced that had I made it to an Ivy or at least a school with something to do other than GET FUCKING WASTED I'd probably be way, way happier than I am and have been. I've also got depression (diagnosed) on top of this, and I went from being suicidal thought-free to daydreaming of killing myself just to get out of this fucking place. It's so bad that when we don't have a home game everyone literally gets up and leaves to go home because there's NOTHING TO DO. I FUCKING HATE THIS SCHOOL, I HATE THIS FUCKING CROWD, AND I FUCKING HATE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE TOLD ME I'D BE GOING PLACES IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN CLEARLY I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

I had an internship over the summer and man afterwards I was so excited to go back to school. With a corporate life it feels like you have no time. Like everyday after work the only thing you have time for is to sleep and eat. Obviously working out and finding new hobbies can certainly help a lot but the idea of not having a long-term break like summer or winter break freaks me out. Like, you have to request off?? Kinda crazy to think about. I mean, I guess if you look at things in the big picture the amount of time you spent studying is nearly the same as working since you have to study during the weekends too, but still. Weekends go by so fast. I don't want to get sucked into the 9-5 lifestyle, one day wake up 35 and have a mid-life crisis. Recently I've just been thinking of alternatives, like getting my masters, or taking a gap year but after writing a pros and cons list for each those, they simply are not realistic cost-wise.

Everything I am about to state happened in the last 365 days.

.Was in a nationwide research competition with over 100,000 applicants. Made it to the finals with just 75 people remaining and won two prizes. The competition from start to end lasted about 6 months.

. I am a non paid intern of one year at one of my country‚Äôs best colleges where I work as a lab assistant for a distinguished professor. I roughly have over 400 hours in the lab.

.I worked on two different really high level research projects at the college I am interning at. I will state them bellow üëá

-spectrochemical analysis of food dye using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
-study of moringa oleifera leaves as an antibacterial and anticancer agent using advanced laser induced breakdown spectroscopy technique.
( both still not published as it takes months or sometimes years to publish a research paper but I had my professor write me a letter of recommendation as proof)

.while doing research on food dye, I‚Äôve found some local brands harboring toxic elements like Arsenic and high concentrations of lead (I triple checked my results via LIBS and even used other advanced methods like ICP-AES for confirmation) and raised awareness in my household and other family households and they all completely got rid of all products including food dye manufactured by those brands.

.My friend and I organized nonprofit sessions where we helped over 15 students from our school on the same competition we were in (the research competition). We even managed to help some of them get in touch with professors from different colleges in my city to help them with their projects. The sessions lasted for a couple of weeks.

.I went on an educational trip to the UK with the same organization that held the competition that I was in (only 21 people from the finalists received this prize).

.GSSC (GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY SPACE CHALLENGE) participant (still participating the competition still isn‚Äôt over)

-part of the science lab at my school.


-some volunteering here and there 


LORs

-4 average LORs from teachers and school counselor

-1 strong LOR from the distinguished professor I worked for.


Honors 

-received a special plaque from my city‚Äôs minister of education.

-received a certificate from my high school for my participation in the research competition.

-another certificate from the research competition themselves.

-trophy for my involvement in the research competition (received from another competition still confused as to why).

-another certificate from oxmidca (the UK educational trip)

-Mawhiba alumni 


Academics 

I don‚Äôt have SAT/AP (financial issues and my school doesn‚Äôt provide either of those).
My CGPA is 99.28 and I am in the top 10% of my class.

No I don‚Äôt need financial aid I am full pay because I am going with my country‚Äôs ‚Äúculture mission ‚Äú so they‚Äôll pay full tuition.

xtl6hd,1,2022-10-02,Would you guess that rhe change in appearance is due to depression,jhlo9001,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/xtl6hd/would_you_guess_that_rhe_change_in_appearance_is/,"I remember that when I met her in freshman yr, she gave off the impression of being somewhat weird and a little‚Ä¶ mean? Like I guess gossip-y, like I was bothered bc she and her best friend (who recently admitted to having had a crush on me I guess at some point in 9th) I guess talked abt me behind my back. 

Our other friend regarded her as being untrustworthy, which she probably is or was. She was class president in 9th but disliked it.

I notice that this school yr she looks different - like the kind of different where I can tell that either she‚Äôs going through something mentally, or that she‚Äôs just decided to stop wearing makeup and be as comfortable as she can (I suspect it‚Äôs the former though, maybe a mixture of both.) 

What I mean is that she has acne now, looks tired, doesn‚Äôt look like she wears any kind of makeup, and looks like she‚Äôs gained weight. It‚Äôs a noticeable change from the end of junior yr. 

I remember getting the impression that she sympathized when I posted a vid crying abt how our classmates had called me. I know she told her best friend. 

She voted ‚Äúyes‚Äù on my poll from like months ago where I asked if you think the appearances of black women are judged more harshly but also voted that she sometimes accidentally votes another time 

She continued to follow me in sophomore yr and allow me to follow her private spam account even tho I blocked her best friend bc her best friend was starting too much drama. But still seemed to suspect I owned this acc, sort of, like she indirectly accused me of in spite of apologizing for bad communication 

I remember her best friend mentioned she is thinking of going into astronomy out of high school and I know she actually has a rlly good internship w NASA

She viewed all of my stories yesterday even though I posted like 10 of them. We‚Äôre in a specific extracurricular together 

She‚Äôs known for being smart. I know she deals w depression

xtli26,32,2022-10-02,"Should I resign, or am I being dramatic?",Interesting_Meat00,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/xtli26/should_i_resign_or_am_i_being_dramatic/,"I got accepted as an accounting intern in a BPO company last September 15, 2022, and now I am thinking of resigning. 

Here's what happened.

When my friends and I were initially accepted, three of their accounting staff just resigned, so when we got in, they were handing us their tasks and responsibilities. At first, the company started well since they provided us with a daily basis of compensation and a monthly snacks allowance.

However,   later on, our tasks seem very heavy for an OJT. Like they handed my friend all the disbursement functions of the company since the primary disbursement accountant left. As for me, I handled the treasury and payroll functions, which were held previously by two accountants. It was frankly stressful since I was responsible for their company payout after only a day of training. And I had the responsibility of converting cash and cash flow projections. Can someone imagine the pressure my friend and I are having, considering our company is a large international BPO company?

Anyway,   my boss persisted in us persevering, especially me, since she told us that the new treasury/payroll accountant starts next week. Monday came,   and the company's newly-hired treasury and payroll accountant, who I  was supposed to assist, resigned after one day at work. With no treasury accountant, I am clueless about what I will do since my superior expects me to have absorbed all that has been handed over to me from our previous treasury accountant after 1-2 days of training.

It is truthfully challenging and frustrating to meet their expectations,   especially when you are an intern and nobody is there to guide you rather than your boss, who is constantly busy and knows little about specific treasury and payroll tasks. Like for such a big international company,  there is only 12 accounting staff, including 4 of us interns.

It does not help to speak up about it to them since they will use it against you and indirectly make fun of or insult you about being incompetent, that they thought you could live up to your grades and resume. She had it as a joke, but it did not sit well with me as I felt disrespected.

One time, my boss called me for a meeting after our new treasury/payroll accountant resigned. There, she mocked one of the previous employees who resigned after a month due to anxiety, citing she was weak and backstabbed our senior accountant, who was on medical leave.

Is resigning from this company justifiable? The people I spoke to told me to stay since I am only an intern and I have no other choice. Can you spare me your thoughts?"

I'm 35. Got my associates degree in graphic design in my twenties and worked as a graphic designer. Went back to school in fall of last year. Started as a biochem major and quickly decided I loved math and hated biology. So I switched gears to a data science major last spring. Took algebra and trig at the same time to get caught up. Also took comp sci 1 and a class on data mining / wrangling where I learned various methods in R. And a data visualization class. This semester, technically my junior year because of how many credits transferred, i'm in calculus w/analytical geometry, into to data analytics (using python and learning various statistical models, taught by a data scientist), and comp sci 2. Those are all the relevent classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I'm spending all of my free time working through [this book](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) on learning Python for data science, working through codewars problems daily, and having the eventual goal of working on a personal data science project over spring break to add to my github.

&amp;#x200B;

I only tell you all this because it's the start of my junior year. And most of my classmates are starting to apply for internships. My resume is pretty sparse. My only professional experience is as a graphic designer and the retail job I'm currently working. I have 2 school projects that involve data science. Given the things I'm learning now, do you think it's too early for me to be applying to internships? Are there things you think I should be doing that I'm not currently doing? I absoutely love learning and am learning as fast as possible on all fronts. But as Richard Feynman said, ""direction is more important than speed"". So I just wanted to ask some people on here if they thought that there were other things I could / should be doing or if I should just pump the breaks on the internship thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Another side note - my data science program at school was just added to the catalogue and is relatively new. The professors are really great and very helpful, but it is a new program. Which is why I wanted to also ask people on here their opinions. Thanks so much for any advice!"

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to kill myself in 2019 (16y), ever since then i got a lot better, i learned a lot about myself going to therapy every week. Eventually found a girlfriend and got the opportunity to study in a place I love. Moved away from my abusive parents, today i live with other two college students and found an internship in a place I love.

However ever since February everything has kinda been falling apart inside of me, i have not been doing good mentally at all. I think i have been working (reflecting and healing) on the years of trauma of my childhood or something. But its been so hard. I live away from my home country, in a colder and less populated part of Europe. I just miss my family and dogs a lot too, which has been contributing for my downfall.

In August things with my gf really hit a breaking point, we were discussing a lot and it was putting me so down, so we decided to break up (to give each other some time to heal). It breaks my heart to say it was because of my mental health and the space and distance i needed, as i truly believe she is the one.

Financially things have gotten a lot worse too, i am barely making enough money to survive and im really at the bottom.

The thing is, i always dealt with suicidal thoughts and ideas. Most of them come from the place of not wanting to live this pain anymore. But this feels different, this feels like a decision. Next sunday i will kill myself, i know it will be the best for me, but it really scares me. It scares me that my family will suffer, that my ex (whom loves me a lot too) will suffer and all my other friends and co-workers.

I just feel too broken to keep on going and i don't know what else to do.

I am sorry."

Here's a little bit about my academic background. I have a Bachelor and Master degree in Physics. After graduating, I worked a researcher with a professor in the area pertaining to mathematical physics and dynamics on curved space for two years. Further, I obtained a master's degree in astronomy and astrophysics (A &amp; A) because it has always fascinated me. I kept in touch with my previous professor with whom I did my mathematical physics research during my master's program in astronomy and astrophysics. A first authored paper based on that research got published recently, and another is in development. Furthermore, during my master's program in A &amp; A, I became deeply interested in computational astrophysics and ML and AI applications in astrophysics.I graduated from the program last year in September 2021 and started applying to various doctoral positions according to my research interests. Besides that, I got an internship as a data scientist in remote sensing was doing well professionally.

Now I got accepted for the following two Ph.D. positions-

1. Ph.D. (Computational Astrophysics) ,Spain-focuses on galaxy and cosmology research.
2. Ph.D. in AI/ML for weather forecasting, Belgium.

My dilemma is what position to accept so that I can have a decent career in case I don't make it further into academia. I understand the uncertainty associated with an academic career and how it may not be possible to achieve tenure-track positions. In that case, I have to look for opportunities in the industry. Therefore, if the previous statement is taken into account and the fact that I have financial responsibilities towards my family ( unmarried btw) now, the second Ph.D. position seems to be a good choice. Considering that the second Ph.D. position will be heavily focused on AI and Data Science, it is more relevant to the job market. In addition, the stipend associated with this PhD position is 800 euro more than the first one, so I will be financially much more secure. However,the computational astrophysics PhD sounds really interesting and is an excellent opportunity. The only downside is the low salary and maybe jumping from one post doc to other until I find a good position. However, if I am unable to do to do so then I have to again find a job as data scientist or ML. Therefore, in that sense the second PhD makes more sense than the first one."
xts35y,3,2022-10-02,Advice for life in general.,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/xts35y/advice_for_life_in_general/,"CS here. I've been pretty anxious about my looks, body and stuff for several years and have not removed my mask in college even once because of shame. Struggle to maintain contact with friends / create friends because of a past experience where I was very close to a friend and things broke out as I became too depressed and cut out all ties with my friends. Used to SH but been a little while since I relapsed.

Things aren't great home financially and think about it all the time. Had to suddenly evacuate old house and the bank took over it, even now the fear of family members being arrested because of the said financial problems is there.

Life has been in a downhill for several years, not sure why a 19-year-old has to go through this, I think if I was 25-30ish I could have managed it fine.

Got into CS as I enjoy it and really love it. Have decent grades (85%+) but failing to get internships I want and most people in my class have gotten internships already. I feel exhausted all the time, jealous of others nice life, and struggle to even step out of my house unless necessary. Anxiety of the future is slowly runinig me. Hell, I even feel tired as soon as I get up.

I've started at my current company in 2018 as an Intern and truly loved my job, I was a young reference to everyone. At the end of my contract (for nearly 2 years), they didn't have any position available so I resigned and used that time to focus mostly in my graduation.

After that time, I really wanted to get a real and important experience on my resume, so I've did an interview and got back to work as an Analyst at my previous area. Obviously, I've already knew the most part of the job and it got boring very fast, and I'm not even mentioning the part where I was BURIED in a massive operational workload.

So, four months ago, I was able to change areas and got promoted to my current position. I've asked everyone for this position, since it's a more analytical role, and people trusted me that I'd be a good fit; able to do an amazing work. 

The problem is that, right now, I have to deal everyday with micromanagement, disorganization, massive workloads, and an insane amount of pressure, while I am dealing with very important and urgent projects. and all of this are increasing significantly my anxiety and depression, to the point that I am having a panic attack everyday before I get to work. 

For my mental health, I want to quit and take time to heal myself, even if there is no other thing to do. But I have an interview next week that I am very excited about, and the company seems a workplace with an amazing work-life balance - which is everything that I am looking forward right now.

However, even if I pass in the interview, I am facing a very complicated context that makes think twice before I quit, such as:

1. My team is already colapsing - my manager is about to take her annual leave;
2. My intern is about to leave to another area;
3. We have two very complex and urgent projects that will affect the company as whole;
4. I am already friends with people that I work with for a long time, even my micromanager, and I am afraid of being perceived as unreliable, having my image hurted and incapable of maintain the friendships and network that I've already build for myself;
5. I feel that I own them for my current role, and I feel that I am betraying them for leaving now, in such a chaotic enviroment.

Someone already have been in this position? What would you do if you were in my position?"
xtvqgv,1,2022-10-02,Is it fair for a final-year undergrad to hire interns from a company he got registered to work on an open-source project that pays grants?,ganeshkanchi_AOS,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xtvqgv/is_it_fair_for_a_finalyear_undergrad_to_hire/,"I applied for a few internships online with my web dev projects and one of them had the requirement of being able to learn a new programming language to which I had applied too after which I was asked to complete an assignment that I did submit. I then got invited to an interview which I thought went very bad as I wasn't very good with the language required yet, and at the end of the interview, the interviewer told me ""I'll talk to my team and get back to you in 2-3 days"" as it was said I got a call at 11 am saying I was selected for the internship and my stipend was set at x/month to work from 10 am to 6 pm remotely. I was also asked to join a meet instantly to meet the team which was just me and another intern who was also in his final year. the same day we were asked to watch a 30 hours long course about blockchain development with solidity within the next 3 days which we weren't able to complete until 3 days additionally. after completing the course we were put on a project to build a smart contract for an open source project that pays grants upon contribution to their repository. being asked to know everything about web3 after learning it for 10 days seems a bit too unrealistic and the fact that the founder/interviewer that hired me told me he had a team which turns out he doesn't which I have confirmed through the employs section of the organization's LinkedIn page."

I wanna move to the US because I have a green card already (I have family that lives in Florida) and salaries for programmers here are depressing to say the least. 

I‚Äôm looking for a state where I‚Äôd be compensated well, but also a  slightly racially diverse place (I‚Äôm half white half black latino, It‚Äôd be nice to meet some Spanish speakers but also new people from around the world), with many young people to make friends with, and generally vibrant. 

A climate similar to Italy‚Äôs would be fine, but I‚Äôd be fine with anything other than hellish hot or extreme cold(extreme cold being avg temps under 0 for multiple months of the year).

How would I proceed about this? I was thinking of finishing my bachelors, working 2 years here and then looking for offers in the states, but I wonder if it‚Äôd be feasible straight out of uni?"

My resume is by no means stacked. I have one prior internship at a defense company.

3.6 gpa at a good school, a few projects involving python, c++, web app.

I guess I got kinda complacent, but I kinda thought it would be easier to get interviews with prior experience. I got my cv checked by a few ppl to make sure the formatting is alright.

So I started applying earlier September, probably applied maybe 30-40 companies. Out of that batch I got 2 interviews. Rejected after one and one coming up. Neither are very well known companies.

Was sick with Covid during mid September which threw things off. In the past week, I felt bad cause I realized how behind I was so I filled out more apps, probably at around 100 by now.

But it‚Äôs pretty discouraging. I‚Äôm grinding LC but I feel like I don‚Äôt have the opportunity to showcase my skills. I didn‚Äôt expect to get interviews left and right, but thought I would get more opportunities."

**TL;DR:** 



Summary | Relevant Section
---|---
Considering an OSU post-bacc  | *Background*
Currently have a good job  | *Current Role*
Concerned about doing full-time work + school + stuff CS majors are supposed to do get offers | *My concern*
Particularly concerned about having to leave a good job to get internships | *My concern -&gt; internships*


**Background:**

I have a BA in Philosophy and Political Science. I've completed CS50, Nand2Tetris, Helsinki Java I, and an introductory Python class at my local CC over the past two years. 

However, I‚Äôve recently realized that I‚Äôd like to have some more structure, accountability, and community in my CS education. I'm thinking about enrolling in the OSU online post-bacc to give me a solid CS foundation and eventually transition into tech. I also considered OMSCS, but getting my ducks in a row to apply would likely take at least a year, and I worry that jumping straight to OMSCS while working full time might be a recipe for burnout. I might get to OMSCS eventually, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right thing for me at this time. 

**Current Role:**

I make pretty good money working at a large bank at the moment. I have a fantastic manager, good career prospects, and I‚Äôve had the opportunity to do some reporting automation with VBA (hopefully going to make use of Python as well, but getting stuff to work in a tightly controlled computing environment can be a huge pain). I‚Äôm currently (slowly) working through the Odin Project in the hopes that I might pick up enough web dev to be able to work on an LOB app my business function will be standing up if we can get the funding for it. 

**My concern:**

I‚Äôd like to keep my current job while studying, but am concerned about balancing a full-time job, school, *and* doing all of the extracurriculars that CS students are supposed to do while earning their degree. Everything I‚Äôve read seems to indicate that CS students need projects, internships, and to spend time picking up extra skills (e.g., tooling, Leetcode, TDD, Unix, new languages) to succeed, and doubly so if they‚Äôre gunning for the top-tier new grad offers. 

While I have really enjoyed the learning I‚Äôve done so far, to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure I have it in me to do all of those things. Just work and school are pretty challenging ‚Äî I took Calc II last winter while working full time to prove to myself that I could succeed in challenging STEM courses, and that one class made those four months a slog. 


* Extracurricular learning:
I‚Äôll certainly continue to pick up some skills at work, and maybe have time for the occasional MOOC. Leetcode actually seems sort of fun ‚Äî the problems feel like CS50 exercises on steroids. That being said, I find it hard to imagine having the time and energy to be able to keep up with even moderately driven undergrads. 
* Projects:
While I‚Äôve really enjoyed some of the projects I‚Äôve done as part of courses (building the HACK computer, OS, and jack compilers are easily some of the coolest things I‚Äôve ever done) ‚Äî I often draw a blank when it comes to making my own projects outside of automating reporting tasks at work. I think part of it is that I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy doing anything UI-related, and most good portfolio projects seem to need one. 

* Internships:
I‚Äôm particularly concerned about internships ‚Äî I‚Äôm hoping that I can change roles at my current company or craft my current job to be more tech-oriented, but if I can‚Äôt, leaving a well-paying job for a temporary internship seems like a huge gamble. 


*I‚Äôm hoping some of you might have some words of wisdom. Thanks in advance!*"

Hello, I'm a French game programmer that just finished school from a private school specialized in game developpement this june after 4 years studying. To get my degree I now need to get at least 3 months of experience (with internship, contract, freelance or whatever, we need to work), starting before 2023.

First, I applied to companies that only make games that seems good to me (really rare, they all fall into this metaverse, crypto, VR thing, not my taste). Failure. Next,I tried everywhere, I always fail their sh!itty test that takes days to do, I almost don't sleep, have to skip school, or at the interview because I'm stressed.

Then a company contact my school to publish a internship offer on Unreal Engine with C++, great, this is what I want to do (even if they make serious game, I probably still learn some stuff). So I send my candidacy, the CEO reply in hours, we directly schedule an interview. This go well, BUT, apparently a school colleague were faster and have taken the Unreal Engine position. So they offer me to go on an other project that is built on Unity. Ok why not, I accept this is better than nothing.

Right before I started my internship, ID Sofwtare reply to my candidacy I made 1 month ago telling me they are interested and they want me to do a C++ test in 48H. I can't decline, so I do it, I thought I failed it because the math part was not easy. In fact they want me to schedule an interview, questionning me about C++ et 3D math in 40 minutes (this was supposed to last an hour), I failed.

Now I'm in ""internship"", were I don't have any supervisor. Yes this dude leave the company the day after I joined wtf. I spend my time pretending, while in fact I'm trying to escape and find an other job, but nothing work, I apply to 20 offers a week at least. I get ghosted, or receive their corporate capy/pasted decline mail.

I'm planning to leave right after my 3 mandatory job ""experience"", and if I can't find anything in the meantime I would have to go indie (that does not bother me, I always wanted to make my games, but after getting enough experience and connection to recruit other devs) while doing minimum wage job to get an income.

Honestly I'm loosing hope."

Is there no way to be both?,salmonpaddy,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/xtz1ql/being_funoutgoing_vs_focusedhardworking_is_there/,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a senior in college and I was diagnosed when I was roughly 13 years old. I have ADHD-C, and I have been taking medicine for approx. 8 years, probably.

I experimented with Ritalin, Concerta, and eventually settled on Adderall. For school and task-related aspects, Adderall completely transformed my performance. I have become a high-achiever over the years and I prioritize my academic success; I‚Äôm also a bit of a perfectionist to the point where it can be detrimental to my mental health.

Being in my final year of university, I‚Äôm trying to end on a high-note, and my courses are much more challenging. Still, I‚Äôve been managing to pull A‚Äôs in each of my assignments/exams so far. On paper, things are great. 

The only problem is I feel as though I‚Äôve realized how different my medicine makes me feel. I actually suppose I‚Äôve always known that I feel/act different on my medicine, but it‚Äôs starting to get to me more now. 

I feel far more serious, to the point where I don‚Äôt laugh or joke around as much. I also get incredibly hangry due to the appetite suppressant of Adderall, and in general I find myself to be less outgoing and personable and more robotic and focused on doing what needs to be done. 

I just don‚Äôt know if I like this version of myself anymore. I want to be enjoying my senior year but all I can do is worry about getting everything in my assignments 100% correct.

I also feel way less creative. This past summer I didn‚Äôt take Adderall at all (although I was in my internship), and my music production and motivation to do new things was off the charts. But I also didn‚Äôt feel remotely involved in my work, on the flip side.

I feel kind of sad because maybe it‚Äôs just a bad day, but I don‚Äôt want to have to choose between being happy, bubbly, creative, and silly versus being determined, hard-working, focused, and a good student/worker. 

Is this the choice that has to be made? I hate that this is something that I‚Äôm struggling with, and I‚Äôm starting to resent my ADHD because of it"

xu0x9x,7,2022-10-02,Return offer to work under drunk manager,PurestSeaSalt,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/xu0x9x/return_offer_to_work_under_drunk_manager/,"
Last summer, I had an internship with a really big company and I absolutely loved the experience of living and working with the other interns. Doing software work as an EE major wasn‚Äôt too bad and I definitely learned a lot, but the real highlight came from meeting a bunch of my peers and hearing about the kind of work they were doing.

One of my fellow interns I got to know pretty well was on a team doing a lot of customer-facing work. This involved a lot of driving around the country and talking to people about ways in which we could improve our products, which I recognize as an important part of the engineering process but something I‚Äôve never really seen myself doing. In getting to know him, I also ended up speaking with his manager a couple of times and it became obvious that something was up.

Firstly, it seemed like the manager and his team went out drinking quite often. Sometimes my friend would join them, and sometimes I was invited, but I always said no because I‚Äôd rather not drink in that kind of environment. Then, I slowly began to notice the manager showing up to work drunk at least once or twice a week. At first, I found it almost funny, especially because I wasn‚Äôt working in his team, but I did make a note of how annoying that would be if I were.

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve transitioned into a part-time student position doing the same work I did in my internship and in the same team, but I just recently received a return offer to come back next summer and work under that same manager who I met months ago. This leaves me conflicted because i like the company and would love to come back for another internship, but I don‚Äôt really want to work with that person and I‚Äôm not super interested in the work his team does, especially because it would pull me from state to state all summer.

Am I valid in feeling this way, or is it really not a big deal if my manager comes to work drunk? I really want to ask if I can instead work on a different team, but I‚Äôm worried it would affect my return offer and/or my current part time position.

Any advice would be appreciated"

My coursework taught me mainly SQL, R, and Python. Trying to get an entry level job as a data analyst or business analyst, but it has been hard. Seemingly all positions require knowledge of things like Tableau or Power BI, along with many other programs that I have never heard of before. Business analysts want you to have past experience working with business or a degree in business. Data analyst jobs in the medical field want you to have experience working in the medical field. Data analysts in a biological field want you to have biology experience. All I have is experience working with R, Python, and SQL, which seemingly does not qualify me for any position anywhere. To make matters worse, I switched into data science late and have no internship experience. Throughout all my applications, I can't even land a single interview. So what is the best course forward? Google Data Analytics Certificate? Learn Tableau or Power BI through Maven Analytics or some other service? Just work on my own projects to add to my resume? Go get a masters degree online? Most posts I see are people asking how to get into the data science/data analyst field from someone switching careers and no degree, so my question is what's the next step after obtaining a data science degree when you seemingly have a 0% chance of getting a job?

Interned at company A this summer, got a full time offer, and accepted. They are a large company (F100) which is going through some financial headache, and might jump at an opportunity to rescind their offer if say, contacted by company B saying I double-signed.

Got an offer from company B recently. They are a privately owned medium sized company (\~1k employees), which is growing and definitely wants to sign me. With that being said, during the process they asked me about my deadlines with A and lied about accepting, telling them I had more time to decide than I did. As their offer was about to expire, I accepted it as well.

I immediately got sent a background check from the same company (HireRight) as company A, and realized I was an idiot. Company A is a previous employer due to the internship, and also paid me a sign on bonus (of course I'd pay it back if I reneged company A). I checked TheWorkNumber and saw that my sign-on bonus from company A is available on there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm *still* unsure of which company I want to go with, to be honest, but what should I do:

In the event I want to join company B?

* Explain to the recruiter what I did, apologize, and hope they forgive the lie and onboard me as normal?
* Freeze TheWorkNumber, provide paystubs for company A in background check, and hope no contacting occurs?

&amp;#x200B;

In the event I want to join company A?

* Explain unforeseen circumstances came up that made me want to go with A to B, and apologize for signing preemptively?

&amp;#x200B;

Or are there other options I should consider? This decision has been stressful enough without worrying I might screw myself out of both jobs if I misstep. I definitely messed up by signing B when I did, and I'm hoping someone here has some sound insight on how to navigate this situation well."

I am quite stressed right now and I‚Äôm not sure if I should be? I am in the midst of a mid career switch. I recently graduated from school after a decade of working in corporate. So after graduated I worked for this startup for 2-3 months without pay. It‚Äôs not an internship- they‚Äôre just use those months to see if you are qualified to work with them before offering an actual salary. However I‚Äôve been doing their marketing work and coming down for meetings.

So last week this startup finally offered me an employment contract and also a high salary starting from October which means they are not paying me since end July- the time when I started doing work for them.

I applied for an apprenticeship with a major company and I managed to get in. So what is making me a little worried is  I haven‚Äôt told the startup that I have decided to not take up their permanent job offer due to this opportunity but before I do that, this major company hired another company to do a background check.

Part of me do not really care cos I have already aced the interview and I‚Äôve told the recruiter I‚Äôve worked for this startup and it‚Äôs freelance work. But at the same time what if this company who does the background check call the startup and then they say that yes xx is with us but only from October instead of July - October? And there‚Äôs no pay stubs cos they‚Äôve not been paying me so I don‚Äôt have any documents to show any proof.

Why am I feeling so nervous when I‚Äôve done nothing wrong? The only reason I‚Äôve put up with them not paying me was cos I wanted to use the experience to land me the apprenticeship. 

Is there anything I should do? Should I just tell the startup the truth- I cannot accept the full time cos I am joining an apprenticeship so at least she‚Äôs aware of my plans and perhaps can say the right things when the background check company call her(hr)? Or do I wait till I confirm pass the background check then tell her?

Any advice would be great. Thank you!"

Hello everyone!

I am a student at Penn in the[ Vagelos Life Sciences and Management (LSM) program](https://lsm.upenn.edu/program/about). The program accepts ""approximately 24 exceptional students and offers them the opportunity to pursue an interdisciplinary curriculum combining bioscience and business, leading to the completion of two degrees."" During my year, only 21 students were enrolled, spots are reserved for transferred students. LSM was my dream college program, and I was shocked when I got in. I had a fairly successful round of college acceptance, I was admitted to half of the T20 schools I applied to (and mostly waitlisted at others). Beyond Penn, I was admitted by Northwestern, Stanford, and Swarthmore (which comprised my four final choices).

**Why am I writing this post?**

I feel like a lot of students are unaware of the CDD programs offered at Penn. Coming to people, I hear a lot of people lament about how they wished they heard about LSM earlier, so they could've applied. The word often only gets spread by alumni to their high schools, within family members, or by mentors. So I'm here to publicize it for you all and give you some tips (if you want any).

**What's the value of a CDD program like LSM?**

If the 24 students accepted a year, which means around a 1% acceptance rate last year wasn't enough to convince you that people are demanding it, I'll give you practical reasons.

First, because it's a highly valued program within people who know about it, students often choose to come to LSM (and other CDD programs) over other schools. We get cross-admits from different Ivy Leagues, Stanford, and MIT. Within this microenvironment, you'll find your peers to be extremely sharp, brilliant, and passionate. As someone who wishes to pursue entrepreneurship, this type of close network of highly talented individuals who can boudary span across discipline was what I needed. And although Northwestern and Stanford are more traditional entrepreneurship schools (which is why I applied), I felt like LSM would provide me with more value. Penn is also gearing up strongly towards entrepreneurship, with[ Tangen Hall](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/new-campus-buildings-house-centers-innovation-and-collaboration) opening last year and the[ extremely large cash prizes Penn gives](https://curf.upenn.edu/presidents-innovation-prize) (which I haven't found another school except MIT match for undergrads). In addition, the broader Penn ecosystem is home to the nations oldest medical school, Penn Medicine, and the world's first collegiate and best business school, the Wharton School. Wharton is often able to procure students from other schools alone.

I would say Penn understands the fact that the students in LSM are special. Being part of LSM means having access to some of the most accomplished professors at Penn. The two professors leading LSM, Dr. Burns and Dr. Rea both have impressive credentials. Dr. Burns received his MBA and PhD from the University of Chicago and has published many books on the business of biotechnology, scientific discoveries, healthcare, and etc. He currently teaches at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Rea received both of his terminal degrees from Oxford University, before proceeding to publish at Cambridge University, later joining the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania.

One of the core classes in LSM is LSMP 1210. Dr. Burns stated LSMP 1210 is one of the only courses (and the only course within the Ivy League) where you have professors from two schools teaching within the same classroom (he jokingly said sometimes it‚Äôs even hard for professors in different departments within one school to collaborate). LSMP 1210 is a proseminar class that follows the outline of an MBA course taught at The Wharton School with modifications. One modification is the guest speakers invited to the seminars are tailored for biotechnology. I cannot stress enough about how valuable these guest speakers are; you would hear from industry leaders within biotechnology, bioengineering, and life science businesses. One year, LSM invited the former CEO of Merck, Roy Vagelos, as a guest speaker. He was the CEO of Merck when it was at its height and helped combat river blindness. Today, he serves on the board of Regeneron.

**How does one know that LSM and other CDD programs are successful?**

As one of our guest speakers,[ David B. Solit](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/david-solit) (director of the MSK Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology) states, you know you're successful when others try to copy you.

LSM hosts an annual retreat, where guest speakers from a variety of life science sectors attend. This year, a couple of the guest speakers were Penn alumni, but Harvard was also kind enough to contribute some of their successful life sciences alumni to our retreat. As the faculty from both schools were talking, I learned that Harvard tried to start an ""LSM"" program at their school. However, they were unsuccessful mainly because a river divides Harvard Business School and their Health Sciences institution, their Medical school is also not as compact as Penn Medicine is with Wharton. A cross-classroom environment where faculties from two different schools co-teach in the same classroom regularly would've been difficult as the faculty explained. Additionally, if I am not mistaken, Harvard recently approved a[ proposal](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/4/6/fas-double-concentration/) for double majors, so an undergraduate coordinated dual-degree program would've definitely been too revolutionary for now.

However, UCB has copied some of Penn's programs. First, MET copied Jerome Fisher M&amp;T in 2017, they had their first graduating class. And more recently, the[ Robinson Life Sciences Business and Entrepreneurship Program](https://light.berkeley.edu/o/investment-transforms-life-sciences-and-business-ecosystem/) was started, which quoting from UCB, they were ""inspired by the Vagelos \[LSM\] program at the University of Pennsylvania."" I was surprised that they mentioned Penn this time (because they didn't for their M&amp;T copy), but Penn and Harvard faculty explained it was because they hired a Wharton professor to advise and direct their new program, and has a Harvard MBA/JD as their co-char, so both Ivy Leagues were keenly aware.

As the older program at an Ivy League school, I think the biggest advantage Vagelos LSM has over Robinson is that we have a strong and developed alumni network. That is Wharton's gift to all business students (and the entire Penn community really), it's the alumni connections. If you ever want to work at a large life sciences company like Merck, Regeneron, Moderna, or Pfizer ([the mRNA vaccines were developed at Penn](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/covid-19-mrna-vaccine-uses-fundamental-penn-technology-receives-fda-approval)), just remember their connections to Penn. You will get the job and internship more easily if you're from Penn, and your chances are even higher if you're in LSM.

Thank you for your patience, and for reading my long post, ask me any questions!"

xu95ft,145,2022-10-03,Being a therapist when you're lonely really sucks,LovelyDovah,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/xu95ft/being_a_therapist_when_youre_lonely_really_sucks/,"I felt like something inside me snapped and gave up on Friday after a tough day. 

I'm a doctoral intern who went across the country for grad school and had an awful experience both in the program and with the location/culture that I moved to. It was five years of distancing myself from department drama and feeling isolated and at odds with the place I was living. The one thing that kept me going through the five years was the hope that my client work combined with working my ass off could land me a spot back home where I had friends, family, my partner, and love for the place. Internship placements got announced, and nope. I got placed somewhere else I needed to uproot to. At least I've heard good things about the school and the place, so I held up hope to get through the year. And it's been pretty bittersweet since. I got injured immediately before the move and had to rely on my dad and partner for everything up to my first day of work. Also didn't even have time to establish a routine, which is harder to do now that I'm busy. I like where I moved, but I cannot make friends for the life of me. Everyone here is already established. My cohort members are from in-state with their friends and families here. I tried to get close to them, but they are too busy with partners and existing friends to make plans with new friends. Tried to not rely on them and join Meetup to make friends, but it feels like first dates the friendship version that haven't really gone anywhere. My friends back home still miss me, but they're busy and are rarely the ones to reach out. I just am tired of being on year 6 of having very little going on in life outside of work and feeling like autopilot is the only way to get day to day because setting down strong roots in temporary positions feels near impossible. I also can't get myself to prep for post-doc apps because I am so scared of uprooting yet again with no end in sight. Even if I know I have a better chance going where I want for post-doc (so I'm told), I just feel unable to get my hopes up and scared of going on 7 years separated from loved ones.

On Friday, one of my coworkers casually mentioned I should check out first Friday downtown. I smiled and agreed and then broke down in my office over lunchtime because it just felt like another instance of someone suggesting I do fun things but at a distance. Then I had two clients in a row dump a ton of new trauma on the way out while I had the next person waiting in the lobby. I do try to conduct sessions so it doesn't happen, and I never think it's the client's fault. I just was a bit worn down already. And to add to it, I co-lead a skills group and multiple people shared for long periods of time about things that weren't even really related, and it led to my lesson plan needing to be cut in half. I felt really critical of how I conducted the group because I got much more didactic than I would like and rushed through it. The rest of the day I felt like I felt like my boundaries and efforts were disrespected by the clients when it was totally a personal reaction and not on them. 

I get in a tough headspace when I feel like the only people I communicate with regularly are clients, distanced coworkers, and supervisors who I am relying on for a letter of rec. I've tried to make friends here and will keep trying. And I keep in touch with friends back home when I can. But I just feel like the long-term imbalance of work self versus personal self has been really tough. I've gotten the the point of feeling nervous when having too much attention or talking about myself, where I can't shake feeling like everything I say in informal conversations needs to be very intentional and focused on the other person's needs. I also feel like I'm being evaluated in the way I would be in supervision or seminar, even in casual conversations. Or that when people even make casual talk about their weekends, I am the only one without anything to talk about except for chores. I'm usually comfortable in my own skin, but I hold relationships really sacred and meaningful to me. Life without them just feels hollow. And it gets to me having the role of a therapist without any solid reciprocal relationships I can lean on outside of a screen.

TLDR: I'm a trainee who has been uprooting and moving for 6 years for my career, and it feels near impossible to make any adult friendships besides those I made before grad school. I'm feeling really warn down and a bit off with my social needs and identity due to being a therapist most of the time and rarely get to just be a person. Most any friend time I get is through a screen where we report back about our lives rather than make meaningful memories together. The loneliness just hits harder when you have to go back to being an emotional blanket for others on Monday.

Sorry for the rant. Felt like I needed to get the emotions out somewhere, and the nuances of how I feel are absolutely tied to being a therapist (hence using this subreddit). Anyone else relate?"

My first internship was a ‚ÄúDEI‚Äù program (think UberStars, Google STEP, FBU, etc‚Ä¶). One thing I‚Äôve always found interesting is how these programs want to maximize underrepresented groups (women, POC, etc..) without taking into account their financial status. 

I don‚Äôt see why a woman from a rich family should be prioritized over a man from a poor family? 

Likewise, does it really make sense to show preference to a rich Black kid, rather then a poor white kid? 

Just curious what others think about programs like this. Is there some legal restriction which prevents companies from doing this (filtering intern candidates via parent‚Äôs income)? 

TLDR: The most underrepresented group in tech are kids from poor families. DEI should focus on them."

i'm currently looking around for some junior/new grad jobs for after my graduation date, and a lot of them seem to not even take a look at you until you complete a timed coding assessment. the problem is, i have a disability that prevents me from completing timed assessments (i.e., do xyz in 2 hours) in a way that accurately reflects my skills. this limitation extends to exams in college, but i get accommodations that allow for the extra time i need to give my best work. note that i haven't had this issue with multiple day deadlines, just short and hard-timed single-session assessments. 

this was a large roadblock in my hunt for an internship, as many companies that seemed interested in my skills prior did not feel that i did a satisfactory job on the coding assessments. i was lucky enough to receive an offer from a company that did not have a timed coding assessment as part of the interview process, but as i look around for new grad positions, it seems that many of them require some sort of timed coding assessment for consideration. 

does anyone have experience with finding alternatives to these timed assessments? is there anything with the ADA that could help me out in my job search? it's really discouraging that most companies that i've seen that are hiring require these types of things when, again, most of those types of assessments do not accurately reflect my skills"
xua0u0,4,2022-10-03,I went from Valedictorian to college drop out,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/xua0u0/i_went_from_valedictorian_to_college_drop_out/,"In high school I studied a ton, got a 4.0 GPA, took 11 AP classes and graduated as 3rd in my class of 650 (not quite valedictorian, but close enough). I got an academic scholarship to the best school in my state. In college I decided to not spend as much time studying but I still managed a 3.85 GPA in my first 4 semesters, had a research job, and plans to get a PhD in Economics. In college I was definitely not the smartest, but I was still always in the top third of all my classes. 

This was 2.5 years ago and my life has only gone down hill. The Summer of 2020 I had an internship and a summer job offer that both got cancelled due to covid. Come the end of the semester I tried looking for another job but after a few interviews I  instead started playing video games. I had occasionally played video games throughout my life but usually only ever for a few hours a week. I had enough money saved up so I just ended up playing video games that whole summer. I literally would sometimes play 16-20 hours a day but probably averaged closer to 12. I felt guilty so I told my parents and friends that I was working. 

Anyways, come the fall semester I got a new research job and started up classes. For some reason I could not focus at all and had brain cloud to the point where I got nothing from lectures. I started having anxiety around assignments and would play video games all night long to avoid doing my schoolwork. I felt horrible this whole time I just lost all self control and ability to study. I ended up withdrawing from all my classes and got fired from my job. I kept telling my family everything was fine this whole time. 

The next semester I recommitted but did essentially the exact same thing. After a month I stopped going to classes completely and after 2 months I withdrew. Now, that summer I got a job doing door to door sales of pest control in California. I worked super hard at this and didn‚Äôt play hardly any games. Near the end of the summer I told my dad I had not completed my last two semesters and he had me meet with a psychiatrist and a therapist. Fall of 2021 I started strong, but ultimately stopped going to classes and withdrew. I had been prescribed antidepressants but they made me extremely suicidal so I stopped taking them after 3 months. I met with my therapist 6 times but I really didn‚Äôt like him or think I was getting anything out of it so I stopped. I again started my next semester thinking I could do it this time. (I really don‚Äôt know why my school kept letting me withdraw so much.) Unfortunately, the exact same thing happened. I had brain fog and panic attacks and ultimately stopped going. Summer of 2022 I did sales again and I was basically happy the entire time I was working. I also went on a 3 week road trip with a couple friends and had a blast the whole time. I started talking to more people about my mental health issues including my sister whom I go to the gym with every day. 

This fall semester I started up and it has been about 4 weeks now. I have not looked at my assignments or gone to class in over 2 weeks. I feel extremely depressed and don‚Äôt think I will ever be able to graduate or fulfill any of life dreams. I don‚Äôt understand! My whole life I loved school and spent all my free time reading books and playing sports. Now I am basically a depressed college drop out who has completely failed at the one thing I have always been good at. 

What do I do? A huge part of me wants to move to a new country and run away from all my family and social obligations. I still have this longing to get a PhD in Economics, but now I‚Äôm 24 without a bachelors and life is looking hopeless. I have also never kissed a girl and that has been weighing on me recently. I just feel too disgust with myself to even try to date. I am at the point where maybe if I give school my 100% I could still pass this semester, but from trying it over and over I know I can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt want to die because their are things in life that I enjoy like my friends, but I do hate myself and wish I could disappear."

I‚Äôm looking at Google‚Äôs opportunities for software engineering, and although the process would be difficult, I‚Äôm willing to work for it. Since I already have my internships sorted, I would be looking for a full time software engineer position from May onwards in 2024.

Some people would say that it‚Äôs too early to prepare now but I‚Äôd rather be aware of the work necessary as well as any tips/advice beforehand.

I‚Äôm looking at Google‚Äôs opportunities for software engineering, and although the process would be difficult, I‚Äôm willing to work for it.

xufhq9,7,2022-10-03,[IWantOut] 22F Italy -&gt; UK/Scandinavia,marta_moro,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/xufhq9/iwantout_22f_italy_ukscandinavia/,"Hi everyone,

I am writing here because I have been spending the last few months in Germany (Munich) for an internship in HR Management. Before moving to Germany, I spent one year in Finland as an Erasmus student, which is where I realised that I should follow my life-long dream of living somewhere else, and not in Italy (where I was born).  
I am sorry to say, I have been super disappointed by my experience in Germany. I don't want to convince people that want to move there that they shouldn't, because I had a very specific unlucky situation, where I had to move out of a terrible WG, got into legal troubles because of that, and ended up in another terrible WG. (WG are shared apartments, in case you don't know). So, the culture shock + what happened + the fact that despite having studied German for 8 years, I now can speak with a very basic level due to having stopped for another 3 years has led me to go through a very difficult time adapting to this country. There would be much more to tell, but I will try to keep it short :)

So, now the question arises: where to relocate next? I was initially thinking about Scandinavian countries (especially Sweden), because I have been there, I like it and I love how the society and welfare functions. There is one thing stopping me: I have promised myself I am not going to move to a country where I don't speak the language fluently. Without going into details, I can just say that my experience in Germany has really crushed my enthusiasm and left me with this big warning sign.

So, at this point, it would only seem right to move to a native English-speaking country, such as the UK. I visited Brighton two times and I really fell in love with the city. I am just thinking whether it could be a good city to move into. When I was in this small Finnish town, I really grew fond of living in a peaceful environment, I am not super into parties and getting wasted, I like having the comfort that a city can give (such as caf√©s, malls, cinemas, and such), but I prefer living in a less crowded and more quiet town. Plus, for me feeling safe at (almost) all times is a must and unfortunately Brighton didn't really strike me as the safest city...

Do you maybe have some UK cities/towns in mind with this description? I was also thinking about Edinburgh or Bournemouth.

Thank you!"

xufr9e,4,2022-10-03,Google‚Äôs Online Challenge [SEA SWE Internship] Invitation,SnooPeanuts3354,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xufr9e/googles_online_challenge_sea_swe_internship/,"Got this invitation in my email after applying to a bunch of sites on the Google career page a few weeks ago. Has anybody else gotten this email before, and what should I expect on the coding exam? What type of internship will this likely be? I'm from SEA, and I know the Google in our country is not very ""established"" or isn't big enough to require SWE interns so I was wondering if anyone has already passed this and proceeded with the internship. Did it require any relocation or was it a remote setting?"
xug19y,0,2022-10-03,data science in north africa,ur-average-geek,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xug19y/data_science_in_north_africa/,"So fresh grad here, did 5 years of engineering school, did like 3 internships, last one was by luck at a foreign startup just launching their product in morocco (my country) and i learned a lot, nice team and all, but after the internship period ended, i was told they are cutting down on their numbers and that's it, and then...            
2 months in of searching for a job and nothing, grinded leetcode, did coding challenges of recruiting agencies like turing and passed, tried applying for remote positions abroad, and tried almost every local company that has something to do with data.        
At the end of the day it boils down to :          
Recruiting agencies want 3 years of experience minimum.            
Foreign remote jobs ask for a VISA or working permit(companies willing to offer sponsorships are so few).             
No data science jobs locally as far as i can tell.        
            
So my options seem to be either keep looking and maybe have a 4-6 month gap in my CV, or switch to web dev / SWE and basically throw most of what i learned for the last 5 years out the window.           
               
What would you guys recommend ?"

19 year old here (almost 20). I've been pretty anxious about my looks, body and stuff for several years and have not removed my mask in college even once because of shame. Struggle to maintain contact with friends / create friends because of a past experience where I was very close to a friend and things broke out as I became too depressed and cut out all ties with my friends. Used to SH but been a little while since I relapsed.

Things aren't great home financially and think about it all the time. Had to suddenly evacuate old house and the bank took over it, even now the fear of family members being arrested because of the said financial problems is there.

Life has been in a downhill for several years, not sure why a 19-year-old has to go through this, I think if I was 25-30ish I could have managed it fine.

Got into CS as I enjoy it and really love it. Have decent grades (85%+) but failing to get internships I want and most people in my class have gotten internships already. I feel exhausted all the time, jealous of others nice life, and struggle to even step out of my house unless necessary. Anxiety of the future is slowly runinig me. Hell, I even feel tired as soon as I get up."

xunm2m,6,2022-10-03,Should I get a second bachelors in the field I actually like?,tortellinisuncle,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xunm2m/should_i_get_a_second_bachelors_in_the_field_i/,"I‚Äôm on mobile so please excuse any formatting. 

Some background: I just graduated from college in May and I have started an entry-level position. I majored in Business, concentrated in Information Systems. I took some computer science classes while and school and absolutely loved it! Unfortunately, it was too late in the game for me to change my major so I finished the business degree (much to my disdain). 

I‚Äôve applied to the local community college starting in January so I can work on an Associates in CS and then move back to my university to finish out the bachelors. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I should go through with it or if I should just do a bootcamp or something. I want to get into software engineering or research for national labs. My current job is a lot of admin support - something I‚Äôve done before and I know I don‚Äôt see myself doing long term. Drawback to this plan is that it will take me 2-4 years to complete the second degree and I want to move to a new state within the next two years. So I‚Äôll have to choose. 

What do you think? Should I stick with my plan to get a second degree, or do a bootcamp/software engineering intern program (examples are NuCamp and Revature)?"

I'll graduate this year as a software engineer, after 5 years from high school, as a part of our study we need to do a 6 months internship (I'm not sure if this is the case universally).

Some guys who are older, did their internship last year in a salesforce consulting company, they work on mulesoft (I'm not sure what's the exact difference) and now they got hired with the same company.

Today they came to school, did a presentation about the company, and it seems like they think it's a great place to work in.

The two main things that catches me is they talked about the company being fully remote, and the good salary for a junior engineer.

Can you please tell me if it's a good career choice? I would love to have the benefits they talked about, but I'm not sure if it's a career I can grow in and improve more in the future?"

I will be graduating in 2023 from Tier-2 college and I have already got placed in a US based MNC. Currently I am trying to publish a paper and along with that I am trying to find a 6 month SDE internship both of which will help me in improving my resume. I have a GPA between 8.4 - 8.5. My aim is to settle in USA due to which I have decided to pursue MS in CS. As I am from a Tier-2 college and my GPA is not above 9, I have decided to gain work experience of 2 years to further improve my resume and increase my chance of getting job after completing MS degree. I am yet to still appear for GRE and TOEFL but suppose if I get 320 out of 340 in GRE and 105 out of 120 in TOEFL, do I stand a chance to get admission in top unis like Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Caltech etc.?

Stripe - return offer, NYC, corp housing, 59/hr
Figma - SF, housing stipend, 50/hr

some other factors i'm considering:
- figma's acquisition by adobe
- wlb is supposed to be better at figma
- value of having interned at more than one company (for experience + resume)

ultimately, i'm sure either is a good choice, but please let me know what you guys think!"

I was wondering what job title and what role will be the most related to quant roles, I understand there are a lot of different quant roles (ie. quant dev, quant trader, middle office quant). To give me the best chance at making \*any\* of those roles I was thinking pivoting from a job with a data science title and a role dealing with financial data would be the best bet. Thoughts?"

I‚Äôm currently a legal assistant at a firm with only one attorney. Initially, I told her I didn‚Äôt mind if it was paid or unpaid but she insisted that after 90 days she would start paying me.

The 90 days ended last week and today she refused to pay me. She came into my office and said that she finds me to be ‚Äúundependable‚Äù and that I‚Äôm never here. Again, I‚Äôm a college student and I have classes on Tuesday and Thursday so I‚Äôm in the office Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00am-5:00pm. She understood that I had school and was fine with the schedule. When I am in the office, I get all of my work done and for the things I can‚Äôt do, I usually wait for her response or opinion. When she was out for 2 weeks with COVID and wasn‚Äôt responding to clients, I had to speak with them, file paperwork, write up documents, basically do her job. She also had me bring her medicine and food but never paid me for it, not that I cared but that was another thing she promised.

Last week my mom had COVID so I told her I couldn‚Äôt come in so I could monitor myself and get tested. That‚Äôs the reason why she‚Äôs calling me undependable and saying that I‚Äôm ‚Äúalways‚Äù absent. Aside from that, I will leave on occasion to go to doctor‚Äôs appointments or to let my dog out but I‚Äôm never gone for more than an hour. Also, I never get any sort break for lunch or anything like that so I feel like it‚Äôs warranted if I run out for a little bit but come back. Otherwise, I‚Äôm in the office doing my job from 9:00am-5:00pm and sometimes she makes me stay later.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do, I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with her avoiding it but working me like it‚Äôs a job when I have experience to actually work somewhere else and get paid. Any advice on approaching the subject to her and letting her know I‚Äôm leaving?"

For reference I am currently a rising junior attending a large state university Studying Economics with minors in Statistics and Mathematics. I've been fortunate enough to intern in an Analytics/Modeling role at a large fortune 50 insurance company and also have DevOps experience at a lab.

Recently though I've been applying to summer 2023 internships and was able to get multiple offers at several large companies. I've narrowed down my offers to two different companies which I will briefly describe.

Company 1: Large Fortune 500 Banking/Credit firm, located on the east coast, with a high 'prestige' name. Pure Data Analytics Internship (Dashboards, Reporting, SQL, Automation, ETL, etc).

Company 2: Medium Sized Car Automotive group, located near my current university, offering a pure Data Science Internship (Focus in pricing, loans and credit modeling)

Ideally I would love to work in Fintech moving forward which is one of the main reasons Company 1 stands out. However moving to Company 1 would be a pain regarding location as I would have to travel across the nation.

Additionally the experience I could gain at Company 2 seems great, there business model relies heavily on the data science team to develop production level models. Further I've met the team I would be working with and could tell I could learn a ton from them.

I am aware that the prestige I could gain from Company 1 would be immense, however I am weary to chose the role just because I'm worried it will only lead to more data analyst internships down the line (which I would ideally like to avoid).

Further, I'm very passionate about ML/econometrics/statistics and although I understand and appreciate the power of pure analytics, I'm worried I could see myself getting bored in a strictly analytics based role.

I would really appreciate any input or thoughts!"

xurwxb,20,2022-10-03,Trying to build out my resume (with only 162 knowledge) - insights appreciated!,lostbruincs,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/xurwxb/trying_to_build_out_my_resume_with_only_162/,"Hello everyone,

It's my first quarter here at OSU and I'm really enjoying it so far! (:

I'm currently taking 162 and 225, and I want to aim for a Summer 2023 internship. 

(If I don't end up with one, that's okay too - I'll see everything as prep for 2024's summer! But I want to put in the work and at least give myself a chance.)

However, all I know right now is what we've been doing in 162. (Transferred in 161 equivalent from a different college.)

I found the two OOP projects so far to be enjoyable as well - the debugging, writing out pseudocode to break things down into smaller piece to tackle a method, and what not. It's been satisfying to see bugs get fixed and seeing those projects come together.

**That said, how would you recommend I go from here to build out my resume with projects ASAP?**  

I've been \*wanting\* to build out a project after finishing the lemonade project a bit ago, but I've been just twiddling my thumbs and ""researching"" on what to do for a week now.

I feel like I know absolutely nothing. 

Seeing these tech stacks, web dev frameworks, etc., makes it really daunting and leaves me with confusion and analysis paralysis. 

Then on top of all this, there's Leetcoding as well - which I do find to be more straightforward to progress with!

I know some people have been able to land great internships with their previous experience + other factors on their resume, but when it comes to me, I graduated 2 years ago and have been just working part time trying to figure myself out...  üòì

In other words, I guess what I'm trying to say is that my experience section is already a big fat white space! 

So my goal right now is to bolster my resume with some projects, leetcode, improve my communication skills, and start applying for any internship.

If you have any insights on what you'd do if you were in my situation, I'd appreciate it!"

xut4e7,12,2022-10-03,My journey to 1M revenue in 3 years.,glidebag,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/xut4e7/my_journey_to_1m_revenue_in_3_years/,"I was working full-time when I began a MVP to help train new comers to join my industry and do what I do. 

It's a trait skill for the entertainment industry and one of those highly difficult and competitive job titles. 

The MVP was a 4 week training that I tested on the interns at our company. 

I also live streamed a demonstration online for free and got my first paying customer in the first 2 months.

When I finished up I realized 4 weeks was too short and people were demanding more training. 

I was about to end my contract with the company and was faced with a choice. 

Do I keep being an employee or do I build something massive. An entire training program to help others? 

I made the choice and my wife supported me. 

It took me 1.5 years to build and I burnt through about 200k in my own savings but I finished. 

At first it was very slow. I was learning the ropes of DM slipping on a specialized website for our community.¬† At first I had no idea what I was doing and people treated me as they should but pretty soon I learned how to help others first to earn their business. 

After 2 years I had a few of my first full-time clients.¬† By my records I needed 6 clients each year just to survive. 

High ticket til the day I die! 

During this tough time I kept skirting the idea of giving up and going back to getting a job.¬† Clients were hard to get and the rejections from my approach was painful. 

At the worst of it I just wept in the bathroom and my wife consoled me.¬† Without her belief in me I dunno if I would have made it. 

Pretty soon a client here and a client there gave me the breathing room to focus on expanding the brand. 

In the last 2 years the revenue has grown by 40% each year and this year I blew it out of the water by doubling it. 

My focus now is expanding my positioning and brand on social media. 

I want to share this with you guys because it really is possible if your MVP is solid, you bring real value to the market and you provide what others are too scared to put together! 

I hope my story inspires you to get going on your own ideas!"

xuu0ob,98,2022-10-03,AMA: My Experience in a Part Time / Weekend MBA Program (Ross),legrauch,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/xuu0ob/ama_my_experience_in_a_part_time_weekend_mba/,"**TL;DR**

* I attended the Ross Weekend Part-time MBA program. I will be graduating in the spring of 2023 and working in a family office setting (LP role) where I will focus on private investments. I did a summer in banking (didn't accept).
* I had 7.5 years of experience as a limited partner at an endowment and large investment consultant. While the world is moving away from requiring an MBA, I found that many places either required one or highly valued them.
* I was 29 when I enrolled and had a compensation package that was essentially the post MBA average, so I didn't like the opportunity cost of attending school on a full-time basis and liked my existing work.
* I'm sure it won't be hard to figure out my identity, so please be mindful these are my thoughts and my thoughts alone. My goal here is to be helpful and provide insights for those considering this path.

**Michigan Ross Weekend Program**

* I had been accepted to a Top 10 (really top 15, but hey there are 20 ""top 10"" schools) for fulltime but ultimately withdrew my deposit and considered PT programs in Chicago, New York, and Ann Arbor. In each case, I would have been flying into all of them. I felt as though the PT offerings at these schools had better branding and outcomes then those in my home city.
* I ultimately chose Ross for a few reasons:
   * **2-Year Program**: Unlike others, Ross has a two-year structured curriculum as opposed to 2.5-4 year plans at other schools. The classes are on every other weekend (4-9 on Fridays, 9-5 on Saturdays). I watched both my parents complete night classes for years and knew that I wanted to get it done at a time in my life where I have flexibility (no kids/family yet).
   * **Single Cohort**: I had the opportunity to get to know each one of my \~90 classmates. We take classes as a whole for the first year and then choose tracks (\~45 students) for 2/3 of our second year. Ross is unique in this regard because the program is smaller and the structure enables you to really build a network while also getting to know your classmates well. We do tailgates and frequent events after class Friday and Saturday. This is not to be underestimated -- the other programs I considered had much larger class sizes and no/limited predefined tracks, which I felt meant that I would not get to know my classmates as well.
   * **Internships and Placements**: recruiting and interning is encouraged at Ross. Unlike other programs, you do not need to wear a special nametag, sneak into events, or wait for your final semester to recruit. We had almost 100% placement for those seeking consulting (MBB/Big 4, etc.) and great placement in F500 (AMZN, Fortive etc.). I was the lone banker in the cohort and had no trouble securing an internship. On that front, I actually found that most bankers respected the grind and I ended up making the final cuts at every BB I applied to before ultimately accepting an early offer from another firm.
   * **MAP**: MAP (Multi-Disciplinary Action Project) takes place in the spring semester of your first year and counts as 50% of your credits (two of four classes). MAP is a program where you work with a sponsor (F500, start-ups, search funds, etc.) in a team of 5-6 students. The projects range from finance to ops to new market entry to M&amp;A. I worked on building out the business plan and model for a healthcare services start-up in the Midwest with a successful entrepreneur. It was truly an amazing experience and a highlight of the academic experience.
* Things to consider:
   * **This is a grind**: balancing a finance job/school/recruiting is no easy feat. Fortunately, I was able to do many coffee chats at night and had the flexibility to work remote and fly in to Ann Arbor for recruiting events as needed. The curriculum is fairly rigorous, though less challenging if you have general finance/business experience. I would take flights out to Detroit at 5am on Fridays and often take the last flight home on Saturdays. Your classmates are working as well, so you'll often be on zooms 9-12p during the week.
   * **Ross is a consulting/tech school:** I was the lone student in my cohort interested in banking. There are others with finance backgrounds, but primarily in corporate finance/credit. Given the Michigan location, most of the student body is engineering/auto focused. I viewed this as a positive as I think you ultimately learn more from other students then your classes/professors, but for building a finance/investment network, there are other schools that might be better positioned. I went through the recruiting process with FT students, so there is the opportunity to develop a finance/banking network more broadly across the Ross programs.
   * **Pursuing an internship and making up classes:** if you pursue an internship, you are encouraged to take a leave from the program over the summer and make up classes in your final year either in-person with fulltime students or via online classes. I chose the former and moved to Ann Arbor. Thus far, I am very happy with that decision and to have the opportunity to experience life in Ann Arbor. Others are doing online or possibly continuing to work fulltime, but the majority choose to do FT classes in their second year.
* Final Thoughts:
   * **Is it worth it?** ¬†¬†This program has accelerated my career and helped me to make amazing friendships. There is something truly special about going through this insane/busy experience with 90 other people and I've truly loved it. My biggest concern about a PT program was that I wouldn't develop a new network and connections and that has proven to absolutely not be the case. I've also paid tuition out of my current income, so I will be graduating with no debt."

I‚Äôm currently doing an IT internship in Canada, and have some questions about a career in IT, in Canada. 

Mainly referring to the market in Alberta/ Ontario, but would love to hear about other provinces if you have insight to provide. 

I‚Äôm early on in my career, and about to finish school with an associates in Information Technology Network Systems. 

I don‚Äôt know the exact route, or what my end goal necessarily is yet. Right now I‚Äôm interested in Cloud Engineering/ Management, Network Engineering, Automation, and even System Administration, I‚Äôm also open to moving into a less technical but more leadership oriented role if it makes sense down the line. 

A few of my questions are; 

what is the salary potential for these IT roles in Canada? 

Do big tech companies hire in Canada? 

Will staying in Canada limit my career potential, if so to what degree?

Can Canadians move to and work in the US relatively easily? 

Thanks in advance, and please feel free to provide any information about your experience as an IT worker in Canada!"

30F here. Diagnosed last year with severe ADHD.

My struggles with inconsistency have started affecting every aspect of my life, and very severely. I'm afraid my partner of eight years is reaching his wit's end with me, my work is suffering, my finances are a mess, and I'm not getting my $hit together enough to even submit important applications for my clinical internship year as part of my PhD program.

I have *never* been consistent--everything I start, I always end up losing enthusiasm in. Almost dropped out of college my senior year. The school at which I received my first master's degree denied me entry into the PhD program because of my inconsistent performance. Tomorrow I have a meeting with my supervisor because my performance has been poor at work. I receive semesterly performance reviews that without fail tend to mention my lateness with administrative tasks. I have gained 50 pounds in two years and lost all the muscle I worked very hard to build throughout the last five years, and I can't stick with a gym routine for more than three weeks. I've gained and lost the same ten pounds countless times in the last six months.

Almost every time my partner and I talk, it feels like he's a parent chiding me to get my life together and come up with a schedule that I can stick to. He has expressed that it makes him sad and anxious that I am like a rolling stone. The thing is, despite how much I love my partner and wholly understand that I'm not being a good partner to him, or kind to myself, I continue to make commitments to myself that I don't keep--and that, at this point, it appears I'm not even interested in keeping. For example, I keep telling myself that I'll go to the gym ""today"" or get on my sleeping schedule ""tomorrow"" and when the time rolls around, I just simply don't. I'm starting to believe that I don't even want to help myself at this point, because it would be too hard after several years of being totally checked out and coasting through almost all life activities. If I were to share this with my partner, I know it would end our relationship.

I am a psychologist-in-training (almost done) and have been gentle and understanding with myself. I accept my flaws and don't expect perfection, and equally recognize that I'm at a point where it's really sink or swim for me. Unfortunately my PhD program does not pay enough that I can afford to see my own therapist regularly.

I *do* struggle with depression and have my whole life, but this feels different than my depressive spirals. It feels like I'm pathologically lying to myself all the time given that I have a lot of insight into my problems and what I need to change, and even tell myself that I will change yet repeat the same pattern day after day. I've listened to countless self-help audiobooks and just received Barkley's Take Charge of ADHD workbook. I'll feel energized (not manic!) for about a week or two, and then just completely regress, often worse than before. The only time I do okay is when I'm living with someone else--which I haven't done for the last 5 years since being in grad school and in a LDR.

I'm feeling really bad, but equally stuck. Please share your tips and tricks."

Essays/LORs/Other: I personally think my essay is going to be pretty good! It‚Äôs this wholesome story about how I used to love doing origami and how much I realized I liked ‚Äútransforming‚Äù things. I went into my interests for baking and crocheting, and how my passions had an impact on the people around me and how much I love spreading joy into other peoples lives. A little cringy, but it made me happy to write about :)

LORs: I asked my AP English and AP Physics teachers. Both letters should be pretty strong because they‚Äôve known me very well outside of the classroom. And yeah, I don‚Äôt have too much to say except that these should be really nice!

xuzkdj,42,2022-10-03,Graduating This Year - Regret it all,dhughes99,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/xuzkdj/graduating_this_year_regret_it_all/,"Just some background, 23M, current 4.0 GPA, graduating May of 23 with a Finance degree from Michigan State University. No internships, no **relevant** work experience, never networked, didn't make any real friends. Live Alone.

In no way, shape, or form is this meant to sound like a sob story or a ""poor me"". I am aware of my choices and the consequences resulting from them. As I sit here at my desk, alone in my apartment, reading my multinational finance textbook, it hit me that this is most likely going to be the first exam since transferring that will probably drop my 4.0 GPA, I felt compelled to say something just to get it off my shoulders.

I have read the threads and heard the advice. ""GPA isn't everything"". I get that. I am fully aware that many of my peers in my graduating class will go on to get incredible job offers despite having performed significantly worse academically than I did. Regardless of this, I cannot help but feel incredibly disappointed. Disappointed, but not the end of the world. Kind of in between I guess. I was really riding on this 4.0 for job searching since I have nothing else of value on my resume other than going to a decent enough school. I am in my 6th year of college overall, so this feels long overdue.

I regret my major. I have no passion for business or finance. I have ADHD and all the other stuff that comes with it, so I have accepted that finding a passion/interest will require a lifelong effort that may result in no discovery at all.

I can socialize with others just fine. You would see me in classes and never assume anything. I had a rough time a few years ago. Lost my closest friends, earned a misdemeanor, and developed addictions. Probation ended, got sober, and relapsed a few times, then I picked myself up and started to focus on school again. Transferred around a few times before meeting a girl and following her to Michigan State. We are still together, coming up on three years :). Other than maybe two guys back home, she is my only friend. I appreciate her. It's hard to tell her that. Wish it was easier.

That being said, I am deeply sensitive. To my own detriment, I actively avoid putting myself into situations where I can meet others. I am fully aware of how these actions are impacting my life. Some days are better than others, as is true with anyone in the world. Sometimes I'm lonely, sometimes I'm not. Will I change my ways? Probably not, though I should. Just not ready to put myself back out there. I am too sensitive to take the chance of being hurt again. Eventually, I will try again. It's been six years. My life will probably forever be affected by those difficult years. 

I interviewed with Ernst &amp; Young last spring for an internship. Was super excited, but was ultimately denied. I was in the last round too. I will muster up the courage to start applying and interviewing again soon, but that was a real blow to my confidence. I didn't have great answers to the situational questions about work. I worked as a housekeeper at a gym for 6 years since I was in high school. Worked for a valet/events company for a year. Basically lied on my resume about that for some kind of substance. My old boss said it was okay. I expect to have a really difficult time finding work post-graduation. I am not an experienced candidate by any means. I plan on applying for jobs I actually think would interest me. Maybe data science/analytics if someone was willing to take a chance on me.

I spend most of my day either in class or studying alone in my apartment. Sometimes my GF is around but I am easily distracted and I can't have her around when exams are near. It takes me 2-3 hours to study compared to what another person would be able to do in one. Even with Adderall, it can be a struggle. I don't get out much because of this. Ask me what I learned about last year and I couldn't tell you. I have optimized my studies in a way that I can spit info back out and get the A, then immediately dump it all to make room for the next exam. If I cared about what I was majoring in it would be different. My girlfriend loves science and wants to work in cancer research post-graduate school. I'm glad she has found what she likes.

To be honest, my life is very melancholic. My mom tells me it's no way to live. But it's comfortable. The dull overtones of every day are hard to see through. At least I can keep things quiet the way I like them. This sounds super depressing but I promise it is not. I don't hate my life, though many days it's not great either. Just kind of existing, though it can be dull, that's okay with me. Hopefully, I can land a good enough job that I will tolerate while still having enough time at home to do the random things I want to do. There are no careers to be had or money to be made in the things I enjoy. That's okay. Don't really know what I'm posting for, but it felt more meaningful than leaving this in the notepad for no one to see.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long post short, I never networked, I knowingly denied myself some really good opportunities, I made no friends, and the only thing I learned was that I made the wrong choices. It could be worse though. I try to be thankful for the things I have."

I have a couple of extra curriculars that look good too such as internships and various different clubs.

Code Redemption: You may not use any code purchased here on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting you pay the listed price of the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request when needed for a support team.

Payment/Fees: I accept only USD through Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F). I do not cover any fee(s) associated with any purchase(s).

When paying through PayPal, do not pay with Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S) or with funds not from your PayPal wallet/linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit/pre-paid card, etc.). Doing so may result in a fee from PayPal. I do not accept eChecks. Failure to adhere to this rule may result in a loss of funds. I typically issue a partial refund in this case because PayPal charges fees that I cannot fully refund without losing money.

xv5n80,10,2022-10-04,Graduating This Year - Regret it all,dhughes99,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/xv5n80/graduating_this_year_regret_it_all/,"Just some background, 23M, current 4.0 GPA, graduating May of 23 with a Finance degree from Michigan State University. No internships, no **relevant** work experience, never networked, didn't make any real friends. Live Alone.

In no way, shape, or form is this meant to sound like a sob story or a ""poor me"". I am aware of my choices and the consequences resulting from them. As I sit here at my desk, alone in my apartment, reading my multinational finance textbook, it hit me that this is most likely going to be the first exam since transferring that will probably drop my 4.0 GPA, I felt compelled to say something just to get it off my shoulders.

I have read the threads and heard the advice. ""GPA isn't everything"". I get that. I am fully aware that many of my peers in my graduating class will go on to get incredible job offers despite having performed significantly worse academically than I did. Regardless of this, I cannot help but feel incredibly disappointed. Disappointed, but not the end of the world. Kind of in between I guess. I was really riding on this 4.0 for job searching since I have nothing else of value on my resume other than going to a decent enough school. I am in my 6th year of college overall, so this feels long overdue.

I regret my major. I have no passion for business or finance. I have ADHD and all the other stuff that comes with it, so I have accepted that finding a passion/interest will require a lifelong effort that may result in no discovery at all.

I can socialize with others just fine. You would see me in classes and never assume anything. I had a rough time a few years ago. Lost my closest friends, earned a misdemeanor, and developed addictions. Probation ended, got sober, and relapsed a few times, then I picked myself up and started to focus on school again. Transferred around a few times before meeting a girl and following her to Michigan State. We are still together, coming up on three years :). Other than maybe two guys back home, she is my only friend. I appreciate her. It's hard to tell her that. Wish it was easier.

That being said, I am deeply sensitive. To my own detriment, I actively avoid putting myself into situations where I can meet others. I am fully aware of how these actions are impacting my life. Some days are better than others, as is true with anyone in the world. Sometimes I'm lonely, sometimes I'm not. Will I change my ways? Probably not, though I should. Just not ready to put myself back out there. I am too sensitive to take the chance of being hurt again. Eventually, I will try again. It's been six years. My life will probably forever be affected by those difficult years.

I interviewed with Ernst &amp; Young last spring for an internship. Was super excited, but was ultimately denied. I was in the last round too. I will muster up the courage to start applying and interviewing again soon, but that was a real blow to my confidence. I didn't have great answers to the situational questions about work. I worked as a housekeeper at a gym for 6 years since I was in high school. Worked for a valet/events company for a year. Basically lied on my resume about that for some kind of substance. My old boss said it was okay. I expect to have a really difficult time finding work post-graduation. I am not an experienced candidate by any means. I plan on applying for jobs I actually think would interest me. Maybe data science/analytics if someone was willing to take a chance on me.

I spend most of my day either in class or studying alone in my apartment. Sometimes my GF is around but I am easily distracted and I can't have her around when exams are near. It takes me 2-3 hours to study compared to what another person would be able to do in one. Even with Adderall, it can be a struggle. I don't get out much because of this. Ask me what I learned about last year and I couldn't tell you. I have optimized my studies in a way that I can spit info back out and get the A, then immediately dump it all to make room for the next exam. If I cared about what I was majoring in it would be different. My girlfriend loves science and wants to work in cancer research post-graduate school. I'm glad she has found what she likes.

To be honest, my life is very melancholic. My mom tells me it's no way to live. But it's comfortable. The dull overtones of every day are hard to see through. At least I can keep things quiet the way I like them. This sounds super depressing but I promise it is not. I don't hate my life, though many days it's not great either. Just kind of existing, though it can be dull, that's okay with me. Hopefully, I can land a good enough job that I will tolerate while still having enough time at home to do the random things I want to do. There are no careers to be had or money to be made in the things I enjoy. That's okay. Don't really know what I'm posting for, but it felt more meaningful than leaving this in the notepad for no one to see.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long post short, I never networked, I knowingly denied myself some really good opportunities, I made no friends, and the only thing I learned was that I made the wrong choices. It could be worse though. I try to be thankful for the things I have."

Yay! Now, the bad(?) news: I have an offer letter for company X (not FAANG but biggish) that needs to be responded to this week. My Google recruiter told me that at this point, the process can't be sped up fast enough to meet the deadline, so I have to make a choice. The Google recruiter also told me while she can't expressly encourage it, it is possible to accept company X and still move forward with the hiring process of Google. Although I'm done with my onsite, I still don't technically have an ""offer"" from Google yet (I'm just moving on to next phase).

Here's the context:

\- I'm a graduate student, graduating this semester

\- company X offered $140k base + \~14k yearly bonus + 68k RSUs + 40k sign on bonus 

\- the offer from company X was a return offer after an internship I completed this summer

\- Both companies I'd end up in the Bay Area

So now, I must make a choice in about 1 day:

1. Accept company X and stop pursuing Google
2. Accept company X and continue pursuing Google until I (hopefully) get an offer
3. Decline company X and hope Google gives me an offer

The missing factor here is obviously I don't know what Google will offer. Has anyone been on a similar boat before? What would you guys do? I think #2 is the right way to go but I'd feel kinda scummy dragging company X along.

Going by (mostly posts on here) it feels like you can‚Äôt even get a ground floor entry level job unless you‚Äôve had at least one internship and a lengthy portfolio and that everyone has these under their belt, and even then you need years of experience to get in. It‚Äôs terrifying, I don‚Äôt want to waste too much time or get left behind, especially since I started uni a couple years later than people at my level, I don‚Äôt want age to be an extra detriment. I‚Äôve also had some health issues interfere with my masters thesis so it‚Äôs really not that  impressive, so I‚Äôm worried about how that will look too. 

Next year/after grad I plan on piecing together a portfolio from uni work and working on some extra personal projects for that purpose, as well as small courses/coding to keep upskilling (should‚Äôve made more use of my uni‚Äôs Esri membership!). But I think an internship would help a lot and seems almost necessary to get anywhere!

I‚Äôve looked around for internships throughout the year but it seems pretty sparse. I even asked around at a geo conference I went to recently and again, not much came of it. My supervisor doesn‚Äôt know of much either. I only know of a few other students who‚Äôve even done one here, so do we just not have that same culture? Where do I find one?

I have two years of college under my belt and one more to go and I am currently interning for the last 3 months.

What is really painful that the jira tickets are written by German people in english and most of the time I am just reading them over and over and emailing about them for a day until everything becomes clear.  


I decided to study CS because I kind of fucked up my highschool years and I only knew that I liked math and CS was a math adjacent field so I figured it must be interesting. In college I mostly gravitated toward the math classes and classes about programming languages or algorithms basically to the more abstract stuff and ignored courses like mobile app development and things like that.  
I discovered that I seriously enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming but not so much the other stuff I dont find tech cool I dont want to build an app or a website at all I am not interested in frameworks and all that jazz.  


What I like is when I have a set of rules or operations and a goal that can be achieved by finding a creative solution, the end product is of no interest to me.  
Now at work I very rarely get this feeling or these kind of tasks mostly its meetings, configuration and reading tickets, reading documentation, fiddling with stuff in a huge database.  
It might be that this is basically a CRUD app and thats why I find it so boring or I get the shit tasks because I am an intern but my question is should I just suck it up and try to learn everything and it will improve, go do a masters in some other field in cs that might interest me or just find another line of work altogether before I waste too much time?"

Getting ready was a very noisy affair.  Fauve, normally a quiet, almost ‚Äòdemure‚Äô child, was loud and bouncing off the walls‚Ä¶ metaphorically speaking, upstairs as she shouted at her tablet on the Chaos server about how she was going to see a ship land.  To most species this would be nothing special, especially these days, but at the *time*?  No alien vessel had landed *directly* on Earth before.

Not even the vessel that brought my professor, actually landed.  Like all vessels, they orbited, docked, and then boarded Earth transports to descend into the docking area.

This was an exception, the very first of its kind, a direct landing on Earth, and that too was strange.  I could chalk up the reason that both Earth and Dlamisa were approving it, given recent events.  ‚ÄúAnything that shows we‚Äôre completely at peace with one another, must look good to both sides.‚Äù  I muttered while I toweled off downstairs and listened to Fauve‚Äôs excited noises.

She had to have been in the kitchen just waiting for me to be ready to go, and was busy talking to her friends on the server while either she or one of her parents brushed her hair.  Sex divisions in labor were once very stark in humans, but the lines blurred as their general sense of equality increased, and as a result in the modern era, William spent abundant time in caring for his children.  Notably, he seemed to enjoy it, particularly in brushing her hair, considering it ‚Äòfather and daughter time‚Äô.

The human urge to connect is a powerful one, crossing lines of sex and culture and‚Ä¶ evidently‚Ä¶ *species*.  Or oddly enough, even reality itself, as humans grew bonded to both inanimate objects and fictional characters‚Ä¶ more on that in the future.

For the present at that moment, I was rushing a fair bit myself, I went through four towels even with both fans going at the same time, then threw on fresh clothes.  I suppose I didn‚Äôt *actually* need them, what with the fur and all.  But I thought it was best if I met with the landing ship dressed in the local custom so they‚Äôd recognize I was between both worlds at that moment.

For clothing, I chose short cargo pants that were good and loose, coming down to just above the joint in my legs, and a button down shirt with a chest pocket to hold a pen and paper pad.  While most people on Earth didn‚Äôt even need them anymore, I liked the aesthetic, and I appreciated the pragmatic approach of having a backup item to write with in case something went wrong with the electronic device I always had on me.

After changing, I picked up my drenched clothing and tossed it into a basket holding other laundry to be done.  Mrs. Walker did most of the washing, she was very particular about it after William said once, ‚ÄòAs long as it gets dry, who cares how?‚Äô

As I heard the story, she muttered something about ‚Äòweaponized incompetence‚Äô and forbade him from doing laundry after that, preferring to let him do something else instead.

I had yet to be assigned any chores in the household, save for occasionally minding the tiniest human in the family, a task I enjoyed a great deal even if it did occasionally get my tail pulled.  I took my time going up the stairs despite the fact that I myself wanted to hurry, I was listening to Fauve‚Äôs incessant chatter.

‚Äú...I know, people who actually live in space‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶ yeah, yeah I‚Äôm getting the occasional nasty message still, but they‚Äôve dropped off a *lot*.  No, I‚Äôm not really worried, I‚Äôve got Bailey and the others, plus mom and dad, I guess *maybe* those xenophobic nasties may throw a fit over an alien ship landing on Earth.  But who cares?  Teresa is still sore about what happened to her parents and won‚Äôt let them get a lot of media attention except when they get arrested for stuff.  I really wish Mr. Barnum were here to see this.  He was a cool old man‚Ä¶‚Äù

Some humans would perhaps criticize me for eavesdropping on my human that way.  It *is* considered rude by most human cultures, but, not *being* human, meant I didn‚Äôt think that way.  I‚Äôm a dlamisan scientist first, a researcher in anthropology, and some things you can only learn by covert observation.  The Walkers knew that when they took me in.

I suppose, yes, I‚Äôm making excuses.  But only for the greater good.  Had Fauve‚Äôs words been intimate or harmful to her, I would never release them.  This however, only offered insight into her excitable nature and the socialized way excitement was shared between individuals.  I noticed how she still turned a thought to the late Percival Terrance Barnum.  He *was* an intriguing old man, there was no denying that.  This is just one more example of the human capacity for bonds, even brief ones, to transcend death itself even for the young.

I reached the main floor of the house and made my arrival known by not hiding the sound of my footsteps. William wasn‚Äôt present, however Boatswain, Byron, and Rebecca were.

Fauve‚Äôs mother was finishing up putting her daughter‚Äôs hair into a ponytail, and when she saw me emerge she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind if she goes, but just to be clear, that‚Äôs *only* if it isn‚Äôt dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs safe even by dlamisan standards.‚Äù  I promised, and with that, Rebecca made her decision.

‚ÄúGood.  You‚Äôre so risk averse I‚Äôm surprised you sleep on an elevated bed.  If *you* say it‚Äôs safe, it must be.‚Äù  Rebecca chuckled at her own joke, but neither Boatswain or I did.

‚ÄúWhy is that funny?‚Äù  I asked, and Rebecca answered me with a casual quip.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just that every year a few hundred people around the world die by falling out of their bed while they sleep.‚Äù  She replied, and both Botswain and I gasped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking up a rod to put in the frame so that doesn‚Äôt happen to me.‚Äù  I said at once, and all three of the humans laughed, while Boatswain nodded along with me.

‚ÄúHow are you all not *extinct* as a species?  You‚Äôre all so *reckless*.‚Äù  I was utterly baffled, but they shrugged all at once.

‚ÄúWeaponized judicial recklessness has its uses, I guess.‚Äù  Byron replied to me and got up as soon as Fauve‚Äôs hair was done.

The girl turned and traded an embrace with her mother.  ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre going, mom.  I‚Äôll do my schoolness tonight after I get home!‚Äù

Fauve‚Äôs homeschool program, being self paced, let her work whatever hours she wished.  I‚Äôve said little about the human education system, but as we left the house, I asked what she knew about it in general.

I will relay what she said as best I can.

‚ÄúMy dad says that a long time ago, schools were based off some kind of dumb ideas about learning, that education was one size fits all, that the goal was to make just good factory workers and that‚Äôs about it.  Lots of memorization and repetition and tests‚Ä¶ and it was only *OK* even at its best.  That sounds kinda bad to me.  But when things got modern, or started to, they got to kinda customizing education.  Me, I got ‚Äòbasic skills‚Äô early, the stuff everybody needs.  Simple math, language, writing, stuff like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs like most education systems I‚Äôve seen, including home.‚Äù  I pointed out, and Fauve shrugged and said‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI dunno about that, but when I started to get older, they started ‚Äòtalent checks‚Äô where I tried a bunch of different things, that was around ten after I had most of the basic skills a person needs just to live.  Talent checks are where they started letting me look at more advanced subjects and trying simple versions of them.  Different types of science and other stuff from art and music to cooking and programming.  The whole idea is to figure out what I‚Äôm good at.  I‚Äôm still doing those now, and they‚Äôll keep going until I graduate.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happens then?‚Äù  I asked, ‚ÄúDo you get assigned a job?‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt think this was the case just based on my observations and Teresa‚Äôs offer, but then, I couldn‚Äôt be sure that my presence wasn‚Äôt altering the options of my humans.

‚ÄúNo, I start applying to different things, they give me my aptitude ratings for everything, and I start secondary education if I want.  Like if I want to be a doctor or a nurse and I have a high aptitude for it I go for free to study it, but if I have a low aptitude for it, I have to spend two years volunteering for a hospital or something and ‚Äòearn‚Äô a placement spot before I can go.  Same goes for anything else, if I have a high aptitude for cooking, culinary school is covered, low aptitude, I have to go through an apprenticeship to earn a spot.  If I really want to do something I have a low aptitude for, I can ‚Äòbuy‚Äô access to the school if I‚Äôve got the money‚Ä¶ which I guess I do now.  But I can only buy an empty seat, which means I may have to wait months or even years for one to open up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmpf, what if you don‚Äôt want to do secondary education?‚Äù  I asked.

Fauve shrugged, ‚ÄúSince Mr. Barnum left me lots of credits, I guess I don‚Äôt have to work if I didn‚Äôt want to, but I guess I could just keep working, secondary isn‚Äôt for everybody.  But most people who don‚Äôt go secondary, instead go for a paid intern spot or go work at one of the other jobs that don‚Äôt ‚Äòrequire‚Äô more education to do.  Or ones that will train you specifically for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know what you want to do?‚Äù  I asked, I‚Äôd never asked Fauve this question, I knew she was intelligent even by human standards.  I tried to think of a job she couldn‚Äôt do, and none came to mind.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.  I like what Teresa does, what Mr. Barnum did, I‚Äôd kind of like to keep that up.  Teresa says I need some secondary school, but with her recommendation I‚Äôm guaranteed a spot anywhere in the world and can do a work/study split.  But I‚Äôm also kinda interested in all the new xenostudies stuff.  Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù  Fauve had stopped talking to me, she trailed off, lost in her own world, I may have asked the question, but as we got on board the hoverbus that would take us to a then completely unused landing platform outside of town, I could tell she was asking herself questions.

‚ÄúI wonder if maybe I could combine xenostudies and media management?  Xenomedia Specialist, maybe?‚Äù  She wasn‚Äôt really answering me anymore, I could feel the shift in her focus, young girl or not, there was *ambition* in this one, an ambition I could completely understand as being not that different from my own.

There was a *reason* I liked this human so much, a reason I considered her mine.

Reader, you may recall my mention of the spreading of media from Earth out into the wider galaxy, the popularization of human music, movies, television, and more?  Perhaps it jumps ahead to tell you why, but the *why* was sitting right next to me at that moment as we raced on, wind in my face, savoring the scents and feel of the breeze, and happy as could be despite not knowing all that lay ahead.

**AN:  I love this chapter.  :)  I hope you enjoyed it as well, and if you did and would like to see more, the reason I'm able to write so much, so fast, and complete novels in weeks that take others months or more, is because of** [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/tellingstories) **members, that literally, not figuratively, literally, pays for me to work my regular job** ***less*** **so that I can write much** ***more***\*\*.

I am a software engineering major graduating in the summer of 2023. 

I got a full time position at Deloitte starting in July/August and a summer internship at TIAA June-August which will lead to a full time offer after the internship is completed.

What company is better to work at for further advancement and what would look better when jobs and universities are looking at my background? 

My current goals are getting into Microsoft after 2+ years at one of these companies and getting in to Harvard Business School. I know TIAA sometimes has partnerships with the school they  work with but I‚Äôm not sure if Harvard is one of those.

Does TIAA carry the same reputation as Deloitte does?"

I did an internship then worked in a shop whilst applying for graduate programs which started in Sept/Oct 2022. Upon getting an offer, I went travelling for a few months.

It‚Äôs my first couple of days and I‚Äôm getting cold feet (and have had doubts for a while). My program is public sector (civil service fast stream) and I know many people from school and uni whose pay will increase much faster than mine in the next couple of years. My longer term earning potential is still okay (my plan was always go to private sector after 4 years) but would probably be much better in the private sector. I don‚Äôt want to feel left behind when seemingly everyone starts moving to London soon and I can‚Äôt really afford it.

I liked the idea of working for the public good and the job will be pretty great in some aspects, but I would rather go for something less cushy so I can earn more. I‚Äôm slightly sceptical about the value of the skills I‚Äôll gain. It‚Äôs a famously difficult program to get into but it seems to train you to be a middle manager. Is that good?

I want to start applying to other schemes now, but I feel it‚Äôs too early. I also can‚Äôt quit as I‚Äôve been unemployed for a while now, and this job would also be a great springboard into something else (this year or in 4 years).

xvjgm0,742,2022-10-04,My Doctor of less than a year wants me to switch to non-stimulant medication/therapy after being on medication for 15+ years,demonjrules,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/xvjgm0/my_doctor_of_less_than_a_year_wants_me_to_switch/,"The Doctor that I switched to in February of this year just mentioned to me that she wanted to get me off stimulants (Vyvanse) and try alternate methods and therapy. I told her this was the first time I have heard this from her after 6 previous meetings and that I do not feel like experimenting with this at this stage of my life. I have a technical job that requires a lot of focus and I do not want my work to suffer for her little experiment. If I was still in school, sure, but I have been on various dosages of Vyvanse since 2007 and it works for me after previously trying Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall after being diagnosed at age 9. 

She mentioned this being the ""new recommendations"" and that she did not want me to become reliant and addicted to stimulants. I have been on various dosages of Vyvanse since 2007 so she might be late for that but also I only take them when I work M-F and not on the weekends. I told her I have ADHD and that I would **LOVE** to not have to pay these high insurance premiums, prescription prices, and monthly doctor visits, but that I know my brain and I could not do this job without help from medication. It is working for me and has been for 15+ years...

She said that she would refill me this time but she was going to bring it up again. She then asked if I had any more questions and I reiterated that I have never heard this from her before and the reason why I switched to her was that my previous doctor was retiring and that now I think I might need to find a new doctor. 

I do want to mention that there was someone else on the Zoom call that did not identify themselves (the call organizer said that there may be an intern on the call) so maybe she was putting on a show. In our previous meetings, she was quite jovial and would only ask me questions about any changes, thoughts of self-harm, trouble sleeping, anxiety, etc., etc., but this time she was very serious and brought up wanting to make a change. 

Are there actual new recommendations out there regarding stimulants? Was she putting on a show for the intern? Is it time to find a new doctor?"

I am an electronics engineer, and I love embedded stuff, basically everything that involves electricity. I have done several projects, worked 2 internships where I designed a product (patent granted, launching June, 2023) and have been offered ESOPs there. 

I wish to work for the core electronics people, where actual research takes place. I understands startups are the way to go, but I have some complications, and have to earn a respectable salary as quick as possible(I work 6 hrs partt-ime job after uni). 

What advice I need is, how do I approach these companies(Silicon Labs, Intel, TI, STmicro etc) as a fresher? I understand my skill set may or may not be of the level, but I would love to develop that as well. I understand RTL, Firmware development, Analog design and PCB design to an appreciable level, but the companies on LinkedIn(almost all) require 2+ years of ""professional"" experience. How do I look for jobs with basically 0 ""professional"" experience(does internship count? at a startup?). 

I also feel(almost constantly) that I don't know enough about my field no matter how much I work, and read books, which stops me from basically applying to anything slightly outside of my comfort zone. Should I apply even when I don't know half the stuff the Job Description says?(my friends seem to be doing that, and they land the jobs). 

I just think I have worked too hard for the past four years, harder than 99% of people at my stage(might sound full of myself and judgemental, sorry, but I write what I think, observing others at my uni). I want to do something worth doing, and work where I would need to scratch my head. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, about any career direction. Thanks!"

I realize I don‚Äôt stand a chance (or maybe I‚Äôm just that pessimistic and realistic, or totally just not ready) with many of these job requirements I‚Äôve been browsing through LinkedIn. They ask for computer science degrees, many years of experience, and knowledge of a whole lot more stuff I don‚Äôt know about like RSA, JWT, OpenID connect. I‚Äôve been hacking away, as a side hustle I‚Äôve been working on while working a dead end job I no longer feel satisfied with. I also practice some questions on leetcode and coding bat for Java. I want to work where I can grow and learn new things. Do I need to go back to full time school, or just keep learning online? I cannot afford to live on part-time salary.

I've heard a lot of people say that a lot of companies hire most of their summer interns in the fall. My question is, should I start applying right now with my somewhat empty resume?

 I was wondering if y‚Äôall had any insights about this? How is Brown‚Äôs social environment really?

Also, I‚Äôm a prospective math/CS student, so I might go into data analysis/research stuff but definitely not finance or software dev (which from what I hear are the most ‚Äúcutthroat‚Äù?)

Aside from working on my GPA, what other things can I do to increase my chances at Stanford GSB and HBS 2+2? (I will be applying to the 2024 cycle.)

&amp;#x200B;

I (19m) am a self-taught programmer while being in an unrelated major at a community college. I fell in love with programming a few months ago, decided to teach myself, and have been building up my resume with projects to hopefully land an internship soon. Here's my problem. My parents have paid for my college thus far (as they had agreed to) and don't want me to drop out of community college to pursue programming. They first stated it was because I wouldn't get a good job (as my father works in IT, although in an unrelated field and my cousin is a programmer under contract with the gov.) but didn't seem to understand that at least according to my research so far (which has been a considerable amount, I haven't been taking this lightly) it seems companies hire off education initially, but will hire off of experience after only a few years in the field (they also raised concerns about computer run hiring which would gloss over my resume without a degree but I don't know anything about that so I have no thoughts on that yet). I explained that my associate's degree wouldn't really matter (particularly since it would be in an unrelated field) and that a computer hiring system would most likely still gloss over my resume since I didn't have a bachelor's, I also said that if I chose to pursue a degree later, I would pursue a CS degree, so that it would matter in my field instead of getting a useless degree that doesn't do anything for me other than wasting my time getting it. They then switched to saying that since they had paid for everything thus far, I owed it to them to finish. When I asked if it was a problem with money, they said no, that it was because we had an agreement that if I went to CC they would pay. (I offered to pay back the money they spent, which is why they said it was because of the agreement). My father doesn't make small money. Although we are single-income (my mother is a stay-at-home mom and doesn't really do much other than small crafts like knitting or sewing) we are well above the median income for families in the US and are sitting comfortably in the upper middle class. They seem intent on me finishing my degree, which not only isn't related to what I am going to do, but it's also something I dislike doing, and my mental health has recently been declining due to stress related to this. They kept telling me they were ""keeping my greater interest in mind"", and were ""guiding me to not make such a large mistake at such a young age"". This brings me to being concerned that this could be an attempt to gaslight me into thinking they have my greater interest in mind when they're just grasping for power that they no longer really have over me. My dad made it pretty clear that if I left college ""under his roof"" I would be kicked out, however, my mom hasn't directly said that but I can only assume her thoughts are similar.

&amp;#x200B;

So pretty much my situation here is to pursue my dreams while being forced to move out (which would entail a lot of expenses and make my life difficult, to say the least) or struggle through my last two semesters of CC, wasting my time which I could be using for an internship all the while knowing my own parents would kick me out over pursuing my dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

TBH I'm not sure whether I could even view my parents the same way after the conversations that led to me making this post. But I'm still being forced to decide. any advice is appreciated, truly."
xw2k00,2,2022-10-05,Foreign Language And Course Rigor,Serious_Pudding_6316,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xw2k00/foreign_language_and_course_rigor/,"So I‚Äôm a junior this year and haven‚Äôt completed any years of foreign language. I have been self-studying Mandarin for a few years now and am planning to take the AP Chinese test to waive my 2 Year Foreign Language Requirement. 
Does this look bad for college admissions (T30s) since I did not take any years of foreign language? It is too late to take 2 years at my high school, should I just take a dual-enrollment foreign language course? Or can I just pass the AP Chinese exam and explain that I studied Chinese for fun out of school?

I also am wondering about Senior Year Course Rigor. In my sophomore year I took 2 APs/1 Honors/ 8 DE, junior year I am taking 4 APS/1 Honors/(probably 4-5DE). So senior year, there aren‚Äôt many APs available that I am interested in, only AP Science courses, so I will probably only take 3 (maybe 4 APs), will colleges look at my senior schedule and think that I am slacking off (since I have a downward course rigor trend)? I am thinking of taking Linear Algebra and 3 Computer Science dual enrollment classes during my Senior Year. Hopefully maybe some internship as well?"

I do not have any work experience or internship experience. I wanna work in the industry so I thought of applying for masters in the States. Do you think it is too big of a stretch? Or rather how should I go about it and what should I do to improve my chances? Other University recommendations are also welcome. Any advice will be helpful :)

Sunt student in anul 4 si de fix un an am inceput sa aplic pentru internshipuri/joburi. In majoritatea cazurilor am ajuns pana la interviul tehnic, uneori chiar spunandu-mi cei cu care dadeam interviul ca am sanse mari sa iau postul. Insa de fiecare data aparea mailul ""ne pare rau, am gasit pe cineva mai potrivit cerintelor noastre"". Doar de doua ori am primit feedback dupa interviu si de fiecare data mi s-a spus ca am idei bune dar nu stiu sa mi le expun. Am incercat sa aplic pentru diferite posturi, de la software engineer la QA sau support.
 Ador domeniul asta, insa am vazut ca am o slabiciune. In teorie stiu ce si cum ar trebui sa fac atunci cand mi se da o problema sau un task, am idei, ma descurc destul de bine si la debugging, dar cand vine vorba de scris cod ma pierd sau dureaza mult pana il fac sa mearga. Am incercat sa mai lucrez, sa fac diverse proiecte, dar cum creste dificultatea nu imi mai iese nimic, de parca as ramane blocat la nivelul de jos. Am incercat si sa urmez cursuri (pe langa cele de la facultate) de programare, dar la inceput mi se pare totul prea usor, apoi deodata nu imi iese decat foarte greu un cod scris de mine.
La facultate este aceeasi problema la teme/proiecte. Ideea o am, stiu cum ar trebui sa fac un lucru, cursurile predate de profesori le inteleg, dar cand vine vorba sa ma apuc sa scriu cod ca sa rezolv ce mi se da ma impotmolesc in ultimul hal. De aceea m-am gandit ca daca sunt primit la un internship poate este alfel si de acolo incep sa imi dau drumul si sa scriu cod mai usor, dar nu a fost sa fie.
Mi-ati putea da cateva sfaturi despre cum ar trebui sa abordez situatia, ce sau cum ar trebui sa lucrez ca sa ma antrenez si sa ma dezvolt, sau cum ar trebui sa ma comport la interviuri?"

####Now onto the questions part:

**Winter Internship**

1.	Can you tell me are there some winter research internships or stuff that I could apply for. Because I checked the different unis like ISI, IISER, IIT, HRI, IAS, CMI and they all have summer schools for which I‚Äôd have to wait quite a bit. 

2.	All of them have their forms open in Jan and Feb and are held in summers so I‚Äôd be able to participate in only 1 internship. 

3.	And how to cold mail professors? I have this fear of sounding pretentious and obnoxious while connecting with them and referencing their papers as I‚Äôd be looking wannabe ish as I don‚Äôt possess their level of knowledge and did I even understand their paper correctly to comment on it. Fir lagta hai nahi ho payega(I feel that I won‚Äôt get the chance to intern) and I give it up in fear of wasting my time.

4.	I haven‚Äôt looked into International Internships yet as I was aiming to build a better profile first. 

5.	Also looking to try at the Niti Aayog internship at the end of 2nd Year.

**Industrial Internships**

1.	Is there any chance of me getting a internship at some startup or company seeing as I am not a BTech Guy and dont have a lot of personal projects. If so, where should I apply, I have checked out AngelList, HireIt and intershala, should I apply from there? 

2.	What kind of roles should I apply for? Data analyst, business analyst or some IT roles? I am getting confused in this one.



At last, any other advice or criticism that you feel would be good for me is also welcome.


Thanks for the help everyone. Happy Dusshera as well."

xw90ik,1,2022-10-05,I have a question about getting an internship in my 2nd year,Special-Marketing-95,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xw90ik/i_have_a_question_about_getting_an_internship_in/,"Hi,

I am a 2nd year Computer Science student with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at a pretty decent government university in India. I have also taken several prob and stats courses and my summer internship in my 1st year was heavily rooted in Data Science (which I found really interesting), so I do have a strong hold over ML and Data Science as well. I have been looking for internships for the Summer of 2023, as most applications come around during this time, and have been feeling quite confused with the entire process. Most internships for 2nd years offered by the big 4 are software internships (like Google STEP), and I am not quite sure if software development roles are for me (maybe it's because I just have the wrong info about them or it's because I have been working quite a lot in the fields of AI and Data Science).

Ideally, if given a choice, I would like to do an internship wherein I'd be able to work in the fields of Data Science and AI. Moreover, I have been wanting to get some experience with the business side of things, just to see if it's a fit for me, so if I could put that in the mix of my workload in an internship then I'd be a really REALLY happy trooper.

I have found some intern programs which seem to at least tick 2 of the 3 boxes on my internship checklist (which is A LOT), but they are all located outside of India . While none of them mention that someone internationally cannot apply, I do wonder if my application would be taken into heed given the added responsibility of getting a work visa for me incase they hire me.

If y'all could give some advice, share your internship experiences and recommend some opportunities that might be a fit for me then that'd be great!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: I know software engineers do work with AI, but from the experience of some of my seniors, none of them worked on any AI projects during their SDE internships."

I knew the internship applications for most tech companies are posted way earlier (before August?), but I decided to wait. The reason for this is that my university has a co-op program, so I thought I'd just start the class, get some advice on my resume and then start applying. The first co-op is done during the second semester of your second year and university.

Between the second week of September and now, I've been applying to around 3 positions a day, including positions of some of the ""big"" companies like Amazon and Tesla.

The only people in my school who've gotten offers already are those who I am pretty sure started the process earlier. I see a lot of Amazon offers. **Did I make a mistake by choosing to apply only in September**?

I really want to work at a FAANG company this time. I know that other companies can give you a similar if not better experience, pay, and connection, but I honestly want it for my resume. I've already done three internships, and having a top tech company would be amazing. Have I screwed myself by starting the process too late?"

For my internship i need to analyze a big set of data, i wanted to use Excel to analyse this.  


The data is exported from an other program thats used in the company, however, since its over 58000 rows, i had to devide up the columns. While i did this, i allways kept the unique *Code* column in there to later merge the data back.   


my question is: Is there an option to merge the sheets back together, using the unique code column so that all the data matches in the right way.

A lot of these people would be so surprised when I‚Äôd say I didn‚Äôt care if I worked in FAANG or something, I just wanted a job. Many of them just wanted to use the current internship as a stepping stone whereas I actually kinda enjoyed the company and ppl I met.

I've had 2 previous internships but they were more relating to the engineering/manufacturing field, not so much SWE.

I recently found the PittCSC GitHub repo, a list of ~300 prestigious SWE internships (including FAANG) for summer 2023. I'm in the process of applying to as many as I can. I was also hired last month as a student software developer for a group at my university - I'm assigned various programming projects to help the researchers here, mainly designing/developing websites and mobile apps for whichever researchers contact our group.

Actual questions: 

Will me having a role at college relating to SWE be beneficial to getting (hopefully prestigious) internships next summer? Or would I need to have actual SWE internship experience/go to a better school?

Thank you."
xwe0fk,1,2022-10-05,My (20F) first job is making me go insane. Should I quit?,yoxnhan,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xwe0fk/my_20f_first_job_is_making_me_go_insane_should_i/,"Hii! I (20F) recently got my first job in the architectural field in a interior design office, but I'm hating it. 
Before this can create a ""gen z being lazy/ungrateful"" type of mentality, let me please give you a full picture. 
I send this as I'm going to the office, so my emotions are really all over the place. 

I got this job via one ex colleague that put my name in for them, I was so grateful because, being my first job ever, with no prior experience, they were being super kind with me to offer such a great opportunity. 

I talked to the boss and she was such a lovely lady in our interview, but the first red flag was that she didn't even knew where I studied, she asked me what I knew about the softwares and other stuff and it seems to me that she didn't even read my resume. To that point I was like ""Hey, she's a very busy woman, the office is super busy every day so I can't ask her to stop and read my resume"". 

So this is where things start to go south. 

We schedule a week of training, in which I would receive half of my hourly payment, so I could learn how the office works, how they do their projects and other things like that. I was just extremely excited because they were offering such a wonderful opportunity to actually train me for the workplace and stuff. 

But then, it's been two months and I'm still waiting on that training week. 

I got to the office the first day, they showed me around, my two co workers are great and super kind to me, and they ask me to do some adjustments on a project that needed some small changes, and I was like ""Ok thats something I know how to do even without training"".

So I spend my first week doing simple stuff, like adjusting simple projects, editing things that the clients asked to be changed, going with the architects to the client's houses to take measurements and start planning the projects, and other simple things. I was living the dream, I didn't received any training yet at this point but hey, they didn't even assign me a job that I didn't know what to do so they don't have something to train me in yet right? 

Wrong. 

They decided to assign me to get one of the floor plans that I measured with other architect of the company and transfer it to one the softwares that we use (I will explain every architectural thing very vaguely but for the possible architects and engineers out there i had to get the floor plan on the paper and put it on autocad, a fairly easy task). I start to type in the measurements that the architect took of the place and they simply are adding up, there's two walls that simply aren't connecting and when I asked my coworkers what should I do they just said ""do what you think it should be done"". Girlie, I'm in my fuckign fourth semester in uni i simply don't fucking know what it should be done. But I thought hey they may be testing my problem solving skills or some shit like that so I just went and did what I deemed the best solution for that problem.

But then, on the following day when I get into the office they sit me down and say ""you have to follow the measurements on the paper"" and I say that they weren't adding up and it isn't going to work and they just said that they went there in the evening and took new measurements so now I should follow another paper and start all over again. I went a whole week just redoing the same thing over and over again, and still didn't receive my training, meaning I was and still am just earning half of my payment. 

Then, when the floor plan was finally said and done, I was assigned to put it in our 3d modeling software, like a the sims construction mode (and i was just asked to import the thing from cad and put it on sketchup for my fellow possible architects feeling my pain right now). Again, something super simple that i know how to do. But with this 3d model, a bunch of questions appeared because I needed to know what exactly I should do. Should I put the outlets in the walls already? Should I do the textures of the floor and the ceiling? Should I do the glass on the windows or just a black square symbolizing it? So I started to ask those questions to my coworkers while they were working and OBVIOUSLY I was and still am being a bother but I didn't receive any conclusive instructions they just told me ""do how you think you should"", and so I did. 

If you are reading until now, first of all thank you, second of all you know that telling me, a 20yo still in uni, to ""do what you think it should be done"" isn't the best instruction. 

Then the third week, my boss shows up at the office, mind you, for the fucking first time in all this time, and calls me on her desk to say that I wasn't helping the company to produce and I was bothering the work of my coworkers with my questions and that she decided to give one more moth of training to see how things would work out. I was fucking livid. Like, obviously I'm not helping the company at all I spent three fucking weeks just trying to fix a FLOOR PLAN that they could measure it RIGHT like girlies you don't know how to use a measuring tape? And evidently I'm bothering my coworkers, nobody even TOLD me what I should do and I want to do them right so I will be asking questions. 
And one more month of training?!?!?!? Girlie I didn't  received a fucking second of training in this office until now ain't nobody telling me SHIT.

And now, I just go there, do what is on the list of things assigned for me without questioning anything, i wait for someone come ask me if everything is okay to ask questions and keeping redoing eveything all the time, because my instructions are ""fix the bathroom floor"" ""adjust center table"" ""adjust doors"", like please more specific?!??!?! 

And the things is that i see that I'm not the only intern that's having this issues, my coworkers spend the whole morning talking shit about the intern that only work on the evening and they probably just talk shit about me to the others when I'm not there. 

My coworkers don't bother me so much but they are really shallow and vain people and just listening to them talk gives me the ick. Like, I get that this is a interior design office but you don't need two brains to work out on what carpet fits the best in this living room. 

What is really bothering me is that I'm being paid the half of what was offered with the condition that i received the training necessary to be able to deserve the full salary and I'm not receiving this training and even more I don't know what I should be training. 

Before someone comes and says hey girl you should just talk to your boss about it or something along this lines, i did already talk to her. 

When she called me on her desk to talk about this one more month of training I asked what i shoul be training and I said that when I had my doubts nobody seemed to come in a conclusive way to help me develop the projects. The only answer I got is that ""Let's see if in this month the things figure themselves out"". 

I don't know if all of this effort that I'm putting in is worth it. I have to get 2 busses to get to the office so i pay 4 tickets which will take away half of my already cut in half salary. 

I didn't want to think about only the money, the experience was more valid to me than anything, but now I really am rethinking everything. 

If someone with more working experience than me could help it would mean the world to me because I feel like I'm going to go insane, everyday I wake up dreading to go to the office and the only thing that I think the whole day is ""what will go wrong next?"". I didn't sign up any contract, not even for these experience days so I'm dreading that one day she's just gonna come in to the office tell me to pack my shit and leave and I will not even see the color of this money. 


Am i being ungrateful? Are internships always like this? Should I quit?"

\*\*Letters of Recommendation\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Counselor (8?/10): He's the best. He knows me fairly well for¬†being a counselor and I'm sure he'll put a lot of effort into my letter.

Econ teacher and Stock Market Club advisor (9?/10): Should be good, have had a close relationship with him for 4 years and he isn't writing a rec for anyone else.

English teacher (7?/10): She really liked my writing and I participated a lot. Didn't have a super close personal relationship though and she has to write a lot of rec letters.

May also ask my Spanish teacher to write a specific rec for me for Penn's Huntsman Program

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Essays\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully they will be decent, I'm a bit behind. CommonApp essay is kinda about my approach to analyzing problems and my interest in the world, but connected with some abstract concepts. Supps have yet to be written.

\*\*Advice\*\*

Struggling with my early plan. I'm extremely aware that I have a minimal chance at Harvard, but I feel like I should shoot my shot and my counselor says that if so, REAing would be best. Equally, I'd be very happy going to Notre Dame and REAing there would (I think, knock on wood) give me a decent chance of acceptance. Any thoughts?"

Feel free to list any colleges in the US that you think would be safeties, targets, and reaches based on my stats

Demographics: Vietnamese-American, super small private school (&lt;100 population, around 20 students in my class) (not as many club opportunities as other schools in the area) graduating a semester early, in a hotspot location for Covid on east coast so I continued online school from March 2020 up until the end of junior year last year to not risk passing Covid onto my at-risk senior dad (this took away many chances of extracurriculars given my school already doesn‚Äôt have many, but also because I was online while nearly everyone else was in person)

School doesn‚Äôt rank or do valedictorian but my guidance counselor said I would‚Äôve been ranked 1st of my class and been valedictorian if the school did that. (She‚Äôs gonna mention that in my rec letter)

Intended major: Psychology (my personal statement has to do with this and helping others which is strongly shown in my ECs)

I would rate my essay a solid 8.5/10 so far. I still have a little less than a month to keep on working on it

GPA: 4.0 unweighted 
Only took APUSH (96 final grade), didn‚Äôt take AP Exam for it (school only offers APUSH, AP Calc AB, and AP Lit) I didn‚Äôt take AP Calc because the teacher‚Äôs way of teaching didn‚Äôt click in my mind and it‚Äôs too late to take AP Lit because it‚Äôs a full year course and I‚Äôm graduating in one semester

Took honors English in freshman, sophomore, and junior year (97-99 in those) (this year isn‚Äôt honors because of the complicated graduating early system)

Did Spanish I freshman year, skipped to Spanish III sophomore year, did Spanish IV junior year (all 98-99), no language class this year (IV is max) 

Going SAT optional 

Rec letters will be amazing. I‚Äôm very close with all of my teachers and actively engage and participate. I always reach out for guidance if needed

Awards:

Excellence in an Environmental Literacy &amp; Job Training Award from an internship I did for a few months

High Honors every year (eligible if overall average is 95+)

Academic Achievement in mostly all of my classes every year

Hope to get National Honors Society this year (I didn‚Äôt get it last year because I was online) 

ECs: 

- Environmental Internship (cleaned litter, gardened, gave away food, etc in a poor neighborhood, studied community organizing/leadership, received an award for outstanding performance and dedication)
- Family caretaker: I take care of my chronically ill dad who is over the age of 65 and do household chores, translate, etc. I also tutor my younger brother
- Leader of my school‚Äôs community service club (I was active in 9th before Covid and will be very active this year)
- I hand-make free custom beaded jewelry and accessories for my friends and family that represents their unique identities (ethnic name, country of origin, religion, gender, sexuality, pronouns, etc)
- I decided to bring my representative beaded jewelry and accessories onto TikTok. I have over 22k followers, 600k+ likes, and 4M+ views. I respond and create according to as many suggestions as I can
- I attend an annual veganism/environmentalism/animal rights pride parade (I have been since I was in elementary school except for one year because of Covid.) I was born into a vegan/vegetarian family and I am a vegetarian. I would pass out free vegan food, held up animal rights posters, and donated over $200 to a veganism organization 
- My mom and I make vegan food together and give it out to homeless people and those in need around our neighborhood. One year, we gave out food, water, jackets, and sleeping bags in the winter
- Member of student council. My school decided to start offering officer positions this year but we haven‚Äôt decided those just yet
- Participated in a Summer Youth Internship where I worked with kids ages 7-11 and helped them through their summer camp
- Participated in a virtual photography internship and was one of thirteen students whose work got selected to be in the photo exhibition 
- Member of yearbook club. Also no roles just yet"

Also, I am pursuing my minors in AIML - my college has partnered with Coursera and thus I am able to earn 20 extra credits.  I had subjects like Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Operating Systems, Java Programming, Python Programming, Cloud Computing, Computer Networks, Big Data, and Database Management Systems as a part of the college curriculum. I have scored 10-pointer in all these subjects. I am aiming for the top universities (not Harvard, Stanford, or MIT level though), like USC, UIUC, UCSD, UCI, and more. How should I go about my application? Can someone help me in the shortlisting process, like which top schools are possible keeping in mind about my branch change?

Also, if someone has successfully changed their branch to CS, please let me know. I want to know how exactly I should write my SoP and LoR. I am not really interested in research, I wish to be a Software Engineer.

I think I want to target HFT next year because I want to at least give it my best shot. I will be perfectly happy with FAANG+/Unicorn new grad but I don‚Äôt want to regret not trying later on. It is my understanding that HFT is easier to get into as an intern, then harder as a new grad, and even harder after that, so I want to try now.

It‚Äôs worth noting I‚Äôm considering pursuing a PhD because I think I may like research.

Further option descriptions:

1. S24 - this would be graduating a year early. BS in CS/ML. Have some gaps so I will be taking graduate level courses in CS and/or math. Just Google STEP and Roblox on my resume as mentioned above. Target HFT/Unicorn for new grad roles.

2. F24 - take a semester off to do an off-season internship + Summer 24 internship. Same degree and coursework as above. Google STEP, Roblox, + 2 more internships on my resume (maybe one unicorn one HFT?). Target HFT new grad starting in January 2025. anyone have any experience w getting new grad roles with January start dates? Is it more stressful, less or same opportunities?

3. F24 - don‚Äôt take a semester off, but double major in Math &amp; CS/ML. So STEP + Roblox + (FAANG+/Unicorn/HFT). Would likely not be able to do any grad coursework or independent study.

4. S25 - this would be a full 4 years of college (sorta). One semester off to do an internship, like mentioned above, except I will be double majoring in Math and CS/ML. I will still do graduate coursework and independent research just cuz i want to. STEP+Roblox+2*(FAANG/Unicorn/HFT)

(Bruteforced when there is a 2d DP solution, did not get to hear the third problem)  


I've read that if I've moved on, I wouldn't be able to reschedule the karat interview. After 4 hours the interview, where karat emailed me saying they delivered my results, I was still able to start rescheduling. When I clicked ""Choose time"", it automatically emailed me that I have started the redo process. I thought it would only start the process after I selected the time. Does anyone know what the status of my application may be? Do I have to actually schedule my redo now? Should I redo?  


The interviewer said I did ""really well"" at the end of the interview, but then things wouldn't add up with what everyone else said on this sub. (Given I can reschedule and did not even get to the third problem)  


Also, a lot of the time was spent trying to dumb everything down for the interviewer, at what point can I stop? The interviewer didn't say they knew Java so I felt the need to explain why I was using classes like StringBuilder and specific methods I haven't seen in other languages like HashMap.getOrDefault.

# Hello everyone!

In this post I would like to share my plan for a Self-Taught front-end developer/software engineer job and what I have learned teaching myself for the past 5 months, I would like to get your feedback and experiences to get an understanding of what I could do better, what I could include in this plan, what I could cut. I just want to be as efficient as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

# My background

I am a 23-year-old college dropout from Athens, Ga. I was originally in school for nursing, but due to some circumstances I am no longer in the program (December 2021). I spent the beginning of the year working in fiber optic construction and had a lot of time to contemplate on what I wanted to do with my life. I came to the conclusion that I no longer wanted to go back to college since it would require an additional 2-3 years in order for me to acquire another degree which was a major turn off for me. I knew that I wanted a career which had the opportunity to be remote and paid well. I learned in my nursing program that the job you dedicate your life too wont always be fun nor exciting, but should at least be gratifying to some degree. I decided to pursue programming, since I enjoyed the idea of turning your ideas into reality, problem solving, and having the ability to work from anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Prior to starting my journey 

I researched for months on what resources I should study and languages to learn. I came to a conclusion that I wanted to be a frontend developer, since it seemed the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù to accomplish (nothing about this is easy‚Ä¶). The languages I decided to learn are HTML, CSS, JS, REACT,  Git, Github, and bootstrap.  I started in June 2022 and decided to use the money I saved up from work to help fund me for remainder of the year, since I still have the luxury of still living with my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

# My journey so far 

It took me more than 3 months to actually have a good grasp on html, css, and some bootstrap fundamentals. I first started with freecodecamp.com then transitioned to a Udemy course. It was a slow grind trying to understand what each css property does and how it works with one another. I struggled to stay consistent when I first started off and was just going along with the tutorials and not actually making projects myself. 

It wasn‚Äôt until month 3-4 that I started to learn JavaScript and actually had a habit of coding everyday established. After I completed some JavaScript tutorials I decided to actually make my own project. I decided to create a crypto ROI calculator webpage and let me tell you it was a lot harder than what I imagined. Originally I thought it would take me the weekend to do, 4 hours a day, but eventually ended up taking a week to due since I forgot what css properties to use and ended up going to StackOverFlow and on YouTube to figure out what properties I needed to apply to my code.  

I can say without a doubt that I learned best from actually practicing the code through project building. After that project I decided it would best to learn how git and github work. I am currently in this process, having started this past Monday and learning how to do commits and how to contribute to open source projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What I have learned so far 

Some of the things I learned since I started my programming journey that I wish I could tell myself before starting are:

It vital to have some sort of schedule or time management and actually commit to it in order to make daily coding a habit. 

You‚Äôll eventually have multiple periods of self-doubt and having people around you question your actions thinking you‚Äôre crazy or dumb. 

You should learn JUST ENOUGH of each language to know how it works so that you can make projects, because this is where you actually learn and retain what you do. 

This is all trial and error, and that you shouldn‚Äôt get down for not understand something, important thing is just making sure you don‚Äôt stop trying to learn.  

Build weekly or monthly projects on top of your learning. Doesn‚Äôt matter what kind as long as you keep practicing the material you studied in order to keep it fresh.

Twitter is your best friend to find developer related content/advice

Have some side hobby that keeps you thinking (for me it was researching financial markets and crypto along with the gym) 

&amp;#x200B;

# My ongoing plan

So my plan for the following months will be to learn Git/Github and React. Once I completed that I will be building projects to add to my portfolio, setting up my resume/LinkedIn, researching interview questions, and hopefully going to interviews.

I know this will take months of work to do, but I want to at least be applying to places by February of next year since that is my birth month. I also intend to start going to any tech meet ups this month and make a habit of going at least 3x a month to some event. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Obstacles I am currently facing

Due to me going the self-taught route I found myself facing some difficulties which wouldn‚Äôt normally be a problem if I went to either a Bootcamp or college route. 

Networking is a main issue I am facing. I know tech meet ups/events are a thing and I intend to start going to them this month, but what other proven ways are there to network with people so that I can land a job interview or paid internship.

Unsure if I should be making a LinkedIn / resume as of right now with my current knowledge.

What type of projects I should be building that I can be used for my portfolio

&amp;#x200B;

# Final thoughts 

I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I started coding, but boy was I wrong haha. These past 5 months honestly thought me more about myself and how I think/learn than my whole time at college. I am grateful for the opportunity and will continue to pursue my goal of becoming a developer even if I end up spending a whole hour trying to debug my code only to realize I forgot to add a ‚Äú;‚Äù at the end of the line. Any advice on what I should be doing or not is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"

It is not about the money, I genuinely love software development so much, I would even do it for free! That is how dedicated I am to working in programming. I learned to program in High school and I've been doing so through college. I've just graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and no one since then want to hire me.

Here is my story:

I have been very unlucky when it comes to getting a job. I applied for internships in my Junior year and I was able to get a few test assessments and interviews. As I am approaching my final interviews, I got Covid and had to cancel all my interviews. It took a while for me to recover and by then, all of the positions were taken. A applied again and got a few test assessments and interviews and boom, a personal emergency and I had to reschedule the interviews again. Those positions were soon taken.

I didn't get a single internship in Junior year so I decided to try harder for Senior year. I was going to study abroad and I have an internship offer from the UK. I applied for my student visa and waited. Nothing. I waited even longer. Nothing! I started contacting UK Immigration and they told me it was processing. Nothing! University in the UK has already started and I am still in my country waiting for the Visa. Nothing! Then my internship was canceled on me because my visa didn't arrive on time. A day later I got my visa approved. AFTER 2 MONTHS of waiting! Talk about sheer luck, all of my classmates got their visas within 15 days, for some reason mine took 2 months. I filled everything out correctly, I am not sure why mine took so long.

Now, I came back and just graduated with no internship experience, but still passionate about software development. Sent out hundreds of applications (with personalized cover letters) in these 4 months and little to no response. I feel so disappointed in myself, I really want to be a software developer, but not having any recruiters give me a chance to work for them (even for free) has been weighing on me. I feel like I don't belong in this position and my dream career has died even before it started. I feel very depressed and these few months have been my darkest. With the recession looming overhead and companies doing a hiring freeze, I feel like that is the nail in the coffin for my dream job.

Please give me some encouragement, tell me that everything is ok, because I am about to give up at this point :("

I have not put much thought into things related to my major/career path besides taking my gen-eds and have only taken one CS class so far (Intro to Programming) which was incredibly uninformative as it never went beyond learning EXTREMELY basic Java like if/else and for loops statements. Other than this, I have ZERO programming/CS knowledge. After reading this sub and some others I realized that I should start learning on my own, especially since the quantity and quality of CS classes at my college are extremely low. I have started taking CS50x and plan to take the CS50 Web Dev course and the Full Stack Open course. I have 2 questions:

1. When it comes to building skills, projects, a resume, etc... Am I behind time-wise if I want a good chance to get a Junior internship? Basically, should I light a fire under my ass and start hardcore grinding or do I have some room to breathe?
2. I unfortunately have to take a 5th semester at my CC, maybe even a full year. Will delaying my graduation and extending my stay at CC for a semester or two impact potential internship/job opportunities?"

I have taken most core classes for my cs degree and I want to start looking for internships and overall expanding my knowledge with programming. Problem is, I'm not super sure where to go. I only took 2 cs classes which was principles of cs 1 and 2 where we focused on Java, which I have a good grip on. I'm not sure what I should really do to go from here, and i'm worried about internships because I only really know one language for programming. So yeah, any advice is massively appreciated! üòÅ"

**Interview Process**  
The format of the interview was essentially the same as the previous one. It started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. My interviewer also went out of his way to give me feedback on my resume and tips on answering screening questions.

Like the previous interview, the assignment itself was pretty simple, in concept. However, unlike the previous interview, it dealt heavily with DSA (though I'm pretty sure it can also be solved without DSA). My interviewer first asked me to just talk with him about different possible solutions. I just threw different ideas into the air and he commented on each possible solution (prompting me for more details if needed). After about 10 minutes, I started working on my implementation, talking about what I was doing and commenting each step of the way. There were a couple of bugs in my code, which I managed to fix. Afterward, my interviewer told me that my solution was the most-optimal implementation and then quizzed me on the time and storage complexity of the code.

Like last time, after the coding section was a Q&amp;A with my interviewer. He gave me detailed answers to all the questions I asked as well as some advice as a potential intern. Overall, I went way beyond the allotted time (about 2 and a half hours in total) though my interviewer said he noticed but just wanted me to have enough time to do my best work.

**Results**  
I heard back from my recruiter the following Monday, setting up a meeting for Wednesday. During the meeting, I officially received an offer for the internship."

Would love some insight. I‚Äôm currently 24. Graduated from university two years ago with a degree in Information Systems and minor in CS (took all the OOP Java courses but nothing beyond that). 

In University I started doing freelance web development work for small-medium sized businesses. The projects I take on range from $5k to $15k and are all over the map in terms of stack used and tech. All were front-end projects. 

Technical skills - I‚Äôm good in HTML/CSS/JS. Most solutions for clients I implemented in pure JS. Used React a few times. 

I was making some good money upon graduating so I didn‚Äôt bother looking for a job‚ÄîI continued freelancing. I was making around $85k a year gross income. 

The problem is I‚Äôm quite burnt out. Despite me trying to block off days I end up working on weekends, and on holidays. I don‚Äôt know if this is worth it if looking at a hourly basis. And talking with clients can get tiring. 

I‚Äôd love to enter the workforce as an entry level front end developer and have more structure in my life, just focusing on implementing code. 

Also‚ÄîI live in the US and am about to run out of my parents health insurance. Would love a corporate job with healthcare because healthcare premiums for self employed folks are fucking insane. 

Issue is‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have a CS degree, I have no ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù internship experience. 

Not sure how to market myself to potential employers.  Do I just put emphasis on solutions I‚Äôve built for clients and show them my portfolio? 

Then there‚Äôs the whole Data Structures and Algorithms part. I have zero knowledge of any of this beyond what is Big O and time-space complexity. Should I self study this? 

I ask because it seems like most companies interview front end candidates these DSA questions? Or am I wrong? 

Has anyone gone from freelancer to software engineer and can offer pointers/insight/advice? 

I feel like companies will just look at me and say ‚Äúlmao this guy is basically a new-grad but with a bullshit IS degree and no internship experience.‚Äù 

Maybe there are other corporate positions that I‚Äôm better suited for? 

Thank you!"
xxb8w3,1,2022-10-06,Moving out will either improve or destroy my mental health,StageAgreeable6213,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xxb8w3/moving_out_will_either_improve_or_destroy_my/,"Hey everyone, new to posting on reddit so apologies for anything wrong.

I, (21F), am considering moving out for the sake of my mental health. Here‚Äôs a little background on me.

I have struggled with anxiety ever since middle school, and recently (this summer, around June) I started having severe panic attacks. My mom knew about my anxiety, but I never opened up to her about specifics. When I started having panic attacks, we grew really close, and I feel as if I can talk to her about anything. I am extremely grateful for her.

However, even though I am doing better than I was back in June, I am not perfect. Sometimes, I still have severe panic attacks at random moments in which the best thing for me is to tell her because being in her presence, or really anyone‚Äôs presence that knows what I‚Äôm going through, is the best thing for moments of extreme stress. 

However, as of recently, it feels like I have no control over my life because my mom is constantly over my shoulder. I have to constantly tell her where I am, when I come home, and what I‚Äôm doing. If I don‚Äôt answer her texts right away she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm not doing well and get worried. 

Overprotective is the right word.

I recently talked to her about it, because she‚Äôs always asking me when I‚Äôll be home from school (i‚Äôm a college student) and I never know because it just depends on how much I feel like studying or doing homework. She wants me to wake her up to let her know I‚Äôm home if I come home past 10. I told her it makes me feel like a child and she told me she only worries because she thinks I‚Äôm not ready to be an adult (Ouch).

I also talked to my SIL about it, and she suggested that moving out might severely improve my mental health. I‚Äôve always been worried about moving out since sometimes I also feel like I can‚Äôt take care of myself, just like my mom had subtly told me. SIL thinks it would be tough at first but my anxieties about living on my own would eventually improve and I would feel way better off the sooner I move out.

I am considering her idea, but am still very conflicted. On one hand, I‚Äôve never felt like my room is my privacy because our walls are thin, and now that my dad is working from home I don‚Äôt have anywhere where i truly feel comfortable being myself. Having a place to call my own would help that. However, I feel as if moving out would make me feel very isolated, as I really rely on others for my mental health. Just having the presence of my family in the other room makes me feel safe and not alone. I currently don‚Äôt have the funds for it, since right now I am doing school and not working, but currently looking for an internship in my field. Moving out most certainly won‚Äôt be a right-away deal. 

I‚Äôm not into confrontation so I don‚Äôt even know how to bring this up with my parents, and whether I even should. Is my mom right in saying that I‚Äôm not ready to be treated as an adult yet, and I should stay home with her, or should I consider moving out as soon as i can comfortably do so?

TLDR: My mom is babying me since I have a severe anxiety disorder, but it makes me feel like a child and I‚Äôm not sure whether she‚Äôs right in doing so, or if I should move out for my own mental health sake."

I will be graduating soon with an undergrad computer science degree and ofc have the option to do a progressive degree program (PDP) to get my masters at USC after just a year. I can also apply to a different grad school for a 2 year program, or just go right into industry.

Is grad school a waste of time and money for me before even landing my first job? My parents would no longer be financing my tuition so I would have to take out loans for grad school. It seems like all my engineering friends are doing PDP (the 1 year program where u stay at ur undergrad school) and I can‚Äôt understand why but maybe I am missing something? Is the pay increase that good? I feel like many tech companies would gladly pay for ur masters as well after a few years of working there. 

Another thing to consider is that I am interested in AI, which I have heard sometimes requires a masters? The thing is, I am pretty meh at mathematics and probability but really great at programming and entrepreneurship so perhaps that may be a mistake! I was told by friends that AI as a career is mostly just writing equations, proofs, and doing really difficult probability questions. So maybe I should stay away and just go into software engineering.

Curious to hear your thoughts! Will happily take out loans and do PDP if someone can convince me it‚Äôs worth it.  I have no internship experience as I recently discovered as a senior that I have ADHD and was never able to focus during coding interviews (although now with meds I am a total beast at them). So maybe a masters is necessary to land a job for me??"

Lessor asked me to leave earlier because they wanted to move back in and I did. I've cleaned my room thoroughly, and cleaned the kitchen as good as I could.

Now they are telling me that they are not going to pay back the full Kaution because I allegedly left everything very dirty.

xxnqci,93,2022-10-06,What type of home-lab is acceptable for a resume?,HypnosG,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xxnqci/what_type_of_homelab_is_acceptable_for_a_resume/,"Hello, I've seen how home labs are highly encouraged to not only broaden your knowledge, but also gain some experience if you have none.

 I've mainly been messing around with Windows Server 2016, AD, GPOs, OUs, a bit of Linux (CentOs, Ubunutu), DHCP &amp; DNS servers, etc. All of this at a fairly beginner level, which has been great and I feel like I've learnt a lot. I listed this stuff on my resume to land my current position (IT internship).

I'm about to venture off a bit out of the traditional IT realm, by setting up and running an Algorand Blockchain Node on Ubuntu via VMware; and maybe even eventually write some smart contracts or make a basic project on the blockchain with Python.

My question is, would this new project be worth putting on a resume for IT jobs? I don't want to come off as the ""cringey crypto kid"" to employers. This is something I'm genuinely interested in, and will be doing regardless of if it looks good on a resume or not; it just would be a great benefit if it is considered relevant.

I'll be applying to some full-time IT roles 10 months or so from now. Later down the line I'm interested in getting into Cloud Services, managing/ maintaining, etc. Maybe a more DevOps style role? Would this experience be more relevant then?

TLDR: Will putting my home project experience with Blockchain nodes come off as cringey on a resume?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. The advice from you more experienced IT people makes sense, and falls pretty much in line with what I was expecting. I‚Äôll be continuing with both types of labs, and probably some more advanced but relevant things a bit closer to my graduation date!"

Is it possible to find a company that offers a 55k+ entry level/junior dev role? Would love to gain some insights as someone who‚Äôs about to venture the corpo life in less than a year

Given how long it's been since I've graduated, I'm wondering when these months of no schooling nor working will start hindering my chances at getting interviews. I have recently begun working on some personal projects, as well as practicing Leetcode (which I'm quite confident in), but is there anything else important that employers expect candidates to do amid long periods of unemployment (beyond applying, obviously)?"

With that being said, I‚Äôm somewhat aware that a SWE internship is better than an IT/SDE and that‚Äôs making me hesitate to accept and continue looking. 

For some background I‚Äôm a sophomore from a non target school with one previous swe internship at a small startup. I‚Äôve also applied to ~200 companies and have received roughly 10-15 OAs but no offers. 

Any advice or info would be appreciated!"

I'm a current sophomore studying CS+Math at a T5 interested in potentially interning/working as a trader after graduation. 

Last summer, I did SWE at a FAANG.

Right now, I have an offer for a summer 2023 ML Research Internship at a well-known unicorn. Or, I could do another SWE internship at a FAANG or similarly well-known company.
If I wanted to optimize my chances of getting a quant internship in summer 2024, what would be your advice to me?

A lot of people I know have gone the SWE -&gt; Trading route. On the other hand, my sense is that more experience with more advanced ML may also be helpful? I have some prior ML experience already from a data science internship and some ML research, for context.

Which, if either, would be more advantageous: SWE vs MLE internship for summer 2023? 

I'd find either to be interesting. 
Does SWE give more transferable skills? Does the FAANG brand name matter for a second summer? Does MLE give potentially more advanced, in demand skills?

Obviously the best way to break into quant would be to get a quant internship next summer, but that is not currently an option for me lol. Is there some other option that I should consider?
Thanks!"

I have been studying LC in prep for general swe roles, but because this is a team specific role the swe will be asking me to go over my app and questions to do with Technical Architecture, Design, Layouts, Data storage and flows. Situation: Im desperate to get any experience this summer.

xxqoua,5,2022-10-07,Mostly a vent --- unsustainable workload or laziness?,spychip2000,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/xxqoua/mostly_a_vent_unsustainable_workload_or_laziness/,"I'm in my final year of a 3 year MA program. I should be focusing primarily on my thesis, and my plan was to severely cut back on doing other things. I ended my TAship and I'm done taking classes, but I decided to continue on with my on-campus job (up to 10hrs/week), an internship (6 hrs/week), I'm obligated to be on a committee planning a large on-campus event (10 hrs/week), on top of continuing research for my thesis (7-10hrs of lab work/week) and writing the darn thing (I planned to do 2 hrs of writing a day). On paper, it is fewer things than I was doing last semester so I thought it would be easy but it feels like a lot more. 

I am exhausted. It seems that for one week I can chug along and get everything done, but then the next week I can barely leave my bed. When I'm overbooked, my thesis research and writing take a back seat. Even though finishing the thesis is my ticket out of here.

Last week was hard for me -- very busy, plus the weekend was spent celebrating a family member's birthday out of town. I feel like I didn't pull my weight in my shared projects, and I had to ask a colleague to help me with lab work that I literally did not have time to complete. We do tend to help each other out as a department so I didn't feel too bad about this, I've helped others before too. 

I realized my workload was a bit unsustainable, especially because I realize now my priority #1 needs to be my research and writing. I spoke with my supervisor and he agreed that I could cut down my internship hours and then spread them out through next semester. I am super grateful for that. 

But then today... I woke up feeling terrible. Aches, headache, light fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, runny nose. I feel terrible because I feel like I already dropped the plates I was juggling last week and now I'm essentially out  of commission -- even though I tested negative for COVID we have some immunocompromised people in my lab who would prefer I stay home. Truth be told I would also prefer I stay home, but that means another week of needing my colleagues to pick up my slack. 

I'm worried that they're getting tired of me and that my own poor planning/lack of work ethic has caused this. I have never really been able to ""grind"" and do 50+ hours of work per week. I feel wiped after doing 40 or, heck, even 30 sometimes. I feel like every time to do try to push myself I end up physically ill or in a mental breakdown and miserable with my life.

Right now I feel like I can't relax because I feel like I'm using not feeling well as an excuse. Like I should just load up on ibuprofen and drag myself to the lab tomorrow to at least wrap up my projects for this week, and then I can pass out over the weekend."

So naturally, I‚Äôm more or less very familiar with Python but get lost with certain concepts that aren‚Äôt present in those languages.

Does anyone have any sources or crash course videos that I can watch and be more comfortable with Python? I want enough expertise so I can comfortably do Leetcode mediums without having to open up syntax rules or try to find pythons version of how to use basic methods.

Moreover, I‚Äôm also looking for sources to brush up my DSA before fully committing to leetcode. I have taken DSA courses in college before but its been a hot minute (more than an year). 

I found a comprehensive guide someone posted on leetcode but its a little too comprehensive and I don‚Äôt want to spend 3 weeks just preparing for it. Or should I dedicate that kind of time? Or should I do both (leetcode and study DSA) simultaneously?

One last thing, I am looking for internships but have no referrals whatsoever. Realistically, if I have an average resume but unbrushed technical knowledge, will I be able to find an internship if I don‚Äôt brush up those skills. Say, I‚Äôm in a better position by January.

I did an audit internship last summer in EY and since I will be graduating soon, they gave me a priority offer (PO) to work with them full time. I have accepted the priority offer as I wanted to try and see if I can manage.

I heard from my peers that there are people who accepted the PO given by Big4 and in the meantime find a better job if they can, and then reject the accepted PO. But I'm not sure how true this is.

Is that allowed? Will there be any consequences if I have already accepted the PO and then inform them that I will not be working with them as I found another job? 

I don't mind working in EY audit, but if I have the option to choose a better choice, then I would choose the better one. My main concern is the working hours, not much of the salary.

Thank you!"

Now that I‚Äôve had time to get myself together and plan accordingly I‚Äôd like to work for them again, maybe even go there full time if they‚Äôd let me. I graduate in the fall of 2023 and my lease ends next June so I might resign a 6 month lease extension but I‚Äôm okay with that.

I think part of the reason is I felt at home there. I‚Äôd like to wait a month to reapply because the first time I applied I failed the drug test (for weed) and they kept me anyway so I don‚Äôt want any worries this time around. The last time I had contact with them was around March of this year.

I haven‚Äôt smoke weed since around September 1st. Should I wait until November to email the old HR manager or wait until I can pass an at home test?"

Any help deciding?,bell_telephone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xxysry/im_torn_between_two_summer_internship_offers_any/,"Hello all. I have received two internship offers and it's very difficult for me to decide between the two. Could anyone with industry experience weigh in?

## Northrop Grumman:

### Pros:

* Role would be programming-oriented. This aligns more with my career goals.
* The pay is slightly better
* NG seems more prestigious

### Cons:

* Would require me to move to Baltimore. I'm not comfortable in large cities, and I spend most of my free time out in the woods.
* Consequently, I would be (far) away from my family. My grandparents are getting old.
* Housing stipend does not entirely cover the cost of rent for a summer

## TJMaxx Distribution Center

### Pros:

* Local. I would not leave home for this role.
* The facility participates in local charitable events. I love this!

### Cons:

* The role is IT oriented. There would be little to no programming.



Could someone with experience weigh in, if I want to end up doing something more computer science oriented with my career, would I be hindering myself by doing an IT internship? This is the largest unknown and the largest deciding factor for me. Is TJMaxx as prestigious of a name as Northrop Grumman on a resume?

So for the last 3 months I've just been kind of... existing, since I work from home and despite multiple requests, no one assigned me any work.

This week I was officially hired as junior dev and assigned to a totally different team, on a totally different project based entirely on Angular. A framework in which I have 0 experience, of javascript, a language in which I also have 0 experience.

This week I tried my hardest to get up to speed on the project (which has been ongoing for about 3 years at this point), and tried to get into Angular itself.

And I'm stumped, I tried to do a couple courses, to understand the codebase, and got nowhere.

I'm completely out of my element here, I was hired as a backend java dev, and suddenly I'm supposed to be able to work on this. Got my first task coming up monday, and I have no clue how I'll go about it.

xy0kfl,1519,2022-10-07,Landing a job has nothing to do with technical skills,osrssam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xy0kfl/landing_a_job_has_nothing_to_do_with_technical/,"Piggybacking off [the discussion in this post](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xxg9ag/now_i_understand_why_it_took_me_so_long_to_land/) to give some advice to those frustrated with landing an internship or full time interview. 

___

First, a bit of background:

1.	Went to a medium sized university with a mediocre CS program
2.	Landed an internship at a large non-software company in their IT department from going to a career fair
3.	Upon graduating, had an offer from Amazon for SWE and an offer from the company I interned at, among others not worth mentioning
4.	Took the cushiony non-software company position and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Years later, I‚Äôm very involved in our college recruiting process. 


Based off the above, I would like to think that I‚Äôve figured out the important pieces to landing an interview relatively well. The biggest advice I can give is as follows:


**Landing an Interview**

As pointed out in the aforementioned post, most job openings have hundreds of applicants, of which only a handful get interviewed. Usually those in the handful have referrals. A referral does *not* necessarily mean your friend or family member works at the company. The most common referral, in my experience, is one where a recruiter got a positive impression of a candidate and passed their resume along with a positive note. 

-	Go to career fairs, events, clubs, etc. Even if you hate meeting new people, find a way to get yourself out there. Quantify it, gamify it, whatever you need. 
-	At career fairs, have copies of your resume to hand out, and use the resources on this sub and elsewhere to make your resume stand out. 
-	I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to say this, but PLEASE, take a shower and put on a business casual outfit for any networking. It‚Äôs astonishing how many unpresentable people we see at career fairs. If you can‚Äôt put in the effort to present yourself, we damn well won‚Äôt be hiring you. 
-	Smile, make eye contact, stand up straight, speak with confidence. Many take these things for granted as they come naturally, but for those that they don‚Äôt, practice these things. 
-	Follow up! If you met a recruiter, gave them your resume, and had a quick convo, reach out to them on LinkedIn! It puts your name in their head again, and shows your interest in the position. 

While most of these may seem obvious, the overarching theme is this: landing the interview has almost nothing to do with your resume, and everything to do with networking. I hate that it‚Äôs true, but I would rather hire a personable, outgoing, mid-tier student than a technical genius who can‚Äôt communicate. 


**Passing the Interview**

Once you‚Äôve got the interview, you‚Äôve already beat 90-95% of applicants (pulled that number out of my ass but still), so go into it with *confidence.*

-	If you‚Äôre remote, have your resume open. When answering questions you can refer to your experience directly on your resume, asking the interviewer to do the same. ‚ÄúIf you have my resume handy, position X mentions Y. In that role‚Ä¶‚Äù This is huge, you‚Äôre painting a picture of yourself and your experience, help us use the tools available to paint that picture. 
-	Smile, make eye contact, stand up straight, laugh if they make a joke, share an anecdote where appropriate, etc. Most companies are hiring for culture fit, so rather than getting bogged down by the details, show that you‚Äôre someone they would enjoy working with. 
-	For technical interviews: vocalizing your thought process is #1, so practice this. Also, if you don‚Äôt know an answer, share how you would find it. In my Amazon technical interview I didn‚Äôt get a working solution at all, and literally said ‚Äúif I was solving this for work rather than for an interview I would google ‚Äò&lt;exact query&gt;‚Äô.‚Äù I ‚Äúfailed‚Äù the technical interview, but still got a handsome swe offer because of the other things. 
-	Show that you have a passion for tech. If you aren‚Äôt passionate about it and just want a paycheck, *pretend.* 


Hopefully this helps, and I will be glad to answer any questions! At the end of the day, there are countless applicants, many with great resumes, and many with awful resumes - the main thing that will set you apart is everything that isn‚Äôt on your resume. Hell, the #1 candidate I‚Äôm looking at right now has 0 relevant experience, but he was the most enjoyable to talk to, showed a passion for problem solving and tech, and showed he‚Äôs eager to learn. It‚Äôs the intangibles that count!


Edit: 
I definitely should‚Äôve worded my title differently - it‚Äôs not so much that you can be a great person with no technical expertise and land a SWE role. It is more so that the technical skills you build are your foundation, but that is the same foundation every other grad is building. The tips above are things that allow you to differentiate yourself from all the other qualified resumes in the stack. 

Also should‚Äôve mentioned in experience that I interviewed with multiple FANG companies and countless tech-adjacent/non-tech companies during my undergrad. The Amazon role and my current role (which includes recruiting) were just most relevant anecdotally.

Finally, this is just my advice from my experiences - by no means do I think this is all encompassing, but I hope it helps a student or two land a job!"

For some background, I'm a third-year student studying Computer Science. I'm only taking 12 credits this semester, but I still seem to get easily overwhelmed by my courses &amp; life in general. I've been battling my anxiety (and a healthy dose of depression) for my whole tenure as a college student.

On top of this, in order to graduate I need to get a couple of internships, and I work a dozen or so hours a week - so the stress is on. On days when I have interviews I get so overwhelmed I tend to skip classes, which is becoming a problem.

What are some strategies that you have used to stay productive and avoid feeling overwhelmed? I tend to scrape by with the bare minimum, and I haven't done any personal projects or anything. As a whole, I'm dissatisfied with my progress and could use some advice."

I was admitted into a development internship at my alma mater.

I was drooling to dive into their codebase, there's a lot of interesting stuff there, but for a while, I'm tasked with documenting how to use their software. It's aimed mainly at researchers and since they usually are not in the exact sciences, they might not have a clear idea on how to use it. I spent the week writing stuff like how to clone the repository, activating a virtual environment, updating the software, creating and changing directories using the CLI.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still super happy about being invited for the position (esp. because I was invited), but for someone who expected to see pure code, there's a lot of other stuff involved. The first three days was all boring meetings where they said so much stuff that most of it has completely flown over my head lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, very glad I got it. Soon I'll be the main person responsible for their python coding and it seems I'll have to implement a SQL database on my own.

Wish me luck!"

To me, going through all this effort only to possibly not even get the position is insane. I haven't been doing well the past few days so the idea of taking a two hour coding assessment and going through all this makes me want to permanently transform into a rock. I don't know if I should just tough it out and go through the assessment even though it'll likely be tortuous. I've been thinking about just not doing the assessment and dropping the company so that I can focus my drained and limited energy into other things.

Are all interview processes this complicated? Is this just the reality I will have to go through in order to get an internship? Is this just the case for big companies? I have also been applying to a bunch of small-medium/medium sized companies and have an interview with one in a few days, and their application process doesn't seem this convoluted."

xy87qd,32,2022-10-07,Down with the Nonprofit Industrial Complex,deadwards14,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/xy87qd/down_with_the_nonprofit_industrial_complex/,"So this post will be somewhat rambling, as my fingers are fueled by adrenaline, but I just have to say absolutely fuck the nonprofit industrial complex (NPIC).  


I work at a relatively small nonprofit of 20 employees, with 5 being in South Africa. While the nature of our work in reproductive justice has us understandably busy of late with the recent broadside of legislative and judicial attacks on reproductive autonomy, we're completely burnt out: overworked, underpaid, and disrespected. 

What is sad is that this burnout is not due to the external challenge of beating back the boomers, but instead comes from the grating and undeniable awareness of just how exploitative, hypocritical, and dishonest those who publicly present themselves as being champions of pay equity, fairness, and progressive politics can be.   


Our Executive Leadership is totally obsessed with getting more and more funding. This would be okay if they were equally committed to doing the work and honoring their obligations to the communities they use to attract money. However, their greed has led to them overextending themselves (aka their employees).   


We have over 26 open projects, each requiring roughly 2,300 total labor hours/year, or around 59,000 each year. Each employee is 'supposed' to work 40 hours/week, so there's only 38,400 hours available per year. This **21,000 hour** deficit must come from somewhere right? Of course it comes out of our weekends, our days off, or evenings with family and friends, etc. All the while, they refuse to give raises except for the Executive Leadership Team (twice in 2 years). It would take every employee ***62*** ***hours a week*** with no days off, no sick time, nothing, just to keep up, and they're still pushing for more projects that we cannot even possibly complete.  


So I sent a breakdown of the math to our ""HR"" person, who is also our de facto VP. What was the response? First it was ""I'm emotionally drained from a personal issue this weekend, so I don't have the bandwidth to respond"". A few days later, I get a call basically explaining that they had to fire ""underperformers"", so that's why, completely ignoring that regardless of productivity level, its mathematically impossible for us to ""perform"". I was then gaslit and told that we don't have the money for raises because they're hiring new people, and things will get better. The person on the phone reassured me that management really understood and they were committed to making things better. What's the remedy, a fucking Christmas party and a $500 Amazon gift card at the end of the year.   


If this weren't insulting enough, today I found that they are paying **$15,000** for ""mindfulness meditation training"" to one of the Exec Director's friends! I told them that we can get the *Calm* app for work, which would cost us only $1000 per year for the *entire organization*. So we don't have the money for cost of living adjustments, bonuses, or increased benefits. We don't have money to hire someone in my 2-person communications department, which technically works on *all 26* projects. We don't have money to pay our interns, or to pay our contractors on time, but we do have money for some guy to play YouTube videos about meditation (literally what the 'training' consists of) for $15k? An utter joke.

There is a lot of funny accounting and ""lost"" funds in the six-figure range every year. Happened upon a CC receipt that showed our Exec Dir spending $5000-$6000/month on the company card on personal expenses. But this latest bs was the final nail in the coffin for me. To be gaslit and lied to about why I should feel grateful to live off of credit cards paycheck-to-paycheck, only to discover that they can generate $15,000 for totally frivolous bullshit out of thin air days later? I can't take it anymore.  


So I've applied for us to unionize. I encourage any other nonprofits in a toxic workplace to do the same! (will post link in comments)

This was definitely a venting rant post, but hopefully it encourages people to create a solidarity network within their own workspace and to tap in to existing resources of support out there. 

Management wins when we stay silent and isolated."

Taking honors Economics (no other honors  offered besides the ones I mentioned) 

Did Spanish I freshman year, skipped to Spanish III sophomore year, did Spanish IV junior year (all 98-99), no language class this year (IV is max) 

Going SAT optional 

Rec letters will be amazing since I‚Äôm very close with all of my teachers and actively engage and participate. I always reach out for guidance if needed

Awards:

Excellence in an Environmental Literacy &amp; Job Training Award from an internship I did for a few months

High Honors every year (eligible if overall average is 95+)

Academic Achievement in mostly all of my classes every year

Hope to get National Honors Society this year (I didn‚Äôt get it last year because I was online) 

ECs: 

- Environmental Internship (cleaned litter, gardened, gave away food, etc in a poor neighborhood, studied community organizing/leadership, received an award for outstanding performance and dedication)
- Family caretaker: I take care of my chronically ill dad who is over the age of 65 and do household chores, translate, etc. I also tutor my younger brother

xy9feb,1,2022-10-07,Quitting the family business.,Gloomy_Anything_5581,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/xy9feb/quitting_the_family_business/,"Sorry about the large amount of text. My problem is in the last few paragraphs below the new lines but I also need to vent. Originally written for IATA reddit but it ended up being way too long. I want someone to see it.

 I(29M) have for the past 6.5 years been working at my family business(auto-repair shop). It all started when I got home from overseas travel after deciding I didn't want to invest money/loans in a university education I couldn't commit interest in.  
It was at Christmas evening when my fathers brother suggested I should come work with them in the family business since they had 2 people quitting soon. They were both very drunk(Both massive alcoholics) but I gave them a clear ""No I am not interested in working there. I want to try to get my own job."" I had recently been working in another country for the past year and I was fairly confident I could get an entry level no-skill job which had been easy for me before. I couldn't stand them at this point so I ended the conversation.

At the start of the year when they go back to work I get my dad yelling at me at the side of my bed saying that he's going to work and he's telling me to come with him. I said no but he keeps yelling at me to get up or he's going to be late. I tell him to go away and after about an hour of yelling he's off but my day is ruined. (he's an hour late from doing this.)  
Next day same thing happens. This time I give in and reluctantly agree to come with him but I try to make it clear that I am looking for other jobs.

Somehow I let it go for a few months(lack of discipline most likely as well as other than it being the ""family business"" I can't find any job better than the one I have ) then I try to educate myself to become some sort of IT support at home, taking courses, certifications etc. eventually even applying for internships.  I am always a little bit worried he's going to be upset when I leave but when I tell him that I am looking to get into IT(I had a cousin willing to help me get a entry level job at his firm) he asks me to wait for a bit because now is not a good time for me to leave.

Time passes and I notice the relationship between my dad and my uncle is getting very strained, eventually my uncle quits. My dad is furious saying things like he's going to kill him etc... at about the same time going out into the woods drunk as,  with a shotgun threatening me and my family he's going to kill himself because we're nagging him to stop drinking(Mostly my mom who has actually been a bit of a nag on him. Not excusing his behavior or saying she's wrong to do so.)

During this period I am escaping into computer games which I did a lot in childhood when living at home.   
I had put away a lot of money so I moved out as fast as I possibly could. I had not been in queue to get a rental property so I bought an apartment for way more than I would have otherwise wanted to just to get out.(It was impossible to sleep since my dad at this time was playing hunting films all night at max volume. So I was very eager to get away. Obviously my mom had her own room already.)

It takes some time and I readjust. My thinking was originally that as I moved out I would be able to cut him out of my life and get my agency back. I hesitate probably because I'm wrong in the head mentally but also that my sisters and my mother was still living with him.  
Eventually my sisters and my mom move out too (little sister lives with mom and she has stabilized a lot psychologically since they moved.)

He starts becoming a lot more relaxed which is a huge relief. I start enjoying work more and doing better at it. Since I was not allowed to work overtime(even without payment or even low payment) I focused most of my energy on building my body which has been a satisfying endeavour and I've gotten to a good place there. 

More people leave the business and now it's only me, my cousin and my dad left. I tried to leave again at the start of the year, he did nothing to stop me but it seemed to me that anywhere I went it would be just the same and I would  probably have to cut ties with my dad who I can actually be around during mornings now(any other time he's drunk).  
I ended up demanding again that he let me work overtime for billed hours which is an extremely big earning for his business. I do this for about a month but then he stops paying me. 

I told him at around summer since he can't run his business(he's basically a cripple from destroying his body with alcohol) he should sell it to me and retire early since he's around that age and give me an opportunity to make more than what is almost minimum wage.   
I try to be firm with it that he needs to go through with it if he wants me to stay, we also discuss the thing with another interested party who wanted to buy it together with me. For this arrangement he was thrilled and willingly able to sell the business for way less than the building(which is the only value in the business) was worth.  For various reasons I decided I had to cut the arrangement off. (I later realized it had nothing to do with the arrangement but I just didn't want to work with cars at all. I have never had any interest in cars.)  
I come to an agreement with my dad that he'll sell 50% of the business to me and give me more agency in it. Ideally even go down in time and only come in a few times a week and not the full week.(I don't want him there because he's basically just a bad telephonist and money-spunge hybrid. He doesn't earn any money for a business that costs a lot to run and is in my mind unnecessary.)

Nothing happens. I try to press him to make it so I can get a stake in the business to pay off. He doesn't take any action. After a lot of attempts to get access to the bank so I can actually run the business he's basically given up on and make purchases I don't have to pay for myself he eventually gives in and I can order a debit card.

At this time I've already decided to start my own company though with the energy I had from the start of this year(been making a lot of personal changes) I ended up deciding to try to get into rental cars which would be a good supplement to the business I'm in since i know repairs and car value quite well.

I actually had a solid business model down to the penny but then one morning I realized I'm already quitting the business with this model. Why should I make it something I don't want to do?  
My interest has always been with technology. I have been a bit hesitant about going into computer science(although it has been something that's come naturally to me before) since I associate that field with gaming which in my mind has always been where losers meet.  
Of course that's ridiculous but just the way the mind works. A lot of nerds in CS and honestly I don't associate with this group personally(Just not the same interests.).   


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway once I realize programming and engineering is where I want to go I am dead set and I get a great opportunity for an education with a job tied to it (though 15000 eur. fee payed by employer) with better salary than I already have now. I have been to an interview and I think I have a good chance of getting one of two spots they have available.  
The spot allocation is based on an IQ and personality test as well as two interviews to discern the candidates with the most drive and ambition to complete the course and the one year of work associated with the course cost.  
I know getting a job as a self-thought programmer is the hardest part so this is a massive opportunity.  
The problem is without me, the business crumbles since my dad is unable to work, my cousin(who unfortunately is a very negative addict-personality like my father) isn't putting the hours in, and I have an intern  sister who relies on me.(18. Though she says she wants to leave and I intend to put a lot of effort in to help her in this. I consider myself as her only male role model and I really try my best to be available to her and help her grow as a person. Mainly not to do my own mistakes.)

If I get the job, I have one month before I have to quit this current job which is not a lot of time to end a business. My dad says he wants 6 months for me to go which for me is inconceiveable. I have seen earlier that his promises that he needs time to action mean nothing.  
I think he is manipulative already and that this might be another way of him saying something and then not doing it. If I give him more time he's just going to want more time and keep me as a ""slave"".

Basically I put these people who I think have been abusive and neglectful to me in a very bad spot and I feel a little bit guilty.  
Writing this text helps me a lot justifying the problem to myself but I'd also love an outside opinion on it.  
I am going to go through with it if given the chance."

My question is if i start working there as an intern would that forcibly make my career path a game dev path. I have no problem with game development, it's just not my passion. Or can i do an internship there and work on data skills on my own? If so would that internship increase my chances at getting a job in data science or would it be considered irrelevant?"
xya37i,0,2022-10-07,Any Career Advice for Chronic Illness?,Lone-Red-Ranger,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xya37i/any_career_advice_for_chronic_illness/,"I am a 28yo male with many chronic health problems looking for advice on what type of job/career I could possibly manage. Details below are for greater context. I need advice, not pity :)

**Education:** Due to my health, school took a while, and I got a B.S. in Food Science last year, and a Master‚Äôs of Science in Management (MSM) this Summer, both from the University of Florida. The MSM was an attempt at giving me easier jobs, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment, due to a poor program and my lack of business savvy. That was $17,000 down the drain. Looking back, I should‚Äôve just gotten some type of tech-based job, instead of something that I liked (food science), so I could get more of a desk job. My resume is pathetic, and I was never able to do any internships, since I was just trying to get through each semester.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is common, but my college education seemed like a joke, and I went to a big school. Classes were either impossibly difficult weed-outs, unstructured and confusing, or just a semester of vague bullet points. I *took* classes, but retained very little, which is likely a combo of my own mind and the education system, based on others‚Äô complaints. The college advisors during both my undergrad and master‚Äôs were worthless, and most people seem to not understand chronic illness.

**Concerns:** I am undiagnosed, despite a list of symptoms and having gone to Mayo and Cleveland Clinics for years; this is for clarity. My biggest problems are fatigue, weakness, digestive issues, neurological problems, major brain fog, and memory issues. Digestive is mostly pain, constant upset, and occasional nausea from gastroparesis, and the neurological mostly affects my hands (this took a while to ‚Äúpeck‚Äù type), a symptom that hit overnight last year, and seemed to have ‚Äúzapped‚Äù my brain too. The cognitive and neuro symptoms are gradually worsening, and it is extremely depressing. I thought they were bad before, but I have been losing basic thinking capabilities over the past few months. I also feel disoriented, and everything seems surreal, which isn‚Äôt fun. Some days I am so exhausted and feel so bad that I can barely sit upright. However, some days are more tolerable and productive, but I am only as good as my worst days.

**Strengths &amp; Weaknesses:** For those that know Myers-Briggs, I am very much an ISTJ. I‚Äôm extremely organized, and a natural manager (when I know what I‚Äôm doing). I‚Äôm a natural scientist, and not very creative (so no blog or YouTube), but I‚Äôm a problem solver and have been told that I have good ideas and solutions to things, on small and large matters (again, when I understand things), although I don‚Äôt expect to actually change the world. However, I don‚Äôt have any passions, ambitions, or drive. This might be caused by my health. Basically anything business- or tech-related is a struggle for me.

**Job options:** With all of this being said, I realize that if I was in a third-world country, or another point in history, I would just need to ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù and work at a street vendor or something. I have accepted that my life is a struggle in many ways, so this is just another part of it. To prevent mistakes in any job, maybe I will need to keep ‚Äúcheat sheets‚Äù around as a personal adaptation.

I would prefer a work-from-home job, but those options are limited. The MSM program was online, and that was probably the only way I pulled it off; the remote classes since Covid was a lot easier on me. The dilemma of ‚Äòentry-level jobs need 3+ years experience‚Äô also sucks. I‚Äôve downgraded my job search to requiring only a high school education.

I‚Äôve been looking into bookkeeping, but starting my own business is daunting and I don‚Äôt want to make any mistakes with money (this goes for any accounting roles), since I retained nothing from my accounting classes (and my mind struggles). If WFH is not an option, then I was wondering about healthcare administration. I would be perfectly fine being the guy who walks around with a clipboard, checking things routinely, and making adjustments (especially in a food factory). I‚Äôm able to drive, but it probably shouldn‚Äôt be a major part of the job.

I don‚Äôt know if there are any certifications that would help in certain fields, but I took a free Excel course at my school a few months ago, then the optional $130 certification exam, and I didn‚Äôt pass, and I used Excel quite a bit during undergrad, so I was not a complete newbie. Needless to say, I just can‚Äôt get a break in life!

I don‚Äôt need to be rich, and maybe part-time jobs are the only option for me, but Social Security only pays $800/month, and that ain‚Äôt enough! Luckily, I still live with my younger brother, who just graduated and helps out with things.

I‚Äôm a Florida guy (still in Gainesville), but with the recent Hurricane Ian, I‚Äôm open to anywhere in the Southeast (mostly for weather).

Feel free to provide ‚Äútough love‚Äù on this; maybe that‚Äôs what it takes :)

All of my experience on my resume (4) says ‚ÄúFull-stack Software Developer‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúFull-stack Software Developer *intern‚Äù*

Background:

Currently a senior at a college in the US. Finished 4+ rounds of interviews for an entry position at a top-tier company in the US. Got offer and signed. Received a form from Sterling for background check.

I was filling out the form for my employment history and opened up my resume for reference. And‚Ä¶ I realized none of my experience had ‚Äúintern‚Äù in job titles.

This is the resume I‚Äôve been using for all the applications.

I‚Äôve seen from other posts that you should be fine if you clarified they were internships during the interviews. However, I am not sure if I did for all of them. I did clarify, though, for two of them when I had to elaborate on each of them but I think that‚Äôs it. (I was only asked questions for two of the experiences)

I honestly don‚Äôt know why I did not put *intern* for my job title. Maybe I thought it was implicit considering I was in school and those positions were short-termed (4 months for each)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had an intent to deceive any but honestly speaking, everyone could make the claim‚Ä¶. I am extremely anxious that my action can be deemed as a fabrication‚Äîor even at best, conducting unethical resume exaggeration.

Thank you all for reading. I‚Äôd like to know what is best for the next steps. I have not submitted the form yet. I am not opposed to contacting my recruiter (or anyone who deals with this) for a quick phone call and telling him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about the unprofessionalism but I just noticed the discrepancy in job titles.‚Äù

Even if they rescind my offer, I don‚Äôt think I would blame them for doing so. From their point of view, I would look like a candidate without integrity.

TLDR: I made the terrible mistake of omitting *interns* for my work experience on my resume, which I used to get an offer from my dream company. Need to submit the form by Sterling for background check and would like to know what to do. Should I just proactively tell them and come clean (at the stake of my offer) or wait for them to call me on the matter after Sterling shares the result?

Thank you so much all. Appreciate any feedback..."

I also have a decent understanding of leetcode problem solving and am working my way through neetcode 150, as well as reading some algo books. My issue is I have zero network and no real way to build that. I will be attending every career fair possible. The main issue is the city I live in I 1000% do not wanna live in after college and it doesn‚Äôt have much tech population anyways. What should I do? I‚Äôm confident if I get interviews I can do decent in the technical portions and decent on the people skills portion.

I've failed almost every one of them and they are draining. I've taken possibly 25 now and have done well on only one of them. I know I need to study more and get better. I feel as if I'm wasting my time doing the challenges when I should just be studying for them intensely. I was wondering - would it be a good idea to take a pause on applying to internships in October, study until December, and start replying in December? I know SWE internships end their processes early, but I just want an internship that is not at a startup (doesn't need to be FANG). Did anyone else experience this? Are startups the only companies looking for interns still in December/January? The last company I worked at had only a handful of employees and I would love to work for a slightly bigger company (1000ish employees) . Please let me know your opinions! I guess my main question is: what type of companies do spring recruitment?"

xyll6z,2,2022-10-08,CS New Grad / Career Change Roast and Resume Review,sbfffnico,EngineeringResumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/xyll6z/cs_new_grad_career_change_roast_and_resume_review/,"Hey all,

I'm looking for a peer roast/review of my resume.  I am a recent CS graduate as of August 2022 and haven't made it past the resume check yet in about 100 applications since I graduated.

I was working full-time through school and do not have any relevant work or internship experience. I am currently working on some side projects to help boost that section as I don't feel I have anything impressive to show directly from coursework.  I know the current project section isn't very strong.  The plan here will be to have 2-3 different working resumes with the project sections tailored with languages/frameworks relevant to the position applied.

At 31 years old, this is also a career change.  I limited down my work history to the recent few years to help reduce everything to one page and I believe I applied the STAR method as best I can.

In this recent iteration, I removed some languages and technologies I haven't touched in a while, such as C/C#/Python/Java, but plan to add them back in as I brush back up on them.

Would it be advised to switch the ordering on my sections as well? I've been thinking about reordering to Skills -&gt; Projects -&gt; Work Experience -&gt; Education as I don't believe my work experience will hold too much weight.  The only development experience is with some proprietary templates our company uses as a make-shift software and some tools developed to help streamline duties, both of which use VBA.

I'm thinking if I don't get some interview practice soon that I may try a WITCH company to help springboard by resume into a better position since I've started my career this late already.

xynesj,4,2022-10-08,SDE Internship at Amazon (Seattle) vs SWE Internship at Gusto (San Francisco) - Summer 2023,rising_coder,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xynesj/sde_internship_at_amazon_seattle_vs_swe/,"
Looking for advice! 
TC about the same, ~12k / mo. 
All in all, which one would you choose? Taking in count: impact, challenges, prestige, wlb, and future opportunities at other top companies (HFT, FANG, other Unicorns)

My views: 
While interviewing at gusto (YC W12), I‚Äôve realized the people there are really smart, humble, and motivated towards empowering employees of small businesses from around the country. The culture is great, and the intern class size is small. Gusto is one of the top unicorns in Silicon Valley sailing towards an IPO. Something I‚Äôve realized is that maybe it‚Äôs not that well known? Some of my friends recognized it because of the Gusto Wallet ads, while others didn‚Äôt recognize it at all; what are your views on that?


Amazon, well, a FAANG company, large-scale challenges that make it interesting, and has some of the best engineers as well. However, apparently the WLB may not be that good (depending on the manager). Because this is a difficult year for the industry, there will be way less interns this year than previous years.

What are your thoughts?

What might you recommend?,jhlo9001,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/xyo4eh/im_a_teenage_black_girl_who_is_low_income_what/,"To preface this, I live in California, although as I have mentioned a few times, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stay here (I will likely work here for a few yrs - I don‚Äôt like how expensive it is, nor how as a young black woman I am not around people who look like me.) 

I am starting at community. In Cali, the first yr is free. 

I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and have struggled with both since I was 9.

I admitted in therapy that being low income to a point wherein my dad paid the cable bill and internet bill a day late yesterday (I cried) and just seeing how many issues everyone in my family has makes me almost feel like we are back in slavery times. 

I have never been good at socializing. I am likely a mixture of both emotional and rational, or this feels most fair to say. 

I am good at remembering what people tell me directly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the type that is great at making people feel like they are really being listened to (well‚Ä¶ it depends, but.) 

My personality type (ISFJ) is common. 

I have dealt w sleeping issues for the past two years. 

My family is low income, and I think about this a lot more now that I‚Äôm almost in college. 

This summer I found that I liked working w kids, when it‚Äôs hot outside I tend to be in a better mood. 

I don‚Äôt like having to be up early in the morning but am capable of doing it. 

I‚Äôve noticed that I tend to get sick easily, but I read somewhere that this is partly due to your immune system weakening when you don‚Äôt sleep enough (I definitely do not sleep enough.) 

My therapist seems impressed w my self awareness around the internalized racism I deal w and my understanding of systemic racism/oppression, alongside my understanding that my parents and brother have so many issues due to trauma. 

I can have a good memory for historical facts.

I am one of those people who is good at completing assignments in class (like the Google doc assignments that we do in Google classroom are a breeze for me, I find them easy to complete or find it easy to just type something up.) 

I have started reading more this school year, which is a good thing. I have particularly been reading King books (‚ÄúMisery‚Äù which I finished, and ‚ÄúThe Green Mile‚Äù which I‚Äôm on now.) I never used to read that often outside of school before. 

I ideally want to make no less than average income. If I end up w a low income job, I will likely eventually be miserable

I genuinely enjoy doing research on mental health disorders (for the health thing I‚Äôm in we have to, I actually really like it.) 

I dropped pre cal as a junior and am not a huge fan of math 

I am a very nostalgic sort of person, always have been. 

I don‚Äôt like having to wear my mask. My mother is strongly against the COVID vaccine but when I‚Äôm an adult it will be my personal choice 

I type over 100 WPM and used to spend a lot of time on the computer and honestly still do 

I don‚Äôt want to make under $50,000 regardless of where I move. My ideal salary would be at least $70,000 annually. 

I don‚Äôt like physiology this school yr even though I‚Äôm passing the class. I tend to fail the tests and it‚Äôs the class where I don‚Äôt study or care. 

I thrived when I worked w elementary school aged kids this summer during my internship.

Ever since I have come to this school, I feel I have become the most jaded, anxious, self-conscious, and unsocial version of myself. I really feel like this school has made me turn out worse personality-wise, and I don't believe that I've already put up with three years of this shit.

On paper, I seem successful, above a 3.5, have amazing internship experience, and well on my way into grad school, but I do NOT feel like a HUMAN, socially! I notice that when I talk with my parents, I only ever complain or talk about negative stuff. And even some of my old friends (I have not made really any ""true"" friends on campus) tell me that all I do is complain and complain, which has really opened my eyes. I barely even laugh or joke around these days. This in turn has made me really unsociable and unpleasant to be around, which even I can tell. 

Thing is, I know I used to not be like this. I used to be able to suck it up, at least put on a pleasant facade, and be an okay guy to be around. I've joined social clubs, worked on myself physically and fashionably, and have a healthy lifestyle. Hell, I had a blast this past summer (not at Tech) and made some really great friends and memories, and I felt like a HUMAN for the first time in a WHILE. And now that I'm back on campus, I'm back to square 1 on my personality and social skills! I'm literally just a Negative Nancy at this point, and I fear that this is who I'll become stuck as in the future.

Is this a me problem or do I just not vibe with this school at all? Please, I just want to hear some folks who may have experienced or experienced similar situations. It's probably way too late as a 4th year to even try to have fun, but I need some understanding and closure as to why I have failed socially in this college environment."

I have an interview coming up with Microsoft that is planned for this week coming. Although it hasn't been scheduled yet. I passed the codility test.

As a bit of a background, I have around a year experience including internships. I am worried since ethis role doesn't seem to be a grad role so I wonder if I am in under my depth.

Also I am running through their interview tips PDFs and all the resources on Google for Microsoft SWE interviews and I still lack confidence. I also still find leetcode mediums difficult. However don't have much time to improve that situation.

Should I just do it for the experience or should I consider not doing it so as not to waste any time? I worry they blacklist if you don't do amazing in the interview.

Any insight is appreciated!"

I started in a company as a .Net intern. I was put in a team of 4 people including me who oversee one of the application for the company, including, system maintenance, enhancement, deployment, everything a client would require, new or old. One of the people (our head) then went on a holiday, leaving with 3 people including me. A 'lead developer', a 'system support engineer', and me, slowly transitioning toward a hybrid role 'support/developer' because of the lack of our head. After 2 months of internship, I was asked to start working there full time due to lack of manpower.  Our old head came back from his holiday and has left due to some circumstance that doesn't allow him to work in the company. The support colleague was in charge of everything, so was handling clients, managing tickets, and managing resources.

Current Situation:

Now it's been a month, and the acting head has found another job too. He was really unhappy with how much he was getting paid, so he was looking for a better opportunity. Now I am expected to fill his shoes. Of course I will have help, he's here for a month, and I will have support from my supervisor, but eventually, I think they will want me to be able to handle this, probably within a couple of months.

Questions:

1. So my two questions, what is the role that I'm being prepped towards, because currently, my official position is 'Technical assistant'. They're not very big on titles.
2. Other, how would I know when to ask for a raise, currently my salary is 45k AUD per year. My colleague who's leaving had his pay raised to 50k from I'm guessing something similar to mine. He's worked here for a year, and that was a recent increase, a few months ago, which he revealed to me after his news of leaving.I was originally expecting around 60 - 70K, but due to my lack of experience and professional knowledge, I was offered that much. How long would it take for me to earn that much? Also, I have a Master's in IT with Software Design and Development specialization."

&amp;#x200B;

As avea si eu nevoie de cateva sfaturi in legatura cu schimbarea jobului.

Momentan sunt angajat pe o pozitie de SL3 in cadrul unei banci din Romania de 1 an+.

Mai am ca si experienta relevanta 2.5 ani anterior L1 + L2 (am avansat) pe o aplicatie din HORECA ( Aplicatie Cloud pentru restaurante + parte de rapoartare )

&amp;#x200B;

Ca si skiluri am:

Oracle SQL - Veirifcari date pentru rapoarte, extragere date din DB dar si lucruri ce tin de partea de DBA. 

Python -&gt; Am creat automatizari de access la jobul actual unde am folosit RE, Pandas, OPENPYXL, Beautiful Soup. (am redus cu 35%+ timpul de procesare si automatizat o buna parte din munca manuala)

GIT -&gt; folosit la versionare cod

QLICK Sense - Am creat o aplicatie de personal finance ( cu date din extracte bancare.)  


Am si un general 'computer knowledge' foarte bun datorita experientei dar si pasiuni pentru calculatoare.

Cursuri/certificari :

Kluger - Advanced Python 

Python &amp; Pandas ( Curst intern oferit de actualul angajator)

Oracle Academy - SQL beginner ( nu am dat si certificarea) 

Mentionez ca anul asta am si terminat facultatea ( Domeniul: Statistica, Cibernetica si Informatica Economica profiulul: Informatica Economica )

Imi doresc o pozitie de Data Scientist / BI developer dar nu cunosc urmatoarele:

\- Sunt cele de mai sus indeajuns pentru o astfel de pozitie ?

\- Ce as putea face pentru a fi un candidat mai potrivit ?

\- Recomandati urmarea unui master in domeniu ?

 \-Ce salariu ar trebui sa cer la interviuri ? 

Mentionez ca iau 8,5k net la jobul actual si probabil pot gasi mai bine. Problema este ca nu mai vreau support si as fi disponibil si la un salariu mai mic atat timp cat oportunitatiile de crestere reala (exponentiala) exista."

A good friend of mine recently came from overseas via F1 study visa. To those not familiar: this visa allows you to attend U.S. university to study. However, you are not granted a social security number or official work authorization.  

The guy is a programmer and is studying for his database scientist master degree. He really wants to gain experience in the field, both to improve his English communication skills and to gain relevant experience in professional aspect. 

However, the F1 visa does not allow one to work, or attend internship outside of programs provided by his university. Absurd, I know, but it is what it is.

What advice can you give that may help him to overcome this obstacle? Can't a company vouch for him should he be hired? Does a person not have a right to work without jumping through bureaucratic hoops? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

I‚Äôll start with some context: 
I‚Äôm a 2nd year student of programming in games and mobile apps. I have pretty good background when it comes to C#, now started a Java course at Uni. At the Uni I have lectured about Unity, Java and few hours of Adobe photoshop. I wanna be a game developer and have, let‚Äôs call it, connections that I can use to get myself a chance for an intern in a big AAA game company.
Only matter that concerns me is that, they work with their own engine and Unreal Engine. I‚Äôm not experienced in C++ (I mean I don‚Äôt have any practical experience but that‚Äôs what interns are for, am I right?) and surely don‚Äôt have any idea about their engine. 
My question here is, is there even a slight chance that this might work and I would get an intern? Does even big companies accept 2nd year students like that?

Clarification: my connections are not strong enough to get my a job without any interview, maybe there‚Äôs slight chance but I don‚Äôt want to rely on that."

But since i hated and dreaded putting the lawn mower in  and out of my truck  and I found something easier with more money I stopped it.

After that I started flipping couches and that has made me $100 in an hour before easy. It‚Äôs the closest thing to fast and easy money I think there is in the world. If you have a pickup truck I highly reccomend doing it on the side!

I‚Äôll tell you what if I ever get another part time job again I‚Äôll scope it out first and make sure it‚Äôs people my age that are like me that‚Äôs for fucking sure.

My old part time fast food jobs I hated so fucking much and I know unless I find a job with people my age where I can just fuck around and do almost nothing with no annoying old Karen supervisor I‚Äôll walk out that bitch on the first day. When I was 16 I worked two part time dishwasher jobs for 12 hours a day and I gotta say it was one of the stupidest decisions of my life. I would go to bed Friday night and wake up Saturday morning basically knowing I‚Äôd go through a dopamine detox for 2 days except maybe in the evenings because nothing about these jobs gave any dopamine, I couldn‚Äôt even play with my phone for a second out of an 8 hour shift without getting bitched at. These were hard ass jobs in the shitty side of town with not one friend my age just 50 year old welfare rejects that just got out of prison for dealing crack or some stupid shit. There were a few fights in front of the customers too because the people that worked there were just dumb uneducated trash, that‚Äôs what you get in a non college or non self employed job. NOBODY should have went through what I went through I was just a fucking dumbass and thought you had to work 1000 hours a week and basically go through painful shit to be successful. I‚Äôll tell you what if I ever get another part time job again I‚Äôll scope it out first and make sure it‚Äôs people my age that are like me that‚Äôs for fucking sure. 

But you know what doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore most of the time? School. I don‚Äôt dread it at all, there‚Äôs a lot of dopamine involved in being around everyone your age and the work serves a purpose, it contributes to my future and I really like learning stuff like Biology. There‚Äôs tons of fuck around time too like a 4 hour lecture in something like Med school sounds tough until you get like 2 20 minute breaks you‚Äôre in a flow state the rest of the time learning and you‚Äôre around a bunch of cool smart prestigious people. Alright enough ranting.

Tl;dr: The worst part of college is much better than the best part of all my experience in part time labor work, including my own businesses. I‚Äôm not gonna do shit if it feels like that much of a chore. So fuck it, I‚Äôm calling up Sallie Mae and taking out $30K a year in private student loans to pay for my living unless I can find some bullshit fuck around party job or an actual cool prestigious fulfilling part time job like tutoring or a medical internship or something. I wrote this out to rationalize my decision and honestly I think I won‚Äôt regret it at all and I‚Äôll have lots of debt since I wanna go into the medical field anyway so fuck it."

xz9zlf,5,2022-10-08,[Poly] CSIT Diploma scholarship or uni programme?,questions2093830,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/xz9zlf/poly_csit_diploma_scholarship_or_uni_programme/,"Hello, im a year 1 in SP DCPE (computer engineering) who has just gotten an invitation to apply for the CSIT Diploma Scholarship. I currently hold a gpa of &gt;3.9 (top 10%), and have been going for quite a few external events like hackathons, although my O level results werent too stellar for my course (cut off 12, nett score 12). I do not have much background in computing, but quite alot in science and tech in secondary school (went for olympiads, inter-school competitions, many many workshops).

I literally had no idea what the CSIT diploma scholarship is, I didnt even know what CSIT was, and I only realised what they were when I searched them up like 2 days ago. So far It seems pretty interesting, and I wouldnt mind trying to apply for the scholarship (not saying i will get the scholarship).

However, for DCPE (or just EEE in general), they have a SP-NUS collaboration / SP-SUTD pathway programme, which are programmes where instead of taking an internship in y3s2, you get to take Uni modules instead. I am pretty interested in the uni programmes as I wish to go to uni to do a computing course, and these uni programmes allow me to get a headstart in those courses in uni. I remember hearing from a few seniors that those with cgpa 3.8 and up were getting offers to join the uni programmes (not sure if they have any external contributing factors), and if I can continue with my sem 1 gpa of 3.9, I have a high chance of getting an offer to join the programme. This was what I was aiming for when entering DCPE.

For internships, I have been hearing countless of horror stories of how people had terrible experiences doing internships e.g. doing OT and committing extra effort and still getting a B, applying for a bunch but recieving no offers etc., which has painted a bad image of doing internships for me. 

The CSIT Scholarship comes with an internship at CSIT in y3s2, $2.5k per year, laptop allowance and covered tuition fees. However, I am not too sure about taking an internship if I do get in.

The uni programmes come with uni mods in y3s2, and potentially an easier time in Uni. It was also my original goal. (no money tho :/ )

I couldnt find much about the SP-NUS and SP-SUTD programmes at all, and also I would like to know more about the CSIT diploma scholarship, thus I would like to ask those who are in/ know people in any of the programmes:


SP uni collab/pathway programmes:

1) How different are the SUTD and NUS programmes? (in terms of what kind of mods are given)

2) Does is depend on gpa for renewal every year? (or is there no renewal?)

3) Are the mods manageable? (does ur gpa tank because of them?)

4) What do those in the programme do between y2s1 and before y3s2?

5) How beneficial is it taking uni mods in poly as opposed to taking the uni mods themselves in uni?


CSIT Diploma Scholarship:

1) Do they focus more on O level results, gpa or holistics? (or a blend of all 3?)

2) How are the CSIT internships in terms of fairness and general experience?

3) Are the internships more research or development sided? (or both?)

4) How strict are they for scholarship renewals? (maintaining gpa, cca records etc.)

5) Are there any other benefits other than money and internship?


sorry if i might be getting too ahead of myself as just a y1s1
also sorry for the terrible formatting"
xza4i0,3,2022-10-08,Should I accept a hardware dev engineering internship at Amazon?,LEVVUCD,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/xza4i0/should_i_accept_a_hardware_dev_engineering/,"Hello I recently got an offer from amazon for a hardware dev engineering internship. I was wondering if any other electrical engineering students have worked at amazon. How was the experience? Will I learn a lot about hardware and gain skills I can take elsewhere?

There are a few things that kind of turn me off to it. But I think I might just be worried for no reason. The internship is a salaried at \~10-8K a month. This makes me think that I wont have set hours and will be putting in over 8 hours a day frequently. Is this true at all or am I being paranoid? The person who interviewed me was obviously a more senior position than an intern but he said that he works 10+ hours a day on average and has put in up to 15 hours a day before.

I'm not against working long hours I'm just worried it will be borderline exploitative if they are paying me this much and their expectations will be very high. It's very hard to turn down since the money is so much more than my current internship pays, but I'm worried it will be an awful experience. 

There's so many other places I want to apply for and am waiting to hear back from too. I wont get a chance to see what other companies will offer me since amazon are making me decide in less than 2 weeks. I know no where else will pay me as much but I'm not sure I care if the experience will suck.

Any advice in general? should I take this question to another subreddit?"

\- 3.8 GPA, but only a 3.5 in Math + CS

\- 1 software internship sophomore year summer

\- Zero research experience

I don't want to try to get a Master's at a top program if it's not a reasonable goal considering the fact that I have absolutely 0 experience in research. I have ways that I can get research experience; for example, I'm a TA for an AI class at my school currently which is helpful because I'm getting a bit closer to the professor, and the applications for next summer research opportunities are open, so I could receive a research opportunity that way.

I have done a lot of research (about skills you need have, how the job is like and etc), participated in some workshops and competitions and done a lot of classes about programming - cyber security - antennas/telecommunications - electronics  plus I did an internship in a power transmission company this summer. 
Although, I like learning general stuff about each field, I can't find a specific field where I'm motivated to dive deeper into it, so I end up giving up easily, procrastinating, playing video games and passing classes with minimum effort. I don't enjoy things i really used to and my anxiety is always high af. Studying and completing tasks doesn't feel fulfilling and I feel stuck all the time.

xzk97m,1,2022-10-09,I could get some advice on jobs for my current situation,chikamj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xzk97m/i_could_get_some_advice_on_jobs_for_my_current/,"I find it hard to find a job in my country(Italy) where I get paid what's right, I'd like to move somewhere else but I'm inexperienced in these kind of things and I really want to find a way not to being burnt out

20M. I have an unfortunate past, 'cause I've always lived with my mom struggling to arrive at the end of the month. Due to reasons I had to quit twice my last year of highschool (not because of me not wanting to study but because discrimination and bullying and from stress from my own life).

 I was studying company information systems 5-6 years and i really enjoyed the course, but couldn't find another school nearby that could help me finish my study there. If I had finished and had the opportunity I would have gone to university most likely.

But I had to find a job.
And I worked in a pharmacy as internship full time (doing also extra time), and only reaching enough to get by to the end of the month, I got a contract later on but they changed what I had to without giving me a proper explanation of my role and yelling at me on every mistake I did, which of course led me to being burnt out and leaving. 

When I first started my role was being basically a secretary, spreading information about covid, register and checking results of covid tests, informing customers and selling the services. But I also started doing edits for Instagram and Facebook, posters that improved the awareness and sales of the pharmacy, I'm not an expert in graphics or anything, I just wanted to help out as much as I could on my first job. 

When the Russian attacked Ukraine, I suggested that we'd make a collection point for medicines, bandages and similar needs and mostly handled it on my own.

After I left I found a job as a night porter(Idk if it's the right translation?).

I have done training from the end of July to August to learn most of the aspects of this job and would start working on September.
What's required for this job is to work 9 days in a row, once or twice in a month depending on the three porters rotation.

The first two days would be a Saturday and a Sunday afternoon from 12pm/2pm to 7pm here I don't do much and I don't have any complaints about this.
While the 7 next days of work are at night from 6:30pm to 5:50am (on contract it's from 7pm to 23pm from 4am)
The contract would also say that I would get paid a remuneration for those 5 hours of that time just for being available, but if there was the need in those hours I SHOULD be paid as the standard night hours. 

The issue is that I'm always working during those hours since I'm required to be cooking the breakfast for the guests, paperwork doesn't usually ends before 1 am and I have to accept new guests during all the time I'm there, so I don't really have any time to relax, if the place is close empty at best id get 1h of those 5h free. But this place is really often full.

When I signed the contract I didn't expect he wouldn't count me those hours because it's obvious I'd be working at those hours.
But when the salary came I saw only the remuneration that would be close 1/4 of the actual pay for those hours (so I got paid 108h (without counting night service) + 14days remuneration x10‚Ç¨ instead of 178 hours, which would be about a 300‚Ç¨+ difference).

I talked to the owner being honest with him and told him that I would like to quit if stuff would keep going like this, since he expects stuff from me to be ready and perfect(otherwise I often get yelled at or abused verbally) but I expect to be paid for the job I do. 

He told me he won't change policy and after this week that I'll be working I'll quit by talking to the worker unions.

-------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah I'd like to find a honest job but I need some tips from seniors. My English is decent and I talk Italian. I wouldn't mind part time jobs or full time as long it's within my capabilities. I'm even up to learn something new.

Sorry for the long text and hope I wasn't too boring."

Ca »ôi background, pe l√¢ngƒÉ disciplinƒÉ »ôi alte chestii specifice, din liceul militar am √ÆnvƒÉ»õat C++, HTML, CSS »ôi speedtyping.

xzryrl,0,2022-10-09,Should I fire this guy ?,venkarafa,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/xzryrl/should_i_fire_this_guy/,"I run a small startup and just recently hired 4 full time employees. In addition we also have an internship program where we try to pick diligent and smart college students, train them and see if they would be good fit with us in future for a FTE. The interns do get paid a stipend. 

1 of our employee from the 4 FTE is actually an intern who impressed us with his work and also found our work culture likeable. We are fully remote company by the way. Impressed with his work, at the end of his internship we offered a full time employment. 

However, he refused our offer. 6 months down the line, he himself called us and expressed his interest to join us again. 

We hired this guy as we found hiring was getting difficult for us as a startup and paid him slightly above market salary keeping in view his potential. First few months he worked fine. However, in the past few months his behavior has taken a turn for the worse.

I as a co-founder, of late have given him multiple tasks with a deadline (since it is a client given deadline in return). However, he flat out refused to work !!

On one occasion, he had some family function for which he took 2 days leave (Mon- Tuesday). Every Friday, we have catch up call with the client to show our progress reports (codes, ppts etc).  On Thursday, when it was time to review the report internally, this guy says he was not able to manage time properly the whole week due to the family function and hence won't be able to present to the client.

I mean isn't this total lack of responsibility ?  I had a loss of face with the client for lack of output that week. 

In an other instance, this same employee could not get the task done by 5pm Friday. We had a presentation the next Monday. We requested him to put in extra hours and finish the work. However he again cited some frivolous reasons like 'gotta flight to catch' and hence can't work late in evening. The other FTE working on the same project with identical scope of work finished the work in stipulated time.

In an other instance, we had a similar situation. He simply struggled with a basic excel report. Upon confronting him on his failure to deliver, he said his skills were a little rusty . I mean as a employer I am not paying some guy to tell me 'his skills are rusty'. Isn't it his responsibility to keep current with his skillset?

Right now, more than his inefficiency, it is his total insubordination and outright on the face refusal to work and complete the tasks that is big worry for me. 

His attitude may have a bad effect on fellow employees too. Already his bad throughput has affected us. As a growing company I don't want to get distracted by this one employee.

Also, I don't want to be seen as an easy boss who tolerates this backtalk and frivolous excuses. 

It has been 6 months since we hired full time and already the experience has been rocky. 

My opinion is that inefficiency and lack of skill can be improved. But the attitude of 'no respect', 'no responsibility' &amp; 'insubordination' can't be improved.

As a startup founder, this would be my first firing (If I got with it). I thought I would be careful in hiring so that I would not have to face this tough situation so early on. But I guess I can't predict how people change or perhaps I failed to read the red flags early on. 

I am also questioning our fully remote setup. Perhaps it is not a good idea to let freshers work remotely fully. I feel I am not able to establish the chain of command or discipline due to this remote set up. Anyhow that is a question I would like to ponder later.

My more current pressing question is:

Should I fire him ? or  Should I give him a longer rope ? (I already gave him 3 separate warnings)."

I would greatly appreciate some help in ranking colleges. I am applying to questbridge which gives low-income families a 100% need met scholarship, but if a college decides to match you it is binding.

  
Here are the colleges that offers accredidated/renowned programs from Questbridge that I am currently looking into:

\- USC

\- Rice

&amp;#x200B;

My goals:

* Attend Grad School in the near future, my dream program is GSAPP.
* Able to do hand-on studio works as much as possible, being able to experiment, fail, repeat, given independence.
* On the cutting edge of architecture field. Go to a place with passionate forward thinkers in architecture.

  
Rice:

* Pros:
   * 1 year internship to renowned architectural offices (researched and i love the offices's works)
   * in city
   * constantly ranked higher than USC for undergrad in Design Intelligence
   * Academically Intensive
   * well-rounded, middle of the road approach to architecture
   * very safe neighborhood
   * no state-income tax, cheap to live in (i come from low-income afterall)
   * Prestige, it is Rice, after all.
* Cons:
   * in houston (urban lab. may not be well-developed as LA)
   * **student thesis work is so uninteresting to me, in comparision to USC and Yale... Yes, their presentation and style is impeccable, but feels so familiar to each other that I question the value they place on creating independent thinkers, rather than big company-approved architects.**
   * falculty undiversed, little to no Asian representation (I am a Chinese Female).
   * wonder if the 1 year internship is all that glorious at all? USC offers internship oppurtunities every summer? So does other schools? 
   * long... 6 years in total including the perceptionship. I am looking into taking grad school anyways, so this is kind of not worth it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

USC:

* Pros:
   * Study Overboard oppurtunities better than Rice, for me personally, due to the fact they have sectors in Chinese offices (invaluable to me because I can speak Mandarin like a native)
   * LA Labortory... and the entire state of Cali... come on now.
      * I love Sci Arc's work so it would be nice to go and see their open houses, even though I have no prospects of attending Sci Arc.
      * firms such as gensler, and first office.
   * Undergrad program director is led by a Asian Female, and its undergrad falculty is filled with diversity, not to mention it takes an emphasis on Sustainability and Green Buildings, which I would like to specialized in the future.
   * Student work is incredible and mind-bending, revolutionary. Each is given a lot of independence in their thesis, it seems like. I believe I would enjoy this type of independence.
   * Trojan Network? Is it a real thing lol.
   * Diverse Body of students (23.5% Asian), I would be very happy if I can connect with people like me who is bilingual and share similiar interests! - student life seems more interesting?
   * Overboard opportunities in Summer... but can i afford it lol that's a problem.
* Cons:
   * Expenses - i heard that they don't cover for student's building fees, and living is LA is probably gonna be wayy expensive than houston (second cheapest town to live in).
   * The neighborhood is not that good compared to Rice.
   * Ranking/Prestige is lower than Rice.
   * Fear that the academic intensity will not be as much as Rice. Fear the cirliculum will not be as well fleshed, well-rounded out as Rice. 
   * Overboard opportunities in Summer... but can i afford it lol that's a problem.

  
Currently I am leaning towards USC... but the fear is that USC may not have as a good coursework cirriculum as Rice... since it is not ranked as highly on Design Intelligence, while Rice is consistently up there. Also the fear that it is expensive, even with a 100% needs-met scholarship. However. I believe that I will enjoy life in USC more, and it is a better fit for my character and passions. Anything else I should take into account on top of the list above?

Thank you so much!!!"

I've known this since I was 14 years old, and here I am now, at 21 years old, still trapped inside of the closet. My family is transphobic, and since I am financially dependent on them right now, I can't come out to them. I am unable to come out to anyone in my life without rejection. I cannot be my true authentic self, and as such, live in a constant state of stress, anxiety, depression, disassociation, and escapism. My only coping mechanism is self-harm. I can't recognize myself in mirrors. I constantly consume media and do meaningless, pointless hobbies to try and escape from the fact I'm living in a body that's not my own. I am a ticking time bomb that will destroy my family when I come out to them. Being stuck in the closet like this, and for 7 years, like I have, seriously fucks you up beyond repair. I feel like a stranger to myself now, a shell of who I used to be and could have been. I lost ""the best years of my life"" to being in the closet. I missed out on so many formative experiences because of my stupid fucking body and brain. My high school and college years have been lost. I can't date, can't be known as a man by my peers, can't wear a suit to prom, can't graduate under the correct name, can't have sex comfortably, and so many other things. And sure, when I got to college, I was granted a little more freedom; I was able to buy a binder and cut my hair, but it doesn't do shit. My family argues with me constantly about how I don't like to wear dresses and have long hair and shit, and it is so exhausting. I'm still too scared to come out to my school friends here. And of course, there's the usual gender dysphoria and transphobia that I have to deal with. I fucking despise my body. Even if I'm able to come out, I'm never going to pass as a man: I'm under five feet tall, and have a super feminine looking face/body. I hate my curves, I hate my height and nose and face and hands and everything else. It is going to be so hard for me to find a partner, or a job, or be accepted in society if I come out. Sometimes I sit in bed awake at night and think ""why the fuck did I have to go through this? why did this have to be me?"" I can't take this fucking suffering anymore. 

I'm also a college student, and going through insane amounts of stress in school. I have so many projects and assignments, and cannot focus for the life of me. I'm an art/design student, so I have a crazy amount of projects and work that is expected to get done in a very short amount of time. I go to a top school that expects a lot of their students, so they give us a lot of stuff to do, and put a ton of extra pressure on us.  I've been sitting in front of my computer for hours today, and I still feel like I got nothing done. Every single class expects us to put several hours every day into their projects, but I have seven classes and not enough time in the fucking day. Sometimes I can't even focus, no matter what I do. I have done pretty much everything I could think of to get myself to focus better on projects, but every single time it's the same thing: spend 3 hours motivating myself to get up out of bed, stop procrastinating, and actually sit down to get work done; actually work for 45 minutes or so; get distracted by something and then lose all motivation; and the cycle repeats. It's Sunday night, and I currently have 7 projects that are due next week, most of them I haven't even started. There's no one to blame but myself. I'm such a fucking failure that I can't even get anything done. Since I'm a senior, they also expect us to find an internship, and then juggle that on top of all of our schoolwork next semester. And everyone else in my major seems to be fine. They don't seem to struggle at all, and they all have work and internships already as well. Their projects always look so much better than mine, and I always feel like the weakest link in all my classes. I try to make friends with them, and they're nice back, but they obviously have no desire to want to be friends with me and so I am always lonely in class. I try to talk to people every day, and feel like I get nowhere. If you bring up how stressed you're feeling to any of the professors, they mock you and make you feel weak for even thinking like that. And if I'm struggling like this in my classes, I obviously won't be able to make it in the ""real world"" once I graduate. I feel like I'm drowning.

This world, and everyone in it, is an absolute asshole. People are so mean to each other now, on social media and real life. The world is just filled with terrible people and terrible things. I just don't get it. My school has an anonymous confessions page and people are so fucking rude to each other. They'll call out people, and tell them to die, or that they hate them, and all of this horrible shit. And when I call it out, or say something, I'm the one who gets called weak, or they'll say I just ""don't get gen z humor."" Well, I'm sorry for not thinking that it's funny when you tell people to kill themselves. I don't get how everyone can act like that to each other. Why should I bother trying to live in this world when it's like this? When people think it's okay to hurt others? And ever since COVID, and seeing how global warming, or even a nuclear war, is going to destroy our planet, I just don't see a point in continuing to bide my time here. The world is just a horrible place. 

So, that's it. I've been hanging on for such a long time, because so many people will say ""it gets better!"", but it's obvious that that is a total lie. I've been suffering like this since middle school, hoping that something will change, that one day I'll get to be comfortable and happy, and it's obvious that it will never fucking happen. I have a couple of people I'm close to in my life who I know will be sad when I go (even though they call people who hate themselves selfish. I don't think I'm selfish for suffering and wanting to end this pain, but whatever.) I'm getting worse every day, and this is the closest I've gotten to ending it. I'm finally starting to think up an actual plan. Luckily, I'm really good at keeping up appearances, so everyone thinks I'm fine. I've gotten good grades in school up till this point, I leave the house at least once a day, I see people, I workout, I laugh and joke around with my friends, etc. No one is able to detect it. And honestly, no one would be able to stop me anyways. My school counselor is so shit, they only give you one appointment with them because they can't even pretend to care. And if I tell anyone about this, they'll just lock me up anyways. I am so fucking tired of living and suffering. I can't wait for this to be over."

Major: BS in Computer Engineering

Concentration: Machine Learning

University: University of North Carolina

GPA: 3.63 / 4.0

Future Degree: Computer Science Master's w/o thesis

GRE: Not Taking It

Projects:

* Autonomous Driving Vehicle in 3D Virtual Environment (GTA V)
* American Sign Language Real-Time Translator with Zoom
* Multi-Sensor Data Fusion for Traffic Analysis

Experience:

* AMD: Silicon Design Engineer Intern
* TIAA: Robotics Automation Engineer Intern
* UNCC: ML Research Assistance

&amp;#x200B;

I was originally not planning on going for a master's degree, I wanted to jump straight into the work force. ML jobs especially as a bachelors are hard to come across but I thought I could do it, although with the looming recession and my graduation in May I am not so sure the job market would be kind to me. So I decided to also apply for a Master's in case a job I am interested in doesn't come up. I was planning on going back to school after paying off my debt but now with my student debt wiped (Pell Grant Recipient) seems like a good opportunity. 

I am not taking the GRE as the student debt relief was enacted not too long ago, so this decision to apply for grad school kind of comes out of no-where I do not have enough time to study and take the GRE for grad school Fall 23.

I know my GPA isn't exactly super competitive for computer Science programs especially for IV league schools, MIT, Duke, etc. But I do have lots of experience and am fairly friendly with multiple Professors so I am sure I could get good recommendations. I am wondering exactly what my schools could be for reach, not reach, backups. I am the first person in my family to actually go to college so I am very new on the process don't have a lot of guidance. The main school I was thinking about apply to was UT Austin I am not sure if that is a reach or not however.

Any advice is welcomed! Thank you in advanced"

As the SEP application for CDE students has just opened, I was keen to apply for it with my friends. However, I learned that IDP had two 1 year long modules (one of which can be mapped to my FYP), one of which do not allow me to take both my 6 months of Industrial Attachment and SEP in the same year since I will be starting one of them next semester, and need to carry it to Y3S2. Essentially, I would have to stay 1 sem in NUS in year 3 semester 1 to complete the second half of the year long module.

I now have two options:
- I would need to secure two vacation internships in y2 and y3 summer to map to CFG2101 NUS Vacation Internship Programme (4 MCs) and EG3612 Vacation Industrial Attachment (6 MCs) each. I would still do my 5th sem as per normal and only go on SEP in Y3S2. Alternatively, I would have to do EG2605 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (4 MCs) in place of the 4MC vacation internship. I am unsure about this as it may be difficult to secure two internships consecutively to fulfill the requirements, which may cause me to run the risk of delaying my graduation.

- Alternatively, I can give SEP a pass, proceed with year 3 semester 1 in NUS, then apply for NOC in Y3S2 to complete my IA requirement. I find this a bit difficult as NOC is said to be very competitive, with people who have experience in entrepreneurship having an edge over others. I fear that if I cannot get into NOC, I would not have an overseas exchange experience during my university study.

Would one 6 months internship be more valuable than two 3-months internships to fill up the IA requirement? Would NOC be difficult to get in? IS NOC more valuable than SEP, or vice versa? I would appreciate some advice for this issue, and thanks in advance!

I see some of my IDP peers facing the same issue. They either forego the second major, sometimes dropping to a minor or dropping it entirely, or give up on SEP entirely and banking everything on NOC. Any idea what I should do?"

y0908m,2,2022-10-10,How do I ask for a salary raise or find a better job with a very low self esteem and confidence?,Kimwai,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y0908m/how_do_i_ask_for_a_salary_raise_or_find_a_better/,"I took a part time internship earlier this year because I was feeling insecure about my skill set and previous experience. Next week my contract is up and I've been told that I will be offered a full time position with the company. According to others who've been hired on full-time, the pay is the same, but I'll get paid for full-time despite the hours I work.

I work for a small company still in the startup phase and they don't have a lot of money. The problem is, technically I know I should be making at least double what I make now considering my experience and degree.

I plan to ask for a raise during my performance review when they offer me full time, but I don't know how much to ask for. I'd like to make what I should be making, but there is no way they can afford to pay me that much.

I'm at a loss for what to do. I don't know how much is too much to ask for a raise. I know I could make more going somewhere else, but I still don't feel confident enough trying to find another job.

Any advice on how I can ask for a raise or find another job even when my confidence is low?"

2- What are my chances of getting into IB as of now, with a 2:1 in my second year and predicted 1st in my last.

y0dy66,4,2022-10-10,CompTIA A+ Certified at age 17,AlexanderVatatzes,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/y0dy66/comptia_a_certified_at_age_17/,"Exactly as the title says, was certified four days ago. For a little context, the high school that I went to had a Computer Technology class where we first did Cisco Packet Tracer stuff before we eventually moved on to studying and preparing to take the CompTIA A+ exams. At first, I didn't care much for all this, I simply saw it as the work I had to do to pass the class. However, I gave it more thought and realized the value of having an accredited certification that could help provide me with a stable career. It helped that I seemed to be naturally good at the work, too, so I started to apply myself more and take it seriously. Fastforward to a few weeks before graduation. We were given a voucher for the Core 1 (1001) exam, if we passed the exam we would be given access to the voucher for the Core 2 (1002) exam. I chose to take the exam at home because all the testing centers were quite far away from me. I ended up taking it on the worse day I could've possibly taken it; simply put it was quite noisy and made it difficult for me to concentrate, I ended up failing by 639.

I wasn't just going to give up after that, though. Four months go by since then and I'm in college and have saved up enough money to purchase a voucher for myself. I made sure to have taken the exam in a quieter environment and to relief passed the exam with a 709. At this point, I thought back to my teacher and the vouchers that he gave us. I wondered if he would be able to provide me with a voucher, so I phoned him up. To my surprise, not only did he answered but he agreed to see if he could provide me one and told me to email him as a reminder. I did so. A day goes by without a response, so I email him again. Two days go by without a response, too. I tried calling him up again and that goes without a response. At this point, I'm starting to get flustered. So I did what I had to do, and I kinda, sorta, trespassed into my old high school to talk to him directly. We talked for a few minutes, and I eventually got the voucher. I study a week before the scheduled day, and I passed core 2 with a 737.

I think I would attribute a majority of my success to Jason Dion's udemy practice exams. Those were really helpful, I took the exams, read the explanations for the questions I got wrong, and then took the exams again until I got a 90% or higher on all of them. It feels really good to be certified now, though I'm not sure what to do from here. Been trying to apply for a bunch of remote IT intern positions and the like. Thoughts?"

Subject: [Reconsidering my position in XYZ]


Hello Mam,

I hope you‚Äôre in good health.

I‚Äôve always been enthusiast to work with you in XYZ since the central theme of the project inclines with not only my goals but with my inner values that to build capacity in people is better than making them depending on others.

Contrary to my predecessors, I willingly decided to go on a voluntary position, because paid or unpaid, it made no difference to me. However my this visit to home after nearly a year, made me realize how the financials of the family has got so much delicate that I‚Äôll have to take on a part time job to contribute to my basic living and educational expenditures, as you know, given the high cost of living in the city. However, it would be extremely difficult for me to handle a second employment considering my college schedules and xyz commitments.


I have complete faith that, in addition to taking my circumstances into account, you'll place your confidence in my skills, recognize my desire to help others and learn, and reevaluate my position in XYZ as a paid intern.

Looking forward to your response."

I am majoring in Electrical Engineering, but my interest lies in data science (also, I am willing to do a minor in Statistics and Data Science). I have started learning on my own, but I cannot dive into Data Science properly.

I started learning Python and then directly moved to learn the libraries NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib and then after going through just the basics, I moved to Machine Learning. Then later I got to know about ""data preparation"" so i started learning Data Scraping through API/Web Crawling and Scraping. I have tried taking structured courses too, but all of them seem different, and none of them works.

But like after trying my hands on a lot of things, I feel that I have made no progress at all. I do not know anything about how it is done. Our college offers Internship drives at big Companies like Microsoft, Optiver, and Google and I want to prepare myself fully for the Data Scientist role by the end of July next year. Please tell me what I should do, and please guide me. I'll be grateful honestly.

So far I ended up with 2 live coding interviews. did poorly on one and got rejected. Felt that I did really well on the other one, interviewer said I did great, and I just got the rejection today. its already almost mid october and I have nothing, not even in the middle of any processes right now.

I'm 19 in my undergrad doing computer science and business systems (doesn't have much to do with business courses). So I'm aiming to pursue my bachelor's and then go on to pursue a master's degree in CS. So, i wanted to do internship to get to know more about how things are done professionally. I was asked an important question that which domain i want an internship in. Basically in my ug classes i haven't had much of specialisation in any of Ai, Data science, Machine learning etc. I'm good with DSA, OOP in languages C and Java (not the best but i really love learning these topics deeper). I basically love solving problems using a machine. I just think it's almost magical how a computer is built, how circuits say 0/1, how OS controls things around, how compiler converts HLL to machine language, just magical how i get an output for a complex input that if i had done on paper would take me weeks to figure out. I just want to understand which domain should i get into because I don't really know about what I should be doing but I know i loving doing it. 
P.s A friend of mine suggested SDE, but my dad said it's too generalised and asked me zero it down to a narrower domain. Like? SaaS? 
Also, if any of you watched Silicon Valley, i want to be like them one. Be someone who changes the world (or atleast get a chance to be a part of it)."

y0jvf2,781,2022-10-10,Just bombed a interviw for QA engineer and I‚Äôm so embarrassed,jana_50n,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y0jvf2/just_bombed_a_interviw_for_qa_engineer_and_im_so/,"This morning I had my first round interviw for a quality assurance position. It was a video call with four software developers, and they asked me to share my screen and do simple problems in Java and Python. I never touched Java in my life or had it on my resume, and I‚Äôm not very skilled in Python. These languages were also not listed on the job description. 

First they had me reverse a string in Java, and I tried but I ended up not being able to. Then they had me to reverse a string in Python, then moving on to a harder DS question that I couldn‚Äôt solve. 

They didn‚Äôt ask me any questions about quality assurance, told me there was no point to continue and to study more common interview questions. They tried to lighten the mood by laughing but it just made me more nervous. 

I‚Äôve previously been employed as a web development intern and graduated with a bachelors in computer information systems two months ago. I‚Äôm mad at myself for not studying harder and feel so hopeless. 

Does anyone have any interview studying tips for an aspiring qa professional?"

My goal for college is get good at coding and a specific area of CS. Not sure what it is yet - i like Data science, AI, cyber security, and j regular software development- so maybe a campus that will allow me to focus on one area after learning all cs fields in first year. I also want to get internships throughout college to help pay fees.

Any suggestions from juniors, seniors, or graduates (last 4 years) of UofT on which campus is the best and can get me to my goal?"

y0kqvi,1,2022-10-10,First career dilemma out of university (computer engineering) - some advice?,MnMWiz,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y0kqvi/first_career_dilemma_out_of_university_computer/,"Hello, I'm looking for advice regarding my situation. Some context:

* I'm midway through my second to last semester as a Computer Engineer with a focus on software.
* I have a few projects and internships on my resume, and a 3.8+ GPA.
* I recently got an offer for a fulltime rotation program at Texas Instruments, just squeaking past a 6 figure salary.
* I have read that the TI campus is a good environment and the location is in a good city with what I can assume to be many likeminded people.

I feel like right now, I'm at a crossroads. I can either:

* Heavily relax for the rest of my college career and feel sound since I have a for sure offer.
* Start grinding leetcode/hackerrank/etc., algorithms/DS, a project maybe, and prepare myself to apply for big tech companies at the start of next year.

Friends of friends have allegedly gotten offers doing remote work for near 200k. Even a position that's 20-30k more than my current offer would be very significant (when considering compound interest on investments).

I don't want to feel like I twiddled my thumbs and wasted my time when I could have been securing double my salary, but I also understand that my current offer is pretty good.

Any comments or advice please?"
y0ksco,2,2022-10-10,A company keeps asking me for a phone screening but refuses to schedule something,LordElysian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y0ksco/a_company_keeps_asking_me_for_a_phone_screening/,"I applied to this job I thought I'd be a fantastic fit for in early September. They're working in a field I had an internship in, where the project I was working on during that internship directly involves some of the hardware this company is looking for experience with.

Later that month, a recruiter reached out to me to schedule a phone screening. Per her request, I sent her a few times that would work for me, along with a general time window.

She didn't respond to that email, and instead cold called me during one of the times I had listed in my email. Since I didn't hear back, I already had something else I was doing during that time and I couldn't pick up the call.

She sent me another email, asking to schedule something again. I responded that like, maybe there was a misunderstanding, but I was under the impression that she would reach back to confirm the time she wanted to call me. I told her another slate of times, and there was one that seemed to work for both of us.

She was supposed to call me 30 minutes ago, but I didn't get a call.

\_\_\_\_

Am I going crazy? Would you find it acceptable for a recruiter to not tell you what time they wanted to call from the times you shared, and then cold call you during that time? If I wanted to pursue this further, what would be my next steps?

To be honest, I was looking forward to the call because this would be my first interview for my current job search. Even if I didn't get an offer, I was really hoping to just get experience with interviewing again, especially since this would have been a really great fit I'd be able to speak at length to. But I'm not sure what's next."

y0oyxi,1,2022-10-10,How hard would it be to break in as a non-EU student in Europe?,browncr1tikal,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/y0oyxi/how_hard_would_it_be_to_break_in_as_a_noneu/,"Currently 18 joining a target school in Italy (Bocconi). I am from India with a B1 certificate in Italian, planning on pursuing a C2 by the time I end my bachelors. I am well versed in English, Hindi and am a B1 German speaker. My program is undecided but it would be either their BEMACS (Economics, Management and Computer Science) or BIEF (International Economics and Finance). 

Now I know no one knows what would happen in 3-4 years in Europe but since studying abroad coming from a middle class family in a low income country is a massive investment, I want to be aware of all possibilities especially the negative ones so that I can plan for alternatives in case of future uncertainties.

The European economy seems to be in trouble and a mild to rough recession is predicted by most economists. Jobs might be hard to come by and being a non EU citizen would certainly make things harder for me. My current plan is trying to break into European IB/MC specifically DACH/Benelux/Italian IB/MC or London IB/MC. I do have plans to continue my studies with masters but that would depend on the country/region I would fixate my target as by the end of my bachelors. Main colleges on my list are St Gallen,  Bocconi, Rotterdam and WHU as my European masters options and the usual UK targets (Oxbridge, LSE, UCL, Imperial, Warwick) because breaking in purely with bachelors as a non EU citizen in a possible recession would be borderline impossible. But even with a decent masters and assuming good grades (hopefully) in both my bachelors and masters, reputable internships, extracurriculars and local language proficiency, how hard would getting a job would be for a person with my citizenship?

I am a fairly ambitious guy with targets of working in the MBBs and the GS/MS/JPMs of the world but I need to have realistic view of my options and work accordingly.

I am also considering looking into the academia due to my interest in econ and my amateur research background or working in other quant/data science roles so I am open to any and all advices."

Also I‚Äôm going to sleep so likely won‚Äôt see anything until morning:

I‚Äôm 40 years old, and just graduated with my bachelor‚Äôs in computer science. While I didn‚Äôt go to a prestigious school, I did graduate with a 3.9 GPA. Now the downside: being a man‚Ä¶ of a certain age‚Ä¶ I work full time, have a wife and kid and have to continue working full time to support my family. As such, I can‚Äôt afford to take on any internships since once one ends, I‚Äôm left without a job‚Ä¶.

This leads me to my issue. I‚Äôve applied to many jobs and gotten a few calls/interviews, one after the other telling me the same thing: ‚ÄúNot enough experience‚Äù. I guess my question is two-fold. First: are there any jobs that are entry level but don‚Äôt still require 3+ years experience (in what world is that entry level???) and Second: how does one get the 3+ years experience without a job that would build experience? (And I‚Äôve seen listings even that specifically state internships don‚Äôt qualify as industry experience)"

UWaterloo, Carleton, UOttawa, UBC, UAlberta, McGill, Simon Fraser, and York University.

I know people say UWaterloo has the best coop. Carleton has a dev program and is also pretty affordable. I'm not very sure if UOttawa, UBC, UAlberta, McGill, Simon Fraser, and York University will be more theory based which will help get into a grad or more career prep with more coding.

What level of internship should I be shooting for and what kind of salary could I expect? I‚Äôm a second year student who did CS all throughout High School as well, so I probably have about 3 years of experience in Java and a bit less of that in python. Just wondering since I know this is a competitive field and I haven‚Äôt been able to get a straight answer online (I‚Äôve seen anywhere from 15/hour to 40/hour as the expected and just want to know what‚Äôs actually realistic for someone with my level of experience)."

I have been applying for IT internships all throughout my last 6 months in graduating. Not a single IT internship got back to me, or they all rejected me.

It's been several months since I graduated. I have applied to every single place I can think of. I KEEP getting rejected, and being told ""We are going to  go with someone with more experience than you have."" 

What grinds my gears further is **Why are you interviewing me in the first place and wasting my time when you are going to give the job to someone with more experience?**

So people in IT, **Tell me what am I supposed to do?** 

How am I supposed to find a job in IT and get job experience **when they will not give me an ENTRY-LEVEL job in the first place WITHOUT experience, and internships will not hire me either.**

Everyone kept pursuading me ""Oh, IT is such a good field to go in, once you finish your education and get a job, you'll be set"". Well if IT was so great, then how come I can't even land my first entry level job in IT after graduating?"

I'm currently looking for jobs post graduation and am finding it hard to pin-point what career path is right for me. I can't decide upon one specific role I'm looking for. I know I no longer want to be in general contracting because work becomes your entire life. I wouldn't be opposed to sticking with being a construction manager as a real estate developer, but I I'm looking for a more vibrant company culture.  I do not know what the magic number is that I should be looking for coming out of college as well ($80k, $90k, etc.) I have more experience than most if not all graduating  students so I want to make sure I do not get low-balled.  I know that I'm looking to remain within within real-estate or construction to some capacity.

I have a passion for innovation and solving problems. I love using MS excel and learning new skills (Power BI). I like the idea of being a solutions engineer working for a company like Procore that combines all of my experiences together. Does anyone have some career advice for senone coming out of college? Is it smart to avoid remote positions since you don't get to form relationships with team members and will likely be the first one out the door when times get tough?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help."

But I don't want to go, I""ve been feeling very lonely for the past 4 years, and because of COVID. Just started to enjoy college and make some good friends (just 2 tbh). If I leave, my friends prpbably will have graduated, and i'll come back to new people. What really scares me is not going to NZ, buy being lonely, I've never had a girlfriend, study away from home, and feel that as we grow, we become loneliner. I'm scared that if I leave for the internship, I'll probably stop seeing my current friends."

* I'm midway through my second to last semester as a Computer Engineer with a focus on software.
* I have a few projects and internships on my resume, and a 3.8+ GPA.
* I recently got an offer for a fulltime rotation program at Texas Instruments, just squeaking past a 6 figure salary.
* I have read that the TI Dallas campus is a good environment and the location is in a good city with what I can assume to be many likeminded people.

I feel like right now, I'm at a crossroads. I can either:

* Heavily relax for the rest of my college career and feel sound since I have a for sure offer.
* Start grinding leetcode/hackerrank/etc., algorithms/DS, another project maybe, and prepare myself to apply for big tech companies at the start of next year.

Friends of friends have allegedly gotten offers doing remote work for near 200k. Even a position that's 20-30k more than my current offer would be very significant (when considering compound interest on investments).

I don't want to feel like I twiddled my thumbs and wasted my time when I could have been securing double my salary, but I also understand that my current offer is pretty good.

Any comments or advice please?"
y0wbug,0,2022-10-10,I really want to finish school before August of 2023. Is my plan too fast/risky?,Dr_Garp,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/y0wbug/i_really_want_to_finish_school_before_august_of/,"So I (23m) have been going through a lot lately and really want to just finish school and get my life ‚Äústarted‚Äù.

I have 6 classes left, or 5 plus an internship requirement. I hope to take 2 winter classes and 3 spring classes to help me finish and the last thing I‚Äôll need to do is take the internship. As of right now I don‚Äôt really have the money to pay for the spring, it‚Äôs probably gonna be ~1400 and I was thinking of putting it on my credit card. That‚Äôll bring me up past 60% but I think it‚Äôll be worth it especially with the talk of student loan forgiveness.

My issue is I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm prepared to move past this point in my life yet. I don‚Äôt have any serious job prospects and even though I‚Äôd love to move back home to Massachusetts I really don‚Äôt think I should be near my family. I‚Äôm homesick but they‚Äôre so toxic and have no problem just taking and taking and taking. Last time I was home my older brother‚Äôs GF said she could set me up with a security job paying $20 an hour but I really want to be on my own. I want to move somewhere new and start over but idk how.

One of the reasons I‚Äôve been pushing myself to finish quickly is I don‚Äôt want to renew my rent. I‚Äôve lived here for 4 years, same waiter job too, and I feel stagnant. I think I need to kick myself out or start a serious plan because I‚Äôve been screwing my self over pretty badly. I‚Äôve fallen back into bad habits and depression and I think I just need more right now or Ill risk being in the same spot at 24.

Am I moving too fast? Should I plan better? Is the debt worth it? Do I have any real hope of moving forward with my life?"

yep. I really thought I was done with job hunting but didn't realize finishing my projects and

even doing stretch goals wasn't enough for a return offer.

Last month I started job hunting and applied to 100 + places,

 and I am getting resume rejected from most companies. 

Most companies that make enough money to sponsor international students are not hiring right now or the resume bar has gotten ridiculously high. At the moment, I'm even applying to places that pay $50,000 /yr and somehow can't even get interviews from them. 

I spent over $150,000 just to get a master's degree in the US, and I'm afraid I might have to go back to my home country, being jobless. 

I know everyone is going through this, but international students are in a deeper shit cause we will get kicked out if we are jobless for 3 months after graduation.

So for all the international friends out there, I really hope we can get a job soon."

y0ydck,109,2022-10-10,The CEIBS Diaries: Part 12 ‚Äì Epilogue,bigger_bamboo,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/y0ydck/the_ceibs_diaries_part_12_epilogue/,"I was considering whether or not to write an extra chapter, and there are a few more things I want to say. 

The CEIBS Diaries have been viewed a total of around 100,000 times. Us alumni have seen a big increase in the past few months of prospective students ‚Äì including those with offers from CEIBS ‚Äì asking whether the stories shared are true. Many have since decided not to apply to CEIBS and some even rejected offers that they had already accepted. You should all feel responsible for stopping these people from wasting their time and money at CEIBS, so thank you.

The public reaction from CEIBS was predictable: no acknowledgement of the posts, but a stark increase in marketing posts about how foreign students can find great jobs in China. Unsurprisingly, the majority of the foreign alumni interviewed and profiled are native Mandarin speakers born in China who later acquired a foreign passport. There has also been a big decline in MBA director Shameen Prashantham marketing his book about dancing gorillas on his personal and CEIBS's official social media pages. Coincidental or not, hopefully that means he'll devote more time to his day job.

The school‚Äôs reaction is trivial. The intention of The CEIBS Diaries wasn‚Äôt to get a reaction from the school because they don‚Äôt care about the opinions of students and alumni who have already paid their tuition fees. I wanted a reaction from prospective applicants and to firmly realign expectations of those entering the program. Today, Monday October 10, [the class of MBA 2024](https://www.ceibs.edu/media/news/mba/ceibs-mba2024-opening-ceremony) began their CEIBS journey, so I want to end with an open letter to its international students. 

Dear future fellow CEIBS alumni,

Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room: you‚Äôve made a huge mistake joining CEIBS. Perhaps you were na√Øve to not speak to any foreign alumni or, if you did, arrogant enough to think that your CEIBS experience would be better than the majority of those who came out of the other side scarred and bruised. Perhaps you read the CEIBS Diaries and dismissed them, just didn‚Äôt read them at all, or by the time I posted them it was already too late for you to apply elsewhere. Whatever, we all made the same mistake of choosing CEIBS for one of these reasons, but we all got through it in the end. As you‚Äôll soon be part of our wider CEIBS international alumni family, I want to give you some advice on how to make the most of what will likely be a disappointing MBA. 

**Welcome Week**

On day 1, you will go through all the formalities of the opening ceremony. It‚Äôs the only time you get to see everyone dressed smart. The drinks reception at the end of the day is the only thing worth doing. During the rest of the week, you‚Äôll find out which of the three sections you will be in during term 1, and which group of 5 you will be in. From then on, most events during the day are done within your section or group. 

Student politics also kicks off in this week. Teams for student body and student club leadership roles have likely already been privately formed, but they all need at least one token foreigner for diversity reasons, and you should definitely let yourself be exploited because, as I‚Äôll discuss later, student leadership roles are mostly used for the exchange semester bidding. 

A foreign alum will come to give a speech about how amazing the MBA experience is. It will probably be either an Indian man or a blonde white American man. The Indian man hangs around campus every year meeting the latest batch and inserts himself into all the social events. If you‚Äôve ever been to high school in the US, you‚Äôll have probably seen *that* guy who graduated a few years ago but still hangs out with the seniors. He‚Äôs the CEIBS version. The American man is a China apologist and was Vice President and then President of the student body. If you‚Äôre curious how he got promoted during the MBA, it‚Äôs because there was a major sex scandal at CEIBS that went viral in China a few years ago so the school forced the President to resign and the Vice President took his place. 

Someone from the careers team will give you an overview of the career service and how best to look for jobs during the MBA. It will probably be Alex ‚Äì the pro-Beijing Hong Konger from [Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/v0pp5z/the_ceibs_diaries_parts_68/) ‚Äì and within his hour-long talk that boasts about how successful they are at helping students find great post-MBA roles, the only thing worth taking note of is that he will state ultimately it is your job search and you alone are solely responsible. You can ignore everything else he says because it‚Äôs BS. Interestingly, one thing he doesn‚Äôt mention is that CEIBS is, or at the very least has been, blacklisted by some major MBA recruiters. Whether it‚Äôs bad behavior at interviews, persistent reneging on job offers or incompetence during internships, some firms explicitly refuse applications from CEIBS and have stopped campus recruiting. So if you have your heart set on a specific firm, you should ask Alex whether CEIBS has been blacklisted by them. He won‚Äôt publicly admit it, but his response, or lack thereof, will tell you everything you need to know. A quick scan of alumni companies will also help. 

Not much else happens in the first week. Everyone is excited about the start of term 1 the following week. 

**Choosing Classes**

Term 1 only has core classes, so you all have the same schedule. CEIBS mostly frontloads the quality full-time professors for term 1 in order to make you think that most classes are pretty good and the occasional bad professors are an anomaly. For example, you‚Äôll have Prof Emily, Prof Bala, Prof Park, a few sessions with Prof Sebastian and some with Prof Byron, all of whom are probably the best full-time professors in the whole MBA. But on the other hand, you will have Prof Michelle and Prof Kristina. For context, Prof Michelle has her head firmly up her own ass, and Prof Kristina is unique and I don‚Äôt mean that in any positive way. Maybe if you go to their classes with low expectations, you‚Äôll have a better experience. 

Beyond term 1, the quality of classes generally gets worse. There are some good professors, but they become the anomaly. By term 3, you mostly get to choose your own classes, so here are some general pieces of advice:

* By in large, the visiting professors are much better than the full-time professors, so prioritize their classes. Even if it‚Äôs a subject you‚Äôre not interested it, you‚Äôll at least get to experience what a proper MBA class should feel like. 
* Some classmates will finish all their credits by the end of term 4 (just before the summer internship starts), and most will have finished by the end of term 5 (August). The classes in terms 5-7 are generally better than terms 3-4, so don‚Äôt frontload credits for the sake of it.
* Also, if you‚Äôre doing an exchange semester, don‚Äôt waste your time doing CEIBS electives in terms 3 and 4 because you can earn the credits on exchange in better classes. 

**Guest Speakers**

Most of the alumni and special guests brought to a class to talk to current students tend to be from small unknown companies. I mostly learned nothing from the ones I attended, and not just because their English level was barely coherent. However, a regular guest lecturer is an alum who works at a facial recognition AI company. The technology is impressive, but he casually mentions that it can automatically recognize ‚Äúpeople from certain groups‚Äù. It later transpired the company has been linked with China‚Äôs genocide against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. It‚Äôs ethically and morally wrong to say this, but don‚Äôt complain to the school or make noise about it. The school is part-owned and fully controlled by the Chinese government. It‚Äôs a fight you won‚Äôt win in China. 

The guest speakers in classes run by visiting professors are much better, as they‚Äôre often alumni from the professor‚Äôs home school (Darden, Oxford etc.). 

**Group Assignments**

As an international student, you‚Äôll be given the role of [spellchecker](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/uzebs8/the_ceibs_diaries_parts_15/) in many assignments. That‚Äôs not all bad because you often get the final review of the content before submitting. This is important because copying directly from textbooks and other groups is common within groups. While you likely won‚Äôt fail a class for blatant plagiarism, it‚Äôs probably not a risk that you‚Äôre comfortable with taking. Before every assignment is submitted, I would strongly suggest you rewrite it in your own words because you should always assume that some of the content is plagiarized and has been plagiarized by other groups. 

**Increasing Your GPA**

When students get a low grade in an assignment that isn‚Äôt a multiple choice exam, they tend to lobby the professor to bump their score up. You don‚Äôt need a good reason for it, just say that you are trying to maintain your 3.8 GPA to get a job at McKinsey and ask if they professor can increase your grade from a B to a B+. The professor will often acquiesce. As everyone else does it, you should too. 

**Exchange School**

You should definitely do an exchange semester. Not only is the list of exchange schools impressive, but most internationals find they get far more job support from their exchange school than from CEIBS. Also, applying for jobs with your exchange school‚Äôs email address will increase the chances of an interview because some roles at big firms automatically reject applicants with a CEIBS email address. One consideration is that, due to China's unwillingness to relax Covid restrictions, you likely won‚Äôt be allowed back into China once you go to your exchange school, so don‚Äôt make plans to return to China after the exchange semester ends or for graduation. 

As I mentioned in [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/uzebs8/the_ceibs_diaries_parts_15/), cheating is an endemic problem at CEIBS, and one of the less obvious examples is in the exchange school selection process. You have to write an anonymous application letter to the MBA admin office explaining your achievements after two semesters and why you want to go to your three chosen exchange schools. It‚Äôs a somewhat counterintuitive process because when your application letter discusses your achievements as ‚ÄúPresident of the student body‚Äù, ‚ÄúPresident of the student ambassadors‚Äù or how you ‚Äúmade the brave decision to relocate from your home in Chile to come to CEIBS‚Äù, it‚Äôs no longer anonymous. But deviously, other students take advantage of this. For example, half the class doesn‚Äôt apply for an exchange school, so if that includes a senior student leader, another student will write their application letter pretending to be that student leader in order to get a good exchange school. Then there are some students who throw a Hail Mary by pretending to be another student and hope that the applications are read by different MBA office staffers. Others will just make up achievements such as ‚Äúrunning the language exchange program‚Äù. This is all done because the MBA admin office doesn‚Äôt verify the claims or cross-reference them against the student ID on the application. They take the application letters as gospel and award exchange schools based on that. So if you are planning on doing an exchange semester, make sure the MBA admin team knows it and is fully aware of your achievements, so that no one else can fraudulently claim them. 

&gt;***Side note****: I had to rewrite this paragraph several times because it‚Äôs very difficult to explain this issue without it sounding outlandish*

When the list of schools that students have been awarded is published, the general reaction is confusion. Don‚Äôt be surprised when a student who never speaks in class, does poorly in assignments, has a low GPA and spends most of the classes on their cellphone gets to go to one of the top exchange schools. It‚Äôs tempting to think that it‚Äôs the result of bribery, but it‚Äôs most likely because there were applications from multiple Presidents of the student body and no one questioned why.

**Job Search**

The main reason most of us do an MBA is to get a better job. The odds are against you though. I‚Äôve spoken [ad nauseam](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/v0pp5z/the_ceibs_diaries_parts_68/) about the difficulties in finding work in China as a non-native Mandarin speaker, but finding work overseas is far more challenging than usual. 

One of the biggest problems you will face is that career treks are mostly cancelled under China‚Äôs zero-Covid rules. A quick two-day or one-week trek to anywhere outside of the Mainland is impossible because it would require at least a week of hotel quarantine after you get back to China, and this would require you to miss core classes, so the school has cancelled all overseas treks. As for treks within China, all but one is designed for Chinese students wanting work in China (career talks are in Chinese by companies not looking to hire foreign nationals etc.). Usually they are oversubscribed, so it would be very difficult to get on the treks. With overseas treks cancelled, demand will be even higher. However, travel within China is now highly restricted and CEIBS likely won‚Äôt want anyone leaving Shanghai because of the risk of other cities being locked down. The one China trek designed for foreign nationals is nothing more than a propaganda tour, so don‚Äôt waste your time. 

You will also find it very difficult to leave China to interview with firms. Due to the difficulties of exiting and reentering China, there will be minimal opportunity to meet recruiters and alumni in person. Obviously, Zoom calls are normalized nowadays, but you‚Äôre at a big disadvantage to candidates in Hong Kong, Singapore or further afield if they can meet the same people in person. As for recruiting for internships, you have to hope that there‚Äôs no in-person interview stage. 

**Try To Enjoy It**

That‚Äôs it. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt tell you to have fun exploring China because travel restrictions will stop you from doing that. I also can‚Äôt tell you to make the most of recruiting because you can‚Äôt go to meet recruiters in person. But what I can tell you is that you will make it out of the other side, probably with a good job at a reputable firm, and definitely with some unique anecdotes about your MBA experience. Just make sure you share them with prospective applicants. 

Hang in there.

Yours,

Bigger Bamboo

If you follow them, I think your first year can be a breeze.

1. **You‚Äôre not inferior to anyone.** When you enter hs, you‚Äôre going to see kids your age making varsity and taking calc. But just because Jimmy from English is in varsity pickleball and 20 APs, it doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs better than you. He wishes he had something of yours.
2. **It only ends when you put limits on yourself.** You‚Äòre not ‚Äútoo dumb‚Äù for anything. You‚Äôre just not there yet. I know this sounds like shitty and trite advice, but it means something.
3. **Hang out with people you admire.** You become more and more like your environment. Put books in your room and you‚Äôll become a reader. Same thing with people. Be careful. Also don‚Äôt fuck around with drama.
4. **Don‚Äòt idolize a college.** Have a goal, like ‚ÄúI want to get into a really good college‚Äù but don‚Äôt be a Stanford Sweat from day 1. Focus on building yourself, and the acceptances will follow. Freshman Stanford Sweats burn out. Freshman Superstars do not.
5. **Take this time to explore and develop.** I had loads of time freshman year(we could not take APs) and I discovered an interest. Due to this, I took this initiative and reached out, and I landed myself an internship at a T20 school.
   1. **Develop good study habits.** This is incredibly important. Habits like distributing work out first as opposed to doing it last minute with serve you well throughout your hs career and life in general.
6. **MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL develop a reading habit.** Reading habits are directly correlated with high SAT scores. You‚Äôll be a happier, smarter and a better person in general(trust me) if you read more.

I have more stuff to say, of course. DM me with any questions and i‚Äôd be happy to help."

I know this is just me venting, but maybe I can find some people who have gone through the same thing and well ended up finishing college. I'm 23 years old and well honestly I have been fooling around since I got into college. I was never one to study and focus so the first year I got through, but nothing stellar even though it was mostly easy classes. I took a year off and well did nothing, but work part time. I came back and well failed college algebra which was demoralizing for me since well it was college algebra and I was going for an engineering degree. So, I decided to take it a bit more seriously and well I took it again and passed it with an A. It felt amazing knowing actually what was going on in class and well the next semester it was time for plane trigonometry. It was going well, however Covid hit and well like many I presume it hurt my grades. I couldn't pay attention at home and just watched tv and played games. However, I could cheat and thus I finished my classes that semester. From there I kept going and passed some courses and failed others.

Now I'm in cal 3, physics, and an engineering class which is basically excel and matlab. However, the thing is I cheated through pre-cal, cal 1 and cal 2 so now  I'm basically lost completely.  I don't even know where to start to study for cal 3, this is my second time taking physics and the engineering course and I don't want to fail these classes again.

My best friend from high school is in his last semester and is starting an internship soon in his career while I'm stuck paranoid on how am I gonna pass these classes that I just don't get. Now I know this is the result of his hard work and dedication and I am insanely proud and happy for my friend. However, I cant lie that I feel jealous and depressed as well. I'm at a point where I'm feeling envious of so many people, yet I know everyone has their own story and are just doing the best they can. Its funny, I could be trying to study right now about physics or cal 3 cause at least that I could maybe just maybe wrap my head around and yet here I am writing about how sad I feel. I feel like a joke these days.

I could maybe change my path, but honestly the only other fields that I guess ensure stability in finding jobs are in business area and well I don't like the idea of any of it.  Also I just don't want to restart again and spend more time in college. I hate it and well it sucks to go to school and work part time. It just drains you and it makes me hate both things more like a never ending cycle.

I never had a passion in much, but I  guess reading fantasy novels, manga/anime and video games.  I dont believe myself to have passion though to pursue any of these as actual careers though especially the first two in which very little people actually make a decent living off.  Though I have been thinking of starting of an idea of a  fantasy novel that I could start in a couple years since I do like to imagine stuff. However, for a minute I was trained by a couple of dudes about their job which was using autocad to design underground pipes for telecommunication cables and where to place them in the street.  I kinda liked it and thus it made me choose civil engineering as my degree even though to be honest I'm not gifted in stem subjects.

I am well aware that this is a struggle of mine that I have to deal with and try to get up if I want to succeed in my life. Its just hard with the classes I'm taking right now and I'm only near an associates degree. I still have two more years of school if I got my stuff together and that is all gonna be in the specifics of my field. I guess I'll thicken my face and just see how maybe other people dealt with college and maybe if someone also dealt with the same thing with calculus or another class. How did y'all deal with it? How did y'all learn to temper yourselves so y'all could actually  do y'alls work and study for class? Or maybe just how did y'all learn to stand up and well learn to lead  life with more confidence and positivity?

I will say this though to whoever starts college though. Study and have a good work ethic so you're not me  in October dreading about all three of my classes in which I'm lost and feeling anxious about. Also don't hole yourself up into yourself and find maybe  ways to find small successes at least so you don't end up massively depressed, bitter, jealous and angry at yourself.  This might sound hollow and stupid considering its coming from someone who is clearly not anywhere where they want to be in my life, but I hope others can find peace in themselves since it sucks when you feel worthless and you know what could you could to help yourself and yet you find yourself on your bed still the same dude who is struggling with the fact that you have never achieved much cause you don't put the effort and just hope everything just fixes itself magically."

y10gcv,1,2022-10-11,New Grad Team Selection,SkyPorridge,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y10gcv/new_grad_team_selection/," 

Hello, previously been a lurker here - did my best to review the rules and comply accordingly, but lmk if I accidentally broke a rule.

That said, I am currently a senior studying CS and have a return offer I plan to accept for full-time Software Engineering. The company's team selection process includes a component in which I rank my top two teams (\~20 teams total at the company), and I have been told that I will likely get one of those two teams by the recruiting team (I believe them, as I got my top choice internship project).

I'm just not entirely sure what team to pick. Ofc, not gonna go through and detail each team, just give some broad strokes with the hopes that y'all have informative suggestions about priorities for an early career SWE.

The safe option would be the team I interned with, as I already know the team, including the manager and my mentors from the summer. I enjoyed working with my mentors and found the team to have solid WLB (from Glassdoor, my impression is that the whole company has good WLB, but my experience gives more certainty). The tech-stack is basically Java + Spring (not Spring Boot) for backend and Typescript + React + Redux for the front-end.

My summer internship project was entirely in Java. In fact, it was so far on the periphery of their codebase that I made a few small modifications to some existing files to integrate my feature and perform a (very) small bit of Spring wiring. Most files I modified I wrote from scratch. It was interesting enough, but I think I'd enjoy and benefit from expanding my technological horizons by going deeper and/or higher in the stack. Personally, I think I'm more interested in back-end work than front-end despite having never done the latter.

The team I interned with maintains a core API used by many other teams in addition to their own, and there's a lot of database work available as a result, so I could go deeper by working on that stuff. During the summer, I just programmatically generated a lot of calls to that API rather than developing the API itself.

But, I could even deeper into the stack on other teams. For example, one teams maintains the compiler and related tooling (incremental parser for syntax highlighting, etc.) for a custom programming language used by the company for elements of data processing. One team manages cloud integrations. Another handles non-cloud integrations (integrating the company's data-engineering products with Hadoop, for example). Yet another maintains a real-time, distributed, in-memory data-processing platform (as far as I can tell, it's like a proprietary competitor of Apache Spark). And so forth. These other teams use mostly C++ and a bit of their custom language.

From having talked to some teams, my impression of the managers is that I vibe well with the team I was on during the summer and the team maintaining the Spark competitor. I have not talked to the other teams as much, but there will be an opportunity to virtually meet them in the spring.

Consequently, I don't actually have to go through this process until the spring, but I figured it couldn't hurt to start contemplating now.

If I went with the Spark-ish team, I think I'd learn a lot about distributed systems, low-level communication, low latency programming, etc. Not to mention general C++ development.

But, I am unsure whether this will box me in with a fairly niche set of skills or else boost my career by providing me with a rare but widely sought skillset, given the centrality of distributed systems to most large-scale platforms. My concern persists because, at most companies, you don't program distributed computation platforms/tools. Instead, you use existing one(s) such as Apache Spark, Kafka, etc. We can integrate with some such tools, but I assume the experience would be different from most distributed dev work elsewhere.

My other somewhat mild concern is that I won't have the required skillset: I might be able to take a distributed computing course in the spring, if it doesn't over-enroll too much, but I don't have experience with networking, etc. either. My coursework covered basic architecture (cache hierarchy, virtual memory, etc.) and O/S fundamentals (more on virtual memory, the boot process, scheduling, etc). 

Thanks!"
y11ggf,2,2022-10-11,Critique My Pivot Plan From Social Science to Corporate Career,AQuickA,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/y11ggf/critique_my_pivot_plan_from_social_science_to/,"So I'm currently a 3rd year student at a big 4 university with a social science major. Recently, I realized that if I want to be a competitive hire, in an industry with a lot of upward mobility, I need to either 1. Shape up my resume or 2. Start building my networks. But since I don't really want to be that rich kid who uses connections to get by in life, I decided to try and pivot into becoming market ready without completely abandoning my passion (social science).

Here is my current plan:

1. Finish my degree with at least an honorable mention.
2. Get a management minor (already well on my way to completing my minor in human resource management (since I feel like that makes the most sense for my major)
3. Learn R (Data Camp)
4. Learn Tableau  (Data Camp) (already started with this)
5. Learn HTML (Sololearn)
6. Get certificate on Project Management (Google) (already started on this)
7. Ger certificate on Data Analysis (Google) 
8. Get a certificate on Human Resource related course (Coursera) (already done)
9. Use my skills to get an org position with a title (working on it)
10. Get internship experience starting March of next year (no need to get paid)

I don't know exactly where I'm going with this, but I want to keep myself open to a career in Project Management, Data Analysis, Human Resources, or Market Analytics, since they're relatively safe career paths that I can find myself having fun with (can still apply social science to those careers). 

My ultimate goal isn't really to make 6 figures or anything too crazy, if I wanted that I'd just suck up and network. I just want to earn financial stability and the freedom to choose the career I want, i.e. not be forced to take the first job offered to me because I know I'm not marketable otherwise.

Is the plan good so far? What can I work on? What can I add?"

y17xoy,5,2022-10-11,Advice for a high school graduate during a gap year,mathewvanherreweghe,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/y17xoy/advice_for_a_high_school_graduate_during_a_gap/,"I'm caught in a dilemma right now.

I studied in Singapore, where the A-level results determine your future. I performed decently for that to grant me admission to almost any major I'd like to attend at local Universities (their entry is almost purely results-based). However, I was set on going overseas for university, but due to visa issues at the last minute, I could not attend. Hence, forcing me into a gap year.

This gap year allowed me to switch up which major I can be offered admission to through their special admission. This route is open to those with achievements in a particular field(my score cannot secure direct admission to their computer science major, but with the special admission scheme, I am confident I could still enter).

In attempting to fulfil these achievements, my parents pushed me to participate in the USA coding Olympiad(USACO). It is one of the most direct paths into the computer science major through discretionary admission. 

After about a month of preparing for USACO, I found that I do not particularly have an aptitude(?) or interest in solving many of these abstract problems surrounding all sorts of mischief of cows. I realize my desire to solve these problems is purely driven by the liking the university ""might"" take to such a medal and Asian parents' pressure into trying to achieve as much as possible in an incredibly short time frame(0 to a silver medal in 3 months). Also, the perception that such a medal is a sure way to get into university and land a job.

On the other hand, during my high school years, I did certain projects and even won prizes in app designing competitions(more imagination than the actual coding part). But the specific field I kept coming back to was data analytics. So I have ploughed through the course on python in data science given by code academy whenever I got too tired of schoolwork and still wanted to be productive.

After the examinations, I signed up and paid for the Google data certificate out of my allowance. Even though I couldn't get as far as I was going to begin my University studies, I still enjoyed the course.

On a side note, I consider myself(and as attested to by my peers, teachers and adults) to be a more outgoing person who enjoys discussing ideas with friends and conversing with all sorts of people. So perhaps not entirely fitting into the typical competitive programming persona.

# This brings me to my question:

Should I continue down this path of competitive programming? Will it be worthwhile to stick it out in the end? I'm sure I'd probably like to do something in IT, preferably in AI/Data/Machine Learning, with much more group work and people oriented role or even a role in the finance industry. Will perhaps Taking up the google certificate be better? Would that be possible to also secure me a short internship over the winter months before I even apply for University(In late March)? And would going into the Computer Science major still be the best idea? Or would mathematics(the original major I was going to attend)/statistics major suit me better? 

# TLDR:

Graduated high school student in a gap year, unsure whether to continue with Competitive programming or switch to data analytics by taking up the google certificate and which major to attend at university for his more outgoing personality for a future job in IT or Finance or as an entrepreneur."
y193ok,68,2022-10-11,I attend a T3 school and want a work-life balance (and big monies) what are good careers?,DrMeepMop,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/y193ok/i_attend_a_t3_school_and_want_a_worklife_balance/,"**EDIT/ADDITIONAL:** I've gotten some wonderful ideas from you wonderful folks, as expected. Now my next question is, how do align myself strategically for these careers ( Corp/com dev/ banking, Com real estate, and my eyes are particularly on Asset Management)?

&amp;#x200B;

I basically have a 99% chance with my scores to get into a top grad school, and I'm already located ""here"" so I'm willing to go if it's worth the time spent (I'll get a free ride too). 

&amp;#x200B;

Any internships I should shoot for? Should I intern at the most prestigious places just for my resume (Looking at you, Goldman Sachs summer analyst)? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**ORIGINAL:**

Let‚Äôs just say I love finance, investing, and especially real estate.

&amp;#x200B;

I crawled out of poverty, joined the Marines, and grinded my way into a badass UG. Problem is, I‚Äôve been grinding nonstop for about 10 years when I graduate.

I‚Äôm done grinding; I‚Äôve finally realized I don‚Äôt want to spend the single currency I can never create: **time**.

&amp;#x200B;

This being said, I‚Äôm married to a wonderful wife and want to start a family soon (I‚Äôm that age)

&amp;#x200B;

I have all the resources, networking, charisma, and prestige to land that shiny new IB job. However, it sounds like the last thing I want to do. I‚Äôve been grinding 80+ hour weeks for an eternity, and I‚Äôm burnt out. I just want to make 150k+ a year and work 40 hours and play catch with my son in our suburban house.

&amp;#x200B;

(Another point to add is location, I want to be in FL)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, what kind of careers would I be looking at? I have great grades and great scores, and I can 100% go to a T3 grad school (so that‚Äôs an option). I really like real estate, but I‚Äôm not familiar with how or what lucrative job opportunities there are.

&amp;#x200B;

Give me some ideas so I can research these career paths. There are so many finance jobs I honestly am not too familiar with half of them. Also, exit Ops is important too, I have the entrepreneurial spirit, and I‚Äôm dying to start a pie of my own. So a career that can transition to entrepreneurship would be ideal."

Edit: Wrongly consolidated my SAT score from two attempts into an average ü§®, and clarifying that my subjects are \*IB\* subjects, I just took two AP exams."
y1aic5,4,2022-10-11,Did i f*ed up my interview??,Milind_,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/y1aic5/did_i_fed_up_my_interview/,"Little bit about myself, So I graduated this year and now I'm sending application for past 5 months to get job or internship and so far no luck. Even tho I had 3 month internship experience with pretty good project to showcase i didn't even passed screening.

 By some tremendous luck I saw a company hiring fresher with decent salary along wfh. I just amazed and applied for it and started revising all my knowledge.

I just aced up first and second interview and they immediately schedule me for 3rd one.

Now my dumbass brain thought I got the intership and now it's hr time, but no. It was another tech interview and problem was related recursion. I never tried recursion problem. But I somehow managed to tell them the approach and able to solve nearly complete solution but couldn't. They we are getting late since they are giving 30min for each candidate. But they did say that If you managed to solve it, send the solution on our email.they leave the meeting. After that I just brain storm and managed to solve in 30min and send it on their email. 

Now I'm worried that even if I send them a mail I don't think they will see and I'll be rejected. 

Guys please tell me what will happen to me. This intership is everything for me."

I know I am fairly early to the game, but I have always been one to want to prep early to maximize my chances of getting accepted. I plan to apply in Fall 2023 for admissions in Fall 2024.

**Current Role:** Technical Product Manager working at large FAANG company for almost 3 years; have had 2 (almost 3 by the time I apply) promotions with upward career trajectory; have always received ""exceeds expectations"" on performance reviews; founder of early in career group for my org (we plan events/ provide resources for 0-5 years in career) &amp; committee member of Learning &amp; Inclusion Committee (heading initiative to host leadership learning series with senior level executives)

**Past work experience:** Several internships at college (every summer including after freshman year) working at start ups and Fortune 500 companies; all related to product or project management

**Why do I want an MBA/Post MBA goals:** Career pivot; want to stay in tech but eventually get into Venture Capital; plan to go into Management Consulting or work at a start up for a few years to build a skillset. Ultimately would want to start/work for a VC fund that provides funding to LATAM startups

**GMAT:** Have only done practice ones and planning to sit for the real deal towards the end of this year; currently scoring in the low 700s with target score of 720-730

**Undergrad GPA:** 3.35 from a top private school, undergrad major in Business/Computer Science. Lowest grades in harder classes like programming, this is what knocked my GPA down (not ivy, but more on par with schools like Duke or Vanderbilt). Since this is my lowest point, participating in HBS Core in the winter to have some post-college transcript grades

**Extracurriculars:** Service mission in South America for 1 year (fluent Spanish); Vice President of undergrad major club for 2 years; student government leader for 3 years (undergrad); undergrad business school student council (1 year); current participant in local volunteer organization (1x a week commitment); refer to current role for work related extracurriculars

**Additional info:** Caucasian, female, mid 20s, letters of recommendation coming from prior managers who are in senior leadership roles or mentors; have known me for multiple years

**Target schools:** Stanford, Yale SOM, Haas, Kellogg, Wharton, HBS, Columbia, Texas McCombs, UCLA-Anderson

Do I have a shot? Or is there anything I can do to make my profile better? I am most concerned for low undergrad gpa."

What kind of jobs can I get that pay more than $20 an hour? It seems like to do anything with my degree, I need either a masters, or I need to be a pro programmer. Could my next step be to learn SQL in my free time or something so I could get into data analysis? My heart would not be in it, but I don't really think learning SQL is the kind of thing people put their hearts in to. And on top of all of this, I'm a non-passing trans woman, so I'm only able/comfortable to work in trans-friendly industries (whatever that means). Part of why I'm thinking of breaking into tech is the supportive culture there, but damn, I'm not that good at computers. I'm close to a tech hub though. I have a bit of history with python and C#, but not enough to do it professionally yet. My mother and only sibling are disabled, too, so I think I need to chase money to provide for my family soon."

y1imbe,2,2022-10-11,Offer that I feel good about has been received. Would like some help deciding,turkishjedi21,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/y1imbe/offer_that_i_feel_good_about_has_been_received/,"So since mid August, starting the day I finished my summer internship, I started applying on indeed, LinkedIn, etc for entry level FPGA and ASIC design positions.

Up until now, I've sent out a total of ~85 apps, and have done 9 interviews. Most of those ended with ""your experience looks to be exactly in line with what we want, but this is an immediate hire position"" or with startups ""we can't tell whether or not we'll be hiring that far in advance""

I've gotten far with 3 companies I interviewed with. Epiq solutions, rampart communications, and Ericsson.

Ericsson gave me a verbal offer after the first interview, later that day. I asked if I could get 4 weeks to continue looking. They said that sounds OK, and that they'll send a formal offer letter when I'm ready to make a decision.

So that's when I have my second interview with rampart, tell them about the deadline. Get a third interview scheduled 3 days before my Ericsson deadline (I told them about it), but they canceled because of a hiring freeze (the day I saw a lot of news about ""credit suisse"" and presumably other financial places losing a ton of money lol)

I interviewed with epiq exactly one week before the deadline. At the very end of the interview I told them about my deadline. Heard back later that day with them saying they want to fly me to Chicago to skip the second round of interviews and meet the team. I ended up saying I couldn't due that, because the week of the deadline with Ericsson was insanely packed with senior design work that I could not miss (what's a job offer if I've got to spend another year in school)

Anyway, the reason I mention all of that is because I feel that it illustrates my value, and my main question I guess is ""can I do better"" or more specifically, ""should I decline my only current offer in hopes of getting a better one""

Ericsson pros:
Generous PTO (28 days, 1 week of sick days, 1 week of kin care, 2 weeks vacation)

Austin area looks like a very good place to be at my age. I can't think of a place id like to be more.

The rotation program I'd be in would give me exposure to both design and verification, doing each for 1 year with different sub teams, then being able to choose which I'd rather do.

The core of the work I'd be doing is centered around ASICs, and the impression I get is that this would allow me to further continue a career with ASIC design or verification as well as FPGA design or verification, whereas an FPGA position seems to be a bit less flexible in that regard

Sma office of 250 people. This was something I loved about my internship, which had the same amount of people.

Engineers I've talked to seem to be passionate about their work.

5k signing bonus, 5k relocation. Self explanatory

Cons:
Pay doesn't seem the greatest for the area, 95k base. On glassdoor the average for the area is displayed as 99k, with 15k bonus iirc. Bonus at Ericsson is 6% of the salary per year, with a performance multiplier (this sounds pretty solid), but another con is there's no stock options, and instead (since it's European based) they do another multiplier on the 6% based on how the company is doing.

Drug free workplace. This is probably for the best, but I've always enjoyed Marijuana outside of school. I'd also like to get one last ""hurrah"" with my friends back hope this Christmas break. I mean, after the drug test this should still be doable.

Bigger company. I feel like this would equate to more boring work, but it also does sound like given the rotation program, I'll have a good amount of freedom with what I do and/or have interesting work.

The applications of the work are interesting, but I know there are better ones out there. Telecommunications and spreading 5g across the world is certainly interesting, but as a golden standard I look at my internship over the summer, where I did meaningful work on a fucking satellite, that wasn't just any satellite, but one that will be used to provide cheap internet access to people in the world who don't have it. An application that I can clearly see impacting humanity in one of the ways that I find to be the most important.

Anyway, what do you think? I'm certainly leaning for it pretty heavily, but it's scary knowing something better could be out there"

My field of study pushes me to work as a data scientist, but I feel like I wont be interested in it (I really enjoy coding, but not so much analysing data / statistics). I heard about data engineering but according to what I already saw, most of DE jobs also involves data science. 

So I was thinking about doing my intership in backend development, however I'm afraid not to like it. I feel like it's more about optimisation (roughly like choosing merge sort over bubble sort, decrease execution time with complex algorithms, do you see what I mean ?). 
What should I do ? I enjoy coding but not with such theorical concepts.

Another option was cloud developper internships, but I guess it falls in the same field.

I feel like I'm struggling to picture how interesting / boring an IT job is, so it is hard for me to pick a field considering that my career will be heavily impacted by this choice."

y1lgd0,1,2022-10-11,Is backend for me ?,165817566995,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/y1lgd0/is_backend_for_me/,"I will soon graduate and I need to choose my internship, and I'm really struggling to pick a field within IT. My field of study pushes me to work as a data scientist, but I feel like I wont be interested in it (I really enjoy coding, but not so much analysing data / statistics). I heard about data engineering but according to what I already saw, most of DE jobs also involves data science.

So I was thinking about doing my intership in backend development, however I'm afraid not to like it. I feel like it's more about optimisation (roughly like choosing merge sort over bubble sort, decrease execution time with complex algorithms, do you see what I mean ?). What should I do ? I enjoy coding but not with such theorical concepts.

Another option was cloud developper internships, but I guess it falls in the same field.

I feel like I'm struggling to picture how interesting / boring an IT job is, so it is hard for me to pick a field considering that my career will be heavily impacted by this choice."

y1m8zy,248,2022-10-11,From Struggling With An Intro To Programming Course To Becoming A Software Engineer At A Silicon Valley Tech Company,lifting_and_coding,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y1m8zy/from_struggling_with_an_intro_to_programming/,"Whatsup everyone.

I remember when I first got into computer science and how I struggled like crazy with the intro to programming course. At that time, I made a promise to myself that I would work my butt off and once I got a good job, I will post on programming communities to motivate others who may be at the same starting point.

Well I'm glad to say that I've been working at a Silicon Valley tech company for just over a year now and I feel it is time to make this post. Hopefully this will motivate some of you out there who are at the same starting point.

**My Starting Point:**

I was finishing up a criminology degree and I became interested in CS at the same time around the last semester of my crim degree. I signed up for the CS program at a local university and was soon accepted. Luckily a lot of the credits from my crim degree transferred for the general credits in the CS degree so I only needed another two years to complete my CS degree rather than 4.

Keep in mind, I've been a terrible student all my life. I didn't graduate high school in time and failed many courses in HS. However, I was an above average student in my crim degree. My above average grades in my crim degree are what got me accepted into the CS program.

**The Struggle:**

The acceptance into the program is where the struggle began. I started with an intro to programming course and understood NOTHING. I remember feeling so hopeless and trying to reach out for tutoring. I had one lesson with a tutor and everything he explained went right over my head. At this time, all the imposter thoughts were swarming into my head (""Am I smart enough for CS?"", ""Can I really do this?"")

However, I kept pushing. This MOOC course was a life saver for me in finally grasping beginner programming concepts [About the course - Java Programming (mooc.fi)](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

There were more struggles along the way. The next one was mathematics. Remember how I said that I didn't even graduate high school in time? My math was barely at elementary school level when I joined the CS program. I had to work on my foundation of math from the base. The best resource I can recommend for this is Professor Leonard [Professor Leonard - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorLeonard). Simply the best math instructor ever. Period. Difficult math concepts that I could never grasp felt so easy when explained by Prof Leonard. Cannot recommend enough!!!

That's a glimpse into the educational struggle. The next struggle was actually finding a job/internship. My advice here may not be the best b/c all I did was apply apply and apply some more. I applied to so many positions its not even funny. My inbox is flooded with rejection emails.

I remember the first coding challenge I got was for an internship from one of my dream companies at the time (not FAANG or any Silicon Valley company). I took it and failed it MISERABLY. Looking back, the coding challenge was actually pretty easy. However, at the time, this was demoralizing.

About 8 months into my CS program is when I got an interview that translated into a job offer. This was at a small local tech company. However, I ended up declining the offer because I felt that it would significantly slow down my progress in school. My number one goal was finishing the degree up ASAP.

12 months in, I applied to the same company at which I had failed the initial coding assessment. As luck would have it, I ended up passing the coding challenge this time and I got the internship. The pay was nothing major but I was ecstatic.

I worked my butt off at that internship and was in the process of being converted to a full time employee.

At this time I was also applying to other companies as I wasn't a full time employee at the company I had done an internship at yet, so I felt it was best to keep applying in case things didn't workout there for some reason.

Again, I was rejected by a lot of companies but one Silicon Valley tech company responded back to my application. I went through the process and soon had an offer on the table.

Prior to this offer, I had never made more than $20/hr in my life and this offer was for six figures. It was a beautiful moment to see all my hard work pay off. I still remember how that felt. In a weird way, that feeling was worth much more than any of the money.

**Where I Am At Today:**

Today, I am employed at said company and have been for over a year. I do get FAANG recruiters hitting me up from time to time on LinkedIn (less now due to all the hiring freezes going on). Overall, I'm very happy with how my career is progressing.

If you're in the same place I was when I started, here are my closing thoughts for you:

\- Computer Science is for you. Put in the hard work and I have no doubt you can get to whatever company you want or whatever your goal may be.

\- Having said the above, I will re-iterate that doing this just for the money may not be the best idea. While software engineering looks really comfortable (remote, well-paid, lots of demand), it is constant problem solving and learning something new everyday. I love it and if you love it, then you'll fit right in. If you hate problem solving and can't stand looking at code, yet are only doing it for the $$, then I still think you can be successful if you work hard. However, is hating 8 hours of your day, 5 days a week, really the life you want to live? There are other well paying professions out there. I'm not saying you have to love everyday of your job but rather, find the profession that best meshes with your personality.

That's all, feel free to ask any questions.

To give some context, I am located in Canada (working remote)."
y1mek6,4,2022-10-11,just graduated and finding the first job is hard,Responsible_Duck_198,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y1mek6/just_graduated_and_finding_the_first_job_is_hard/,"I have a BSc in Econ (2022) but not a whole lot of work experience, basically general office summer internships all pre-pandemic.

I thought I could get a job in a new graduate training program at a company somewhere but it seems to be rejection after rejection. Should I be sending out hundreds of resumes each week? I usually just stick to openings that seem to make sense given my lack of work experience and econ background which usually end up being about 10 a week. 

It's been 5 months of unemployment and I'm not sure if I should just literally get any min wage job for a bit of cash so I can stop relying on my parents for money or keep trying for something a bit better. I'm also new to the city and I don't know many people so networking has been difficult.

A lot of the postings are for co-ops/internships so I'm wondering if I should go back for a masters but try and focus on co-ops/internships unlike I did in my undergrad. It's just going to add up to more time and money and I'm already 25.

Any advice?"

y1o3x3,0,2022-10-11,Intern needing advice from more senior devs,noblepups,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/y1o3x3/intern_needing_advice_from_more_senior_devs/,"I am a new dev with just 3 months of experience. My brother is an ex google engineer that left to start his own company. Basically I'm an unpaid intern learning and working with him. Before this I got pretty decent at writing Python, but that's all I knew for all intensive purposes. The backend that I'm working on is Flask, psql, and sqlalchemy. My brother just gave me an endpoint to create from scratch. I am having a really hard time getting to a place where I can confidently contribute to the codebase. It's hard for me to gauge how effective my learning is by just looking at random documentation. I can see alot of the code he's written and that kinda helps as a guide, but also it makes me more likely to copy paste without learning at the depth that I normally would building something from scratch.

I feel like my confidence was higher when I was following a tutorial and building things on my own from scratch, and I'm not sure if confidence = efficient learning. I feel very drawn to get to a point where I can help him with his app whilst I'm sure he just wants me to learn as much as I can.

I want to use the learning opportunity to the best I can, and also I crave getting to the point where I am with python which is just a foundation of confidence I don't feel now. I think what's also hard is that I feel compelled to want to help him, and maybe if I can then he will give me a job when/if he gets funding (he has also mentioned the possibility)so I can leave my job and work full-time coding. Can anyone give me tips to solve my confidence/learning dilemma?

PS: Told my brother this briefly, and he said he has no way of knowing how much or how effectively I am learning because he can't see from my perspective. Also, I have been working with him for like two weeks and I fixed one bug lol."

I am just worried that I will get burnt out but I prefer to just do this and get my degree and start applying for grad position or internships.

What do you think my workload and life balance will be and also if this is suicide..

Would I have time to network in between?

Would I have time to apply during the terms?

Would it be better if I just do 2 comp subjects and do another year?

I fear worst for term 2 since 2511 and 3141 has the worst manageability rating..

(I want to do comp subjects that had the most useful rating in the CSE Elective website and preferable finish uni quick as possible since Ive already be at unsw for 3 years)

Thanks for your advice!"

Could my projects be holding me back?,Judge_AssKing,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y1pat6/graduated_5_months_ago_with_no_luck_finding_a_job/,"Graduated in May with an average GPA, have been consistently applying for jobs (don't ask how many, I don't know). All I've gotten so far is 1 phone interview and 1 technical assessment. As a consequence of poor motivation, I only have 2 internships and 2 potentially bad projects. Both were made a long time ago (2018 and 2019) and under similar circumstances (relatively simple Java games developed for competitions), and neither of them were particularly successful in those competitions.

I have a feeling that these projects may be holding me back from success due to their nature. I feel that my best options at this time of desperation are defense (which I have ethical qualms about), and WITCH (which I am not super eager to do).

I can post my resume if necessary. On a related note, what ""personal projects"" SHOULD I be working on during all this downtime? I honestly have no ideas on what to do (and when I told someone this, he questioned why I was in CS in the first place).

tl;dr can't find a job after graduating, projects might be screwing me, help.

I‚Äôm doing a dual degree program (5 years) (Mechanical engineering + MBA in technology management (operations management)) rn from one of the top B-schools here, also have goodish marks(~3.2 out of 4 CGPA). I have worked for over 3 years in the university‚Äôs SAE BAJA team as a roll-cage engineer, and have 2 months (technical) of professional working experience in an internship. I have also done some MOOCs on digital manufacturing, cybersecurity and MIS. I have a university mandated internship(4.5 months) for management roles coming up soon. I‚Äôve also never been abroad.

I still have 1.5 years before I graduate, but I think it‚Äôs high time now, to start working on a plan to move out of India.

My major problems are the utter chaos, relentlessness and high competition everywhere, and on top of that my internship was unpaid and I had work ~60 hours a week; so just a shitty work environment and I just feel that I‚Äôm not valued here in general. 

So what I would want is, a place that values me as a human being, is peaceful, has good working conditions, pays well, less (or ideally not) racist and is basically just nice to live in. I‚Äôm eyeing Germany and Canada rn as they are immigrant hotspots for Indians (making it easier to get settled in), have good quality of life and in need of skilled workers. 

I have B1.2 CEFR English Language certification which I got several years back (my English had def improved a lot since then), and I‚Äôm looking forward to giving IELTS. And I have been learning German using Duolingo for over a year now. I can do very basic conversations and can make out few unexplored words by myself, but I have no official German certifications yet.

Budget wise, my parents are saying they can aid in financing for the first year‚Äôs living expenses (maximum aid would be CA$ or ‚Ç¨ 10,000 for the year), but university fees and rest of the expenses I will have to cover. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should do another masters program, just so that I could move into that country easily or if I ACTUALLY NEED ONE (and especially since I‚Äôve already have a masters degree). Or if I need more work experience to land a job outside India. I‚Äôm totally lost and overwhelmed. 

Just looking for some guidance and suggestions so that I could move out, and live a happier life. 

Any suggestions would be helpful. I would also be really grateful if y‚Äôall could say what scope do I have on the job market. Thanks!

Also y‚Äôall can suggest any other countries too. Thanks again ü§ûüèΩ

TLDR: Gave an overview of my education, experience and finances. Looking to move out of India so that I could live peacefully. Target countries are Germany and Canada, but y‚Äôall can suggest any other countries.

It's pretty depressing but I don't want to give up just yet. 



My question is- even if I do get unlucky in this year/round, I do still want to apply the following year? What is the typical ways and chances of doing this? 


My concerns: If I apply this time next year/round I'll be out of college for a while, and I know these firms like to scoop up fresh grads. Will I still be able to apply for graduate level positions? I definitely wouldn't be able to qualify for junior trading positions but it seems companies overwhelmingly prefer new grads/current students for graduate and internship positions? Where exactly would someone like me fit in, if at all? 


Other questions: What kind of jobs are best in b/w to maximize my chances of getting a trading job? SWE at FAANG? Data Science? ML? 


Chances- Once you're out of the industry, how difficult is it to break back in? Does the industry have much patience for people not getting in via the traditional timeline? Is there roughly speaking an age/experience limit/deadline before the door is shut behind you forever?


**Profile:** I have a Master's in Math from a T10 university, and UG in math + cs from a T15 one. 3.8 GPA in both. I'm a recent grad from the Master's.

My assessment as to the lack of success is because I have 0 prior work/internship experience. This was because until very recently my 'life plan' was to be in academia and all my efforts went to that (so for instance summers I spent taking extra coursework and research instead of going for internships). But then I changed my mind from academia and now I find myself with decent/good academic pedigree (and the appropriate skills) but 0 relevant work experience. I was hoping the skills and the degrees would make up for the lack of work experience but apparently not."

So I‚Äôm currently 2 months in my 12 month internship, and I‚Äôm having a really good time, and a part of a very, very good culture and team

However, I‚Äôve just received an offer from another company. This company is more prestigious than what I have now, better pay, good culture and will most likely open more doors later on. It‚Äôs for 4 months starting in January.

Part of me wants to quit my current internship to sign the offer with the other company, but afraid of the repercussions I may face, such as being blacklisted.

The other part of me wants to stay in my current internship because I like the team and work I do but worries I‚Äôm turning down a very good opportunity

Kind of in a standstill - any advice would be appreciated!!

EDIT: Just had a meeting with the new company - details:

My Situation:
- I am financially well, live with parents so not difficult to manage bills
- New Company is a completely new team/experience, Current Company is similar to previous internship
- My goal is to learn a lot, have impact, and have better opportunities for future

New Company:
- ~$86.5k per year (~$29k since I'm here for 4 months)
- Remote
- 5 day vacation for 4 months
- 8k to retirement, will match up to 1.5%

Current Company:
- ~$55k per year (~$55k since I am here for 12 months)
- Remote
- 3 week vacation for year"

https://preview.redd.it/rvcc4bzrsft91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd286ed115edc735a0f1b4ca429891c4b081548

For background, I did 1 FPGA-related project the summer between sophomore and Junior year, finishing the first week of school . Took almost the entire summer given how new it was to me and how challenging it was. This past  summer I finished an internship at a startup that builds satellites for providing internet access to rural areas. Learned an insane amount there and did some really meaningful work. I currently have a 3.72 GPA

So I started applying the final day of my internship, and sent out a bunch of applications whenever I really had the time from then (Aug 12) through about September 12 when I received my first offer and was given some details that I was a large fan of (should've continued searching in hindsight, but I'm very happy with what  I got, and I had just about exhausted current entry-level ASIC and FPGA job listings).

I had my first interview the first day of school. Most other interviews would follow the same way. I'd be asked about my resume experience, what interests me about the company, maybe a few questions about my resume experience. But then, I'd be notified that the position is for an immediate hire. To be clear this was by no means frustrating, I found it to be great practice for interviews and it was kind of fun to talk about my experience, since it was a time that I really enjoyed.

I had 6 other interviews that followed the same way. With these interviews, the outcome was generally ""good experience but we don't know if we will have an open position that far in advance"".  One interview seemed like it went well but ended up receiving a rejection email. Was never ghosted by a company after one or more interviews.

One company I had my first interview with around September 1. It went well, and I was waiting for another interview invite when a week later Ericsson wanted an interview. I did that, thought I did really well. They asked some questions about my resume experience and some straightforward SystemVerilog questions.

Later that day, I was emailed asking if I could take a phone call from them. I did so, and was told I did really well in the interview and they wanted to go ahead and extend an offer for the position, as an ASIC engineer (new grad role). I was a bit taken aback, I had never heard of this happening, but I was excited nonetheless. I asked if I could get 4 weeks to continue my search. They said that was fine, they'd send the offer letter when I was ready to decide.

So I continued, and the company I mentioned earlier got back to me the following week wanting a second interview. I did this, and It went well again. Had some really technical questions, some of which I didn't know the answer to. Told them about a pending offer and the upcoming deadline.

Around 2 weeks later, they got back to me wanting to schedule a 3rd interview. I agreed. This was a week before my deadline with Ericsson. In addition, another company reached out wanting an interview. I said fuck it, didn't expect to get too far with them in 1 week. Scheduled it for the next day. Went really well, and I mentioned the deadline and the guy was like ""Oh shit ok we'll figure something out"" (not verbatim lol). Really cool guy with interesting interview questions. The next day I got an email from him saying they were impressed with the interview, and wanted to skip the second stage to fly me out to them, do a day of interviews in their office.

I'm currently in senior design and I really couldn't miss a day that week, in addition to having the interview with the other company that week. I ended up calling it off with them.

A couple days later, the other company got back to me (after scheduling the 3rd interview) and said they were now under a hiring freeze, and they'd like to check in in a couple months.

So, Ericsson. I got the offer details and I was pretty stoked. 95k base with 5k sign on, 5k relocation, 28 days PTO per year, 4% 401k match with 3% company contribution. 6% of salary per year bonus with a performance based multiplier, and another multiplier based on how well the company does (no stock because European-based, some laws I think or something). Base is a little under average for the area and position, but by no means bad. God tier location IMO, a sick rotation plan that'll expose me to ASIC design. I will likely sign later today.

The general ease of my search I'd attribute to the jobs I was searching for, as well as my passion for the subject. Generally, digital design using HDLs like Verilog or VHDL is not done extensively in college, and even then it's done senior year (I'm currently in a class for it this semester). Because of how interested in it I was, I did a project between sophomore and Junior year, which definitely put me ahead a TON. This got me an insane internship which pushed me further ahead, and now here we are.

If you have a passion for one of your subjects, do a project (or several), get an internship doing that same stuff, search for a job doing that stuff. Seems to be a good plan.

Also apologies if the graph isn't very clear, first time using that software

Edit: Just negotiated 100k salary and 10k sign on (+5k relocation still)"
y28gjl,2,2022-10-12,Getting a job in the field I studied in when I have depression/anxiety and after a year of post-breakup joblessness and trying to rebuild myself. How do I approach this? I need your tips.,VisagePaysage,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/y28gjl/getting_a_job_in_the_field_i_studied_in_when_i/,"For context, I am a 32F, live in Canada and have studied landscape architecture.

\-

I am paralyzed. I'm running out of funds and really need to get a job, but my fear is physically painful and I literally find anything else to do during my mostly boring days except what I should be prioritizing which is applying to firms to find work.

In September of 2021, I went through the worst breakup of my life which was more akin to a divorce. It broke me. I was trying to finish my master's at that time and survived, in pain yet numb, until the end of the fall semester in December of 2021. After that, the full realization of what had happened hit me and I completely unraveled. I did reach out to get psychological help through therapy and that came in spurts (according to the sliding scale therapists that I could find). I was hell bent on rebuilding myself and poured my energy into therapy, physical exercise (martial arts) and eating well (which came easily once I started working out regularly). During the winter semester (Jan-April 2022), which was supposed to be my last one, I totally dropped the ball on my final master's project. I was doing better mentally, but uni fell off my radar. I got extensions to finish my project at the end of summer thanks to a doctor's note, but I still couldn't pull through because of my fluctuating mental state (I have a long history of chronic mental illness), my unhealthy coping mechanisms (avoidance, hypersomnia) and my general disinterest in anything that wasn't training (or trying to find a new partner to love) among other things. A few weeks ago, the university kicked me out of the program. They didn't do this in a manner that respects the rules so I am fighting it, but I do understand why they decided to kick me out. Since, September 2021, I have been surviving on student loans (which stopped last April) and the little money I had saved up. Now, the funds ae running out and I can't coast with my head in the sand anymore.

I can work in my field, I don't need my master's diploma (which I am still hoping to complete) for that. The problem is I am scared shitless. I worked a lot in my life, but only once had a ""career"" type job which I burntout from after a year. I love my field, but I enjoy the creative side more and dislike the technical (plans, construction methods, etc.) side of it; that stuff doesn't interest me as much, but it's part of it. Also, as a paid intern, I will probably have to do a lot of the technical stuff which I dislike and, to be frank, am just not good at.

So now, I find myself afraid to apply for jobs in my field mainly because:

1. I only want to work part-time. 3 days a week max so I can ease into it, avoid my depression worsening, try to prevent another burnout and give myself some days to work on my final project for my master's. I doubt anyone would want to hire part-time.
2. I don't know how to sell myself since I am not good at the technical aspects of the job and most employers write things like ""great proficiency in CAD"" and I don't want to lie or oversell myself in the interview only to be found out after.
3. I am afraid people will see that I have depression/anxiety and I will be the ""depressed one"" and, since my field is quite small, the word will get around and I will get fired for not bringing the right attitude to work. Ideally, I would be able to discuss my mental health openly during hiring, but I don't want to be labled as ""disabled"" (because I'm not) and I highly doubt that any employer would want to hire me if I am honest with them (that's just not the world we live in).

Yes, I know all of these fears are based on hypothetical narratives that I have built in my mind, but they are also based on my lived and observed experiences.

I am back in therapy now and working through things, I also am extremely self-ware (or so every therapist tells me) and ""high functioning"" when I am working on projects that stimulate me (i.e. creative and varied things).

My question for you is how do I go about this whole application process? Which information would you reveal and which would you withold with employers and during the hiring process? I'm so afraid, I just want to apply to jobs that I am extremely overqualified for (like easy community sector coordinator jobs, which I would be really good at) because I am afraid of stepping into my field and failing (again). I feel a lot of shame for being paralyzed and afraid because everyone keeps telling me how talented and knowledgeable I am, but I feel like they don't know what they are talking about and that I'm a complete noob. I'd like to feel prepared and confident when I go through interviews."

I want to start by saying I'm really and I mean REALLY grateful for my job and place in life right now, and what I'm about to vent doesn't take away from that...

I have OCD/Anxiety (I can mask really well but in times of deep stress or if im triggered I do have twitches/tics), Insomnia, ADHD, Mood Disorder, &amp; a pending dyslexia diagnosis (psychiatrist wants me to get evaluated but I can't afford the test)

I'm also 28 and have been desperately trying to get into my field and get good pay since I graduated college.

I studied to write &amp; conceptualize for animation, but I knew I wouldn't get a job right out of the gate, what I didn't know was how long or difficult it would be. I couldn't really take internships in my desired field because they don't pay, and the jobs that do pay want you to already have that experience...and at this point I have too many expenses to take anything without pay or part time.

I finally landed a high level graphic design job at a small nonprofit. I like my boss and although I get stressed at times I generally have the flexibility I need to get things done outside of work. 

I get paid 60k gross salary, which I feel is wild to even think of complaining about, and like I said I truly am grateful I mean I'm the most financially stable I've ever been...but my medication costs increased, I had 2 emergency expenses now, and I pay hundreds a month on debt, and I do live alone in a really expensive city. I got a ""good"" deal on a studio apartment but it's still half my paycheck when you factor in utilities and internet. 

I have other pursuits outside of work...for fun I sing/game and make little comedy sketches, I wrote a book I plan to self publish after my artist completes her illustrations for it, and last week I started designing journals and stationary to sell on etsy &amp; Amazon which I'll be launching this month...I know it's inevitable I'll burn out doing all these things, but to be honest I feel more stressed when I'm not doing these things.

I'm constantly anxious at the thought of losing my one source of income and if I'm not trying to invest and work on these things to make more money or be more social I just feel utterly hopeless, picturing myself in 1...5...15..years down the line with no savings still scraping by. 

I feel my mind wandering always thinking of ways I can try and get more money while I'm supposed to be working, and I can tell this and my mental health from all my issues is starting to affect my performance. I already have accommodations so at this point I just am beginning to feel like a useless burden on my employer.

Everyone tells me I'm doing the right things, I went to college, applied and interviewed nonstop for years, and am still applying to higher paying jobs as well..

I want to have a house and a family and dogs someday and for the interim I'd just be so happy to be saving for that while being able to go out and eat or see a movie without having panic attacks about money.

It's just such a vicious cycle because

 money stress --&gt; mental health decline

mental health decline --&gt; money stress

My job didn't make me anxious at all but now I'm really on edge about my performance. I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of posting this but I can't afford my therapist since she went out of network, my friends already know I'm in a dark place and I don't want to unload on them more, and I feel like I'm about to implode and ruin all the good things I have going for me."

I work 10 minutes away from the school I teach at, 6 days a week. I work 4-7 during the week and 9-7 on the weekends (because how else am I supposed to afford unpaid work?)  It's only a gig for the entire month of October, but I feel so burnt out and overwhelmed and it is tanking my lesson plans, my grades for college and most importantly, my mental and physical health. I get 4 ish hours of sleep every night and I wake up in the mornings not wanting to go to teach. Don't get me wrong, I like teaching and I like a majority of my students, but the frustration I get from students not wanting to work or everything falling apart is stressing me out so bad.  I thought that I would love this career and I really thought I would be good at it, but I feel like all I am doing so far is failing. I come home feeling defeated after school and just want to give up. I don't know what's wrong with me, I was so excited to start. It's gotten to the point where my mentor teacher told me that something has to give because I am so tense and stressed to the point where she can see it in my body when I'm up there teaching. I also just had a total breakdown to her today before school and cried. I don't know what to do, someone please tell me that it will get better??? Did everyone struggle like this with teaching?? It seems like everyone in my cohort is doing so much better than I am, and I feel very alone.

(IDK what this rant was but I just wish someone would understand me and tell me I'm not stupid for going into this field.)

**TLDR:** Can't afford to student teach &amp; have to work in order to afford it. Can't balance teaching &amp; work, feel so stressed and overwhelmed. Someone tell me it will get better??"

Looking at entry-level software/web dev jobs, a lot of them mention 1-3 years of experience required or preferred. I'm trying to figure out how to qualify for entry-level jobs when internships don't add up to the required amount of experience. Or does the YOE even matter for entry level?

Hey all, I‚Äôm a Systems engineer freshly graduated with a BSME. My school didn‚Äôt have a mechatronics program so I took a lot of controls/robotics classes and landed this position. Plus some internships in robotics experience helped too. Right now my job is industrial automation for the steel industry and I‚Äôm learning a lot. And I‚Äôm definitely finding what I do engaging and interesting. I‚Äôd like a more research and development roll though and I‚Äôm getting ready to start my Masters in robotics this following fall semester after a break. 

Ultimately I‚Äôd like to end up in a roll where I‚Äôm developing robots and taking part in the design and implementation of new technology. The advice I seek is in the form of a few questions. 

#1. Will industrial automation in steel industry help me reach this goal? 

In my free time mess around with python and C languages and do side projects so I‚Äôm not just working and not building new knowledge.

#2. My job is largely PLC programming. Will being good at this transfer to a more ‚ÄúBoston dynamics‚Äù type industry? 

Not that I specifically want to work for Boston dynamics but I‚Äôd like to contribute to the world and field of robotics by helping design complex systems like these.

#3. I plan to work here maximum 5 years, earning my masters in the mean time which my company will pay for. Is that enough time or too much time? 

From what I‚Äôve gather from a coworker he‚Äôs been here 15 years and says nobody wants to hire an engineer who has 15 years of steel processing training unless it‚Äôs another job in steel so I don‚Äôt want to stay here too long. 

Thanks in advance for any advice it‚Äôs greatly appreciated!"

y2gd53,0,2022-10-12,Self employed and wondering how to manage current and future savings,PlanElectronic3310,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/y2gd53/self_employed_and_wondering_how_to_manage_current/,"I am in my early 30s, self employed and have recently incorporated so I‚Äôm also no longer paying into CPP.  I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed trying to figure out what my strategy should be with my current and future savings. I don‚Äôt own a home/apartment, and while I would love to make that happen somehow in the next 5 years, it feels like a bit of a pipe-dream with the cost of housing in BC.

Currently I have $10k invested in my TFSA which is down 22%. About half of that is in VEQT and I plan to keep DCA-ing into VEQT and stop messing around with any individual stocks. I‚Äôve also been thinking of putting that on pause and committing a decent chunk of money to a GIC and reevaluating things in a years time since things are crazy right now. Not sure if the chances of potential gains outweigh the risk of the market dropping another 20%.

I have another $15k in a HISA which is my safety net savings, and then another $20k in my business account which I don‚Äôt really know what to do with (this is separate from business specific savings). I‚Äôve kept this $20k in the business since it‚Äôs taxed at a lower rate than personal income but it‚Äôs also not doing anything for me sitting in a checking account right now. 

I have the ability to save around $15k-$20k/year.

I guess my question is how should I best utilize this savings? Should I keep contributing as much as I can into my TFSA until it‚Äôs maxed out or should I also utilize my RRSP especially being self employed? There‚Äôs also the First Home Savings Account coming in 2023 which allows $8k/year of contribution room and is deductible from income and also allows transfers from your RRSP.

I feel like I‚Äôm at a fork in the road where housing costs might drop to something more realistic, but there‚Äôs also this opportunity to enter the market while it‚Äôs down. It feels almost impossible to save for both a home and for retirement at the same time in any meaningful way. 

It‚Äôs worth noting my wife (early 30s) also has $20k in savings and the current ability to save $10k/year. She is also new to being able to start saving. It‚Äôs likely her yearly earnings will increase dramatically in the next year or two (income likely doubling as she‚Äôs finishing her internship and has job offers for when it‚Äôs done), but we‚Äôre also hoping to start a family so those increases might just cancel themselves out. 

We currently have no debts and we‚Äôre both in a similar place of not knowing how best to allocate our savings. We both have full trust in one another and are planning to merge all our accounts in the next month or two to make things simpler and more transparent, we just haven‚Äôt gotten around to making an appointment at the bank."

**Intended Major(s):** Finance

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** Didn't take ACT, 1440 SAT but I didn't really study, was supposed to take Oct. but cancelled from Hurricane. Rescheduled for Saturday.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.75/\~\~4\~\~, its close to 4 maybe on the lower side, I haven't calculated it out before. Rank: Not sure because online. Overall I think this is my weakest point.

**Coursework:** Took 1/2 AP's but then the school f\*\*\*ed it up and I could never take the tests so it got cleared, I've been Dual Enrolled at a D1 Uni for 2 years now. 14 Classes total at that school so far, took some regular honors classes in HS. Am registered for 5 more Dual classes next semester at upper levels (3-4000).

**Awards:** Feel a little lacking here because I was always online so not a lot of options. I guess honors society for my high school and honors college for my Dual? If this is a big dealbreaker I could probably rack up a few scholarships from my town, lmk how important please.

**Extracurriculars:** *Food Pantry* for 2 Years, working in procurement and now Finance dept. too, volunteer of course. Working with receipt data/food cost analysis. *Agribusiness Internship* at one of the largest Food producers &amp; grocers nationally, this semester and moving forward. Fits my minor.

Smaller ones maybe: Hurricane Ian (&amp; Irma) cleanup, working individually and with organized groups connected to my church. Was evac-ing old folks during the storm when their house started to flood too, shipped em around on dinghy to higher ground. Volunteer at a Food Forest too, I like that sort of stuff.

Athlete too, tennis at a national competitive level for years now, would be able to play for any spare maybe the best handful of D3 teams. I'm a little shortchanged so to speak because I'm a grade skipped ahead and didn't have as much time to improve. Idk if its worth anything but I also wrote for and operated a finance/investing forum here on reddit. Wasn't too big tho, 3k.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Essays will probably be fairly weak, my life is pretty mundane tbh and I'm fortunately very privileged. LORs, will probably be solid. Other: Legacy at Emory might be something, a parent used to give speeches at conferences post-grad and so forth.

Excuses: I got straight A's for the first 5 semesters of HS, but last semester was really really rough for me. Ended up breaking my arm and then getting stuck in Asia with Covid, missed 1.5 WKs of the semester start (16 WK classes so fast). Parents had to leave state for work and I had to take care of siblings, then school and tennis and I live far from campus, 2 hours to get there and back. Anyway was a nightmare and feel like it ruined my gpa after reading about you bay area kids.

&amp;#x200B;

**Schools:**

UF, NYU, UT, Rochester, Vanderbilt, Georgetown, U. Miami, Middlebury, Colgate. Reaches are Carnegie Mellon, Wash. U would be really cool, and williams. Can't do sports for the D1's. Any school suggestions would be appreciated. Emory however is my #1 pick and where I'm legacy at.

I was like, ""Sigh me up!"" 

And promptly got hit by a brick wall. The pre-interview coding test consisted of 2 questions in python, they were both really hard. 

I kind of answered 1 correctly, the second one I could have probably answered in 3 hours but I had 55 min. The recruiter emailed me a few hours later and told me that they were moving on. 

But I'm not upset, I'm actually really happy. 

Why? Because this is exactly what my research is telling me would happen. If you go on the r/learnprgramming FAQ they tell you all about the process of learning programming, and I am caught in that valley where confidence and competence are both low. 

I knew that they said I needed several hundred hours of independent coding practice before I'm ready to be employed, and this definitively answers it."

My goal is to resume my studies in the next academic year. I still live with my parents so I have all of my necessities met. I applied for scholarships, got rejected in all of them, and I want to try out this path first before I apply to other jobs.

My original plan was to create a portfolio of high quality personal projects and apply for junior positions. But as I joined Facebook groups related to finding jobs in this field, I discovered that some companies offer internships for people who aren't enrolled in any academic programs, although unpaid. From what I've read, experience is much more valuable than a portfolio. Internships are one of the ways to gain experience and I think it's easier to get into than applying for a junior position.

My plan right now is to make a few personal projects until I get accepted into a company as an intern. Paid or unpaid, but I'll try my best to find paid ones. If it's unpaid, it better be worth my time and make me employable when I get out of the company. I could work on my personal projects while on an internship, but I'm afraid that I might get burnt out lol.

I'm currently eyeing this company called Symph since I've heard good things about it. But I'm open to other options as well.

What do you think of my plan? Is it possible to apply for junior roles after a few months of being an intern (paid or unpaid)? Or should I stick to creating personal projects and expand my portfolio, then apply for a junior position?"

Do you normally try to understand every line/function of the code you'll be working on, or do you just try to get a general idea of what's going on?

I'm asking because I got this internship about 2 weeks ago. I was documenting some stuff, now i'm moving into the code itself, and they asked me to read the scripts I'll be maintaining and bring any questions I have to them.

This script imports a good deal of 3rd party libraries and functions, and I was trying to read the documentation for every single one of them that gets used in the code, but it got overwhelming pretty fast. For the first lines I quickly grasped it from the docs. Down below, however, it just references a lot of external stuff and it got overwhelming pretty quick.

That's when I began to wonder if it wouldn't be enough to try and get a general idea of what's going on, because I won't be tinkering with every single line of that. But even then, I got confused as to how I should approach this."

y2nte9,3,2022-10-12,How do I figure out what I actually *want* to do with my life?,Veggieleezy,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/y2nte9/how_do_i_figure_out_what_i_actually_want_to_do/,"I'm 30, pushing 31, I've worked in retail/customer service basically my entire working life. It's killing me inside, but it's also pretty much the only thing I have any experience in. And I'm so regularly reminded by my family/invasive thoughts, I'm not getting any younger, so getting an entry-level job doing pretty much anything else is going to be exponentially harder. The worst part is that I feel like I wouldn't be happy doing most of the entry-level jobs I see, but I'm drastically unqualified for jobs in the fields I've always told myself I wanted to be in. And anymore I don't even know if I actually want to do that or if I've just told myself that I want it.

I've always told myself I wanted to work in media/production. I even went to a prominent art/media/communications school to get my degree. The best ""job"" I ever had was while I was interning my last semester at a YouTube channel as their office/preproduction intern (I even got a friend of mine in the same spot when it was her turn). It was great; every day was doing something different, I was working with cool and fun people, some of whom I'm still in touch with today, I got to work on interesting projects, and I got to put myself into my work. I got to express myself because they wanted my authentic voice and opinions on things. The only job I've had where that's been the case. Every other job I've just been another ""how can I help you?"" NPC.

The problem is that I was dealing with a lot of unprocessed trauma, anxiety, impostor syndrome, and depression while I was in college, so I never felt like I belonged there, so I never really did anything because I was constantly questioning why I was even there in the first place. As a result, I have no portfolio or credits to speak of despite my degree.

Ever since I've done basically only part-time retail/customer service jobs because I never felt like I deserved to go after something I didn't put the effort into when I should have, even though I had a lot of blocks keeping me from doing them (or was I really just that lazy and just didn't want to do anything?), and now it's too late to start back over because I'm already 30 and who's gonna want to hire a 30-year-old entry-level guy with no professional (or even amateur) experience in a media position?

I don't even know what I ultimately want to *do* for a living, I just know that I have to get out of retail/customer service ASAP and into something that at least won't make me miserable. The problem there is I don't even know what would actually make me happy anymore. Do I actually want to work in the field I got my degree in or did I just go there to prove that I could and squander every opportunity that was available like an idiot?

Should I just accept that customer service/retail is pretty much the only thing I'm qualified for? Because I have no goddamn idea how to translate my skills anywhere else, and everywhere else I look is just pretty much the same thing but at least it would be full-time so I could actually make some money?

Or the bigger question, how do I figure out what would actually make me happy? I know I like to make people laugh and entertain them, and everyone always says that I'm good at what I do in terms of comedy, but I don't see a way to translate that into a living. I'm not a standup, I'm not a character comic, I'm not a particularly skilled musician, I'm not a great actor (I always say I'm a clown who can act) or singer, and I have no idea how I would even work as a solo act. All I can think of is some fusion of Puddles Pity Party, Clownvis Presley, and the Rat Pack, but I'm still just one guy. I've always found I'm at my funniest playing off other people and playing straight for them to enhance their laughs. But how the hell do you turn that into a living? The only other thing I can think of would be to propose teaming up with a friend of mine who's had some moderate success, maybe play Dean Martin to his Jerry Lewis to enhance his characters and routines, but that feels like I'd be trying to ride his coattails, and he works just fine on his own, he absolutely doesn't need my help. Not to mention he lives in a different city.

My dad always says I have the mind for coding and programming, and I like the idea, I think I'd just need to get over some hurdles there. It seems like a solid option, but again, by the time I'd be good enough at any of them to be hirable, I'm already in my mid-30s and basically un-hirable as a beginner.

I don't know anymore. I'm sorry for rambling, this kind of got away from me, but it's something I stress about quite a bit and it's becoming increasingly stressful as I get older and have no clear idea where I'm going or how secure my future will be. Have a nice night."

y2pvep,4,2022-10-13,I'm tired of coding interviews. I don't think I will ever land a full time software engineer job. What should I do?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y2pvep/im_tired_of_coding_interviews_i_dont_think_i_will/,"TL;DR; I don't think I can be employed as a software engineer but I have no other job skills for other industries. Feels like I'm a complete failure.

I just took a Codesignal online assessment for an internship position but I could only solve the first question. I used to get like 2.5 out of 4 questions on practice exams but I couldn't come up with the solutions, so I just rage-quitted the exam and feel like a total failure now.

I graduated with a Computer Science major from a U.S university last year but had to return to my home country due to legal issues (South Korea). Anyway, I started job hunting in Korea 2 months after graduation for entry-level software engineer positions but no luck so far. I struggled a lot with Korean high school Mathematics and never enjoyed it when I was in high school. And I screwed up the Korean university entrance exam several times because of the exam stress related to Mathematics stuff. But at the university, I had no problems getting decent grades in mathematics or computer science courses. I easily got A+ when I was studying at a Korean university, and even scored first place in some math courses among all classes when I transferred to the U.S university. But coding interviews are different stories. I solved more than 400 problems on platforms like Leetcode and others. But I still struggle with coding questions. It's like 'Why the hell I couldn't come up with the solution during the interview'.

I have ADHD and take meds for more than 10 years but it's still difficult for me to solve interview questions in a limited time. I still have nightmares of failing the exam, just like I used to have in high school.

I can easily pass the coding interviews for tier-2 companies, mostly startups, but I don't think I can be accepted to Top Tier companies like Google and Korean Big Tech companies (Kakao for instance). And even I clear the first tech interview or Online Assessment of lower companies, I get rejected during the second round because the entry-level job market is much more fucked up in Korea compared to Western countries. I asked for feedback from the companies I've been rejected a couple of times and they usually responded ""You have good skills blah blah.. but we had to move on to other candidates with work experience."" Yes, they just say sugar-coated responses not to make an applicant annoyed so I don't give a damn.

I don't have an extreme passion or love for coding but I somehow feel happy when I get the code working. But I'm sick of solving algorithm problems and never enjoyed it, although I had no problems with Computer Science subjects and programming stuff when I was in the university.

I regret choosing a Computer Science major when I faced reality after I graduated from the university but I have no skills related to other industries.

I have quite good but not highly gifted IQ scores ranging around 130-135 (SD 15). My teachers and professors used to tell me they think I have high intelligence but now I realized all of them were lying.

I'm trying to build a SaaS myself to make some money, but I can't think of any profitable business ideas. I have no ideas how to make living as a software engineer. Honestly, I don't want to live as a software engineer for the rest of my life forever. I planned to get employed as an engineer, have some work experience of 3 to 5 years, quit the engineering job, and start my own business. But I can't even start with the first step of my career. I really hate my ADHD."

Also there are so many things going on there concerning our future like internship programmes, which made me see how little l know about life and how lost I'm probably going to be in the future.

Even socially I feel isolated as I fail to form deeper connections with my friends and have thoughts like they secretly hate me, and when I see others being close to their friends and actually have charismatic personalities I feel bad because of my quiet, boring and unenthusiastic personality. I'm not keen on improving either because I have no motivation to work for anything.

All this has made me feel not only dejected but also weak and think that if I feel so bad over such trivial matters I'll never make it in the real world. I don't know what I'll be in life, am really scared and can use emotional support"

As a guy who's starting his career, I want to work and learn. On top of that, the stipend was low, 10k.

So I applied and got another internship, the stipend is double and I think the work would also be better.

I've got a lot of questions, kindly help this freshie

* Should I give an excuse like family reasons or just straight up say I'm joining someplace else?
* Should I send an email to HR or send a message on MS Teams message? What should the message be?
* Also, the current position is SDE Intern and the offer I've got is Backend Dev Intern. Will that affect my career/future?
* I also interviewed at one more place, the results aren't out yet. Should I inform them?
* If I accept this offer letter and I receive one from the other place(stipend is same + FTE Offer), would I be able to accept it?
* There are tons of questions but I can't think of them right now

Kindly help &lt;3, and give advice or share your experience/"

Now, after going through 3 interviews the interviewer got back to me and said that I got the offer, but there was a catch. I was told that I‚Äôd be put on probation for 3 months and then if I pass I can get a full-time offer, I was pretty excited to hear that until she told me that the probation period would be unpaid. I was pretty taken aback, why would they list the position as paid then? It feels like they were leading me on or something and it smells like a breeding ground for exploitation.

Am I correct? does this actually smell like they want to exploit someone for free? I mean, the pay they originally listed was not even for $35/month for god's sake, but now they said it'd be unpaid?? I mean I guess it's fine right as long as I have a chance at a full-time position? hahaaaaaaaa.

Now they want to hear back from me as soon as possible (and by that I mean in 3 hours), I don't even know if I want to take the offer now because it sounds like an exploitation, but am I naive for considering it because of the full-time offer? (but still it pissed me off more than anything, honestly), or is this just how it is in this industry? "

Is this a downgrade? Because it was very easy to get. I feel the entry is very easy.

I got to interview at a few top startups (databricks, rubrik) /quant shops (jane street, smaller quant shop) for the following summer but I bombed all of them due to lack of preparation. I feel that if I was prepared enough, I could have gotten offers at least from one of the companies given I passed their resume screens/OAs. They're all definitely an upgrade over Google.

Now, I have an amazon intern offer. It was so easy to get, much easier than my previous opportunities. I really do appreciate it.

But, I feel if I go to Amazon, it'll be a disadvantage because I won't even pass new grad resume screens for top quants/startups which I did now with 2x Google on my resume. A lot of past amazon interns having been facing this lately. I'm worried that instead of being neutral having amazon would have a negative impact on my resume given those companies are so strict w resume screens.

I'm going to keep looking but I'd really like some opinion on my situation. I want to prepare and aim high. I just don't want to be stopped at the door.

edit: i graduate in 2024, being in a 5y bachelor + master program."

However- The problem is that my current employer has a 90 day notice period which isn‚Äôt very negotiable.
So lets pick the best case scenario:
Offer received mid november; notice period till mid february, join McK full time as March begins.
I need to leave for masters in 5 months and considering indian notice periods, would need to resign at McKinsey in 2-3 months of joining .
I am sure this will look terrible on my part and I‚Äôm wondering if this‚Äôll become a problem later for re-joining McKinsey.

Should I rather tell the partner I‚Äôm interviewing with about my admit and explore whether they can extend a deferred employment offer instead?
i.e. Instead of an Indian office in 2023, an american office in 2024?
Or maybe discuss if I can be hired as an intern for 4 months?

I feel like they‚Äôll ding me directly if i tell im leavin in half an year‚Ä¶

Or can i wait until i get an offer and then negotiate starting date with HR for after a year?

I‚Äôm extremely fortunate to have an amazing mom and dad who have helped me tremendously throughout my life and have been able to cover the main expenses such as my tuition. 

Now, this last summer I worked at a mortgage broker full time for an internship and it was such an amazing experience, as the skills I was able to attain were invaluable. It was a remote position so I would always be home, and after I was done for the day I wouldn‚Äôt do much other than go hangout with my friends if they weren‚Äôt busy. I didn‚Äôt find it boring but it was kind of getting annoying doing the same thing everyday, just sitting in my house during the week. 

Fast forward to now, I live away for school and I am out of the house all the time, working out, going to class, walking around the city to get a few things, meeting new people etc. It just feels like my days are a lot more productive than they were in the summer. My plan after school is to live at home for a few years as I would essentially have zero major expenses and would end up saving a lot but my days would just be boring, and sort of unfulfilling in terms of productivity just like it was in the summer. If I were to not choose that route, I could possibly find a job in a major city such as Toronto where my productivity would be very high, and my days wouldn‚Äôt be as boring. I would be able to meet new people, walk around the city just to get minor things such as groceries, go to cafes etc. By doing this I think I would be a bit more happy but I would forfeit the chance to have zero expenses and save a lot before my late 20‚Äôs. 

Any suggestions or advice on what I should do? I am leaning towards just staying at home as I believe my future is more important than my early 20‚Äôs gratification I guess, but I‚Äôm open to having my mind changed.

Lets just say he has ego, so when I say stuff like ‚ÄúI was considering doing this and that‚Äù for advice, he tells me stuff like ‚Äúwell yeah, but what I‚Äôm doing its harder‚Äù... which, obviously it's true since I just graduated, but man, I‚Äôm the only person in my team programming the Android app, and I take care of the API and database as well, my bosses are happy with me, why everytime i speak with him has to be this ego competition with achievements.  


I didn't go the normal way of getting a CS degree either, I studied 2 years on alternative education to get here, while he went to uni. I think this is important to mark because today he told me they hired someone great and said ‚Äúhe is just like you‚Äù, maybe I‚Äôm just sensitive but that sounded really derogatory.  


This isnt the only friend I have behaving like this but its the closest encounter I had these days so I thought of giving some context.

So after this, do you guys have any advice on how to handle ego so I dont feel less than others while also being able to focus on my projects?

y3asrm,3,2022-10-13,"I've got my first job potentially lined up, but I'm not sure how to feel about it. Advice?",irjax,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y3asrm/ive_got_my_first_job_potentially_lined_up_but_im/,"Some background: I'm in my final semester at a state school. I have no internships, my projects are pretty meh, and no LC skills. I do have a good GPA though. 

I started applying last month and haven't had much luck. I've been talking to this small business consultant company that is looking for a developer. I've talked to their IT director three times. He seems to like me and I think they will probably end up giving me an offer. 

Basically, the company sells a LAMP web application to auto dealerships that's meant to provide business insights. It has about 8000 users. It's a legacy software, and they are looking to do two main things. First, they want to update it to be on the newest version of PHP. Then, they want to completely move it to a MERN app. But they need a developer to help with this, because no one there knows how to code. 

Pros

\- They are willing to pay market rate for a new grad, I live in a LCOL area and the range they gave was acceptable.

\- I'd get the opportunity to work with a popular and relevant tech stack, and I'd be getting payed to learn it. 

\- I'd get the opportunity to modernize a legacy software, which is pretty good experience and would probably set me up for something better down the road. 

\- I'd have my own office. 

\- It's a job. Which is better than no job, I guess. 

Cons

\- I'd be the only developer. The IT director said he eventually wants to put together an agile team, but initially it would just be me. 

\- I don't know LAMP or MERN. I've been upfront about this, and I told him that initially there will be a learning curve where I may not be able to contribute much for the first few months, which he understood. 

\- It's a really small company that's looking to invest more into their technology. Which is a good thing and all, it's just that I'm not super confident in myself. If I were to be hired onto a team at a more ""proven"" company I'd feel better about it going in. I just worry that I may end up in a situation where I'm completely useless and get fired or some shit. 

Overall, it's not really an ideal job for me, and I'm going to keep on looking for something else over the next two months. But if I graduate and they end up being the only company willing to hire me, should I go for it? 

My gut tells me yes, that I should just take the job and even if it ends up being terrible I could at least get the experience. But what if I just end up sucking and get fired after a few months? Then I'd be several months out of school without any experience worth putting on my resume. I'm just dealing with a lot of uncertainty about it and could use the advice of this community."

I'm an out-of-state student.

As the title states, I've found out today that a lot of my plans for the next year or so may be in jeopardy because I thought that completing my degree requirements faster would make my last quarters at UCI more flexible. That is apparently not the case, quite the opposite in fact.

Starting from the beginning, I always knew I wanted to go study abroad in Japan for at least a quarter since I was in freshman year. I got into a program for sophomore year, but it was cancelled due to COVID. I then applied again and got into the same program again for junior year, but I then got an internship for summer that the study abroad would overlap with, so I cancelled again. Now, I want to apply for it again for my senior year, but, that ostensibly being my last year, I was required to make an appointment with an ICS academic counselor first. That appointment was today.

We talked a bit about how going abroad my senior year would work. Then I, being oh so proud of myself, told the counselor that I, in fact, could finish my degree requirements by the end of my 3rd year, so there shouldn't be any problems with going abroad before graduating, especially since I wasn't planning on taking any credits that needed to be transferred here while abroad. I could not have been more wrong. Apparently UCI hates having student stay after they finish their degree requirements, let alone letting students go abroad with their requirements finished. They told me that as it stands, they were going to make me graduate at the end of my 3rd year.

With that revelation, I've now gone from slightly worried that I wouldn't be able to go study abroad after all, to extremely stressed about my future. My plans have always involved me graduating in my 4th year. Putting the study abroad aside for now, I don't even know if my internship is going to let me attend anymore, since they expect you to go back to school for at least a quarter after the internship, and I was really banking on getting a return offer from there. I've also decided that I wanted to do research, and I was planning to finish the courses I'm taking this quarter before emailing professors, since the courses I'm taking is very related to what I want to research, but I don't even think I have time to wait anymore. I already know I want to do grad school, but with covid making half my time here online, and my other half spent in huge courses where professors have little chance to know students well, the only professor I can confidently get a recommendation letter from is my Japanese professor. 

All of this because I decided to work hard, and get my requirements done quickly. 

I could have spent the past two summers back home in Taiwan, visiting my family and friends. Instead I stayed at UCI and did 16 units each summer, lusting over checkmarks over my Degreeworks and my 4.0 major GPA.

I honestly feel like I'm being punished for being diligent, though it's definitely my fault too, for not knowing this beforehand.

I'm at a loss here, I honestly don't know what I should do. I'm waiting for the email from the counselor who I talked with today, she's supposed to send me a petition form or something for studying abroad. If I do get to do the study abroad, then everything would be fine, since it's still taking courses after the internship, it's a research program, and I get good material for if I want to do grad school. 

But what if the petition fails? How can I delay my graduation time? My only idea right now is that since I haven't chosen a specialization for my CS major yet, I can choose one that I basically haven't taken any classes in. That way it would be impossible for me to complete my requirements by the end of my 3rd year. But now that the counselors know about my situation, would they even pass me on that?

I seriously doubt it, but has anyone gone through a situation like this before? I could really use some advice right about now.

If you've gotten this far, thanks a lot for reading. I hope everything will turn out OK.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr 

Took too many courses, might be forced to graduate early. That was not part of the plan and may cancel my summer internship, make it extremely difficult to do research, and serious hurt my grad school odds."

When I entered college last year, I was super motivated and applied to a bunch of CS clubs, only to get rejected by all of them. That was super demotivating for me and I kind of gave up after that. I didn't do any leetcode problems, participate in any clubs, or make any projects. The only thing I managed to do was to keep up my 4.0 GPA and induct in my school's CS honors society.

I really want to get an internship for this summer but I'm not sure that will be possible, especially since the only good things on my resume are from high school and I absolutely suck at technical interviews. I know the most logical thing would be to grind leetcode problems, but I honestly don't have it in me to do that, as I'm already very behind in my classes and struggling to keep up.

The next best thing would probably be to find startups in my area and email a bunch. That's what I did to get my high school internship. However, any internship I get through that approach would probably be remote and relatively unstructured. I feel like I didn't get as much out of my hs internship as I could have because it was remote and super unstructured.

So I'll definitely keep the startups idea as a backup, but if possible, I would really like to intern at a company that has a more structured program for interns, preferably in-person or at least hybrid (I'm fine with any location and would be willing to relocate). Does anyone have ideas for how I could find companies that accept sophomores and don't really require technical interviews, or at least have technical interviews that are relatively easy? I would highly appreciate it!"

I'm now 23 and have made good progress in managing my mental health in a lot of areas of my life such as social and academics. 

One thing I have not been able to master is intense anxiety around careers and work. During my bachelors I  applied and interviewed for internships at a very bad time with my mental health and basically got nothing and being the idiot I was I was too insecure to ask for feedback. After graduating from my bachelor in 2020 I was initially optimistic but I found that job-hunting emotionally drained me and was extremely challenging for my self-esteem. The conditions of Lockdown really didn't help and I was trapped in my childhood bedroom extremely depressed, burned-out, and unhappy, with no social contact and basically crumbling under the pressure. Long story short, I took a random job for eight months, did manage to do some upskilling, and then started a 2-year masters basically because it was the only thing that would give me some relief from how much mental distress I was in. 

 I'm now on the second year of my masters and the prospects of jobs and internships are looming again. I'm now insecure about all my peers effectively being 3 years ahead of me, still no relevant work experience  (although I have relevant voluntary and academic experience) and I have (without being facetious) trauma around my previous experiences of job-hunting.  Even casually scrolling through job adverts makes me feel anxious and depressed.

Any advice or tips on how to help me get out of this mental block would be much appreciated. I know my conditions are more favourable this time around and I really think the biggest thing holding me back is myself."

Dublin has been my target for quite a while, but truth be told I'm not quite sure how the cost of living works out.

I was expecting maybe a 15% drop, but now I'm more curious of real examples of people with that SE2 3-4 years of experience range have actually made, and specifically the city rent costs of people who have been in the range of ‚Ç¨58-68k/yr. if anyone could help out in either facet I'd really appreciate it."

I talked to a couple friends, and they said it‚Äôs fine, no one keeps record, the parents are just worried about making sure there kiddos are having fun and getting them extra Curricular activities.

Now the thing is, I feel like I want to do more and take it up notch in the creative industry. I‚Äôm a tech-savvy guy, but I‚Äôm not good at Math, so I decided to find a career wherein I can apply both my creative skillset and knowledge in the tech industry. This is where I decided to push through into UX/UI Design.

I enrolled in the Google UX Design course in Coursera so that I could get a good understanding of the basics and fundamentals and eventually learn how to use Figma and Adobe XD. So, for the people in this industry, I‚Äôd just like to ask for some guidance moving forward:

1. On average, how much do people make in job positions in UX/UI?

2. Will my background on Marketing and previous work experience in graphic design/copywriting help me land a job easier when I start looking? Planning once I finish the course, I‚Äôll start making my case study and fix up my portfolio.

3. (For people in the Philippines only) Would UX/UI internships in PH companies help me in getting more job offers? Or would it be easier to apply directly to both local and international companies?

4. Aside from Figma and Adobe XD, what other applications should I learn?

I took a total of 31 credits at GSU as a first year. Then I transferred here while applying for 15 credits. Linear and Physics were kicking my ass and I had to withdraw from physics. Now I‚Äôm taking linear, CS, ECE 2020, and ECE 1100 but I won‚Äôt talk about 1100 cause it‚Äôs just a discovery studio. I‚Äôm barely scraping a 70 in linear and I just bombed the most recent midterm. Pretty sure I got like a 30 on it. CS was easy at first cause I took APCS. But the thing that‚Äôs got me confused is the checkstyle and seriously tanking my grade. And ECE 2020, I‚Äôm failing with a 30% cause the prof is horribly unorganized. I failed the last test by a large margin from the error so it‚Äôs not completely his fault. However, I‚Äôm gonna try to put more effort into his class and go to his office hours. 

I love engineering and learning about it. But I getting those grades up are getting more and more difficult. I keep telling myself that grades don‚Äôt mean shit and it‚Äôs about what I know and the experience. But deep down, I haven‚Äôt fully accepted it. Like how do I get my first internship when they see that the only experience I have is Java, soldering, and restaurant jobs. Deeper down, I feel like a failure and regret my decision of transferring. I came with a 3.8 just to fail the only 3 classes I‚Äôm taking."
y3ldcn,2,2022-10-14,Need advice on if I should quit my job before I have a new one?,MediumSun3322,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y3ldcn/need_advice_on_if_i_should_quit_my_job_before_i/,"So I‚Äôve been working at my job for over a year and a half. A lil backstory I graduated in 2020 so I couldn‚Äôt get a job for a year. I originally applied for an internship at my company because although I had multiple internships I didn‚Äôt have corporate experience so I was ok with starting from the bottom. I didn‚Äôt get the first internship, but they still thought I was a good candidate so they wanted me to interview for two more teams, &amp; both teams ended up wanting me to join their team. I accepted one but before I even started my internship they wanted to hire me for a full time position. My goal since graduating has been to become an assistant buyer so in my mind I thought this position would be a bigger and faster step to becoming an AB. After about a month of me working there the grad associates and interns started. The grad associates are promised an AB position after their program is finished in the summer which I didn‚Äôt find out until a few months after I started working there and sure enough the grad associate that was on my team is now my AB even though I started working there before her and we were both in the same training sessions not to mention we both graduated from the same top fashion school but I graduated a year before her. When this happened it really hurt my feelings because I always made it clear I wanted to be an AB since my interviews and my manager never said anything about it she just popped up in our meetings one day. This was the first straw for me, it really bothered me but I didn‚Äôt say anything because what could I say? So once I reached a year of working I noticed there was an AB position open so I asked my manager to apply and she said no and that she knows I can do the job but I need to communicate more which I agree with because I am a quiet introverted person BUT in my position there‚Äôs really nothing to speak on and if there is it‚Äôs few and far in between. And she also mentioned that it takes 2 years to get promoted. Which clearly it doesn‚Äôt because grad associates are promoted within 4 mos. I even asked if I could apply to the GA program and she said that would be like taking a step back. (I later found out that they were having trouble filling this position because all the recent grads they were interviewing didn‚Äôt want to work in a hybrid setting :(, I also later found out that someone who previously had my position applied for the GA program and is now an AB). So this made me upset but I was willing to work for it. At this time I had just joined the mentor program at work and my mentor was helping me with ways to speak up more and network. I met with a few AB‚Äôs for advice and I think that‚Äôs when I realized that I would of been better off with the internship because 9.99/10 I could of applied somewhere else to be an AB with that experience. That‚Äôs when I started to feel like I was bamboozeled by taking this position. I‚Äôm already a year behind because of Covid and now I feel even more behind. I thought I didn‚Äôt have enough experience to be an AB but now I realize I have plenty so that‚Äôs when I started to apply to jobs externally while also simultaneously going after a position at my current job. Another AB position at my job becomes available and once again I ask to apply and my manager says no for the same reasons. I ask for examples of what I can do better and her examples were bs. Nothing really specific just things coming from the top of her head. If there were things to talk about I would say it but I don‚Äôt feel the need to just talk to talk. I soon found out that my AB was working on speaking up as well, this is when I started getting angry because the only thing that‚Äôs keeping me from getting a promotion is something my AB needs to work on too. At this time I was interviewing for another job. A few months passed and I‚Äôve done like 9 interviews for 3 different teams and I‚Äôm just waiting to hear back but I‚Äôm pretty confident. While I‚Äôm waiting I noticed another position available at my current job. I was hesitant to ask to apply but my mentor convinced me and I did. My manager said yes but she has to get her managers approval and her manager says no for the same reasons but it‚Äôs annoying because this manager works remote so she never around to hear me talk. At this point I‚Äôm defeated and I no longer have motivation to do anything for this team. I had the opportunity to express my feelings to my managers boss I end up breaking down crying because the situation bothers me so much and has for a long time now. She basically said she knows it‚Äôs unfair but unfortunately it‚Äôs bad timing:(. That conversation had me crying consistently for a week because I realized I have been wasting my time in this position and at this time I had been waiting to hear back from the other job for a month. They finally reached out to me the next week and I thought I would finally be able to leave my current job only to find out that senior level ppl resigned so they are still restructuring and they don‚Äôt know which AB positions are available or when they will be. I had spent two months interviewing and one month waiting to hear back and I got this news right before my 25th birthday :(. They did say there is another AB position available but I‚Äôd have to do more interviews. I go on vacation for my birthday and I come back only to find out that someone who has my position and has only been working at my job for TWO MONTHS got the AB position that I couldn‚Äôt even get a chance to apply to and that was the straw that broke the camels back for me that I put my two weeks in. I‚Äôm begging to just submit my resume to a job that I know I‚Äôm more than qualified for it‚Äôs so frustrating and I feel like no one understands me. My manager and I talked and I broke down crying in front of her too because this is so upsetting for me and I can‚Äôt hold my tears whenever someone asks me about it. I ended up telling her I‚Äôll let her know by the end of the week if I want to quit so I guess I‚Äôm asking for advice or what you would do if you were me?"

I'm a Y2 CS student, thinking about what I want to pursue in the future... Most of my friends are pursuing SWE jobs/internships but I'm kinda not feeling being a SWE and working the rest of my life in a tech company...

At the same time, I'm thinking of pursuing further studies in the field of AI/Algorithms. And so, I'd like to hear from any seniors who've done Dissertation or FYP in Computing. I also have some questions so it'd be good if someone could give me some insights!

1. What is selection for Dissertation like? Is it difficult? 

2. I'm aware that it can replace the 12MCs of internship, but should I still try to get an internship in industry regardless for the experience?

3. Do I need to/should I do UROP before Dissertation?

4. What are some ways to find research to undertake/look at previous projects? The link on the website doesn't seem to work...

I would also appreciate any advice from seniors regarding this as I'm just kinda clueless right now ahahah. Thanks in advance and thanks for reading!"

Any advice?,Parking_Resource_113,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y3o79g/transitioning_from_marketing_to_the_uxui_industry/,"I recently graduated college with a degree in Marketing. I originally planned to work in a multinational company or in sales, but I decided to go with the creative side of marketing and got a job as a copywriter/graphic designer. Been doing this current job for 6 months, but I have almost 2 years of work experience in total.

Now the thing is, I feel like I want to do more and take it up a notch in the creative industry. I‚Äôm a tech-savvy guy, but I‚Äôm not good at Math, so I decided to find a career wherein I can apply both my creative skillset and knowledge in the tech industry. This is where I decided to push through into UX/UI Design.

I enrolled in the **Google UX Design Course** in Coursera so that I could get a good understanding of the basics and fundamentals and eventually learn how to use Figma and Adobe XD. So, for the people in this industry, ***I‚Äôd just like to ask for some guidance moving forward:***

1. On average, how much do people make in job positions in UX/UI?
2. Will my background in Marketing and previous work experience in graphic design/copywriting help me land a job easier when I start looking? Planning once I finish the course, I‚Äôll start making my case study and fix up my portfolio.
3. *\[FOR PEOPLE IN THE PHILIPPINES\]* Would UX/UI internships in PH companies help me in getting more job offers? Or would it be easier to apply directly to both local and international companies?
4. Aside from Figma and Adobe XD, what other applications should I learn?

Hoping people can help me here. I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!"

I (30m), have been going through my belongings, and I found an album of photos of my ex and I, it really dredged up feelings between being a ball of wasted potential and an idiot without prospects or a clue of how to find them.

I'm pretty introverted and have very few people I connect to on a regular basis, and most connections I make aren't much more than shallow or always at arms length, and I don't talk to many people outside of my work, not as in co-workers, but the people I see due to my line of work.

Every time I feel like I'm going in the right direction or moving in a way to build myself up, it falls apart like a sandcastle on the beach, in 2020 I went from having the highest number of close friends I feel I've ever had, working a steady job with room for growth and promotion, having a girlfriend of almost 5 years, and working on a college degree, to going through 3 different homes, 3 different jobs, losing my financial aid, losing a deposit on an engagement ring, and maybe having one to two friends that are closer than arms length.

I feel like every bit of progress I made in what feels like the right direction was undone and I wasted time and effort with no payoff.

I was with my ex for about 5 years, we had been living together for roughly a year of that, things were sometimes rocky but at a point I started to get some red flags then lockdown for COVID happened, and she left to spend the week with her parents, when she got back she made some more comments what threw up more red flags, and I confronted it, we split, she left again to stay with her parents for a few days, and I was stuck in an apartment for a week in a city I moved to for her, away from my family, friends, and everything I cared about, and I was stuck alone in an apartment without nearby friends or anything to do due to lockdown, and I had been let go from my job due to COVID downsizing. Less than 24hrs after we broke up she was in our hometown sleeping with one of my (then) close friends, she tried to pursue a relationship with them, they turned her down, and (I don't have an exact timeline) she started a relationship with another person in the same friend group, I know within a day of her returning they had been cuddling in the apartment, in front of me, eating the food I paid for and cooked, without thinking anything of it, which is how I found out what was going on.

When we broke up she told me she didn't cheat on me but she would a have if the opportunity had presented itself, I don't know why she told me that, and I don't think I ever will, but it's something that has cut me to my core, and I don't know if I'll ever truly trust anyone ever again. I've had some pretty bad relationships, walked in on people in beds together, and been lied to before, but this one somehow hurt the worst.

It really felt lie I was a stepping stone in her life, and the moment she felt she could grab something better I was discarded after being used.

Earlier this year someone I know from that friend circle told me she said I wasn't physical enough, and that's something that ended a relationship I had been in before and I've always been insecure about it and this made that worse tenfold. That relationship and how it ended is something I made aware to her when we were in the dating phase before putting a label on our relationship.

I worked a really bad retail job that fed into my depression and the home life I had at the time fed into alcoholism for about 3 or 4 months, I got therapy and lost some friends due to this.

I left the retail job for a better job, from which I was fired due to some inter-company politics, so I returned to a job that I honestly love I've been with this job since, but I feel this job has no future moving forward and feel like a burden on the family I'm living with.

I feel like my job is dead end and I live paycheck to paycheck, and when I interview for new prospective jobs I seem to always miss the cut, I'm a semester away from an associates degree in a field where that degree doesn't even open internships.

I'm truly at a loss on how to move forward or pickup the pieces of my life, and really I'm just here to vent it's been in the chamber for awhile and this is what flipped the switch, so here we are.

No, the line about being in the chamber isn't about suicide it is just a term of phrase.

I hate hugs and I am not a physical person, but man do I really feel like I need one for what may be the first time in my life."

I am currently doing an internship with a big  company. I joined about a month ago and I have been mostly learning about the infrastructure system here. My team deals with all the infrastructure devices to ensure the connection to our client works . Our department used many different types of hardwares and softwares. My supervisor is quite busy and doesnt have much time for me.Over my time here so far, my team has been mainly dealing with patch update and migration. Since I think I have gotten the hang on the things here, I want to try and initate areas of improvement and make an impact here while still learning ofc!

We uses mostly on prem services with only one or two cloud services mainly for management purposes. There has already been some automations in place like alerting the any non-normal status of the devices to our management software.

Looking for suggestions on areas I can focus on where I can you know help save time/save costs/save manpower etc . Thank you so much!"

I just wanted to ask anyone out there albeit who switched from healthcare disciplines or any others really into computer science or tech, how was it? Do you like it now? What made you change? Any advice for someone young, naive and unsure of their career choices and prospects? Is tech as lucrative as social media platforms make them out to be?

Obviously if i post on this sub it is because i Have had crippling social anxiety. I am usually very quiet shy and reserved.
I couldn‚Äôt give an oral presentation and was doing everything in my power to run away from those, from my fears and my insecurities. 

Well that was until today.

The teacher asked us to speak in front of everyone and present our compagny. it was all volontary. No assignment or grade. She didnt coerced anybody into doing it.

I initially wanted to go for it but then my negative thoughts came back. ¬´¬†I am so boring¬† people will be bored to death¬†¬ª ¬´¬† i will be shy and not be able to speak¬†¬ª ¬´¬† stay sit, don‚Äôt stand up, you‚Äôre not made for it¬†¬ª.

all of those thoughts were appearing inside my head and i decided at first to not go.

I don‚Äôt know what happened but then i said to myself ¬´¬†fuck it man, if you‚Äôre not going you Will regret it and you‚Äôll still have this victim mentality. you don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre shy or if you‚Äôre boring people, this is not about them, it‚Äôs about you you against you.¬†¬ª

I raised my hand and i actually went for it.

Well it didn‚Äôt go well. I shaked a lot, had a black out, didnt know what to say and i noticed people being embarassed. But you know what, the teacher told me i done a great job and everyone applaused, twice.
And i dont care, i fucking won the battle against me, against my fear i was doing everything in my power to avoid

I am in the subway and so satisfied. If i didn‚Äôt go i would be regretting now, as always.

I know it is not much. My classmates were confortable but they went by 3 and i was the third person to stand up and i was all alone.
It is still not much as there are a lot of people doing it alone usually and everywhere around the wolrd but at the end of the day it is not about comparing yourself to other people but to yourself only.

**LOR:** I have three from former/current teachers, and one from another teacher who didn't teach me in class but guided me through science fair. I think the first three are good/above average (6-7/10), but the last one should be really good. (9/10 or 10/10.) Can't be sure because I waived FERPA.

**Essays:** my commonapp essay is pretty good I think, I wrote it about how my little sister inspired me to start my science fair project, learn on my own how to code (my school didn't have a class), and then my struggles during the fair: how my school tried to stop me from going, how I went anyway, how I changed my presentation to the judges at the last second to be more authentic, etc. Basically, its about how I overcame the various challenges that I encountered, and how it made me less afraid to do more things outside the box.

Advice?",irjax,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y40nwn/ive_got_my_first_job_potentially_lined_up_but_im/,"I've got my first job potentially lined up, but I'm not sure how to feel about it. Advice?

Some background: I'm in my final semester at a state school. I have no internships, my projects are pretty meh, and no LC skills. I do have a good GPA though. 

I started applying last month and haven't had much luck. I've been talking to this small business consultant company that is looking for a developer. I've talked to their IT director three times. He seems to like me and I think they will probably end up giving me an offer. 

Basically, the company sells a LAMP web application to auto dealerships that's meant to provide business insights. It has about 8000 users. It's a legacy software, and they are looking to do two main things. First, they want to update it to be on the newest version of PHP. Then, they want to completely move it to a MERN app. But they need a developer to help with this, because no one there knows how to code. 

Pros

\- They are willing to pay market rate for a new grad, I live in a LCOL area and the range they gave was pretty good. 

\- I'd get the opportunity to work with a popular and relevant tech stack, and I'd be getting payed to learn it. 

\- I'd get the opportunity to modernize a legacy software, which is pretty good experience and would probably set me up for something better down the road. 

\- I'd have my own office. 

\- It's a job. Which is better than no job, I guess. 

Cons

\- I'd be the only developer. The IT director said he eventually wants to put together an agile team, but initially it would just be me. 

\- I don't know LAMP or MERN. I've been upfront about this, and I told him that initially there will be a learning curve where I may not be able to contribute much for the first few months, which he understood. 

\- It's a really small company that's looking to invest more into their technology. Which is a good thing and all, it's just that I'm not super confident in myself. If I were to be hired onto a team at a more ""proven"" company I'd feel better about it going in. I just worry that I may end up in a situation where I'm completely useless and get fired or some shit. 

Overall, it's not really an ideal job for me, and I'm going to keep on looking for something else over the next two months. But if I graduate and they end up being the only company willing to hire me, should I go for it? 

My gut tells me yes, that I should just take the job and even if it ends up being terrible I could at least get the experience. But what if I just end up sucking and get fired after a few months? Then I'd be several months out of school without any experience worth putting on my resume. Or what if I'm just dealing with a lot of uncertainty about it and could use the advice of this community."

I‚Äôve only worked in my position for a year and half and enjoy what I do. However, I do want to make a move out soon to find something with more upward mobility and earnings potential.

I have a degree in economics and I would love a job more related to that field. However, my school didn‚Äôt have a particularly rigorous program. I don‚Äôt really have many hard skills or research experience. I‚Äôve looked into jobs in policy analysis or consulting, and because of my lack of hard skills (R, Python, formal research experience, etc.), I don‚Äôt think I would really fit the bill. From where I stand now, I don‚Äôt know how to develop hard skills or build a network to move fields. It doesn‚Äôt even necessarily have to be policy-related, but I‚Äôve always felt I‚Äôve been good with math and numbers, and I feel I could do well in any kind of data analysis role. Economics is just something I‚Äôm personally invested in.

I‚Äôve considered grad school, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the best option now. It seems dumb to take 5-6 figures of debt without guaranteeing returns on that investment. I‚Äôve thought about MPP, economics, stats, and I don‚Äôt know for sure which would be best. I did an AmeriCorps year so I have a $6k education stipend that I do feel compelled to use at some point. Part of what draws me to an MPP is that Georgetown, GWU, Carnegie-Mellon, etc. all have very well-ranked MPP programs and they match or provide other scholarships to AmeriCorps alum. 

Aside from the cost factor, I have other factors that make me anxious about grad school. I did very well in undergrad GPA-wise but don‚Äôt have too much else going for me. I screwed the pooch and I didn‚Äôt really make connections with any professors, so I would be hard-pressed to ask for letters of rec especially when my last year and a half was entirely online. I didn‚Äôt do too much extracurricular stuff because I was pretty occupied with my crappy retail jobs for most of my time. I do have a short internship to my name, but I can‚Äôt honestly say I developed any outstanding skills. What I mean to say is that I feel like I‚Äôd face an uphill battle trying to get into school with these factors in mind. 

Overall, I‚Äôm feeling kind of lost with regards to pathways out of my current job. I could do this work for years and continue to enjoy it, but I‚Äôd rather not be stuck living with college-aged roommates in a 50 year old apartment for much longer lol. Data analysis seems like something I‚Äôd excel in, but I don‚Äôt know how to get there in a demonstrable way. Outside of formal education, I‚Äôve considered taking online classes on Coursera or w/e, but without formal experience, I don‚Äôt know how far that would get me in a job search. Looking for advice on career + education and also partially a rant."

y46zhh,10,2022-10-14,Close to graduating and feel like I'm nowhere near ready,Beavertales,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/y46zhh/close_to_graduating_and_feel_like_im_nowhere_near/,"I'm about 2 months away from finishing my MSW and have a position lined up at the agency where I'm doing my internship at. I'm finding myself in a different place with Imposter Syndrome than I was the first time I dealt with it about 6 months ago. Back then, I was unsure of my ability to help anyone with anything. Now, after maintaining a caseload of anywhere from 5-10 clients and having very positive feedback from some of those clients, and holding on to clients for several months at a time, I don't worry that much about my ability to be helpful. Where my concern is now is whether or not I am doing enough to warrant putting LLMSW after my name and truly calling myself a ""therapist"". 

I have complete, unwavering confidence in my ability to connect with people, be authentic and non-judgmental, establish a therapeutic alliance, and all of the core fundamentals of being a ""good enough therapist"". However, when it comes to branching out from a person-centered orientation with maybe some CBT skills thrown in there, I fall apart. I try to tell myself that I'm a pretty damn good person-centered therapist, but part of me feels like that's just something I'm telling myself to make myself feel better about not being able to do highly structured therapies. I guess I have a lofty idea of what a therapist is, and what I'm doing right now doesn't fully match up to that concept.

Am I where I should be starting out fresh from college? Am I expecting too much of myself, especially considering I'm practicing in a non-specialized, outpatient setting? I'm finding this to be much more stressful than my first tussle with Imposter Syndrome, and any input or advice would be appreciated."
y4882h,1,2022-10-14,Audit worth it if I‚Äôm not sure?,CleaveTheSheev,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/y4882h/audit_worth_it_if_im_not_sure/,"What‚Äôs up everybody. I was offered a summer internship at Big4 for audit Summer 2023, but after doing a lot of research and reading some threads, it may not be something I‚Äôd want to do for an extended time.

1. Would taking this internship limit my possibilities in other industries? Along with accounting, I‚Äôm majoring in finance and Chinese so I definitely have interest in other industries like banking and wealth management. I would be regretful if taking this internship would limit my ability to go into the aforementioned industries full time.

2. How easy is it to transfer from audit to consulting internally or externally at another Big4? Consulting is something I‚Äôm interested in, and also seemingly pays a higher salary. If it‚Äôs very easy to transfer internally, I‚Äôd be more willing to accept this current audit offer.

Thanks for any insight!"

I recently started working through ""Crafting Interpreters"" by Robert Nyman and it's made me want to go to grad school to study compilers/PLT. The problem is that I have zero research experience. I never anticipated going to grad school, so I didn't participate in class very much and didn't make an effort to get involved in research. The closest thing I have is an internship where I was given an open-ended task with very little guidance and produced something useful. I have a 3.96 cumulative GPA/4.0 CS GPA from a mediocre state school. Is getting a funded, research oriented masters degree out of reach for me?"

I took way too long to apply as I had personal and family issues to deal with throughout the summer, and now, I am kinda scrambling for jobs. I was hoping I could find some answers to my questions here. I‚Äôll listen them out below:
1. Are there any places I can apply to get a job this late? Doesn‚Äôt have to be big.
2. What should I do to increase my chances for the next hiring period to get into a major tech company, as I will no longer meet the requirements of ‚Äúnew grad‚Äù?

y49n59,14,2022-10-14,Should I accept an offer out of safety even if I know that I will most likely renege later?,dealtkiron,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y49n59/should_i_accept_an_offer_out_of_safety_even_if_i/,"Hello all!

Graduating 2023, so 0 YOE

I received an offer from Lockheed Martin for \~$80,000 TC (base + bonus) about 2 weeks ago, deadline is in a couple days. The job will be in-person in Forth Worth, TX and will require security clearance. I currently live in Austin, TX, so the COL will be quite similar, maybe cheaper in FW. The only problem is that while it would not be impossible to move to Forth Worth, I don't think it's a city that I would like to live or build a career in (if you are from FW, please change my mind) vs Austin, TX.

I also interned at a FinTech company this past summer and I was verbally offered a full-time position, with expectation that they would be sending the formal offer out by 3 weeks after the end of summer. It has been 5 weeks, and I have been reaching out to my director (who verbally offered) and my recruiter, and they said they were still awaiting approval from higher ups. They've been saying that they would be able to send out offers the following week, repeatedly for 3 weeks now. It's the end of the 5th week and the director just said that ""discussions are still going at the level above him and that hopefully they'll know by next week"", which is the week that I must reply to the LM offer. From talk that I've been hearing &amp; levels.fyi, the offer will be around 90-95k base. I also enjoyed working with my team this past summer, so on top of the perceived higher TC, I would know what team I'd be working with.

I know next May is somewhat of a long way, but LM is my only offer so far. LM seems great, but the combined cons mentioned above means that I will be interviewing for other companies that will naturally be better between now and graduation. Should I just accept the LM offer and renege if I get the offer from my internship? Is reneging even okay?

**TLDR:**

**Lockheed:**

\--Pros--

* Missiles and Propulsion team. Military defense projects, so cooler I think??
* Only offer on the table right now, so safety in this recession

\--Cons--

* !!! In Forth Worth, TX. Far from family/friends. Not an exciting city!!!
* TC is somewhat low if I am actually considering following thru.
* Will have to renege if I get offer from another company that promised verbal offer."

y4b8cf,4,2022-10-14,DevOps first job opinion,Danytch,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/y4b8cf/devops_first_job_opinion/,"Hi people!
So, basically I did a bootcamp in Java for 6 months and after that I did one internship for 3 months which was also in Java, but I had contact with docker, Jenkins and k8s. Now, I started applying for a job and after some interviews for Java Developer I suddenly got one job proposal to devOps that I am considering, but it seems more a ETL Developer job than devOps. But I don‚Äôt really have experience to tell.

For this job, the company asks for skills in SQL, one OOP language and ETL processes knowledge (ODI). They also mention PL/SQL, Elastic Stack and mediation components.

Do you guys think this is a good first opportunity in devOps? Or should I search another one?

I will have another interview with the company and the team manager and I will ask him, but since I don‚Äôt have too much experience I would like to have one point of view from who really knows about this.

Thanks in advance"

This is also a throwaway account as I am looking for advice and want anonymity

In my professional career thus far (2020-present), I have only held three jobs in total. All of which I have been served PIPs. 

**My first job**

After college, I immediately got my first job. The first job was extremely toxic and I was depressed during my short time of 10 months and it continued after I got termination. The PIPs themselves were served due to performance issues. I even tried to switch to a different department (I was in Sales so I tried to switch to marketing since I have a background in marketing due to the internships I did but the knowledge I gained wasn‚Äôt as solid since it was extremely hands-on and I had no mentorship at all) but my manager stood firm.

**My second job**

My second job was the first time ever in which I was there for a year. That job was in content marketing and I thought I would turn over a new leaf. Unfortunately, I was getting extremely burnt out and distracted by a newfound addiction of traveling, which was fueled by not going anywhere for a year due to COVID. I was then served a PIP due to underperforming and lack of communication. I gave it my all but it wasn‚Äôt enough so I was let go. I have no ill will towards that company as they‚Äôve treated me with empathy and respect. 

**My current job**

My current job, which is my 3rd one, is as a Product Marketing Specialist (PMS). It is the very first time I am involved in Product Marketing and I really have a genuine passion for it as I want to learn more. I kept asking questions, getting feedback and implementing it, and making strides. The company itself is in the SaaS space. 

Today, I have been served a three week PIP by my manager because she said that I do not meet the standards and expectations of the role. So far, I have been with the company for about three months, going on 4 to 5. Prior to this PIP, my role and responsibilities was changed recently a month ago from Content Marketing Associate to PMS.

Being in that situation yet again again is really demoralizing and my confidence is battered. I have stressed that even though I am in a new industry and learning a new role and its responsibilities, I am willing to put in the work and learn from my shortcomings.  

**Conclusion**

I really care about my career and I do not mind if I get brutal feedback or anything. I just feel really demoralized as I have pushed myself and devoted so much of myself at work only to find that I get really battered at work. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I do plan on looking for new opportunities but I really don‚Äôt know where I should go from there in my career.

EDIT: Going to clarify that I am 26 M, forgot to add that in the title"

Biochemistry 2 teacher: I did well in her class, and I did extra semester-long research projects so overall work ethic and motivation should be noted in my essay

Counselor: Not super close to her but she tends to write a good letter. I fleshed out who I was for the most part to her so in the end, should be good."

I am currently in my final year,and have a job offer for c++ developer. There will be 8 months of intern and then I will be converted to full time . There is a 20 months bond . The pay is okay. But the Glassdoor reviews all say that work life balance is not good . My college is tier 3, and recession is here , so I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer . But along with the job I might not be able to upskill myself enough to switch. 
Should I take this job now , or wait and improve myself and look for one after my degree is done .
Please reply , I really need some good advice on this matter ."
y4fwsi,1,2022-10-15,Which language should I focus on for technical test?,An_anonymousperson,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y4fwsi/which_language_should_i_focus_on_for_technical/,"Hi, 

I am currently a Uni student and looking for internship and just generally part-time jobs. I understand the importance of leetcode, but am a bit stuck on choosing a language to prepare with leetcode.

Although I have heard the point that ""the best language to focus on for the interview is the language you are familiar with"", but I am still curious about whether some languages are required / used more by most companies and whethter some languages give more advantage during a tech interview.

For example, a lot of companies I really want to work for specify they want Java and C++, while Google, Microsoft and Apple are more lenient on what languages we can use. 

It comes down to a point that whether I should practise leetcode for Java in order to get into my dream companies, or Python just because it's widely accepted everywhere and it's (apparently) easier to do.

I understand algo questions can be applied in any languages if learned well, but I really want to build strength on one to two particular languages and make sure I can excel in them.  Because I don't feel confident enough to just apply algorithm in all sort of languages under time pressure. 

If I want to spend my time wisely over the summer holiday to prepare for algorithmic questions, should I focus on just Java or Python, or both? 

Is it worth it to learn how to do leetcode in JavaScript, Go or C++ or other languages I haven't learned? (Haven't learned Go and C++ before)"

I decided on this path 2 years ago when I decided to venture out of my current field of engineering. So I have no experience in the tech field yet. 

I'm studying part time and I'm not sure if I have the case of imposter syndrome or I really do feel inadequate. In classes, I think I do okay, as I help others with their codes. Please don't take me for boasting or flexing, I had a full time software engineer seeking help from me and praising me as well, and this further adds to my confusion because I can't think that I'm actually bad. 

When I'm browsing LinkedIn, I see people at my level with very good portfolios, like reducing man-hours by 70% by implementing this-that algorithm etc in their internships. I'm applying for an apprenticeship that has a second assessment coming up and I just feel stressed even though I got past their first assessment. 

Has anyone experienced this and how do I go about solving this?"

The general statement I get from Internet is that PGDM isn't enough to get a job in Canada but that isn't my main goal. I plan to do my MBA (Finance) after this Diploma and currently do not have a profile worthy of being an MBA Student. 

I must mention that I have my CFA Level 1 due in February 2023 and am quite confident about clearing it. By the time I start this program, I'll have 2 years work in Accounting and CFA L1 done. I'm also learning basic Financial Modelling &amp; Valuation, Business Intelligence Softwares side by side . Will I be able to get an internship during my Diploma with these credentials? If not, how can I increase my chances? How do I network with the right people? My goal will be to complete CFA Level 2 at least during the Diploma because I've heard it's quite challenging. I can complete CFA in my country, write GMAT and then directly come for MBA but CFA doesn't have much value here and University programmes aren't affiliated with it. 

I believe I'll be in the right environment and will be gaining Canadian work experience which might make my profile better suitable for an MBA.

What do you think? Am I being delusional? XD 

What are your experiences with this Diploma? Please help me out, I'll forever be grateful.

I‚Äôm born and live up north near Lancaster so I don‚Äôt see myself working in London so maybe the salaries in other cities like Manchester or Liverpool?

2)Anyway my second question is about what I should do right now. My course didn‚Äôt require any prior knowledge but a week in and I feel out of place (I was going to do medicine until I had a change of heart) so what courses would you recommend to someone new to coding/computer science so I can feel better. For example should I do the python course on Code Academy? Which courses should I do on Odin Project and Free Code Camp?

3)Final question is that I know there‚Äôs way too many cs students in my uni alone so I assume job hunting is competitive af. Is there anything in particular I could do to stand out or land myself an internship by the end of the year?"

I create this post because I am in dire need of solid and genuine advice. I graduated in August with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I have done two internships until now: One from Dec 21 - April 22 as an Embedded Systems Intern and one from May 22 - Oct 22 as a Machine Learning Intern. My skills revolve around Machine Learning and Python. Now I'm looking for a job and applying everywhere I can. However, there are very less Machine Learning or Data Science jobs where I am (Pakistan). 

My question is: What path should I take now? There are three possible options (that I can see) for me:

1. Stay home and develop Web Development skills while also freelancing on Fiverr and maybe Upwork

2. Try to get a job quick and rack up experience

3. Apply for Masters"

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

*Essay*:

I will explain how I rationalized a classmate's internalized homophobia (even when called a slur by him) and why that cultivated my passion for decoding systemic issues in oppressed groups.

*School* *Letter of Recommendations:*

AP Stats: 7/10 - I anticipate him to provide a ""hard-working"" and ""last student of mine to achieve a 5 on the AP Stat Exam since 2009"" sort of LOR. Since he expressed how happy he is with how I am taking his lessons to the next level, I expect him to reveal my Applied Economics research with Rutgers University.

AP Psych: 8/10 - She is more familiar with my past as someone who suffered from mental problems as a child; she admires my determination to tackle huge issues and claims she can write a powerful LOR. She went to Penn for undergrad.

Counselor 9/10 - I am the first person she knows who has conducted research as a high school student, especially because she works for a low-income school. She suggests I apply to John Hopkins, implying that she is impressed with my application. She will delve into the context of my life, including difficulties, financial constraints,¬†and home life. She will go into the details of my life, such as challenges, financial restraints, and family life.

*Supplemental Recommendations:*

Cornell University Research Associate: 9/10 - We both have a Latino identity and are interested in understanding systemic difficulties in our countries or communities. If I could pull the ""younger version of myself researching to improve our community"" out of him in the LOR, I could really get a 10/10 recommendation.

Social and Cultural Analysis Professor at New York University: 9/10 - We have the same Latino and indigenous heritage. She said that I was the only high schooler in her decades-long career to contact her about her work. She is well-versed in my own circumstances and has been of tremendous assistance to me throughout the application process. She also assisted me with my college essay; She went to Yale for undergrad and Stanford for graduate school.

**Additional Information:**

\- I received my first Chromebook laptop in March of 2022, after saving for nearly 3 years, which means that almost all of my ECs (everything except social media organization) occurred in the span of 5-9 months, rather than the 4 years most people have. During my time saving, I used a substantial percentage of my money to pay for shopping trips at our local convenience store and to partially pay phone bills.

\- I've also had anxiety and paranoia since I was six years old. My ""potential,"" as my counselor put it, had been stifled for most of my existence.

**School List (as of October 15, 2022):**

Babson College (EA)

Bowdoin College (RD)

Colgate University  (RD)

I thought this might add to my application to HYPSM nicely, but the problem is that this internship would take place in the summer just after my (current) senior year, so I'm not really sure how I should go about mentioning it in any college apps. The program is legit in terms of what it teaches, but it's only happening for the 2nd year and is certainly not recognisable by itself, but rather only by the position that I will get afterwards."

For a while, i felt that the hard work and the endless grinding through research, courses and internships through the undergrad to be a competitive applicant for my phd dream has  paid off. 

I went to the visa interview without worry because I thought that the visa would be no issue after being admitted to the school and having more than sufficient funds. Then I was struck that my application has been sent to special administrative processing or security check since more than 3 months. I tried to give the embassy all the information they requested but they did not even respond. I missed the first semester and about to miss the second, and at this point I think my PI would just rescind the offer and find someone else because of the grant deadline. I feel deeply frustrated and depressed, and my mental health is being drained right now. I wish i had a backup plan to europe or Canada if I knew beforehand that I would be treated like a criminal at 21 years  old when applying to student visa. What was more frustrating that i found that this special background check happens ""randomly""  only to applicants with a muslim name.


So advice to current applicants that I wish someone had told me, try to diversify the locations of the schools you are applying to. Apply to some in Canada, Australia and Europe because you might face extra difficulties every time you travel if you come from a muslim background."

I have applied to many big name (FAANG) internship positions, but I feel like the competition is fierce and my GPA is good but not extremely good (7.6 / 10, Im european). My resume isn't that spectaculair either because although I did work at a tech company for a while, it wasn't swe related. My fear is that I don't get any internship offers and I graduate without any experience under my belt.

I have a few options before me:

1. Keep applying to Faang internships, hoping that I do get one in the future. In the meantime work on my masters.

2. Take a gap year from my masters to focus on grinding LC and do some personal projects. This gives me more time to land a good internship.

3. Start applying to smaller companies for internships, hoping that this will be easier although the rewards might be smaller.


Any advice? I feel kind of hopeless rn."

The advice I got here led to me getting my dream internship offers (SpaceX and Blue Origin). So I thought I'd post here and jot down a couple pieces of advice for anyone beginning to look for internships and such. 

1) The fundamentals of all your classes are so so so important. You hear all this talk about ""when will I ever use this again"" and ""You barely ever use anything you learn in class in career"" and what not. Sure maybe you won't ever use calculus or that very specific diffeq method, but you need to have at least an intuition on how things work. You don't need to know how to solve some complicated cantilevered beam problem off the top of your head, but you at least need to know what happens when your design is under stress. 

2) Communication skills!!!!!! You gotta be able to talk to people and be able to work with others. You might be thinking ""Why is this recruiter asking me to explain things in a very specific way"" well they are essentially trying to get a gage of how you talk to people. Interpersonal skills are just as an important as technical.

3) Interview the employer just as much as they interview you. You want to get an idea of how the team operates. The interview should be you seeing if you are compatible with the company just as much as the company wants to see if you are compatible with them.

4) Resume Resume Resume. Take someone elses resume format (someone who has had success in getting the job you want), use the format, write everything in the STAR format, post it to r/EngineeringResumes a hundred times until its literally perfect. Even if you are a top candidate, it's no good if you never get call backs. Also alot of companies have GPA cutoffs, so make sure you are above water in that aspect.

5) Look for any opportunities. Majority of schools have engineering clubs and teams, this is basically your way to get experience early. Not only technical and problem solving skills, interpersonal skills. This helps with point 1 and 2, and 4 as you can build that sexy resume. 

6) Arguably the most important. Identify all of your weaknesses, and do something to fix them. You are bad at coding? Take on a coding project. You are bad at interviews? Find people to do mock interviews with. You've never designed anything that works? Design something that works. Don't try to hide them, address them.  

I wish everyone the best of luck this internship searching season. Don't panic, give it your all, and don't give up. Ad Astra"

I was given a task to complete. I did my best but my preceptor still claimed it wasn‚Äôt fast enough. She  told me before the task was given that since I don‚Äôt have double computer screens and a mouse and using a laptop, it might be a bit harder for me to complete it  but she was still furious. Mind you this is unpaid internship so I‚Äôm not spending money. I‚Äôm already a broke college student. 

She decides to give me another task I‚Äôm not too skilled in. I told her to guide me. She gave a very condescending answer making feel so stupid.

She then guides me and immediately tells me to replicate what she just did. At this point I was feeling so anxious that I blanked out and I told her that honestly with this type of pressure I can‚Äôt replicate it right after her but I can study it on my own and then show her. I ask her what topics I should self study so I can be better. She very passive aggressively tells me to click on the excel formula and made me repeat it out loud like I am in kindergarten or something.

Im so anxious to possible go back and work with her. I want to quit as I‚Äôm not even learning anything and her passive aggressiveness makes me feel so small. When she sensed I wanted to quit, she panicked and started asking me how she could help me but tbh I‚Äôm checked out. 

How do I gracefully quit this? My peace of mind and mental health is more important than some unpaid internship. Or do you guys think I should stick it through. Am I being too sensitive? Any advice is helpful. Thanks."

I did the phone screen in Java, so should I expect to be allowed to answer coding Qs in Java, or should I make sure I also have good C++ knowledge? And in terms of system design, are there any particular concepts I should be focusing on or is something like the system design primer on GitHub good to stick to? Any kind of project presentation too?

My common app is about Astronomy and I truly enjoy it, which is why I am applying for Aerospace as well. I want to use computing for scientific research instead of coding for Google or anything. Overall, my common app essay is decent but supplementals are much stronger. 

I am also applying to the top tier schools as well (not ivys tho)  but I know my profile is very lacking compared to people who have found the cure for cancer. My only hook is women in tech and Astronomy.

A bit of background on me - I'm an ECE about to graduate next year. I want to pursue software engineering and I live in Canada.

I have 2 offers as a new grad:

1 - silicon engineer at Microsoft for Mountain View, CA.

2 - software developer at a medium size Canadian company. 

I've been spinning on this because I interned with both and I really enjoyed my internship w/ the smaller company. They're willing to give me the start date I want, it's remote, and I really like the culture. The only thing is the comp isn't that great.

I had a good time at Microsoft, but I noticed that I don't fit in as well in big corporations. The corporate culture really gets to me. Also, like I mentioned, I want to do software engineering, but this position is silicon engineering. I've been told I can switch teams later, but I'll have to do silicon for 6 months minimum. The comp is obviously good, but average in CA terms. I'll also have to move away from family to a whole other country. I'm also not particularly interested in living in the US.

The main reason why I'm spinning on this is because someone I talked to told me to think about who I want to work with - the 97th percentile or, humbly speaking, more average people? Also, MS comes with a brand pedigree, but then again, why do I want people to think I'm smart? It will help my career a lot though in terms of opportunity.

I want a good career, but a lot of other things are important to me. My career isn't everything to me anymore and I'm generally not a fan of the rat race. Would I be stupid to decline the MS offer? The more I think about this, the more confused I get. Any advice or guidance would be appreciated."

I'm pretty sure I've got something going on, either like ADHD or Depression, I'm not really sure what, but it's been making my life like a living hell, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I know that I want to do art and film professionally, and I'm already in my third year of college about to graduate with enough credits to go to an Art university and start applying for some internships at some animation and gaming studios like Disney or Bungie near California, but I just feel so unmotivated all the time. It feels like a constant struggle to do anything or get anywhere. Like whenever I'm with my friends, I can never focus on the moment and always have to bring up something serious and accidentally trauma dump, or I self-sabotage and decline hang out invitations. 

It's just like, some days, it's such a freaking effort to do anything. Like, ok, an average day for me will start like this: Recently, I've messed my sleep schedule up pretty bad, and I've been going to bed around 2-3 am, sometimes 4, and waking up at 10-11 am, sometimes noon. (Not a great start, I know, usually I wake up and go to bed earlier, but for some reason it's just been pretty bad lately.) Then after waking up, it's either straight to video games, or I'm endlessly scrolling through social media for 2-3 hours, laying in my bed and doing nothing. I'm currently jobless and only going to school, and I beat myself up all the goddamn time for it, telling myself how ***""other's would kill to be where you are, so stop taking it so easy on yourself and being nice to yourself""*** and so on, so usually I wallow in self-pity for a few hours, and then maybe I'll get up and make some ""breakfast"" (it's usually around 1:00 pm at this point), and then procrastinate until the last minute to get whatever homework I have for the day done right before the deadline. This also usually results in my work either being rushed or unfinished. Which actually sucks, because I really like some of the classes I'm taking, and I really like some of the professors and the students in the class, so I want to show a little pride in my work, but I just always procrastinate till the last second. And then I stay up super late, ""recovering"" from the anxiety and stress I put on myself for procrastinating all day, and then either I usually drink a beer, or I'll just stay up until God knows when with some online friends playing games, usually not even talking sometimes. 

Honestly writing this now it seems pretty obvious that I have like some form of depression or something, but I don't know what to do about it. I'm seeking health care from a professional, but even sometimes it feels like therapy is either too slow, or not working at all, like I'm just wasting my money. 

I used to work at a pizza place during the beginning of my second semester of college, because I needed the money to pay for it, but then I quit because I got it all paid off and then I guess I just felt like I was going to be stuck in a dead-end job for the rest of my life. My father beat it into my head that you basically have to be Donald-fucking-Trump if you want to be successful, otherwise, you're nothing. 

Sorry just, I want to feel like I have my life back. I have a girlfriend and a grandparent to take care of, and I guess they're both doing fine without me, but my grandma's getting older and is starting to need help with financial payments, and my girlfriend has always been supportive of our financial troubles, but I want to start providing, and I know it would be a load off of her mind if I started to save up a little bit so we can finally move out and be independent. She and I are both waiting to finish college, but home life is pretty shit so we're getting pretty antsy about pulling the trigger. Anyway, any advice on what I should do? I'm sorry this is so long winded; I just feel really lost and want my life back in my control."

I have a well-written CV and can write a good cover letter, but god, it's so frustrating when you keep getting rejected because you have a degree that is kind of looked down upon. All my lecturers say that it really doesn't matter because there is so much demand, that eventually you will find something if you sell yourself good enough. This made me realize that I'm of course, probably not selling myself good enough. I fear this will continue to be a hurdle and I'm considering doing an extra 2 years to get my bachelor's degree. Is this worth the extra effort, or should I just stick with an associate, get hired somewhere, and specialize on the job? 

What are your opinions on bachelor vs associate, especially for someone like me who is 1 year in the field and still searching for better ways of selling myself / finding my strengths?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am an international student and came to Canada in September 2022 (1 year ago). I have a credit score of about 730 and a student credit card with a limit of 1000 on it. 

I am really confused about how to raise my credit score. I am planning to apply for a credit card in the near future. I am currently working as an intern and hoping to get a job in January 2023. Will increasing my credit limit help me increase my credit score? I am planning to apply for the [simplyCash card](https://www.americanexpress.com/ca/en/credit-cards/simply-cash/?linknav=ca-en-amex-cardshop-allcards-text-simplyCashCard) from Amex.

Also, I am still confused about the 30% limit usage on the credit card. If I could pay off my credit card before the statement is generated should I do that and have a statement of like $10 being generated or should I have a statement that is closer to the 30% limit (like around $250-$300)? What is the recommended thing to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."

I realized how important the leetcode grind is around end of my sophomore year and I did that religiously until I landed an internship in FAANG. I rode my internship all the way to a full time offer and am about to start. However, I feel a lot less knowledgeable than my peers. I basically got here because I grinded leetcode day in day out for months, but I feel like there is a lot I shouldve also focused on while studying. I realized how embarrassing it was when I walked into my Senior Design class at my University wearing my company's merch (and having everyone come up to me and ask me how I did it and all), but proceeding to be clueless when my teammates for my project began talking about RESTful API's and creating docker instances.

I have a few months before I start since I graduate in December but don't start until April. I wanted to use those months to relax but also to study as much as I can. I planned to watch a bunch of courses on system design and then try to create a few apps over that time period, but I wanted to ask what you all think would be the best course of action for me to maximize my time before I start working. For context imagine all I know is C++ and how to do C++ leetcode problems. I'm not that bad, but I just want to be as solid as I possibly can heading into my new job. Thanks in advance!"

y5ad2f,162,2022-10-16,Moving to the US from the EU: A selection of options,WheresTatianaMaslany,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/y5ad2f/moving_to_the_us_from_the_eu_a_selection_of/,"I‚Äôm a lurker of this sub, and I often see posts from my fellow Europeans along the lines of ‚Äúhow can I move to the US?‚Äù, or just general comments from people who would like to explore the software industry in the US. As someone who successfully made the jump a few years ago, I‚Äôve now seen a variety of other people make the jump, and I wanted to share some options for people who are really interested in moving to the US. (I also know that some people are tired of ‚Äúhow to move to the US?‚Äù posts and threads, so hopefully this can be a one-stop thread for people who are wondering about that, to avoid polluting other threads :-) )

Let me start by prefacing with this: moving to the US is **really hard**. The US immigration system has much more demand than it has supply, and with the current political gridlock, there‚Äôs basically little chance of the US increasing avenues for immigration.

In an average Western country, if a tech company finds a foreigner who‚Äôs able to do the job, they would sponsor them, and that new employee could be on a plane with their family a few months later. In the US, **the system is so clogged that there‚Äôs very little chance a company would even** ***consider*** **foreigners from abroad**, be it Europeans or others. The H-1B system (H-1B being the main visa for highly skilled foreigners) is completely clogged, to the point where the US government had to set up a yearly lottery that only selects one out of 3 petitions. (In 2022, there were 308,613 petitions, even though the yearly cap is 87,500 slots.) Recruiters mostly *won't even consider people outside of the US*. If you click on ‚ÄúApply‚Äù for a job posting in the US, your resume likely **won‚Äôt even go in front of a recruiter** if you‚Äôve checked the box ‚Äúneeds sponsorship‚Äù in the application. (There are exceptions of course, but mostly for very senior roles, or people who have an extremely specialized skillset.)  
This is also compounded by the fact that since US companies have a harder and harder time hiring locally (especially companies in Silicon Valley), **lots of them are actively trying to set up offices abroad**‚Äìso if they want to hire foreigners, it‚Äôs typically more **to try and base them abroad**, so as to start building up their presence there. (For example, see the Google and Meta offices in London.) So yeah. If you hadn‚Äôt noticed by now, it‚Äôs really hard.

(Last note before I lay out options: I know that America is not a country for everyone, and lots of people have strong opinions about life in America from abroad. This post will not try to convince you to move to the US. Just to provide guidance to those who are interested to move to the US, be it just for a few years or to immigrate permanently.)

I'll now get started on the options. If some acronyms are unknown to you, I‚Äôve added a mini-glossary at the end.

* **(EARLY CAREER): Doing a Master‚Äôs in the US**  
If you haven‚Äôt gotten a Master‚Äôs yet, a serious option to get a foot in the door is **doing your Master‚Äôs in the US**. There‚Äôs lots of reasons for that. The main one is that doing a Master‚Äôs in CS in the US gives you a right to **a work visa called the STEM OPT, which is basically a 3-year post-grad work visa**. Once you‚Äôre done with your Master‚Äôs, you can apply for company in the US, and they won‚Äôt need to sponsor you to start working. If you‚Äôre doing a good job, many of them (especially the big ones) will try to get you an H-1B before the STEM OPT expires. And if your STEM OPT runs out before you get an H-1B, but that you‚Äôve already proven yourself, bigger companies that have a presence abroad will often transfer you to an office abroad, then will transfer you back to the US once you're eligible for an L1.  
Now, you might be thinking: isn‚Äôt doing in the Master‚Äôs in the US extremely expensive? **Yes, it's expensive**. However, it‚Äôs good to keep in mind that with salaries being higher in the US, you might be able to pay it off in just a few years. In addition to that, it‚Äôs a good idea to look up if your home country has programs to help you study abroad while keeping costs down. For example, Sweden has 0% interest rate loans available if you want to study abroad.  
(Keep in mind that studying in the US technically initially *requires non-immigrant intent*: the officer at the US embassy will want to ensure that your initial intent, when getting your student visa, is *only* to study &amp; possibly do an OPT, then go back to your home country. While US law recognizes that you might change your mind after you've been studying in the US for a while, it's good to keep this non-immigrant aspect in mind if you decide to go that route.)  
Doing a Master‚Äôs in the US has other immigration &amp; career benefits:
   * You‚Äôll start building a network with other folks who want to work in software in the US, who might be able to‚Äìfor example‚Äìrefer you to a job down the line.
   * US tech companies often recruit interns and new grads at career fairs and on campus, which you‚Äôll be able to attend.
   * Your odds to be selected in the H-1B lottery are higher. (There‚Äôs a selection of slots reserved to applicants with a US Master‚Äôs.)
* **(ALL CAREER STAGES) Transfer**  
Because transfer visas (specifically, the L1 visa) are easier to get than H-1B visas (since they don't have the same yearly cap problem), **having a company hire you** ***outside*** **of the US then transfer you to the US** is a possibly effective strategy. Here are a few ways you could go at this:
   * **Apply for the job you‚Äôd like, but have them park you outside of the US until you‚Äôre eligible for an L1 visa**. Possible for extremely niche position, but in general, *most* job postings will filter out your application just from you having checked ‚Äúneeds sponsorship to work in the US‚Äù.  
In this situation, a referral can work in your favor. If you can be referred directly to a hiring manager by an acquaintance, they might be more inclined to pick up your resume from the list‚Äìand then, to figure out visa solutions if they decide that they‚Äôd like to make you an offer.
      * What's worked for some people I know was to reach out on LinkedIn to alumnae of their universities that are working for US companies, and ask if they were recruiting/could refer them.
   * **Get a job at a US company at one of their offices, then ask for a transfer to the US after a few years**. I‚Äôve seen quite a few successfully do that: they worked for 3 or 4 years at a FAANG in London or elsewhere, then were transferred to the US. Typically, it‚Äôs either because they were offered to transfer without asking‚Äìbut I‚Äôve also seen some people apply for an internal job change for a US position after already proving themselves in a position for a few years.
* **(IF YOU HAVE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER SKILLS) Self-sponsoring**  
If you have lots of experience, or if you have experience in a highly specialized &amp; sought-after niche, another option is **self-sponsoring** \- i.e. not relying on a company to sponsor you, but instead **asking the US government for a visa directly, based on your skillset**. If you‚Äôre a software engineer, the classic go-to option would be the EB2-NIW (National Interest Waiver). If you petition the US government for an EB2-NIW and that your petition is approved, not only will they let you in and let you work in the US, but they‚Äôll also issue you a green card, meaning you‚Äôll effectively be a US permanent resident, and that you‚Äôll be free to do whatever you‚Äôd like (instead of being tied to a single employer).  
The bar for self-sponsoring is higher, and you typically need to demonstrate you‚Äôll provide a unique and useful set of skills. A PhD, patents, publications, years of experience, online presence/personal brand, conference talks will help, although none of those are strict requirements. I‚Äôd recommend doing some research (just a Google search is a good start) on the profiles of software engineers who have been approved, and investigating whether it could be an option for you. There are quite a few immigration lawyers who offer to help you file on a ‚Äúsuccessful or refunded‚Äù basis‚Äìafter they audit your profile, they‚Äôll tell you immediately if they think you‚Äôll be approved, and if you end up being refused, they‚Äôll refund you their legal fees.

Those are some of the main options that I‚Äôve seen used successfully. There‚Äôs also a few smaller options that it‚Äôs good to keep in mind:

* The United States runs a [diversity visa program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html?wcmmode=disabled), where a small subset of entrants (less than 1%) are randomly selected for a green card. While the odds are very small, I‚Äôve met a few foreign techies who moved this way. If you‚Äôre thinking of moving to the US, it can always be worth signing up every year, since it‚Äôs free and takes 10 minutes to do.
* Per US law, it‚Äôs easier for non-profits to sponsor foreigners in the US than for-profit companies. (They aren‚Äôt constrained by the H-1B cap, so they can keep sponsoring foreigners even if the H-1B cap has been reached for the year.) Aiming specifically for those companies can be an option.

That's it! Hopefully, all this information will have been helpful. If you have thoughts, comments, or think I missed an option, please feel free to comment in the thread :-)

**Glossary:**

* OPT: Stands for Optional Practical Training. Temporary 1-year work visa that international students in the US can leverage post-graduation.Graduates from STEM fields can ask for a 2-year extension, granting the total to 3 years. This option is called the STEM OPT.
* H-1B: The US‚Äôs classic high-skilled foreigner visa. It‚Äôs capped to 87,500 visas per year (including a portion exclusively for applicants with a US Master‚Äôs). Because demand has been so much higher in the past few years, the US government has been forced to do a yearly lottery. The US Congress could raise the cap, but it would be very difficult with the current political gridlock.
* L1 Visa: Intra-company transfer visa. If you‚Äôve worked for a company in one of their non-US offices for a year, they can use this visa to transfer you back to the US.
* O-1 Visa: ‚ÄúExceptionally skilled‚Äù visa, or the celebrity visa. (Justin Bieber was, at least at some point, living in the US on an O-1.) It‚Äôs possible to get an O-1 visa as a software engineer, but the bar is quite higher than for H-1B. Typically only accessible if you have lots of experience, if you have a highly specialized skillset, or if you‚Äôre influential in your field (e.g. patents, conference talks‚Ä¶)"

y5i9pm,77,2022-10-16,Job Hunting Tips from a Fresh Grad,ifonlymenarelikebts,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/y5i9pm/job_hunting_tips_from_a_fresh_grad/,"I just had a random urge to share my job hunting experience as a fresh grad and I hope this helps bc that's the goal hehe

1. List your non-negotiables when applying (e.g in terms of location, salary, job position, industry, work set-up etc.) and then choose job postings according to your non-negotiables.
2. Apply to as many jobs as you can! It could be tiring but attending many interviews will make you reflect on your answers which will make you get better in the long run. Besides, not all job postings that you applied for will answer back so the more, the better.
3. Always do prior research about the company and the role. The recruiters can feel if you are really interested by testing your knowledge about them and the job.
4. During interviews, tailor your answer according to the job description/responsibilities. Most recruiters rely on how fit you are for the role. For example, only mention strengths that are variable for the role and weaknesses that you think will not hinder you from doing the role well when you get hired.
5. If you are a fresh grad without experience like me, when asked a situational question, make sure that you remember every event in your org/employee engagement or a technical task in your internship where you played an important role and answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Results) Fun fact, I was able to bullshit my way out when I was asked why I didn't join orgs by saying I spent half of my college in a pandemic (I know it's manipulative but they were able to empathize and understand)
6. Do not let the job qualifications intimidate you. Most job postings especially 'entry level' positions mention that you have to have 2 years experience which may hinder you from applying. Don't be intimidated and still shoot your shot!
7. Job hunting can be mentally and physically draining so it's better if you know how to do time blocking by creating a schedule when to send an application, attend interviews and of course, rest.
8. Set a timeframe for your job hunting journey. Based on my experience, it's better to be patient and wait so you can get a job that you really want. However, if you don't have the luxury of time, just make sure not to accept lowballed JO.
9. Lastly, getting a job is really just about how you market yourself. Communication skills will take you far, so practice is one of the key.


This, ofcourse, is subject to corrections. I still have a long way to go but I am just so happy to share things as my job hunting experience taught me a lot. Also, tomorrow's my first day in my new job and I am honestly experiencing imposter syndrome right now. Regardless, wish me luck! ü§û

Because of this, all of the job postings I've encountered boil down to three things:

* Hiring date starts in 2023, which gives me less than a month to pay off student loans before the end of the deferment period.
* Salary is well below the global median, let alone the median for my college (RIT). I've also interviewed for jobs that have a starting salary WELL below the documented starting salary on glassdoor ($20k difference to be exact).
* Job requirements include 1 or more years of experience outside of internships. 

As I was struggling, I've been invited to apply for a plethora of Technical Consulting postings from companies that have a decent starting salary, an immediate start date, and require less than a year of experience outside of internships. While I am extremely desperate to escape from unemployment, especially as a software engineering graduate getting my foot in the door, I've read numerous Reddit posts and comments claiming that it's better to struggle into an entry-level SWE gig than to pursue consulting in terms of both pigeon-holing and long-term salary growth.

Although this question boils down to personal preference, my biggest concern is finding development experience that will allow me to access development roles without sabotaging myself even more career-wise. With that being said should I continue to seek software engineering postings, or switch to consulting despite the risks?

I'm studying Industrial Engineering and after I graduate I'd like to be in Data Science.

The first would be a returning internship with a large agriculture/manufacturing company in their Data Science &amp; Analytics department. I will be doing machine learning for their equipment. Essentially, its strictly data science. Typical interns come from CS and Data Science backgrounds.

The second is with a large oil and gas company in their trading &amp; shipping department. From my understanding, I'd be assigned to one of the commodity benches and supporting the Analytics team there along with being exposed to/supporting the trading and operations teams. I think it's more a data analytics role vs data science (think doing regression/forecasting, cleaning data, etc.) The setting is similar to what you'd find on wall street. The other interns come from a variety of finance, economics, supply chain, and engineering.

I'm honestly torn between the two. On one hand, I think returning to the ag company as a DS intern sets me up nicely to break into the data science field. On the other hand, the oil company exposes me to a new industry, opens up new opportunities, and also the pay and location are much better (trying not to take this in account too much tho because it's only for 3 months).

I worry that if I turn down the new internship with the oil company I will always wonder what if I took it -- I don't think I'll ever have a chance to work with the company again. Whereas, I can probably come back to the original ag company more easily.

Any thoughts? Would really appreciate it.

y5new5,0,2022-10-16,Good and affordable CS or comp neuro/cog sci masters programs one can into with low GPA (6.3/10) but good research experience) see details below,Xyber5,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/y5new5/good_and_affordable_cs_or_comp_neurocog_sci/," 

So basically I am final year undergrad from a decent engineering college in India, the reason for my GPA being low is that I was never really interested acads and only attempted to just pass the exams, even in open book tests rather than scoring well because of this I have been ineligible to apply at many places for internships too and got waitlisted in many I applied to, so before you say 'YOU COULD NOT COPE UP WITH YOUR UNDERGRAD, WHY GO TO GRAD SCHOOL' , that was never the case. With that being said my I do have good research experience.

\- During my second year I was selected for internship at my university's research lab, and was 1 of the only 2 students to be selected from second year, despite being from non-CS background(E&amp;TC) , the other guy was CS.

\- During my third year I worked with a healthcare company as a research intern, where I worked on depression and stress detection with Machine Learning.

\- Currently in 4th year I am working on joint project funded by the Department of Science and Technology Government of India along with University of Milan Italy based on Multimodal AI and Computer vision.

\- From January next year I will be working on another funded research Project funded by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology with CDAC and DRDO(think of it as India's DARPA) .

In terms on extracurricular achievements I was a professional e-sports player before getting into research and my team was among the top 10 teams in south asia

My research interest is in the intersection of machine learning with neuroscience and cognitive science. I also want to continue working on computer vision and multimodal. Princeton's Neuroscience Institute seems to quite interesting for this since princeton has a funded masters CS program but they wont accept me because of my low GPA lol.

In europe I am thinking of applying to EPFL's Neuro-x Masters program and ETH zurich's Neural Information Processing masters but again I barely have any chance of getting into these since I have low GPA and these two institutes prefer GPA waay more than american ones.

The only place where I feel I can get in is KU leuven's Masters CS program since they take in anyone. My plan is to keep a good GPA this time along an gain research experience so that I can get into a Top PhD program.

I just wanna know if there are some better places where I have a chance of getting in with funding or atleast low fees. Any and all advice/suggestions are welcome."

*    Chief Technology Office (CTO)
*    Global Technology Infrastructure (GTI)

CODA‚Äôd into ECE with a 3.8 CODA GPA. Fast forward one year: fell out with my parents, was paying for school on my own, working 30-40 hours in part time jobs to pay for school and feed myself and gf, completely lost interest in school and failed two classes across 3 semesters. 

Edit: CODA stands for change of degree audit. You have to CODA to get into engineering or switch

Fast forward 6 more months: gf of 4 years broke up with me, was homeless and sleeping in my car before I turned 20. Was acing 4/5 of my classes but chose one to stop caring about because I literally couldn‚Äôt manage it. Thankfully I had landed an internship and was making decent money so I could eat something other than rice mixed with condensed cream of chicken soup.

My internship reinspired me about education and realized I had a huge passion for programming and comp sci. Decided it was a good idea to switch to CSC so I could actually enjoy school again and learn about something I was passionate about. State had other ideas. Explained my homelessness and requirement to work full time so I could eat and find somewhere to live and that my internship made me passionate about school again like I was in high school. 

My CODA transfer request was denied. 

Think to myself ‚Äúno big deal, I‚Äôll take som CS classes to show I‚Äôm good now and I‚Äôll try again.‚Äù Nope. Aced four of my CSC classes that next semester while still working at my internship part time. Applied for a CODA transfer again. Same story. Same result. Denied. 

Reached out to my advisor and gave her the same story. Nothing she could do, she said. 

One more semester, same deal. A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs in my classes. CODA transfer request. Same story. Denied. 

I was devastated. I couldn‚Äôt believe that one, I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to study computer science, and two, that not one of the adults I talked to or that read my CODA essay thought about reaching out to a 19 year old that was homeless, working full time and in 15+ credit hours worth of classes. I was literally drowning, and no one gave a shit. 

So fuck you State. You don‚Äôt give a shit about your students or what they‚Äôre going through. You are a sports program that offers degrees as a side hustle. 

This story has a happy ending. I dropped out of state, convinced my internship employer to hire me on full time while I finished school online at SNHU (highly recommend this university). I‚Äôm engaged and bought a house in 2021. My feet are still numb from all the bootstrap pulling I had to do with no support from my school. Still pissed. 

If anyone is struggling or just needs someone to talk to, I‚Äôm happy to talk to you or just listen. No one should have to go through something like that alone.

I am in my final year of enginnering majoring in Computer Science from a college affiliated to the University of Mumbai. My college is Tier(n+1) where n&gt;=3. Anyways my mom, as any Indian parent would to stand their ground, started to tell about my recent achivements. How I got into a good internship and how I recently got a modest placement. To which the aunt replies : *""Yeh toh kuch nahi, mere gaav meh ek jan ka beta IIT Delhi meh 3rd year meh hai, usko abhi hee ek lakh rupiya mil raha hai mahine ka internship meh.""* (This is nothing. In my village, someones son is in IIT Delhi and gets 1Lakh Rupees per month as internship stipend in his 3rd year).

The discussion went no further. While leaving she said *""Koi nahi, kuch na kuch toh hojayega yaar tere bete ka"".* (Don't worry, something or the other will hapen with your son).

I sat in my bedroom this whole while overhearing them, and when she left, I could see the storm in my moms eyes. Her throat was dry, and I could see tears rolling out of her eyes slowly. All the years of hardwork I did after Grade12 to make up for what I had lost, gone in vain. It felt some kind of Deja Vu seriously, all those haunting memories of Grade11 &amp; Grade12 came gushing back.

We know that you and your child's hardwork has paid off and we accept it, you have every right to hold your held high. But please don't try to discourage the one's who are correcting course.  

Previous to this incident me and my family were okaiyishly happy about my internship &amp; placement, but now I get constantly compared to 1Lakh/month internship &amp; 50Lakh/year placement.

I seriously don't know what to write more. For the students who have settled for less and moved on, please don't tell us nothing can be made of us. It has taken me lots and lots amounts of time and effort to make my home's environment positive after my Grade12 when I didn't make it. I am not opposing recognition, but this newfound hatred and the sense of pity for the ones left behind is truly pathetic. This trend to belittle others achievements is rude."
y5s8wv,12,2022-10-16,Non-traditional (switched to CS late in life) grad student looking for advice,ClaimExpert8106,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y5s8wv/nontraditional_switched_to_cs_late_in_life_grad/," Hi all, I really need your advice on putting my resume together for landing my first internship and (hopefully) my first full time job as a SWE.  
I am a grad student currently enrolled in MSCS program and I'm preparing to start the job application process. The problem is that I'm not sure what to put on my resume: I'm a professional musician who after decades of trying to make the ends meet by having various day-time jobs and performing finally decided to switch to CS in 2020. I've held several retail positions, between 3 and 5 years for each, I've taught private music lessons in a studio for about a year and I also worked in fast food for about 7 years while working on my Bachelor of Music degree and some time after that while I was gigging. I was also self employed as a musical instrument repairman for a few years. As you can deduce from these numbers, I'm not your typical new graduate - I'm 48 y/o now.  
So the dilemma I'm facing when it comes to putting together my resume is two-fold:

1. Should I mention any of the non-CS work experience I have on my resume at all (perhaps under 'other experience')? The only thing I have right now for experience is school and personal projects.
2. If I do mention these various jobs I had, how can I do it without exposing my age? I know that ageism is rampant and I really don't want to shoot myself in the foot here. Even for my bachelor's degree, I didn't want to include the graduation year - it was almost 20 years ago.

I would really appreciate any advice, especially from the folks who hired people like me - the ones who switched careers late in life. Thanks!"
y5st60,82,2022-10-16,I think A2C and thinking about college in general has damaged my mindset,Curejoker,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/y5st60/i_think_a2c_and_thinking_about_college_in_general/,"I started thinking about college in June, in the last few days of my sophomore year. Before really researching about the college application process, I thought getting into a ‚Äúgood‚Äù university was impossible for someone like me, who lived in Canada and wasn‚Äôt rich. Luckily, I found that it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ but I also found that I NEEDED to do impressive and life changing extracurriculars to get into my dream college.


Before I wanted to get into Harvard, I did things out of initiative and desire. In elementary school, I made websites, started protests and wanted to create businesses and charities. I had so much passion. I don‚Äôt know when that motivation ended, but now, so much is about my EC section, my ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù and what would look best. Before I do anything I think ‚Äúcan I put this on my application?‚Äù and I KNOW that‚Äôs a bad thing to think, but really I can‚Äôt help it being in the back of my mind. I‚Äôve never felt the amount of pressure I am putting on myself right now. Every second that goes by is a second wasted.


I barely have any ECs and they‚Äôre all random. I‚Äôve applied to countless internships and jobs. I‚Äôve tried starting clubs and personal projects but at the end of the day I always end where I started.


I‚Äôve read hours of EC advice, but nothing makes my anxiety better. In fact, it makes my worries worse. I have no more passions. I don‚Äôt have anything I actually care about anymore. Nothing motivates me enough to actually make me start doing it. 
My breaking point was realizing my summer was over and every internship and job and program I applied for denied me. It‚Äôs been a month since school started and I‚Äôve accomplished nothing. Everyone else at my school has done more ECs and sports than I have. I wanted to start a personal project with my friend but she just started it without me. Everyone and everything has rejected me.

I‚Äôve read countless posts that say internships and research are average ECs. I just read a post that said you need to start ECs before junior year, and I literally wanted to jump off a cliff. I feel like it‚Äôs all over before I had known it."
y5tul1,7,2022-10-16,Capital One Chicago TIP,HaarisTheHandsome,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y5tul1/capital_one_chicago_tip/,"Does anyone have any experience with C1's TIP in the Chicago office? I know McLean is the HQ so there would be more interns but I like the more big city feel over being 20 minutes from DC which I don't think I'd enjoy much anyway. I just don't want to miss out on the social aspect that would be in McLean. But I also feel like living in Chicago especially with free housing is more worth it than living in DC. 

Also, I've heard that C1 is pretty strict about where you go for fulltime if you a get a return offer, so I don't want to get stuck with McLean for fulltime as well. But I don't know how true that is.  

If anyone has any insight, I'd really appreciate it!"

For his school project, he wanted to write a password generator in Python. He sent me his code, and wanted me to look at it and tweak it where needed. The script he had written was messy and hard to understand, which isn't bad, we all started somewhere. Anyway,  I decided to visit the office and invited him to sit next to me for 30 minutes, and completely rewrote the script to make it nice and understandable. Also gave him the opportunity to ask questions.

Because I'm a self-taught scripter, I kinda also lack the experience of writing clean code myself. So, I was wondering if you guys could give me some feedback.

I'm swamped with schoolwork, my mental health was thrown into the dumpster, and don't have the time nor energy to do these assessments. I know that a majority of these assessments come from the big FAANG-type companies, so I've decided to start avoiding them. I want to go for internships from companies where I can get a decent software engineering internship without killing myself trying to get through their hiring process. I no longer care about getting a big-shot $50/hr+ internship from Microshit, I just want a normal one. I've read posts where people have talked about how they got their internships without doing long OAs, never touched a single leetcode problem in their life, and only had to do one technical interview to get their position so I know that these companies exist, but I don't know where to find them.

Does anyone know where I can find places like this? I've been searching mainly on LinkedIn and Handshake. Anything helps, thank you."

I was thinking we could use this thread for profile evaluation requests pertaining to computer science and related branches. We can follow a standard format, and then others willing to do the evaluations and looking for evaluations can spend some time on the thread.

I was thinking this format can be used for those posting their profile for evaluations:

---------------------------x--------x-----------------------

GRE:

TOEFL/IELTS:

Undergraduate College and GPA:

Work Experience (internships and FTE):

Research Experience:

Publications:

Other Info:

Shortlisted colleges:

--------------------------x-------x-------------------------

The college list is extremely important- please don't be lazy and do some research yourself on shortlisting, as it is very subjective (use websites like admits.fyi, LinkedIn, gradcafe and admit predictiors like gyaandhan)- at least do some homework and provide a list.

Apologies if this is not how everyone wants to go ahead- I am open to modifying the format/even deleting the post if others are not up for it.

I have limited this to Computer Science courses for more focused evaluations- please create more threads for other streams.

If this works for everyone, I request the moderators to pin this thread."

y637ol,1,2022-10-17,The desillusion of my first internship. What should I do ?,Brave-Introduction37,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y637ol/the_desillusion_of_my_first_internship_what/,"Hello everyone !

Last week, I started my internship in a little company as a commercial agent

Before that, I was studying a computer science bachelor but I burned out because I wasn't able to hold the rythm (working until 2 a.m and awakening at 6 a.m everyday yaaaaay) and after a huge introspection, I decided to do something completely different 

The company in itself is kindda good with a lot of different things to learn and that's such a good thing since I'm a very curious person and I never miss a opportunity to ask for work pr some responsibilities since I'm a quick learner and a very atonomous person (always learned stuff by myself)

The thing is, on a human aspect, I feel very anxious and stressed about the people in the company (we are 3 working on the sales aspect of the company and 5 others people working at the shop)

Usually, I'm the kind of person wich talks with everyone and have a good time creating bounds with others because I'm just like ""who cares about what others think of us ? Let's try this stuff, we have nothing to lose !"" But I'm also very analytical about complex stuff and finding solutions.

But inside the company, I just feel like I'm not welcome... Colleagues seems so cold on the break time and it's hard to try to know them just a little in order to know who they are and feeling comfortable with them (asked them little question like in what consist their jobs, what they did before, etc but I always received cold answer and not any ""what about you?"" Excepted some jokes)

My boss is always working even on the break time and has a hard time to explain me how to do stuffs in the company with a lot of theorical stuffs to learn and not a lot of place for experimentation

Las friday, I asked for a review and well... It didn't went good at all because for her, I wasn't learning as fast as she expected from me, showing that I'm superior about others to make them trust me and she thinks I need to be sheken to make me understand stuff wich is kindda disturbing since I still need to find my place inside the company

Other thing is the fact that they accepted me while they are in a huge rush about some projects to finish but nothing feels organized... The tech in the company feels outdated as hell (house software not updated since 2004, way too much folders and files wich doesn't tell what they are, outdated files wich should be deleted, copy of stuffs, etc) and their is no place to think how to do stuffs in the most efficient way or a creative one with no place to creativity, just following the orders and if the boss thinks you didn't make stuff how she wanted it, that's not good even if you did well

One last thing is the fact that what my boss is teaching me feel so blurry and leave me with just too much questions but she has no time to explain me or it's to early for me to know about that wich is very frustrating

I don't know what to do honestly, I cannot put my head outside the company even at home, I feel very stressed, I cannot sleep and don't have any energy anymore, I just want to leave and seatch for a company which feels way open and take the time to teach me how to work in a good way but on the other side, people tells me to wait 3 weeks before making a definitive opinion about the company"

It seems like everyone has a job lined up already and I‚Äôm still struggling to finish leetcode hards because I just don‚Äôt have the time. Does anyone have any advice? I don‚Äôt have any internship experience which I feel puts me at a disadvantage. I know there‚Äôs a recession but I know so many people who already have jobs. My classes this quarter are pretty hard so I don‚Äôt have the time to focus on interviewing right now. Am I screwed if I start looking for jobs next summer? Do I even have a good chance of getting one?

You guys, my problem is the boredom. 

I was working at a salon and it was my first job so I was really excited and I liked it for three months and got bored afterwards. I woke up angry every day. 

Had to leave that bc I had an internship (thank God) at a bank. So I was excited for that too
Like really excited cos after this I‚Äôll be able to work for them and everything I learned at Uni won‚Äôt be in vain. 

however, it has been three months since my internship started and I am again bored and I don‚Äôt know what do cos I do learn different things every day and I like it here, I actually like my colleagues and etc but I‚Äôm bored. 

I can‚Äôt keep doing this boredom thing, cos I‚Äôm growing up and it won‚Äôt be sustainable afterwards. 

Any advice?"

I did multiple projects, and business side of education. I also have a MBA but I still end up in this field. I'm looking for ways to transfer into Tech with my transferrable skills. My aim is to be Tech Project/Product Manager so I'm thinking to take CSM or CSPO since I already have skills. Preparing for PMP too. But at the same time, I'm thinking if I should do coding. I'm a non-US citizen and Bootcamps are not ideal or at all exist in my country. I'm looking for a second master degree in IT management in USA but I will have to spend 80K+ as an international student but the OPT will be really useful for me to get a hands-on internship which I can't find it in my country or the other country I'm working right now.

What are my options to switch into IT career? 

Many thanks."

y6aosz,7,2022-10-17,Should I take an apprenticeship at a place where they use very old software - if provided with the opportunity?,DakkaDak,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/y6aosz/should_i_take_an_apprenticeship_at_a_place_where/,"Hello all, I got a burning question I hope you can help me with!

# TL;DR 

Company I'm interviewing with uses old tech, and I'm not really sure if I want to spend 5 years learning things I may not need, when I could be learning future-relevant things quite effectively on my own in vocational school.

# The issue

I'm currently interviewing with a big european company. I got some doubts once I asked them if they had any primary languages they used in the company, or if it was more of a best-tool-to-fit-the-job thing.

They answered that they had quite a bit of restraints as to what they could use, mainly for security reasons (which is fair of course). I don't recall all languages they listed, but the one that I actually heard clearly was Visual Basic for Applications (I should probably have asked them to repeat the ones I didn't quite get, since they were ones I had not heard of before, but did not want to be impolite).

# Some background on me

* I am attending a vocational school in my first year out of five
* I am very serious about my education, this is the career I want to pursue
* I seem to be learning at a good pace so far in school

# The options

So with that out of the way, should I accept this apprenticeship (paid internship) if I get the opportunity? I'm really torn about this.

On one hand, let's say I get the apprenticeship; would the things I learn here even be applicable in other companies that develop software?

On the other hand, let's say I don't get/decline the apprenticeship; I would continue attending school, learning future-relevant things at a pretty good pace (so far), but not be exposed to real work.

Basically it's all about the long-term for me, whichever one would be the most beneficial one (and I don't particularly like the sound of five years of learning old outdated things). Five years is a long time that I don't want to waste, and I'm basically already in my mid twenties.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear what you all think of this, and let me know if you got any questions that you might have!

Appreciate it!"

The position is completely different from SRE, it is very close to Machine Learning, data analysis and python programming.

y6csam,0,2022-10-17,My family is controlling my life and I feel like I can‚Äôt escape without serious damage,themoocow_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/y6csam/my_family_is_controlling_my_life_and_i_feel_like/,"I (22F) am unsure of what to do about my family. I am constantly under stress and anxiety dealing with them and I don‚Äôt know how much more of it I can take.

My brother (23) and I grew up with my mom, a single mother, and my dad, and my grandmother on my dads side. My mom went on to marry someone else and had another child, my brother (11). Me and my older brothers childhood consisted of a myriad of verbal and physical abuse, constant stress, fights between the courts and our family members, and lies.

My dad is unemployed, and is simply scraping by every day. He doesn‚Äôt do anything, and perhaps that is his fault. He lost his good jobs when I was younger, because he was abusive towards my mother and reverted back to the trouble maker he always was and will be. My dad is enjoyable, as a joke, because he‚Äôs crazy, but as a constant presence and a parent it‚Äôs stressful and confusing. He was physically abusive to my brother and my mom and still sometimes gets into fights with my brother.

My mom is successful, hard working and an absolute narcissist. When we were growing up, she only showed up when it was convenient for her. She is good at providing monetary assistance, and my brother and I don‚Äôt have the ability to support ourselves, especially where we live. This is good however she is often cold, manipulative, neglectful, and aggressive. She is one of those people who will ignore you for something you did wrong but won‚Äôt tell you what it was. She likes to appear better to other people and talk about how much she supported her kids when in reality all she did was give all of us depression and anxiety. She made me hate who I am, and the hold she has over my emotions is debilitating.

My grandmother took care of me and my older brother until we got too old for visiting my dad. My dad lived with my grandma. She is caring, but overbearing, hateful and callous. She took care of us but often berated and screams and yells at us saying things to us as children that you wouldn‚Äôt say to even someone you hated. I can‚Äôt do anything without a terrible opinion coming from her and her threatening to withhold things from me so that I will obey her. 

I am not a bad person. I am smart, I go to college, I am currently an intern at a very good company and I have many friends and people who love and support me on the outside. I also just like to enjoy life. I don‚Äôt do drugs, I‚Äôm not having s*x or meeting boys, I don‚Äôt party and drink and I‚Äôm very adamant about doing something with my life. This is how I am seen by my friends, colleagues, coworkers, professors, mentors and doctors. My family sees me as a lazy, stupid, and a trouble maker who has no common sense. I‚Äôve literally never gotten into trouble.

I have to hide or sugar coat everything I do. I don‚Äôt lie I just make it more acceptable for me to not be berated. Even going over my best friends house to sleep over can turn into a world war. So I just say I‚Äôm visiting. Right know I am doing a different program for credits at my school. I haven‚Äôt told them as they would call me names and berate me. I can‚Äôt go out to dinner with a close friend, someone I‚Äôve known all my life, without it being the worst decision of my life ending up in all 3 of them blowing up my phone telling me to get home and I‚Äôm doing stupid shit. I can‚Äôt even enjoy going to the movies anymore. They say it‚Äôs stupid sh*t, a waste of time, and I need to get home.

They have made having an open dialogue with them impossible. They make me cry over enjoying my life and youth in simple ways. They berate me for the way I act and do things because I‚Äôm annoying or weird to them or stupid. No one else sees me like that.

I would leave but the things I have that are helping me I wouldn‚Äôt have without them. My car, my phone, some of my bills, and I can‚Äôt do those things on my own in the city that we live in. 

I feel so helpless and trapped that often I think about killing myself to avoid telling them things I enjoy doing in life or revealing the small things I don‚Äôt tell them that I do or have done. Nothing bad, just like a park I may have went to, or a restaurant I have tried, or even going to the beach.

I have often theorized that because I am a female and my family is mostly old fashioned and religious that I have become a black sheep for simply being a girl. It‚Äôs traditional for the girls stay home to do all of the work and have the responsibility to take care of their family. I was always treated worse than my older brother, something he has seen and has admitted as obvious. He gets more leeway with what he can say to them, he can cuss them out, swear, hang up on them and have a tantrum and they will still give him what he wants. God forbid I sound slightly tired on the phone, now I‚Äôm getting threatened again. My mother and I have always had a rocky relationship with me trying to defend myself against her abuse but I find the best thing is for me to not be around her as much. It‚Äôs worked for quantity of incidents but other issues have arose. 

My mom has been expecting me to be home with no warning to watch my brother. I already pick him up 4 out of 5 days if the week from school. I may not be home that day my mom may not see me that week but I still will always help him. It just so happens on this one day something always comes up. This time I had gotten tickets to a museum in a famous town. I was going to be gone all day, I warned her days before. She still called me the day of angry about it. I told my grandma and dad what I was doing and as usual they thought I was a huge liar, I‚Äôm getting in trouble, I‚Äôm hanging around the wrong crowd, I‚Äôm doing stupid things, etc.

I got home later than expected and my mother locked me out. She has done this before, to teach me lessons or as a punishment but we were on a good streak I did a everything she wanted and I had been extra careful When I called her she opened the door, slammed it behind her and ignored my calls and plea‚Äôs about what I did wrong for her to be angry at me again. My dad texted me calling me a good liar and I am doing something that I‚Äôm getting caught up in. He‚Äôs called me a b*tch, stupid, etc for‚Ä¶ nothing other than his delusions about what I could be doing.

This has been going on for so long. I don‚Äôt do anything wrong. I‚Äôm not caught up in anything. I‚Äôm trying my best to help. I almost cancelled today for my brother like I always do, but she said I could go. I should‚Äôve known better it‚Äôs always a lie and a test‚Ä¶.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take being called a liar for doing nothing wrong. I don‚Äôt know much much more insults and verbal abuse and induced anxiety attacks.

I need help on how to escape this situation with me in one piece or at least advice on how to deal with a family like this."

y6e3bh,2,2022-10-17,How to become freelance website designer?,garvitkasera,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y6e3bh/how_to_become_freelance_website_designer/," Choose your niche.

When it comes to being a freelance web designer, you can specialize in designing for a specific industry, or you can be a generalist who can design websites for a variety of businesses. Consider your skillset and decide which type of design work you‚Äôd like to focus on.

Get some experience.

Once you‚Äôve decided on your niche, it‚Äôs time to start building your portfolio. If you don‚Äôt have any previous experience designing websites, you can start by working on some personal projects, or you can look for internships or entry-level jobs with web design firms.

Create a strong portfolio.

Your portfolio is one of the most important tools you have as a freelancer. It‚Äôs where potential clients will go to see your work and decide if you‚Äôre the right person for the job. Make sure your portfolio showcases your best work, and don‚Äôt be afraid to show a variety of projects to demonstrate your range.

Develop a strong web presence.

In today‚Äôs world, a strong web presence is essential for any freelance professional. Make sure your website is up-to-date and easy to navigate, and that you have an active blog and social media accounts. This will give you a platform to share your work, attract new clients, and build your brand.

Stay up-to-date with industry trends.

As a freelance web designer, it‚Äôs important to keep up with the latest industry trends. This will not only make you more marketable, but it will also help you create better designs. Stay abreast of new technologies, design trends, and user experience best practices by reading industry blogs, attending web design conferences, and taking online courses.

Get organized.

Freelancing can be a bit chaotic, so it‚Äôs important to develop strong organizational skills. Keep your project files organized, set up a system for tracking payments, and maintain regular communication with your clients. This will help you stay on top of projects and avoid any potential problems.

Know your worth.

When it comes to setting your rates, don‚Äôt underestimate yourself. Remember that you‚Äôre providing a valuable service and that you should be compensated accordingly. Do some research to find out what other designers in your area are charging, and then set a rate that you‚Äôre comfortable with.

Be professional.

As a freelancer, you are your own brand. This means that it‚Äôs important to present yourself in a professional manner at all times. This includes everything from the way you communicate with clients to the way you dress for meetings. By maintaining a professional image, you‚Äôll instill confidence in potential clients and set yourself apart from the competition.

y6fgx5,7,2022-10-17,Should I move from a large automotive company to a startup?,Temporary-World-8115,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/y6fgx5/should_i_move_from_a_large_automotive_company_to/,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for advice on my next move. For context:

* Working at a huge german automotive supplier company for 5 years now (from internship all the way to a senior-like role now), making about 85k, in the computer vision machine learning area
* Recently got rejected after an AWS loop interview, but got told I should re-apply in 6 months (instead of the normal 2 year minimum wait time)
* Have an offer for 102k + options at a (IMO exciting) startup working in synthetic data

In general I‚Äôm looking to leave automotive, as I've come to hate automotive and all its red tape, bloated processes, terrible understanding of SWE, etc.

(Main) Reasons I like the startup offer

* I'm still &lt;30 years old, now is probably the best time to still experiment with different industries, company types, etc.
* Company seems stable and have exciting challenges (= learn new things), cutting edge, moving fast, have more contract offers than they can even take on 
* Continues my computer vision ML specialization
* Allows me to make a measurable impact on the business
* Experience in an entrepreneurial environment to maybe someday make my own company

Re-applying to AWS or similar FAANGs is (and was) stressful, would probably delay my switch by another 6+ months at this point (I've been ""poking"" the market for about 3/4th of a year now) and is not guaranteed.

**That said,** I‚Äôm wondering how moving to the startup looks to outsiders if I were to apply at bigger companies again down the line and if anyone even cares that much as long as you delivered results. Obviously I‚Äôd be ignoring the typical career advice to *gradually* go from bigger to smaller company etc.

**What do you think of this move?** Is there anything fundamentally wrong/weird with my reasons?"
y6flxk,1,2022-10-17,Marketing or Finance?,dpickle29,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y6flxk/marketing_or_finance/,"I (22F) recently graduated with my BA in business administration with a concentration in marketing. Towards the end of my senior year I happened to get an internship at one of the biggest investment banks, despite having any experience or much knowledge of finance. I was hired by an FA who wanted me to take care of prospecting and some administrative work. My internship has given me an in to a great company where I can begin working in the finance world. As it is a 9 month position, it is going to come to an end in December and I cannot decide where I want to go. 

I‚Äôm also still in school to get my MBA online, and was planning on doing a concentration in marketing. I‚Äôve always had interests in brand management, social media marketing, e-commerce, developing content, etc. 

About a month ago, I had a really good connection get me on a phone call with a PR company. They had sent my resume to the CEO who referred me to the hiring team. 
I was told that there is an entry position that would be suitable for me that is a part of their digital marketing team. She told me that as it is entry level, people get promoted after a year and the position opens up every few months. Therefore, I would have to wait. I followed up with her a few weeks after and she said that the position wasn‚Äôt available yet but she would ‚Äúwant to keep an open line of communication‚Äù. 

For the past few weeks I have been sending my resume out to various internships (even unpaid) and positions but no one as good as the company I‚Äôm currently in, or the PR company is going to reply to me due to my lack of experience. It‚Äôs really difficult to stand out with a mediocre resume when there are hundreds of other applicants (lol). Working for the PR company would be like a dream job, but I can‚Äôt expect that I would actually get hired eventually. 

I am really interested in marketing, but I feel like I would be able to make a better living if I stayed in finance, and maybe even declared a finance concentration for my MBA. I also had someone tell me that if I worked in finance for a few years, I would be able to ‚Äúpick any marketing job that I wanted‚Äù. 

Can anyone provide guidance on which path could be more successful?"

**Background**:

I'm really not set on the idea of going to business school. As is evident from my profile, my main passion is technology, but I would like to move to management instead of just being a code monkey. I feel like my academics are strong, I do very well with standardized tests and I'm confident I could write solid essays. The only thing that truly worries me is my complete lack of extracurriculars. Most of my involvement has been admittedly superficial, and since I graduate in May, I don't have a ton of time to add more. There are a couple opportunities I could pursue but not a ton. Essentially what I'm curious about it, is it even worth it to apply to these M7 programs? If my lack of involvement will preclude me from being admitted to a deferred program, than I'd rather save the time and money.

**Work Experience:**

* Data engineering internship with large insurance company
* Either going to accept a software engineering job with a large bank or with a tech consulting firm  

**School:**

* Large, Public southeastern state school. BS in Computer Science, Minor in Business Admin
* 3.97/4.0 GPA

**ECs:**

* Participated in a handful of hackathons
* Briefly involved in school's product management club

**GMAT/GRE:**

* 770 GMAT (Mocks)

**Goals/Target:**  
I'm interested in going into tech consulting - I like the variability and practicality of the work

*Reach*:

* HBS 2+2
* GSB Deferred
* Wharton Deferred
* Sloan Deferred"

The main problem would be that if I take too many hits on my GPA I would lose the grants that are allowing me to go to CC for free.

My main questions are:

- Would it be a good idea to switch to MIS? I know that CompSci and CompE degrees are much more valuable than MIS, especially for internships and opportunities, but would the extra effort be worth it in the long run?

- Did I pick the wrong career because I wasn't ""smart enough""?

y6n6e4,69,2022-10-17,Narcissistic First Gen Student - College Admissions Fraud,Foreign-Chair4867,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/y6n6e4/narcissistic_first_gen_student_college_admissions/,"When I was a high school senior, I was awarded a full-tuition scholarship from a pretty popular scholarship that recruits students and matches them to a college/university. To each college that they have a partnership with, they send a cohort of ten students. For 8-months prior to starting our first semester, we have to meet weekly for two hours. In these sessions we get to know each other and the whole point is to bond and help each other be a support system for one another. From the start, I immediately got bad vibes from a girl, let‚Äôs call her Samantha, that always had a cold demeanor. She befriended two of the other girls, and the cohort quickly felt very clique-y. She always made sure to make us feel excluded, and was unnecessarily rude. 

As I stated in these sessions we are supposed to basically share our stories, how we grew up, our values, how we see the world, etc. So we are basically trauma dumping to each other. I caught on to one of her lies really early on, this is probably at like the 4th month since the cohort began to meet. Samantha talked about her older brother frequently and made sure to always emphasize that he attended a prestigious university. I had Samantha on Facebook so I one day lurked and found her brother‚Äôs page, and after digging through it he did not attend the prestigious university she claimed he attended, rather he was at our local state school. I basically told everyone in the cohort (except Samantha and the two other girls) and not that anyone didn‚Äôt believe me, but I think we were all too afraid to bring this up to our coaches/counselors, that oversaw our weekly meetings. We all knew the horrible attitude and defensiveness that Samantha had, so we did not address this then.

Fast forward to the time we are starting our first semester and her lies keep expanding. She continues to say her brother graduated from the prestigious university and was now attending a prestigious law school. I unfortunately left the school on medical leave (and eventually withdrew) due to the culture shock I had of attending a predominately white institution as a first gen student. I continued to suspect that she was not just lying about her brother, but everything that she said. 

It wasn‚Äôt until two years later that the truth was revealed. I still kept in touch with one of the girl‚Äôs in the cohort because we were close friends so this is how I stayed in the loop with everything. To keep it short, Samantha had a fallout with the two girls she was close with. I‚Äôm not sure how they found out, but they reported her to the college. Samantha had been lying about her whole story. In our weekly sessions she talked about her father being deported, being in and out of the forest care system, how she had to clean homes with her mom, etc. It was all a lie. She would steal people‚Äôs stories from the multiple conferences, programs, and organizations she was a apart of. She would literally even attend therapy groups on campus that were for students who were undocumented or had family that are undocumented. She would also get financial support from the college for her ‚Äúemergency situations‚Äù like flying back home because her dad had court hearings. 

I had suspected that she was lying about all of this but how fucked is it to think that someone would lie about their father being deported. Even more fucked up when people in our cohort were actually undocumented and/or had family members who were. Anyways after she was reported more things came forward like how she was violent and aggressive towards people on campus (people in these cohorts were literally hiding and staying together because they were afraid she was going to come and hurt them). She was like MIA from the campus for awhile and I think was treating to kill herself/saying she was mentally ill. Which to me, you clearly do if you have no damn empathy or remorse for manipulating everyone around you. 

In the end, the college did not expel her and she was able to graduate and still be part of the scholarship program. It‚Äôs crazy to me how these institutions will go out of their way to brush off things for the sake they they are not sued. I truly hate that this girl is now working a full-time job and had no repercussions for her disgusting actions. I 

Edit: The title is not an exaggeration. This girl lied about her WHOLE life story and got prestigious scholarships, internships, money from the college, money from community members who wanted to support her. Lying for monetary gain, IS being a fraud.I also want to emphasize that I do not use the word narcissistic lightly, I know many people throw it around. This girl seriously lacked empathy, had the biggest ego/attitude, and it was always a ‚Äútrauma olympics‚Äù with her like gaslighting you into making you feel bad because she had it worse than you. I‚Äôve left out a lot of details but this was truly a traumatic experience for me and especially for those that formed a friendship with this girl, bonded because of their traumas, only for it to all be a lie."

4 YOE, SF Bay Area, white guy who didn't grow up rich or go to a high tier CS college, been working for a FAANG (the voice controlled device side of the South American River one) for the last year. I think the development work we do is cool and interesting but I'm getting really sick of the culture.

I worked in a variety of roles in different spaces before that, mainly government and defense with an internship at a fintech startup that has grown a lot and IPOd since while I was in undergrad.

Out of everywhere I've worked, the places I've liked the least have all been the ones with a high degree of stereotypical Bay Area ""Big Tech"" FAANG type culture.

The work has usually been very interesting at those places but I've found their general culture and the attitudes of my coworkers at those places the worst by far.

The main issue I've run into at the FAANGs and FAANG-wannabes I've worked at has been a total lack of sincerity and candor at every level.

It seems like it's impossible for anyone at these places to speak directly about anything unless it's management trying to make you feel bad about doing something they don't like after it's too late to do anything to fix the issue proactively.

The rest of the time all communication is nothing but soulless corporate buzzword bullshitting that would put Patrick Bateman to shame, company Kool-Aid butt-chugging, gaslighting and straight up lies that make it impossible to relate to both your peers and seniors/bosses on anything besides the most superficial, dehumanized, transactional level or know where you really stand on anything.

No I don't mean this in the ""I can't go on a Mel Gibson rant at work, literally 1984"" sense. I mean staying professional but acting like a real human being who works with other real human beings, not a sociopathic lizard person who works with a bunch of soulless interchangeable robots.

I get that some degree of needing to ""play the game"" is inevitable but these companies take it to a ridiculous extent. Is totally selling your soul and humanity really what it takes to make it at these places?

Do I just need to up my Adderall prescription in order to become that particular kind of psychopathic culturally poisonous yuppie scum who only sees their fellow human beings and the community they currently inhabit as a consumable resource to shamelessly discard for a new one once they've strip-mined all the value out of them and destroyed them in the process?

Does anyone else feel the same about stereotypical ""tech"" culture here?"

- English Teacher: She‚Äôs one of the teachers I have had the most out of class contact of. She‚Äôs kinda like a laid back person who writes really well and is from the US.

y6uatr,0,2022-10-17,How Do I Balance College?,Impressive_Ad7185,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/y6uatr/how_do_i_balance_college/,"I'll keep it short and sweet.

I'm a current freshman who is actively involved in six to seven extra-curricular activities, dedicating about 15-20 hours a week to them, if not more. I was originally taking seven classes, or eighteen credits, but the class proved to be too difficult, in which I dropped it and plan to retake it over the summer. Now I'm taking fifteen credits, which is still considered to be a full-time student.

I also dedicate my time to actively seeking out and applying to scholarships, job &amp; internship opportunities, and attending workshops to increase my knowledge about potential tech companies that may hire me over the summer. And lastly, I am at the beginning of becoming involved in a sport, specifically volleyball, which may (or may not) be taking up the majority of my time in the evenings.

Did I mention I participate in Fitness Friday's at the gym and do glow in the dark cycling AND yoga?!  ;D

On a serious note, I'm panicking. Not like anyone cares. Everyone always replies with ""I'm struggling too, babe"" or ""Yeah, I feel you"".

I feel as though I'm taking on a lot and I need to take a step back, but I just can't because I'm so focused and set on achieving the goals I have in my mind. They're these goals that are blaring in my mind, and I'd consider myself an absolute failure if I didn't achieve them. And at times, I want to cry because I'm beating myself down, but I need to keep going.

I come from a low income family, my mother works part-time. My father is currently not involved in my life. I also come from a toxic at-home living situation, and this is the first time I've gotten a real taste of freedom and involvement. In high school, my grades sucked kinda (graduated with a 3.5), and if it weren't for my living situation I could've done better. I could've been more involved.

Now, my life is in my hands. I just turned 18 and I feel that I need to step up to the plate. I've mapped out my whole life before I came here:

I'll get a job, participate in extra curriculars, get a 4.0 gpa. I'll declare either my minor or my dual degree. I will also work internships over the summer. Then I'll transfer to my dream school if they offer a full ride tuition (this is why my 4.0 is important) and join the accelerated masters program in which I'll attain my true education. At my dream school, I'll either rush a sorority or join the dance team, volleyball team, or the cheerleading team. And when I graduate, I'll become either a Financial Tech Advisor or a Data Analyst. I will then be able to provide for my mother and buy a comfy condo (which I've already picked out) on the beach. This said beach is aslo where I'll meet my husband. My kids will then be a legacy to the school I went to!

I'm just stressed though. How do people do this for four years? Each day, its go, go go. I never get to rest. And I hardly sleep, geez. I'm stuck in the library until 2am most of the time, and even then, I'm still doing work.

Someone please tell me it'll be okay and give me tips on balancing it all."

If you believe you‚Äôve found somebody better suited by that time I‚Äôd be grateful to have had the opportunity to try. Thank you for taking the time to read my appeal to you.

y6y0zs,4,2022-10-18,Apply to Vanderbilt's Merit-Based Full-Tuition Scholarships (Due December 1st)!,EbbComprehensive839,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/y6y0zs/apply_to_vanderbilts_meritbased_fulltuition/,"**TLDR: The Ingram Scholarship is freaking awesome so PLEASE APPLY! Especially if you want to engage in social impact or service in your future (could be any career: doctor, lawyer, chef, etc.). I am an Ingram Scholar so I'm definitely not biased ! My views are also my views only: they do not reflect the views of the program (please don't sue me Vanderbilt).**

Vanderbilt has three full-tuition scholarship programs: the Ingram Scholarship, Chancellor's Scholarship, and Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship. The money is very nice, but each one also offers unique benefits. I will primarily speak to the Ingram Scholarship but as an example, Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholars also have their own honors seminars.

The Ingram Scholarship is awesome. I've only been here two months but the best thing is honestly the community. The program has around forty people and each person is amazing: they're both incredibly accomplished and kind, which are two things that don't tend to go together these days. People are also doing incredibly different things: some are pre-law, others are working in tech or doing CS PhDs,  others are going to medical school, and some are starting companies. On the website it says we want business people (not directly but feels like it tbh) but to be honest, **we're really just looking for people who want to incorporate service in their career and beyond** (you don't have to want to be a C-level executive or non-profit leader: service takes place in different contexts). We're focused on service learning so we volunteer 4+ hours/week at Nashville nonprofits. Service learning is based on the concept that there are some skills/contexts that only service can teach you so we research service, talk about it, and do a ton of it. Here's the service learning breakdown:

* 4+ hours/week volunteering at nonprofits: Helping out the community while learning about different contexts. We're a guest in each community, aiming to understand and help out in any way possible but also realizing that we can never fully empathize with underserved populations because we are not in those situations.
* 2-Hour meeting once a week (three-week rotation year-round)
   * Week One - All-Scholars Meeting: Engaging with alumni guest speakers, discussing service, leadership/development activities, etc.
   * Week Two - Cohort Meeting (based on year in school)
      * Freshman year: Frank Wade Experience - Super kind, smart advisor Frank Wade takes us to different awesome Nashville nonprofits and we learn how they function from their leaders
      * Sophomore year: Service project preparation (more details below)
      * Junior year: Learning about the intersections between social impact, sustainability, and business from Jeff Gowdy (haven't met him yet but he's a legend)
      * Senior year: Learning philanthropic concepts and practicing philanthropy with $1,200 stipend
   * Week Three - Small Group Meeting (small groups of 6-7 people assigned randomly)
      * Just fun stuff: eating at Nada, paintballing, hiking, painting, etc.
* Service Project - We spend sophomore year preparing for the summer service project. During sophomore summer, we work with a company/nonprofit to engage in a service project. This project can be anything, ranging from eye clinics in India to computer education in Latin America to service partnerships with companies like Accenture. We get $7,000 and a summer to create lasting and meaningful impact.

I hope all that has sold you on the scholarship, It's freaking awesome. And also hard to get. It had a 2% acceptance rate this year and there are three essays and an interview. But that's not to discourage you. Even if you're not sure if you'll get it, **PLEASE APPLY**. I want you to think about this in terms of expected value. Over four years, you'll get **$320,000** of value (20k per year in perks/other activities + 60k per year full-tuition). If you have a 1% chance of getting it (you definitely do -- work on those essays!), that's **$3,200** in expected value. So work on it for however many hours you think that amount of money is worth. If that's one day, you're making more than some interns at quant firms. If it's more than that, LFGGG your chances of getting it are now higher so expected value is simultaneously increasing. 

Feel free to drop any questions down below! I'll respond to everything."

Like the title says, I created a course for anyone who wants to learn how to create a backend API project.

I've seen that many people wanted to have projects in their portfolio for job search but weren't sure where to get started and how to finish a project, so I thought it'd be a good idea to do a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a project.

In this course, you will create a Twitter clone with Python and MySQL, and I expect the participants to have some programming knowledge because I'm not going to go over the basic concepts and syntaxes.

The course is divided into multiple sections, and at the end of each section you will be given exercises that are reasonably challenging so you can apply and actually do something with what you've learned.

There is already one person who finished the course and aced the interview. Apparently, the employer was surprised by how much he knew about API development as an intern applicant! So if you're in a similar spot, I hope you share the same success through this material.

Please note that there are no strings attached. The only thing I would really appreciate would be some constructive feedback.

There is a link to my Slack channel where you can ask me if you get stuck.

Cheers!!

I guess I am just looking for tips on where to start on the job searching. It feels daunting every time I try to spend time and look for jobs because I feel like I am not experienced enough due to no prior computer related jobs. 

I am currently a Pharmacy Technician in a 24 hour retail pharmacy as well, so the chaos of my job and the long hours certainly don't help me either. Usually when I get home from work, doing anything else feels way to stressful including job hunting. So my current job combined with how daunting the new job hunting process is going for me has kept me in this perpetual loop for the past few months.


What would you recommend for a starting out programmer trying to land their first job? Would most of you recommend I look for internships first? Because I make $17 an hour right now working at the CVS down the road from me, and I need to land a new job that either pays the same and is close still or a new job that pays a few dollars per hour more if it is further away due to travel costs. 

It would also need to be a full-time job and preferably come with employee benefits like health insurance as well because soon I will be kicked off of my parents health plan and will need my own. I specify this because I feel like with my limited experience I might only be able to find part-time jobs or internships, but would prefer a full-time job if it is possible for someone like me to obtain with my limited work-related experience.

Every job posting I have looked at so far requires some past work experience, even at the entry-level jobs. Is there something specific I should be looking for when looking for a job that hires with no past work experience?

If you want more specifics, I live in the Atlanta area in Georgia near the city of Kennesaw. I have been programming since Freshman year of high school at the age of 14 and am now currently 25.

I know how to do front-end and back-end website coding. I know Python, Visual Basic (it has been awhile...), Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, C++ (some), and PHP. I am certified in CompTIA ITF+ (IT Fundamentals). My Associate's degree in Web Application Development also came with Certificates attached for Java Programming Fundamentals then Java, C#, and PHP Programming to show employers I am certified in that language. 

So... Where should I start out when looking for a job to apply to? And... What prerequisites do you all think I would meet? I ask so I have a better idea of what I should look for when choosing to apply and what I shouldn't apply for with my current credentials..."
y76qhk,2,2022-10-18,can I make a pdf maker Android application with only c language?,Infinite-Rooster-996,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/y76qhk/can_i_make_a_pdf_maker_android_application_with/,"I'm currently learning c language and was thinking of making projects after I finish with basic topics . The only project rn coming in my mind is to make a pdf maker. 

I know it's not that unique of a project but i have some gameplan for this. Though i think it will be a very very difficult task and if it was possible someone would have already made this type of pdf maker .
The plan is to make a pdf maker apk that has many features like jpeg/doc/ppt/excel to pdf or vice versa ,adding password to pdf, merging and compressing pdf  etc 

But a very unique and important upgrade im thinking of is making a pdf scanner .what I'm trying to think of is 
That the user will just scan any already printed text article of their book with their camera .the application will start writing the texts (not images of any kind ) on its whiteboard to which user can also add texts or edit texts if the scanner scans in wrong order or way . 

It then converts the scanned texts into pdf later on after user is finished with scanning the texts of his book . 

With this user wouldn't have to waste time on first taking pictures of each and every page and then assemble the pics and then convert them into pdf .
With this method user wouldn't have to have extra space for images he taken so imagine u wouldn't have to trouble yourself of taking 150 pages for a single pdf and then delete them after making a pdf . 


All I'm doing is to just make good projects to find internships in cities and i don't think i can make a buisness out of it cuz let's say if this somehow perfectly worked and many people are buying this application from me 
It wouldn't even take a good pdf maker company like Adobe to update to this feature even better than me . 


I really hope u all like this idea and feel free to share true things about this like my friend who said it's very impossible and you would need to learn ai for this which i believe is true ."

I generally get along fine with my team. And the career prospect is above average. There is just one problem - my boss thinks he‚Äôs close to us (he‚Äôs not technically wrong) and jokes about everything.

I have a really sarcastic sense of humour and I almost never get offended at any of the jokes my boss came up with. But I recently rescued 2 budgie parakeets. And the jokes got a bit uncomfortable.

Like, my boss repeatedly call them KFCs, that they ‚Äútaste like chicken‚Äù, and ‚Äúare you eating parakeets for dinner‚Äù, etc.. I‚Äôd repeatedly asked him to stop. But I don‚Äôt think the message is coming across because he makes way more offensive jokes at my expenses and I never seem to get offended.

It‚Äôs getting to a point where I‚Äôm thinking about quitting, once the economy gets better. I know it probably sounds like a really trivial reason to quite a corporate job over. But it‚Äôs affecting my mental health.

What would you do in my position?"
y794xx,3,2022-10-18,Crypto vs Traditional MM,randomthrowaway281,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/y794xx/crypto_vs_traditional_mm/,"I‚Äôve recently gotten a SWE offer from a traditional prop shop (one of Optiver, Jump, DRW, IMC, 2S) and one from a tiny crypto firm (think Dexterity, Alameda, GSR, Wintermute, etc) and was not sure what choice to go for.

I guess the main drawbacks of the crypto firm include:
- Lower comp / risk of being fired if I don‚Äôt perform / web3 dies down
- Way less people at work, might be hard to get close to coworkers
- No name (although I have done an internship at another prop shop) if wanting to switch back to trad trading / tech.
- Probably worse WLB/culture

Benefits:
- Higher initial comp
- More upside if I do well and web3 keeps growing
- More interesting work
- Flexibility regarding remote

Any advice would be appreciated."

Pretty much since the start of university, I had a lot of interest in DSA/CP, and most of my seniors told that's the most important part for internships, so I overlooked everything else and focused just on that. Now the intern season arrived, all I had was pretty basic front end projects (won couple of hackathons with one of them) and a decent CP profile.

I got a perfect score in almost all the companies that I gave the online assessment test for, but got shortlisted for interviews just once, for which I got rejected in the final round. A lot of companies went on hiring freeze amidst the intern hiring procedures, so got quite unlucky. My resume is formatted as per the university format, and my cgpa is pretty high.

I started applying off campus, and I barely received any response to it. So, I've a couple of things I want advise on. How do I get an off campus internship?
And what changes should I make in my profile for the placements season, ie, should I start focusing more towards projects from now onwards or what should I do?

I'm K, a 21F, and for the first time in my life I completely on the fence. I was hoping some third-party advice might clear things up for me. Any advice is welcome - even for something as simple as *when* I should make the choice.

TW - mention of sexual abuse

Buckle up, there's a lot of detail to the story that very much factors into the pros and cons of both right now.

In spring of 2021, living at home in Virginia, I was accepted to study for my bachelor's degree in Estonia. I was so excited, because I was finally going to be pursuing a college degree on a full-ride. $0 couldn't even compare to the meager scholarships Virginia 4-yr universities could offer me. I was also very excited to come because I am half-Estonian myself. I've had the privilege of visiting many times in my life, but I had always wanted to live there to be closer to my family, really learn the language, become integrated with the culture, and to see what life outside the US was like.

Fast forward a year later (Sept 2022), and I was absolutely miserable; the depression and inability to fathom life beyond a few days' time was all-encompassing. Estonia wasn't without its share of hardships. For one, the culture was very uninviting to foreigners. There have been many times where my language has been mocked, I've been told to go back to my country, and have been met with social rejection. I have tried connecting through hobbies, through peers at school, through language courses, really anything. I cried so hard my first day back in Estonia after summer break realizing that I had not a single friend to go to. That was a tough pill to swallow because I've always been a social butterfly, always have had deep/meaningful friendships, and have always gotten along well with others. A year later, and I still had no roots?

Family life was hard here, too. I've always been extremely lucky to have such strong familial ties back home in VA, and it just hasn't been the case here in Estonia. I've tried to connect with my family members, engage with them, enjoy activities with them, etc. The most telling was after I finally opened up about some of my deepest trauma I suffered here in Estonia - r\*pe. Of course, it sucked, and I still carry this unresolved trauma with me from the sheer shock of it all, but it doesn't even come close to the feeling of sobbing in front of your only family, begging for help and connection and a shoulder to cry on, just to be shunned and ignored.

By spring 2022, I was sure Estonia wasn't the place for me, but at least I had a free education... right? Well, the quality is about what you'd expect it to be. I've never been a jealous person, but I couldn't help but envy the professional connections, peer networking, and community many of my VA friends found at their home universities. I came here for educational and social experience, neither of which bearing any fruit. I can pass classes anywhere with enough grit and determination, but what's my college degree without any of the skills I'm supposed to have with it?

Bless my mom, she bought me a plane ticket home late September 2022 after one too many breakdowns over the phone.

The amount of healing I experienced was incredible while visiting home. I was introduced to the idea of moving back home and completing my college degree here, which I couldn't believe I hadn't even thought of. I had time to reconnect with my family, my BF (studying at a VA uni), and my friends. I got to talk all this over with them, and they agreed - come home. I spent the week making the **first of my plans**: go to community college during the spring semester while working at a job I love, take out some loans, transfer to a 4yr uni in VA, complete my bachelor's ""a year late"", but have access to all of those networking, internship, and club opportunities I had always wanted deep in my heart of hearts.

Great, I flew back to Estonia with a new game plan. Except... everything got much better? Which is fantastic! But part of me is wondering if this new outlook on life was BECAUSE I had made up my mind to leave, and could now enjoy life on a more superficial note, or if it was the universe's way of telling me to give Estonia another shot. Granted, Estonia is not all sunshine and roses like VA always seems to be, but little things that mattered to me have gotten better. Family members have been reaching out to me, asking to connect with me, they miss me, etc. Peers have been more inviting and have asked me to join them for fun occasionally. I began my first mentor relationship with one of my professors, who has been introducing me to networking activities in the area. Life is by no means perfect, but drastically different from a month ago. This started kicking in my reasoning skills, or **the other plan**: staying in Estonia, graduating on-time, and finishing a $0 degree.

So, TL;DR do I stay in Estonia or do I go back to the States? My heart is in VA, but I want to feel like I've given Estonia the best shot I could've."

y7fzgv,1061,2022-10-18,No one actually talks about Computer Science in this subreddit.,domcantreed,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y7fzgv/no_one_actually_talks_about_computer_science_in/,"I can barely find a single post that is actually about computer science. It is only jobs.  


If you look at highest in the top post in the last month, all you see is Rejection Emails, Leetcode, Jobs, Internships, and how this sub sucks basically.  


I just wish people would actually talk about Computer Science within my major. I genuinely love computer science but its actually impossible to talk to people in this reddit about computer science. It would be cool if people kept the computer science career stuff in the cs career subreddit.   


It would be interesting to see more topics about things like good resources people use to learn Operating Systems. Or good resources to become a better programmer for college students. But these things are rare in this subreddit."
y7g1au,75,2022-10-18,I haven't gotten any positive responses from my applications and I don't understand why,Hanbarner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y7g1au/i_havent_gotten_any_positive_responses_from_my/,"About me: I graduated in May with a BA in Computer Science. I had initially planned to do IT or something and only realized I wanted to do web development in my last semester of school, and unfortunately I didn't do any internships or any meaningful extracurriculars during my time in school. Since I felt like I was missing experience, I took a Full-Stack Bootcamp over the summer. I also have a few years of unrelated work experience if that matters.

I've been applying to junior/entry level full-stack and frontend developer positions, but I haven't gotten anything more than a rejection. From what I've been reading that means it's a problem with the resume. I paid for a resume from TopResume last month however, and to seemingly no avail. 

I really don't want to lock myself into a contracted position from one of those consulting groups or use one of those services that takes 15% of your salary, but I'm growing increasingly worried that will be my only option. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated here.


Edit:

[This](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vTd_AGNGwPrhhwLn2KJZc3bW1FATb50qbAbWs2tu6cWKDhZdLCuUF_2ljJEcNEZtg/pub) is the resume I resumed from them

Edit 2: Thank you for all the helpful replies. Aside from improving the formatting of my resume, I was previously under the impression that I should be overselling myself and my qualifications. I will focus on selling myself realistically as a candidate and start tailoring my resume more to each job description."

About 8 minutes on Q1 and 12 on Q2. I'm always worried that there's hidden test cases or something where the system will make you think ""oh fuck yeah I solved it successfully"" but then your solution was actually dogshit and the only way to know it is to figure it out yourself.

I didn't spend a TON of time optimizing. I did do a second pass on Q1 and improved it slightly, and spent a whopping 30 seconds wondering if a better runtime for Q2 is possible, and decided ""nope!"" (because I sorted the input, and some requirements of the output indicated to me that the input being sorted makes sense)

So should I feel good about finishing it quickly and passing the test cases? Or should I have spent the extra 40 minutes thinking harder about if I could find more optimal solutions?"

Want to join FAANG or any other top Tech companies in the world. Does not have any work or study permit in any country outside Bangladesh. So, please guide me on which track I should follow.

Some of my friends are suggesting me to do Masters in US/Canada and get an internship/new grad position from there. According to them it is nearly impossible to land on FAANG or any other top companies from outside Europe / America. Is that true? 

Is it easier to land into FAANG from the Masters -&gt; Internship -&gt; Entry Level / New Grad path? Can't I just continue my job here + solve 300+ LCs -&gt; apply to the companies in Senior positions and expect an offer after completing OAs + Phone Call Interviews? Are they really difficult for foreigners?

Please note that, any company which offers 80K+ will be okay. Not just FAANG."

I'm 16 and currently studying for my A levels in year 12 at a local school. After finishing A levels, I would like to study Computer Science at the university. Since I would really love to go to the best universities in the UK (Cambridge, Oxford etc.), I believe they really value the real life work experience that you might have had. To add to that, I have plenty of time during the summer or other holidays and even after school to fill it with something useful and giving me some little income.

Do you know any places or ways that I can get a summer or part-time internship given that I am not yet in university? Or if it is not really possible, what else can I do to improve my appearance amongs thousands of other people that will be applying for the same course? I am doing a lot of programming on my own and I really enjoy that, but perhaps there is a way to combine the ""enjoy"" part and having a job that brings me actual money."

We were high school classmates and first year he used to kinda bully me but eventually covid lockdown came and I stopped talking to my friends other than online class notes during the lockdown. When we were talking on Discord one day, we were playing games and he was depressed so I comforted him and told about my problems, told everything is gonna be okay etc. That day he said from now on he is my slave which I thought was a joke and said obviously no. From that moment he would always make his names on Discord like ""xxx's Slave"" and call me master. He would always ask me to be his master but I always refused it. One day I made him wait 30 or so minutes in a cold winter day in the subway because I told him the wrong station. I felt bad for him so I accepted his request thinking it would be nothing bad. But it got worse, he would do anything I want no matter what. Since I'm a very fragile and someone who doesn't want to hurt people, I always tried to play it cool but after sometime I got disgusted by it. In these days my flirt revealed she has a boyfriend and used me for attention so my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) was triggered. I cut her out of my life few days later and I was so fucking depressed and felt so bad. I would constantly think about suicide and stuff. In these times he tried to cheer me up but I would get these sudden mood changes and find a way to avoid doing things with him and spend time alone. One day while we were playing CS:GO, he said something that made me exteremely angry. The thing he said wasn't even something offensive nor something that is serious, but my stupid self got offended and literally blocked him everywhere. Next day, he came to my workplace's clock out time (at that time I was doing internship) and asked for forgiveness. Since I got a lot of pride, I simply chose ignoring him until I arrived the station I needed to get out. He said he was sorry for what he did and I said I don't care and exit the train. After that we didnt talk for 3 or 4 months, one day he asked if we could be friends again and I accepted it. Whole time I knew something terrible but couldn't do anything about it since I didn't want to talk to anyone at all. After all of these, I met with my current girlfriend who is a very sweet person, she has a lot of traumas so I kinda dedicated myself to her. One day, while we were talking about my girlfriend to him (at that time we were just friends, no master/slave shit going on.) he said he is jealous of her and admitted that he was addicted to me and he was obsessed with his girlfriend back then too, so it's not something that is first. It went on and on, I literally didnt know what to do and tried to comfort him with how he did nothing wrong and he will be okay if he agrees to taking professional help. He agreed and its been few months and he is worse than ever, he says he cries thinking about me and cant sleep. One time he confessed to my girlfriend that he was planning on killing himself when I visit my girlfriend (traveling to another country) and he said he changed his mind, he promised that he won't do it. I feel so terrible not being able to help him, my girlfriend and myself at the same time. I want to help him but I literally don't know how. When I get enough courage to go outside (I have severe social anxiety and I started taking pills a week ago.) I will visit his house and talk about this to her mom with him and try to get him help. Do you guys have any advice for me to how can I be next to him while he is completely obsessed with me? I don't want to leave him alone but when I'm there for him it just makes him worse and worse. I want to him to be my friend for life because of how caring and funny person he is. He agreed to stop being friends because it hurts me too, I thought of maybe if I say ""Yeah, we can do it but when we turn 25 we will be friends again"" it will be okay but no, it will make it worse. He will just store things inside of it for years. I just want to help him really. But deep down something inside of my heart literally says ""It's not your problem, dump him."" and I start getting nauseous. I am literally incapable of making decisions because of my BPD, all I can do is talk this to my girlfriend and think over and over again. I don't want to hurt him, nor see him obsessed with me. What should I do?"

I come from a low-income and abusive household, so I feel a lot of pressure to make a lot of money this summer and get the best experience for my resume possible because moving back in with my parents is just not a safe option for me. The current economic situation in the US and the world isn't helping. 

So that limits me to reasonably paid internships that will look good when I graduate. I am majoring in Math and I want to get a job where I can apply that and not really have to work overtime, be middle-class. I've done a lot of research and I feel like data analysis is probably the most achievable for me right now with my skills and that is interesting to me. The problem is 90% of the paid data analyst internship listings so far in the city I'm in this summer are in finance/banking, or some company that's known for being super messed up. It kinda makes sense. These big, messed up corporations are the ones who can afford to actually pay their interns. Maybe I will find some other opportunities that fit better that I am more comfortable with, but it seems like this might be the best thing to shoot for, unfortunately.

Some more background on me, I was a total communist in high school. I'm still very left-wing. I know pretty much every company is exploitative in some way or another. But I think within left-wing communities we shame each other for ""selling out"" almost as much as we shame companies. I know that I just need to make the most money I can and I don't need to be (or want to be!) in love with every company I work for. I just want to have enough money to rest well at night and go on vacation every once in awhile! Isn't that something like what we all want and are fighting for? At the same time, I don't want to get too comfortable and forget about helping people who are struggling like how I am now (or who struggle even more). It does feel like I'm really overthinking this! But I am terrified of losing my empathy for others if I make too much money and do dirty work for ""The Man""!

Does anyone have advice on processing feelings of guilt, shame, and fear around this? I have heard people throw around the term ""poverty mindset"" a lot, which I know can be pop psych, but I wonder if there might be some of that going on here with me?"

There were interns who made $30 &amp; $33/hour. So I was definitely screwed salary wise compared to my peers but it was first internship so I didn't complain. I am working part time for them during the sem remotely and have been guaranteed a spot at DT and that I am getting an offer once I finish my fall internship. This internship would be based out of Cincinnati

I received an offer at Company 2 for their D&amp;T program just last week and have to accept in one week. It is $5000 a month (31.25/hour). I really liked the people during this whole process but I am wondering if it is worth the moving companies. It is based out of Minneapolis.

I am based in Michigan, and wondering which one should I take. I don't know if the 1st company would start me at the $33 an hour salary or the $30. Tbh the only think I know is the location and that I will get the offer in January.

Both would give me opportunities in cybersecurity, data science, and cloud computing routes which are what I am interested in.

So what do people think?"

y7ofjg,65,2022-10-18,Interview Advice from the Other Side of the Table,KMT210,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/y7ofjg/interview_advice_from_the_other_side_of_the_table/,"I‚Äôve had the privilege of designing and recruiting for the internship programs of two Fortune 500 Manufacturing Companies. During that time, I have sat across the table from hundreds of talented people in the interview, and I have seen the interview make or break the application process for candidates. I thought this would be a good place to share my tips on how to ace the interview and give yourself the best chance at landing that dream internship.

The interview is the professional version of speed dating. It‚Äôs about quickly getting to know someone and be known by someone, checking compatibility, and seeing if there is some overlap in goals and vision for the future. It‚Äôs a conversation that requires a mix of logical and emotional connection.

As any avid reader can attest, the best way to communicate emotion and logic is through a compelling story, and interviews are structured perfectly for compelling stories. Most employers use a technique called behavior-based interview questions, which sounds like a complex technical term, but it really just means interviewers will ask questions that start with a phrase like ‚ÄúTell me about a time when‚Ä¶‚Äù rather than asking a general question like ‚ÄúHow good are you at leading a team?‚Äù The interviewer is inviting you to make an emotional and logical connection through a series of stories about your past experiences.

Typically an interview will consist of 4-6 such invitations, so I recommend each person be prepared with about 10 stories. What should these stories look like? In terms of structure, I recommend the general structure of the ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù method (Situation, Tasks, Actions, Results). For content I recommend that each story has all the elements of a good story: a setting, characters, plot, conflict reaching a climax, and a resolution. For length, it should only take about 5 minutes total per story. It‚Äôs a tough challenge to get all three elements, but I know you can master it with some thought and practice! As Mark Twain once famously said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long one.‚Äù Most of your work on interview preparation will be to make each of your stories fit into that 5-minute window, but still create a good level of emotional connection.

So how do you prepare your stories? Start with a list of formative experiences in your professional and educational life so far: key projects involving teams, work that yielded good results, and tough interpersonal issues you had to manage. Once you have a healthy list, build the structure of each story: what was the Situation (the setting and the characters mostly), what were the Tasks (the beginnings of the plot and some character development, as well as the beginning of conflict - a challenge to overcome), what were the Actions (your direct impact on the plot and on the other characters, as well as the climax of the conflict), and finally the Results (how the conflict came to a resolution and the outcome for the characters). Then you have the tough work of trimming the content to 5 minutes or less without losing the impact. This is a team activity. Going one story at a time, tell the longer version to a friend, family member, or consultant, and ask for some help narrowing down the story without losing the impact.

Once you have the individual stories outlined (not memorized word for word) it‚Äôs important to step back and look at the overall picture that the series of stories paints of you as the main character. Do the stories show a compelling main character with values, goals, relatable personality, and growth through the conflicts? If so, then you are ready for just about any interview you walk into! If not, then it is worth identifying which of those elements is missing and supplementing your series of stories.

One last piece of advice though, preparing your stories will get you 90% ready for an interview, and that‚Äôs the hard 90%, but there is another 10% to prepare. For that 10% here are three bonus tips: 1) Be prepared for the question ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù with a shorter 3-minute story. Sometimes interviewers use this to get to know the main character a bit before hearing your other stories. These should have the same elements of a compelling main character described above. 2) The interview is a conversation about being known AND knowing. Show up with genuine interest in the other person and their role in the organization that you are thinking about joining. Which means you should also do some research about the organization. 3) Don‚Äôt get hung up on the wording of the questions. Listen thoughtfully to the question, pick one of your stories that mostly gets at the heart of the question and roll with it emphasizing the details that match the question where you can.

y7q0b4,7,2022-10-18,Trouble deciding between two offers,Pokemined,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y7q0b4/trouble_deciding_between_two_offers/,"So I am a junior at a top 10 CS school, majoring in Computer Science. I got two internship offers through career fair! However, I am having a hard time deciding between the two.

Company 1 (Fortune 100) - $28 hr, housing stipend -&gt; UI/UX Design Developer/ Design System Developer (Unsure of title atm)

I have a decent background with graphic design and art in general, so I always thought that UI/UX design was a great way to combine my two interests, art and tech. I love using tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and really enjoyed the frontend development I have done in the past. At this company everyone I talked to and interviewed with was extremely nice. Overall I think there products are really cool, and I am a good culture fit. One of the guys that interviewed me had one spot left on his team and liked me enough to have me skip a stage of the interview process which was incredibly cool and nice of him. 

Company 2 (Fortune 500) - \~$35 hr, housing payed -&gt; Software Engineer Intern

This company I also met at Career fair. I had an in person behavioral interview with with a leetcode easy technical. I also had a final interview which was System design. Overall the people I met throughout this process were not as nice as Company 1, but very normal. The product that this company creates does not seem as cool as Company 1. However, the internship is mentor-based which could be really educational.

After doing some research it seems like Software Engineers definitely make more than UI/Design developers/Frontend engineers. As a Junior in college who is not exactly sure what I want to do in the future, is it more of a risk to take the UI/UX Design role? 

My concern is that having Software Engineer Intern at Company 2 will look more impressive and help me land higher paying jobs in the future as a software engineer. While I think I would rather do the work that Company 1 would have me do, I am afraid I might get stuck in that more design oriented field, and because of that get paid less. Money is obviously important to me, so it is also really hard to pass up Company 2 as it pays more and housing is included. 

What would you guys do? (Both are in the same location)"

y7qtag,1,2022-10-18,Should I Buy a Used 3090 off eBay?,All_Math,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/y7qtag/should_i_buy_a_used_3090_off_ebay/,"I've been planning on building a rig for a few months now and after being disappointed by the eye-watering prices Nmidia is gonna charge for a 4000 series card, I decided I'd probably be sitting out that gen. I've seen a lot of relatively cheap 3090s floating around on eBay lately and I've been thinking of buying one, but what do y'all think? The system I'm planning on building should be completely capable of using this card to its fullest (undecided between Zen 4 Ryzen 9 or Raptor Lake i9 or i7, I'm gonna get a decent mobo, 4k 144Hz monitor, 1000W PSU from SuperFlower, an AIO or a noctua air cooler), and (for better or worse) I'm planning on sticking with Nvidia since I plan on getting an internship next year for CS and I've heard Nvidia's CUDA is better than whatever AMD is offering. I budgeted roughly $700 for a GPU in my build so while it won't be easy finding a working 3090 on eBay that's not from a shady seller, it's still completely possible based on the final auction prices I've seen on eBay. With that said, should I go for a used 3090? While I don't doubt I'll have an absolute beast of a card, I'm more worried about the odds that my card dies a month after I get it and the warranty doesn't transfer or that secondhand cards don't have as much life left in them (although you could argue that because the card is still in working condition after use, the card wasn't DOA so the chances it lives another 2-3 years are at least the same as that of a new card). I haven't built a PC in a few years and this is my first time building something that's more high-end. (If it wouldn't be a problem for CS work, I'd be open to possibly waiting for RDNA3 since I might wait out on buying a CPU and mobo until I either see 7000X3D or really nice CPU + mobo combos, but I'm worried AMD might follow Nvidia's lead and charge a kidney or two for a new card)

Edit: I notice a lot of people saying the 3090 had temp issues, so what would be considered ""safe"" for a 3090 to run at consistently? I remember doing some searching and reading that it was common for people to have memory upwards of 90C only gaming. Not to say this is safe as I have no idea how their cards are doing a year later, but what would be safe? (I forgot to add this but would the use of GDDR6 vs GDDR6X memory make a difference as I heard GDDR6X can handle higher temps but also tends to run hotter)

Tl;Dr: I want to buy a used 3090 off eBay but I'm mostly worried about dropping $700 on a card only for it to die in a month and I can't get it replaced cuz the warranty was voided or something."

I plan to start at community, in part bc we are low income (father makes $30,000-$40,000 annually.) 

I desire to make at least $60,000 annually.

Both years of community where I live are free. 

I don‚Äôt like lifting heavy things, moving things, doing a lot of physical activity. I know this based on my summer internship 

I have bad sleeping issues and a weak immune system. I always look REALLY tired. 

I am a black girl who is slightly below average facially, and lives in a predominantly white/Asian environment. I am conscious of this in regards to a potential career. 


I dropped Pre Calculus as a junior. I felt like I didn‚Äôt learn algebra 2 over zoom 

I don‚Äôt want to be placed in a remedial math class when I get to college (but I was told by someone who is in their 2nd yr that if you show them your transcript proving you passed a class, you don‚Äôt have to take a placement test.) 

I have depression and anxiety. 

I live in California, but do not plan to stay here.

A lot of people dislike me, for a variety of reasons. 

I am in Physiology, but dislike it. I have a B in the class but fail the tests. I don‚Äôt study for it. 

I spend a lot of time on the computer, and am a fast typist (over 100 WPM.) 

I wouldn‚Äôt mind grading someone‚Äôs essay or paper (hypothetically) or giving feedback/suggestions and helping someone out w their grammar on a paper or essay. 

I have grown up around a lot of people who have homes, but we live in an apartment complex. We have a car but cannot pay to get it fixed. 

Therefore, going to community is more convenient. The nearest trade school to me is a city away (the city itself is 5 mins away by bus, but I got lost last yr when I went there to see my ex.) 

The dental assisting program at my community sounded like it may not be super easy to get into (you have to be ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù and apply by, or before, April.) 

I was told by someone who is in their first yr of community that you can go in for nursing even though it‚Äôs not listed on the site. 

I was also told that the staff are ‚Äúweird‚Äù about the CNA program and that it‚Äôs possible it won‚Äôt be continued next year. 

I have, within the past week, looked into what fields my community college offers. The fields listed are the fields that I am most potentially interested in. 

I am an introvert. I get my work in on time, even when I‚Äôm stressed out or don‚Äôt feel that I ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the assignment (unless said teacher is lenient about late work‚Ä¶ but even then.) 

My therapist suggested that I am self aware, and I spend a fair amount of time reflecting every day. 

I do not have good social skills, and I know this. I am curious about those around me, and how they came to be the way they are. But I am not good at ‚Äúconnecting.‚Äù 

I am working on becoming healthier, but think that I just struggle deep down w being distrustful toward others due to past experiences w bullying.

y7tb5p,128,2022-10-19,I (20F) called my brother (18M) out on his behavior. He shoved me into a wall.,professor-okay,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/y7tb5p/i_20f_called_my_brother_18m_out_on_his_behavior/,"I (20F) called my brother (18M) out on his behavior, and he responded by shoving me into a wall. **UPDATE/CLARIFICATION see below \*\*\*\***

My Mother (60F) was doing work that required heavy lifting. I was working on an internship application and my brother was playing video games. My brother consistently does not help around the house and plays his games.  My mother has bone and back issues and needs help, and I myself have health issues and a massive courseload to maintain my scholarship. My father(80M) works all day and is also older. My brother is the only physically healthy person in our household.

I kept hearing my mother shouting and shouting for help with not response and and finally got sick of it. I shouted and my brother to get off his game and come help our mother. I told him he had a responsibility to help his elderly parents, and I was disgusted with his selfish behavior. He responded by calling me a hypocrite. I told him I was working like crazy to maintain my scholarship to stay in school and that our father is at work. He is the only person available to help our mother and he chooses to play video games for hours and does not even attempt to look for colleges to apply for, get a job, or invest in his future at all.

Angry, he told me to ""Not f\*cking speak to him like that."" I responded that I was only telling him the truth.

He told me I was ""Questioning his integrity"" I responded. ""What integrity?""

He responded by shoving me into the wall.

I wasn't physically hurt. I was more shocked than anything else. I started crying and saying that I loved him but his behavior made that so difficult, that I knew I wasn't perfect, but I was trying. He just shouted louder and started calling my mother a dumbass for keeping a decoration that happened to cut his leg as he paced back and forth. He showed no remorse.

I started shaking. Someone had just shoved me into my own wall in my own home. There was a six-foot-tall man in my home who was willing to physically shove or push me when I disagreed with him without any remorse. He had shouted, and called names before, and even pushed my mother around a bit, but never this.

I left the house crying hysterically. I didn't return until late that night. I have not spoken to him since. He has offered no apology, made no noticeable change to his behavior other than not throwing college brochures away immediately. I sent him a single text after the experience, saying ""Don't ever touch me or our mother again"" there was no response.

My mother has spoken to him. My father has spoken to him. My father has voiced his support and told me if anything happens, it will be my brother who must leave and not I. My mother has told me not to be dramatic, that I was not hurt.

I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel I hate him and that I refuse to interact with someone who treats others this way. Other time I feel exhausted, and I just want to cry and cry.  I haven't told anyone but one friend and my college counselor. I just feel I need to write it out and say it.

Thank you all for listening. Any advice would be appreciated.

**\*\*\*\*UPDATE/CLARIFICATION**

Thank you all for your advice and comments, even those who feel more negatively toward me. Here are few clarifications and responses. I cut down this story a great deal before posting because it was far too long.

To clarify to the people who said I should have helped my mother myself, I do help my mother and I **was actively helping my mother** with her work **while the argument was taking place**. I prefaced this entire argument with the words ""Get up, **we** are going to help **our** mother.""  When I am at home, I help my mother. Every weekday from 9:00am to 6:00pm I spend at class, work study, and my scholarship position, not including homework time. The **entire reason I go to college is so I can become the primary breadwinner** for our family. That is my choice, my decision, and my goal, and why I am so serious about my scholarship and studies.

As for it **only being an issue when he pushed me versus my mother**, as I have called him out on his behavior toward my mother previously, calling it unacceptable. I have spoken to my mother about it before, saying she needs to control or punish him. My mother as I mentioned before, does not see it as serious and **I cannot make her** leave, report him, or other any other action.

As for the argument that this entire thing being about college, I understand that **college is not the right choice for everyone** and my brother does not need to pursue it. He does however, have to do **something.** Whether that's a trade school, a job, starting a business, etc, I'd support him in all of that. It doesn't have to be college, but he has to start thinking about what he wants to do with his life and at least help around the house when he can.

As for everyone who wants me to report him or call the police, as much as I would push that advice from an outsider's perspective, I am more of the opinion that **I will push for therapy, behavioral counseling, or other less extreme form of intervention**, as he is very newly 18 and I don't think jail, juvie, or other high level punishment would do anything but ruin his life without providing resources to fix the issue.

As for my parents having kids when they're older- mental issues, behavioral issues, and out of control children occur in children from couples of all ages. Any set of parents can develop health issues at any point in their life that will affect their family and parenting. Again, I cannot control my parent's past or current choices. While my parents being elderly makes my brother's help more necessary, regardless of a parent's age, an older child should make some basic contribution to the maintenance of the household.

Again, thank you all for your advice and comments, even those that view me negatively. Your time and interest is appreciated. I'm glad I was able to write this out somewhere. I will probably delete this post at some point, since even looking at it makes me upset, but I sincerely do thank you for your comments and advice and I will keep them all in mind.

TLDR: Yes, I do help my mother and was helping while we argued. Yes, I did respond when he pushed my mother. No, I cannot make my mother respond/react to that in a certain way. Yes, I understand college is not for everyone. Yes, I will push for behavioral therapy, not jail or police. No, I cannot time travel and control when my parents have kids. I will delete this at some point, thank you all for your time and advice."

y7y93q,0,2022-10-19,A CRY FOR HELP/OPPORTUNITY,Guilty_Age_9535,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/y7y93q/a_cry_for_helpopportunity/,"(23M, Belgium) I study a graduate in Business here in Antwerp, which is a new kind college business course here in belgium of 2 years. So it is not a recognized bachelor's degree in business (it's supposed to be more practical than theoretical). I would really like to do an internship abroad to gain new experiences, my preference is Copenhagen, but it can also be somewhere else, does not really matter where.

Now my training coordinator  expects us to find an internship place where we will prepare a full business plan for the company. So we are not allowed to fill a particular position, because we have to meet all his conditions. I don't get any guidance at all and when I ask him (the training coordinator) where I should look for this internship place, he keeps telling me to just try harder to build connections through LinkedIn. 

All internship places in business require at least a bachelor in that field, so this graduate is not a bachelor and on top of that we have to work out a project for a company. 

So so here I want to ask my opportunity if there is anyone with a company/start-up still looking for a driven intern? I have very high sense of responsibility am creative and have experience in preparing a business plan.

Any tips? Advice? Anything is welcome.

y814ur,1,2022-10-19,Mental health issues while writing Master's thesis.,ChipmunkExcellent162,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/y814ur/mental_health_issues_while_writing_masters_thesis/,"Hello,

I already posted this on r/academia, but I felt that this community might be more suited. To be honest, I'm not sure why I am writing this post or if this is even the proper community to write this in. I don't know if I expect to find a solution in this community, or whether I'm just writing this to to clear my conscience. Anyway, I am in the process of writing my Master of Science (MSc) thesis and I am having some serious trouble doing it.

To fill you in on the complete picture, I started my Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering in September 2020. The Master constitutes a total of 120 ECTS, of which 47 ECTS is coursework, 18 ECTS is a mandatory internship, and 55 ECTS is a literature study + thesis. During the first 1,5 years of my Master, I managed to pass all my courses in one go with a cum laude average, and the internship was a great success. In the meantime, I had picked out a supervisor and a topic so I could get started on my thesis right after the internship. So far so good. Sadly, things turned around once I got started on my literature study in February 2022.

Immediately in the first week of working on the literature study, I started experiencing extreme anxiety which lead to the occasional daily panic attack. This went on for about 2 weeks, until the people around me gave me the advice to indefinitely ""press the pause button"", since they attributed the anxiety and panic to the fact that I had been working too hard and alone throughout the COVID pandemic up until that point. So fine, that's what I did. Putting a pause to the studies helped me get rid of the underlying daily anxiety, and I pretty much relaxed and worked on my personal development for around 7 months. I started talking to a life coach about dealing with these feelings and to trace the origin, I went on several holidays, I played video games, started working out, solved puzzles, etc. In September 2022, after these 7 months of feeling better, I felt confident to resume my literature study and thesis again.

Unfortunately, on the first day of resuming my literature study, I immediately experienced another panic attack. I initially hoped it had something to do with the fact that I had just resumed from a long break, and that it would get better over time. However, here I am 8 weeks later trying to make it better and to push through, but I keep experiencing a constant underlying feeling of anxiety and weekly panic attacks. I haven't been enjoying life the way I should in these past weeks. Everything I do, even fun leisure activities such as going to a concert or the movies, is spoiled by the constant feeling of anxiety that tomorrow or monday I will have to work on the literature study again. Around once every week, this anxiety accumulates into a panic attack and I will spend most of the day crying not knowing what to do. I am booking progress on the literature study, though the progress is slow, and I know deep down inside that I have the skills to pull this off. But the fact that this literature study and thesis combined takes up 55 ECTS means that I will be working on this for at least a full academic year, and I just don't know if I can push myself through this for that long. Despite having a girlfriend and a healthy social circle, I also feel extremely lonely while writing my thesis, since this is mine alone and no other colleague students know as much about this as I do, which means I can never ask for help or support from them. Furthermore, since I have been taking this much longer to complete my Master's already, all of my university contacts have already graduated, so at days I work at university are mostly spent alone.

The alternative would be to quit my Master, but that would make me feel like I failed myself miserably. I have already put 2 years into this Master, and most of the jobs I want to apply to require a Master's degree (data/software engineer North-West Europe). Even if that weren't the case and I were to apply to a job, I am worried that they will either ask about a 2-year gap in my CV, or why I quit my Master's. The honest answer to that question would be that I quit my Master's because I couldn't push myself through experiencing a constant undertone of anxiety with weekly panic attacks, but I could never tell that to a company recruiter, since I don't think any company would want to hire an engineer that is a psychological wreck. I don't want to take another break either, since I everything will take even longer and I will be even older when I graduate.

I just feel like I'm at a complete roadblock, not knowing what to do. To continue would mean to push myself through a constant feeling of anxiety, but to quit and apply for a job would make me feel like I failed myself, since I know that I have the intelligence to pull this off.

I have spoken to my GP about this, and I am on the waiting list for a university psychologist. The talks with the life coach only helped temporarily, so I hope to get more out of this. Like I said, I don't really know if I am writing this post to expect some solution in the comments, or if I am just writing it to get the weight off my chest and put it out there in the world."

y84mfy,1673,2022-10-19,I Think My Roommate is a Vampire,NutellaNovella,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y84mfy/i_think_my_roommate_is_a_vampire/,"That sounds idiotic, right? Everyone knows vampires aren't real, but hear me out.


It started about a year ago when my old roommate decided to move in with his girlfriend without any warning. His name was on the lease too, and I could have just forfeited my half of the deposit and found a cheaper place, but that's really hard to do on short notice, especially in the middle of a semester. So, I put out ads everywhere I could think of online and around campus for a new roommate, not really expecting much.


To my initial delight I got a nibble within a week. She was a quiet grad student who'd had some sort of falling out with her own roommate and needed a place to land. Perfect! Or so I thought. She moved in and covered her half of the expenses when bills came due at the start of the next month. It looked like I managed to dodge a bullet, and maybe in my relief at not being evicted I ignored a few signs I should have picked up on.


You see, I almost never saw my roommate. She stayed locked up in her room most days when I was home. Though I occasionally bumped into her watching something on our shared TV late at night. Her explanations were reasonable. Night shift work as a medical intern, sleep schedules, all that seemed legit.


She was really weird about mirrors though. She doesn't have a single one in her room, which is odd, for a girl. Nor does she ever keep *any* food in the fridge. She doesn't have any cookware. She never has friends over. All of these things I could write off somehow, if it weren't for the dreams.


You see, I keep having this recurring dream, about once or twice a month. I wake up with her perched on the corner of my bed. In these dreams the room is utterly black - I sleep with blackout curtains drawn because of an obnoxiously bright street lamp outside my window - but somehow I know she's there. I never say anything to her, she just slithers under the covers with me, and her body is cold! Then she talks to me in a low voice, speaking words I can never seem to remember in the morning, and she kisses my neck, and that cold feeling explodes through my whole body! Then I wake up.


That's it. I know, it's freaky! I'm always a little groggy and lethargic after I have one of those dreams. Thirsty too, like, working-in-the-hot-sun-sweating-like-a-pig-all-day, thirsty. And the chronic fatigue has only gotten worse. After I fainted at work one night my boss insisted that I make a doctor's appointment. Guess what they found: Anemia.


My family has *no* history of anemia, none. The doctors can't explain it, they just put me on a regimen of iron supplements and called it good.


I've tried to ask her to move out, but whenever I talk to her I always seem to forget the purpose of the conversation and get sidetracked on something she wants to talk about instead, and then I go to bed having forgot about the whole thing, until the next time I have one of the dreams.


I think I might be loosing my mind, either that, or my roommate really is what I think she is. I want to move out. I've even packed my stuff up a couple times, only to wake up the next morning with everything back in its place wondering if I only dreamed about packing. One night I just got in my car and drove as far as I could before sleep got the better of me and I had to pull off the highway. The next morning I woke up parked at the curb outside my apartment. I'd write that one off as a weird dream too, if it weren't for the credit card statement that has me getting gas in a town about three hours drive from where I live on the night in question. That could just be credit card fraud, except I know that it isn't.


I've tried telling people about what's going on, but no one ever believes me. Family, friends, they all think it's some kind of joke, or an hallucination on my part. Especially after they meet my roommate. Everyone likes her, even though she's weird. *I* even like her, though I'm scared to death of her. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night lately with the insane urge to go out and talk to her. I know where she'll be, I can hear the TV turned to low volume in the other room. Some nights I succeed in resisting, but most I end up getting up and sitting with her until near dawn when she heads to bed.


It's gotten to where I can't force myself to tell people about my fears anymore. Even writing this all out on an anonymous forum is hard to do. When I think about including any personally identifying details though, I can't make myself do it. My fingers simply refuse to type that information out. I don't think I'd be able to write as much as I have, except that I think my feeble attempts to get away amuse her somehow.


I can't escape her anymore. I need help, but I know no one is going to help me. I feel like, like I should just accept my fate. One of these nights *I'll* be the one perched on *her* bed and then it will all be over. I know it somehow. I won't *want* to escape then. I'll be completely hers until I'm dead, or maybe worse.


I've written my story out three times now. And each time I found some reason to delete it rather than posting. I'm not going to hit discard this time, though. I will not do it!


If you're reading this, please, try to find some way of helping me! I don't know how you'd do it. I can't know. If I actually believed that someone could, I don't think I would be able write this much. I want to delete it, but I'm going to hit post before I talk myself out of it again."

I wanted to hear your thoughts on my situation. I'll be graduating in December with a degree in HRM with a minor in Information Management, and I'm looking to start a job as close to when I graduate as possible. I was fortunate enough to receive a return offer for a full-time position following an internship this past summer with a Fortune 500 tech company. Unfortunately, they only gave me until the end of October to decide if I want to move 12 hours away in January for more of a traditional HRBP role albeit with a company I enjoyed and could move up in.

 I recently received an invitation for a phone screen with another company for a position that would combine both my major in HR and my minor in IM through consulting for HCM cloud systems. I'm very interested in this type of position, but I'm obviously not far in the process and the position is nowhere near guaranteed. That being said, if I received an offer for this position I would 100% prefer it. From your collective experience, would you suggest taking the bird in the hand or declining it in hopes of other offers? If I do accept, how bad are the consequences for going back on my acceptance? Is it even something to consider?"

I wanna pursue this as a career but don't intend to go to uni, I know a lot of people are saying that its possible to get a job without a degree but realistically how possible it actually to land a job in tech. Ive been doing Codecademy but Im thinking of doing udemy courses and the harvardx to get certificates. Its just that every time I look through internship, apprenticeship or even the job description themselves theres always the degree/or at least currently studying in uni stated on them."

Terms of Sale:

Refund Policy: I am not obligated to issue a refund under any circumstance once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer mistake(s) do not constitute grounds for a refund. This includes, but is not limited to, already owning the title, purchasing a code for the wrong platform, and not adhering to notes associated with a code (i.e. do NOT click iTunes).

Code Redemption: You may not use any code purchased here on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting you pay the listed price of the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request when needed for a support team.

Payment/Fees: I accept only USD through Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F). I do not cover any fee(s) associated with any purchase(s). I require that the buyer pays before I send the code(s). When paying through PayPal, do not pay with Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S) or with funds not from your PayPal wallet/linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit/pre-paid card, etc.). Doing so may result in a fee from PayPal. I do not accept eChecks. Failure to adhere to this rule may result in a loss of funds. I typically issue a partial refund in this case because PayPal charges fees that I cannot fully refund without losing money.

Transaction Etiquette/Timely Contact: I do not get immediate notifications for chats or comments. I check posts when I get the chance. I respond to messages as soon as I am aware of them, but please do not expect quick replies. I will interpret 'interested in' as a request to purchase the title unless you also make an inquiry. I also require that all price negotiation be conducted in the comments in accordance with [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalCodeSELL/wiki/index/rules#wiki_4._proper_transaction_etiquette): ""All discussions/negotiations about a potential exchange must be made via comments.""

Dual Redeems/Splits: I can check any code upon request and provide a for-sure answer as to whether or not it is a dual redeem/split. Otherwise, assume all codes are dual redeems/splits."

I have recently gotten an invite from Goldman Sachs to do their programming and math OA for summer 2023 interns. Can anyone who has done the OA this season or last season share topics as well as recommended resources? I know they ask mostly LC mediums for coding and the following for math:

-probability/statistics
-linear algebra
-calculus

But if possible I would like more details. For context, I have high school knowledge of statistics/probability, calc 1 knowledge and almost no linear algebra knowledge, and I will do my OA next Monday.

(Also looking at what is asked in the math section I‚Äôm a little intimidated since I‚Äôm a first year and haven‚Äôt covered advanced math yet. Is it possible to contact the support team and change the OA to just coding?)"

I‚Äôm really worried that, especially since I‚Äôm applying to Stanford which is known for CS, they‚Äôll think that I‚Äôm just pretending to be a philosophy major but is actually the typical ‚ÄúAsian male in CS‚Äù that‚Äôs trying to cheat the system. 

Is this a valid concern? FYI, I do have many non-STEM stuff(DM for further details) like being the cohead of a philosophy club and writing club, as well as winning a significant writing award, and I plan on writing my essays mostly about non-STEM related things, it‚Äôs just that my STEM stuff like Olympiads and internship might be seen as ‚Äúoutshining‚Äù them.

I‚Äôm also curious if maybe I should apply as a different major like SymSys, Communication, STS, or even CS itself if those are more strategic choices."

I've been in university for about 5 years now. Started off getting a degree in cyber security, two years into that I figured out it wasn't for me and switched to a CS degree. I have about 21 credits left, all the hard stuff, but I'm completely burnt out, I'm unmotivated and unfocused. The constant stress of tests and homework (you can't ""clock out"" from school) has wore me down. I'd much rather be working full time.

However I do currently have a paid internship, I've been basically working part time for the last 2.5 years. I had another internship before that too. So I have work experience, or I'd like to think I do at least.

I don't want to quit school outright, but I need a loooong break, years. I'm not certain how long. 
So I'd like to get some opinions, how likely is it that I get a full time job with this experience but an unfinished degree?"

I'm graduating with an M.S. this fall and I got two job offers, each for a data engineering position. These are entry level positions and I have very little experience in data engineering aside from a summer internship for a major credit card company, but my long-term career goal is to stay in this field, grow, advance, and make money. Here are the two offers:

Offer 1
Company A
Title: Data Engineer
Compensation: $95k + up to 15% annual bonus based on company performance, and a free bed
Other: Uses Microsoft software, will get proficient in Azure/Microsoft stack (and cloud computing in general).

Offer 2
Company B
Title: Data Engineer
Compensation $95k (up from $92k to match offer 1, might have more room to negotiate) + 3% annual bonus, $5k signing bonus and 15% off everything I buy at their stores lol
Other: Has 1000s of servers on premises (interviewers insisted they will never go to the Cloud), will learn Scala and do lots of hard- coding, along with Hadoop and the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù data engineering software stacks

So, Company A is offering me a bit more money (looking at possibly $109k vs $98k). However, I am surprised at this, since B is generally a more well-known company (especially in the Twin Cities) and I do think it was actually more competitive to get an offer from B than A (tougher interviews). Additionally, at B I will definitely code more and use less software (DE fundamentals). B is a bigger company (more infrastructure). More data. No Cloud. 

Question: Is it better long-term to learn Azure/MS stack vs. Scala/Hadoop/ traditional DE with on prem servers? Is it better to work for a more well known company but not get paid as much? What would you do if you were starting off a career in DE? Understand fundamentals or become proficient in new Cloud tech (definitely the future)?"

y8cbly,2,2022-10-19,Applying for DevOps roles as a new grad?,usr3nmev3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y8cbly/applying_for_devops_roles_as_a_new_grad/,"Title; I'm an (almost) new grad with two internships. One of my internships was at a startup in the dev-ops tools space, but was doing software engineering for those tools. My current internship is with a research-focused engineering team, and a lot of what I've been helping with has been integrating new tools into production. The main project I own is designing a benchmarking framework. The work focused a lot on creating a simulated production cluster environment and used a lot of tools that (from what I can tell) are normally used for dev ops (lots of container management, some event bus work, and also some things like Prometheus and Grafana)  and I've generally really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I can't really find that many positions that don't require 5YOE+. 

If I want to pursue a career as a dev ops engineer, is the best way to just start out as an SWE and try to transition within a particular company? I'm not sure if I want to continue with the company I'm currently with largely due to the location and ethical concerns with the industry."

I have been applying to visa sponsored jobs, even if  they are Intern positions. I got the OA for one of intern, I passed it and today I scheduled the interview.

Now I'm wondering if there's going to be a problem because either A) I can't be an actual ""intern"" since if I get the internship, by the time it ends I won't be a student anymore (did I get the definition of internship wrong?), or B) I get hired as an intern, but it only lasts a few months, so I'd have to risk quitting my current job and not getting an offer back from this new company (this is more of a personal decision/risk and I'm assuming that I'll pass all the interviews lol, although honestly this sole internship could be better for my resume).

After finishing the OA they included a question about my current student situation with 2 options: Intern o New Grad. I chose New Grad of course, but the job position is still Software Engineering Intern.

Do you think this could lead to something negative like they dropping the recruitment process? I'm thinking of sending an email to my recruiter and ask if after the recruitment process we can negotiate for a different position, like a Full Time one, but I wanted to know what you all guys think."

It‚Äôs making me a bit restless and depressed especially because I WFH , speak to no one (I‚Äôm the only person working on this tool) and I feel lonely as I am the only intern. 

Once I finish work I have a small break and leetcode for an 1hr or 2. After this I code. This continuous routine is making me sad especially as I have no social life and I also never leave my house

There aren't many in my area, which means I'll probably have to go to a city that's an hour away for a job that doesn't absolutely suck. There are only two problems with this:

2. I have never lived on my own before and it scares me slightly.

1. Finally gain independence. I am 23. I want to be an ""adult"" and do my own thing. 
2. Dating will be easier when I don't live with my parents.

I am making progress in the hiring process with this one company, which I got through referrals. The way the referral process works is that my friend submits my details into their internal portal while I apply separately through the hiring portal so the system will match the info between the two portals. Anyways, after talking with my friend about the position I applied for, he suggested that I should not move forward. He said that the position is a very low-level entry position, and knowing me, he said that I wouldn't be satisfied. He's even okay with not getting the referral bonus because he would feel bad for me if I accept the job lol.

I have not received an offer yet, but he's convinced that I'll definitely get one for this position. I also did my own research on glassdoor/ indeed, found some average reviews for the position (3/5) and the pay range is relatively low for the industry (supply chain/ logistics), which is around the same pay as my internship experiences.

I know there are multiple red flags, but I just feel very unsure of myself if I continue with the job search. I don't think I have received that many responses + I'm afraid there may be fewer opportunities in the future with the recession looming, especially with the tight timeframe with my graduation.

Again, I know it is early, but I would really appreciate some guidance because I am not familiar with all the sub-fields. I am an econ/cs major currently. Might change to math/cs or just cs + masters in 4 yrs.

At my school, everyone seems to want to apply for SWE internships and eventually work at these companies, but I've already kinda lost interest in this. Here are things I am interested in/not interested in/random concerns:

1. The one thing I am 100% sure that I am passionate about is research (i know this is kinda broad, but idk how else to describe it). In high school, I would do archival history research, econ research, and research in applying CS to different areas for fun. I published some papers and really enjoyed the research process and working with others. I'm guessing this is more of the PhD route, but everyone here tells me not to do a PhD when I can just get a FANG job and get paid more. Also, I am concerned I won't get a job/won't be smart enough to even get into a PhD program as this route seems to be reserved for the top CS people which I am def not in my school (but I can improve ofc). Are there PhD programs that involve CS but are some application of it or is this really not what a PhD is? Can I do research w/o a PhD?
2. For some reason I really do not like web/app development and maybe building software in general. All the clubs at my school are so web dev focused and I cannot bring myself to work on their projects. I guess the end product just does not excite me. I was a swe intern briefly where I was working with Django, and it was alright but it is not something I would want to do every day when I am older, yk? Also, the developers there started talking about how humanities subjects were useless, but I find myslef more interested in humanities that I did in web dev lol. In high school, I did a lot of ML stuff (at an extremely basic level ofc) and I was really interested in that.
3. I don't love my intro to CS class that everyone else seems to love. I am not super passionate about learning syntax/algorithms/what is going on under the hood. However, I really love my math for CS class (although I am pretty average at it in terms of grades lol).
4. I was never that kid who started coding or was into computers since birth. I totally admire people who were but that just isn't me. I started coding in high school cuz it was necessary for some of my research projects, and I am majoring in CS because of its practical applications to every field. I am super interested in writing/history so rn I feel super lost.

I want to start getting involved in one area at a deep level instead of spreading my self too thin across projects in disparate areas. For the upcoming breaks/summers I can either start applying for swe internships or going all in on research through my school's (UPenn) undegrad research program or just doing research projects for fun. Idk which path to take. I am majoring in CS because I know it will become necessary in any field I go into.

tldr; really interested in research, not super passionate about pursuing swe--what r some paths i can take?"

Aiming for MS in DS or Artificial Intelligence

If anyone could please review my shortlisted universities and let me know if I'm aiming too high or too low anywhere? I am also available for educated discussions on the programs in these universities as I think I did some proper research here (I think).

I do not want to fall into that situation where interns develop a nice project with their own environment, but that eventually cannot be reproduced and never goes to production, i.e. due to an update of the Cube IDE, using a different IDE, or when the required packages, configurations, dependencies are not correctly documented.

I'm thinking about switching majors from Information Technology to Computer Science. I feel like Information Technology is a degree neutral job for most jobs and fields.

But as I'm applying for internships and ""practicing"" applying for jobs I've noticed there's a higher demand for computer science majors.

I'm also getting internship emails back, but as soon as I get the HackerRank assessments, I freeze up because I'm not that fluent in coding. I love coding but I only know the basis of what I've learned, I just haven't had time for it lately which kind of contradicts my love for code.

I don't mind doing IT as a career, but all of my dream jobs are like the FAANG companies, and building software or applications to help people. But math is hugely what is deterring me away from computer science.

IT equally interests me too, and I've been able to equally get internship emails back, but again its the HackerRack assessments that freeze me up.

Does anyone have any advice? Can I still do IT and maybe develop my coding languages on the side?"

However to gain experience and exposure we must nonetheless go through this phase. Working in a new environment with new people can be challenging for; if not all most people. Not to mention interviews and client meetings and dealings.
However before we reach that stage I would like to open a discussion to those professionals already involved in architectural, design firms and projects regarding the following points to help the upcoming generations of designers and architects.

1. What are your view on interns and freshers?

2. Is portfolio necessary for Internships? If yes what are the things the architecture firm and design studios look for in a fresher??

3. What happens during internship period?

4. How frequent are freshers/ intenrs exposed to projects and clients?

5. What should people know about internship as a professional?

Let's help build professionals by sharing your knowledge, understanding, experience and expertise as an expert in this field."

y8vd5h,2,2022-10-20,"So burnt out, and have finally decided to leave my non-profit job. Is it possible to give a month + notice and still find a way to take a break between jobs?",maryumzid,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y8vd5h/so_burnt_out_and_have_finally_decided_to_leave_my/,"Background: I am in my mid to late twenties, and have worked at an education non-profit for about 2 and a half years. I started as a comms manager and was promoted to a director about six months ago. I work on a very small team, and have a really great relationship with everyone, including my manager. However, I am always pulled in way too many directions and my manager even told me point blank I was doing the work of at least 3 people or a team in any other context. It is not sustainable. I have also not had a break from work since I started college. I have always been employed. From working two jobs and an internship throughout college, to getting a writing job immediately after my teaching fellowship was shortened due to COVID in 2020. And I have also always tied my worth to my productivity. 

I am at the level of burnt out that I would love nothing more than to leave before the end of the year, for the sake of my mental health and even my relationships. 

However: 

1. I don‚Äôt have another job lined up. I haven‚Äôt started applying but would really like to take a month off if possible in between roles. Based on my experiences I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt have too much of an issue finding another job. But you never know üò¨

2. We have so many huge events coming up fast, and I feel like I would leave my work hanging  and cause so much stress for my team if I didn‚Äôt give more than a two weeks notice. 

I don‚Äôt know whether to tell my boss sooner rather than later that I plan on leaving- so that they have time to make a plan and I maintain good relationships- or give the standard two week notice. Should I most definitely have a job lined up after? My main worry is between giving enough notice to my current employer and still being able to take the break i so desperately need before I begin a new role. 

In your experience is it harder to find employment if you‚Äôre not already employed? Is this too much of a financial risk? Is it rude to give your two weeks right after winter break and before large events? Or should I just tell my boss now I plan on leaving by the end of the year? 

I clearly have so many questions and so few answers üòÖ"

It's gotten to the point where my self esteem is basically non-existent and I cope with this by pretending my self esteem issues do not exist.

&amp;#x200B;

All things considered, I'm doing relatively alright for myself. I got diagnosed only earlier this year after struggling a lot in my second year of college, and I've been coping better with medication. However, I still struggle with ""keeping up"" and let responsibilities fall by the wayside sometimes. I feel REALLY HORRIBLE every time I drop the ball on something, but feel so helpless because my brain just makes everything so horribly difficult to function ;;   

&amp;#x200B;

I recently completed an internship over the summer break, and met with my supervisor on my last day. Essentially, the bulk of the feedback she gave about my performance centred around how I didn't communicate effectively, and how I tended to freeze up / enter paralysis mode when encountering problems.  I really don't want to shirk responsibility or use ADHD as an excuse, but I just felt so helpless because I don't mean to come off this way. I do appreciate the constructive criticism because I want to learn and get better, but I can't shut off the panic / anxiety spiral response. The panic gets compounded by the fact that I've received such feedback before, on several occasions, so I feel like a failure for not having learnt from the past.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like a total letdown, and can't help thinking that I've overestimated my abilities in applying for the internship in the first place. Does anyone have similar experiences, and how do you work towards overcoming this? I'll definitely talk to my therapist about this, but I was hoping to gain some insights from the ADHD community as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Wretched goblin brain shuts down when faced with criticism; I want to learn how to move beyond this and channel negative feedback constructively

My father and I would argue regularly because he wanted me to be an engineer. He wanted me to pursue a career that is financially safe and to him, an engineering degree (the same degree he was unable to obtain) was the answer. Money has never been a motivating factor for me. I know I am privileged in being able to say that, but it is the truth. I'm not the entrepreneurial type. I am content with just having enough to get by, and would rather be producing something interesting, or making a difference. I feel like Corporate jobs fall flat to me because of this. I also just hate most corporations.

&amp;#x200B;

I never saw myself working in an office space growing up, I liked working with people and hated the idea of a cubicle. I did two internships during my gap year, one corporate (Kelloggs) and one government (USDA). Both left me unsatisfied as the work was unchallenging, and frankly not fulfilling. The internships themselves were fun because of friends I made, places we visited, etc. But I would procrastinate at the office way more than I actually did work assigned to me. Whenever I had to turn in work, I would finish it last minute, and I got by just fine. This is much of how I got through school for a while until I stopped caring to turn in the schoolwork. From missing deadlines, to work piling up because of late work, quickly my mental health would go to shit.   


I failed multiple classes. I had a hard time committing to the work, because I didn't see a point. Being able to visualize success is important to me. Seeing an end-goal that is fulfilling and tangible is how I motivate myself, and school didn't have that for me. The diploma is just a piece of paper saying I earned a piece of paper. To me, whether you have a diploma or not didn't mean you had any more or less value as a person, it was just proof of completing a challenge. And yet here I am diploma-less, feeling like a loser because I can't get a career afloat, unemployed, living with my father and searching for guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

After years of mental health struggles, a gap year, a gap semester, and nasty imposter syndrome, I dropped out to pursue the hobby I had greatly enjoyed for 6 years at that point, acting. I've since tried to pursue this dream to little success. I understand it's a difficult career to get moving and to sustain yourself with, and I'm committed to making it work. But I understand now that a Survival Job is needed, A career that can sustain me and my acting until I can pay the bills by just acting. 

&amp;#x200B;

The agonizing question of what I want to do with my life has been one that haunted and crippled me for my whole college career. One that has called in question my morals, values, and aspirations (if I have any). Now that I am once again bringing back this question to the forefront of my mind I don't want it to haunt me the same way it did all those years ago. I know there must be a path out there that must be fulfilling and flexible. I've worked service industry jobs for years now, jobs that didn't lead lead to me saving much of any money, nor granted me any new skills, or opportunities that could translate to other meaningful work. It can be fulfilling to see a table truly engage with you and respond positively to your service, but then the next one is an asshole that has you questioning why you're there. Not to mention the seemingly inept management. I know I could just go back to Olive Garden right now and get my old job back, but for what? I don't want to look back 6 months from now with nothing to show for it. I've done that already and don't want to waste any more time. I apologize if this has been a ramble, but I really didn't know how to write it all out cohesively. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this so much."

I originally applied through a conference I attended, Out 4 Undergrad. I was invited to join a recruiting call, and then got a phone screen later on. I heard back about a final round a week later.

So the day of the interview, they had everyone who was interviewing join a kick off call in the morning. They basically just showed us a video and told us good luck. The call was a mix of job and internship interviewees.

I had two rounds scheduled for that day. I found out through the chat that some interns had four rounds scheduled instead of two-- I couldn't get a straight answer as to whether that was good or bad news for me.

For both rounds, they asked me first about a project from my resume, and then went into a codility problem. The first was an array problem, and despite it being easy I totally blanked. I tried to talk through it pretty well but it was rough. I didn't get it working.

For the second round I did much better, it was a string pattern matching question and I solved it in a reasonable amount of time. The interviewer then asked me more questions from my resume and then we ended. Thankfully I think I did well on the behavioral questions from both. If anything that'll be my saving grace.

All in all, it was a pretty standard interview process. Only weird thing was the discrepancy between people with 2 and 4 interview rounds. I doubt I'm gonna get the position since I messed up the first question, but you never know!

If you have your final round with MS coming up soon, its really nothing to be afraid of. Hopefully you do better than I did :) &lt;3"

Hey everyone, I'm having trouble deciding on an offer for a Spring internship.

I have a Technology Analyst Intern offer from Southwest Airlines for $30 hourly which seems to have more business-tech/PM responsibilities and there's free unlimited flights with SW.

I also received an offer for Siemens Strategic Student Program which is Java Desktop App dev for $37 hourly.

I would be working 10-20 hours with Siemens and 20-30 with Southwest. Both of these jobs are remote.

I know from the numbers the decision should be clear but I'm also considering the value of each company on my resume as well as the fact that I've already worked a couple development internships and was hoping for increased responsibility.

Plus, the internship I'm doing right now is in Java, so it seems redundant from an experience perspective.

I did send an email trying to negotiate wages with Southwest but I'm still waiting for a reply

Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!"

My university offers a BSc degree with a major in computing science and a minor in bioinformatics, but after reading a lot (on reddit) mainly im seeing more number of people who acquire a bachelor's in bio-related fields and proceed to a post grad in bioinformatics.

So I'm just looking for advise whether it's better to stick with biochemistry and try to do bioinformatics in masters, or is it advisable to switch to a CS degree and minor in bioinformatics and continue to postgrad route, or is there another path even more advisable? 

I realize masters is required at the very least, and I'm (at least in the early passion of an undergrad) ready for that commitment, i just want to set the best base for myself, any suggestions as to things I can do during an undergrad to add to my CV and info on internships etc would help me a lot as well.

The work that I do however is data engineering stuff, as in building pipelines for processes on gcp. 


Long story short my experience with programming is not great, I‚Äôm an ai and data science post grad student all the projects that I did were basically me using python and applying statistical methods and trying out new things in python. Most of the time I didn‚Äôt have to code anything, I just had to find the right solution and the ones that makes sense to my project needs. 

I was pretty confident as I thought it‚Äôs about finding the code rather than writing it by yourself, now I‚Äôm paying the price. I get blanked out the moment I have to build logic and fix errors on code written by others in my workplace. I struggle with development and I don‚Äôt know how else can I‚Äôm prove myself, I know for fact that there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting an offer for my internship as I‚Äôm very slow and everyone in the team is pretty smart. 

I understand that they have realized that I‚Äôm not on their expectation of performance so in the meetings they assign easy stuff and have a little laugh(I sometimes suck at those too) 


I thought they would be training me for the 1st month by introducing me to the tools and objectives at hand instead I was asked to read the documentation of Apache beam and gcp related stuff and expected me to work right away. It may sound like my team isn‚Äôt helpful but they are very nice people have helped me very much in learning and understanding.


So I don‚Äôt want to suck at coding so any resources will be helpful, I failed to find a leet code equivalent of data engineering and data science. Leet code does have sql but no where can I find-exercises related to pyspark apache beam google data flow and other equivalent cloud services such aws and azure provide. I love the fact that I suck at it makes me only want to learn more. So please any suggestions can be helpful. Thank you!"

Thoughts?",JibilWibil,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/y9fl77/feeling_maybe_lost_and_confused_cant_really/,"Hello everyone, so I just finished my education for a medical course recently, everything is going well and just in a few months I have to get ready for my license exam. Now the thing is, it might just be peer pressure, but most of my friends and colleagues all have an idea on what they want to do, like either getting a job, or studying for the license exam, or like getting a job in a different field from the one we just studied. Now I kinda feel pressured a little bit, but I try to keep myself as composed as possible, but recently I feel like I hit a wall. 

Due to the pandemic in 2020, I started to develop an interest in tech, mainly PC stuff, and I recently started thinking maybe I could start learning how to program.  Because I started thinking of this, I started wondering if I should continue on with my license exam. The thing is, I mostly picked my college course because of a gut feeling, but upon experiencing what I just went through, I started realizing that this job doesn't interest me that much. I also recently realized that compared to programming, I'm actually more eager to study programming rather than continuing with my medical course. I've been talking to my parents about my interest in my medical course and they want me to continue with the license exam stating that because if I started working in another country well that's where my pay will increase significantly (the country I'm currently in doesn't pay well to my career choice). I feel like if I went with programming, I might start from 0 but I would feel more comfortable with the work, but if I went with my medical course, then I could potentially earn some money when I move abroad and possibly have some benefits (not sure about this part), but then would feel like I'm probably gonna get battered by the workload (another factor to why I'm doubting my medical course). I learned about the workload during my internship, and it was painful, I don't know if this is especially true because we didn't have a paid internship like in some countries or colleges, but yeah, I understand that work is work but I also heard a saying that if you loved what you're doing, work isn't just work anymore. A reason why I'm also doubting my choice in programming is because firstly, the amount of money we paid just to finish my college course would go to waste, and because at first I believed that a desk job wouldn't suit me, but oddly thought I started thinking about it and started feeling like I still might have some fun.

So in short, I am caught in between learning how about tech stuff and continuing with my medical course. Sorry if this post got too lengthy but atm I just feel very lost and it feels like something is constantly screaming in my mind. So if maybe you were in my position or like had an experience close to or just like this, what would you do?  Or maybe you have your own opinion on the matter, I'm eager to read everything. Thanks so much and have a good day!"

I am by no means an artist at the moment but I feel like if I pour everything I can into I can improve enough in the next two years to build a portfolio. I used to love to draw when I was younger and I did a bit of anime fan art (I know it‚Äôs not much). However I think I do have an affinity for it and given proper guidance I can do it. I started looking into game art programs like CGSpectrum but it‚Äôs not for beginners to art. I also saw the CGSpectrum + Hussian College programs and they are 24 months which is a little less than what I have for my degree. There is also the option for changing to the Game Art undergrad at my current school however it leans more into 3D Art than concept art. I am pretty torn at the moment as to what I should do.

I am learning Java as I navigate the codebase. However I am facing some difficulty in navigating the codebase. Sometimes, while navigating I get lost in the depth of the interrelated code blocks and forget where I started from. 

As I am learning while navigating the codebase, I take a lot of time to understand the code and work on some modification of this repo according the the needs of the project, however, I am worried that I am taking too much time. My co-intern also works on the same repo, but he can land fixes or resolve bugs very quickly. I feel that I keep foregetting the entire codeflow when working on a specific folder.

I feel dumb and very slow at times.

Any suggestions on how to navigate codebase in a systematic manner to retain the flow better? Or does this get better with practice since my co-intern has more work experince than me not necessarily in Java but in other languagaes and internships?"

At Microsoft, I would be interning for Commerce + Ecosystems (C+E) which, I'll be honest, I'm not as interested in (yet, I guess since I don't have much exposure to it). At Salesforce I would be working for the Revenue cloud team which I think I might enjoy more but man, the resume boost Microsoft would give me is probably way better than Salesforce. Both are pretty good about giving return offers so I'm not too worried about new grad offers, assuming the economy doesn't tank. I'd have to relocate for Microsoft but I don't think it's that big of a deal.

I was hoping to get feedback on my resume--I have a lot of things redacted for anonymity so apologies if it is hard to read. I'm happy to send over a less redacted one if necessary!

For background: I graduated with a non-CS degree &lt;5 yrs ago and am pursuing a career change to CS. The MS in CS begins in Spring 2023 (it's online/part-time), but I don't think the degree denotes that so leaving it just as is. My previous experience was at a medium-sized software company doing software adjacent work (more customer facing).

I'm mainly targeting Computer Science internships for Summer 2023 and have begun applying to those.

In **June** I got an 4-month-long internship as a Python developer (CS50 teaches Python and connections were the only reason I got it) and now my title is SWE. I work part-time since I'm a student (not CS related).

The reason for the confusion is that I feel like I'm just doing random tasks - Django APIs, web-scraping, and test cases in Python, web adapters in C# for MS Botbuilder, worked on an open-source language-parsing library.

The issue is I don't have the skill or experience in a particular area that can help me land a job. I'd say I'm OK at Python, but I don't have much experience in Django (apart from small side projects) and I have 0 experience in AI and data science, and these 3 are what most Python jobs require.

I have some non-professional experience with web technologies such as React and Node. Should I just continue doing the random unrelated tasks in Python and not worry or should I seek to get more experience in other areas? 

Any advice would be appreciated."

My first job out of college was as a community manager, worked hard‚Äîtypical first job honeymoon phase‚Äîand did very well in the position and learned things that made me very hard to replace. Long story short, after less than 2 years, I was leading the entire local marketing department‚Äîa 17-man team. I also pipelined the brand's e-commerce business, which contributes to 12% of their annual profit (very high for the industry). Because of that, I was 'pirated' by another company for a director-level position. Had to leave 4 months in because I couldn't take the kind of culture the CEO was cultivating.

It's been almost 2 years of actively applying (including my shortlived director stint) and I haven't been able to land a job. I've sent over more than 500 applications and tailored my resume, cover letters, etc. and so far have only had 8 interviews, which either low-balled me to hell or I failed. (I realized I suck at interviews no matter how much I try, I get anxious, get too honest, or poorly communicate my successes. I especially suck at the managerial-situational questions, because I honestly don't remember how I handled those situations, I just did them and made my entire team happy and high-performing.)

I've applied to countless roles from internships to c-level. Optimized my CV. Made a portfolio. I only apply to positions I know I can do and where it clearly indicates in my CV that I can do that kind of work. Still, no luck.

TL;DR

Worked hard to later land a director-level role at the age of 24 (I'm still 24) and have been looking for a job for 2 years to no avail.

**I was wondering if you think my director-level role is affecting my applications. Is it a red flag for applicants to have that kind of role at the age of 24? What should I do instead?**"

Got a job in service based company. 

As it goes with these companies, you don‚Äôt get the relevant experience and i did neither. The job was entirely different and I had no experience in SE during my 1 year 9 months of the time I spent there. 

Somehow I landed a job in a product based company and now after working for about 1.6 years I have resigned for some issue with the manager. 

So in total i have been employed for almost 3 years and 3 months with only 1.6 years of experience in software engineering with no internships. 

Now the dilemma is I don‚Äôt find myself ready for SDE 2 roles. 

But am not sure if I am expected to go for SDE 2 role and being rejected for SDE 1 roles based on the number years that has passed by.  

Also what do I put in my resume for my previous role? I don‚Äôt have any good experiences with my previous company. Although I did try make it look like it was related to programming but don‚Äôt feel its barely enough cause 1 year and 9 month is a lot of time. 

It saddens me to see how much these company expects from the candidate, its pretty darn hard for a regular folks to get a job in this industry even after some experience."

I'm a bit confused as to what I'm supposed to put when it asks for a description of each job, since I've already listed my responsibilities and accomplishments on my resume, and I don't want to sound redundant.

So far, I've just been putting something along the lines of:

Part-time position during X year of college. Was responsible for X and Y. Technologies used include...

And for some, I've also added ""Achievements include:"" and listed those that I specify on my resume, but I feel a little iffy about that one since I'm just repeating myself at that point.

Does anyone have any advice on how to fill out this part of the application, and if/how they should differ from what's listed on your resume? Would you change anything in the example I gave above, or is what I've been doing so far fine?

Now, I don't have a lot of white collar professional experience so I was hoping that I could get advice. Here is my letter so far:

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a senior computer science general concentration major. I started out as a cyber security major but found the mathematical aspects of programming to be a better fit for me. I spend a lot of my free time planning my future career and learning about the way different companies manage their software engineers. I am passionate about writing code and working on programs. I have been taking steps towards becoming a full stack developer and am currently seeking a position in which I can grow these skills as both an intern and eventually a full-time member of the team. I am flexible in that I can work extensively on my own or as part of a collaboration. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't sure how to post my resume, but my current GPA is 4.0 and probably going to be 3.8/3.9 at the end of this semester. My resume is not special, I have some work experience - not tech related. I was going to post a redacted picture of it on here but wasn't sure how."

I'm not dropping out of the degree to take the job; I'm either graduating 2 years early to take it, or staying a year or two longer to try to find a better offer.



I'm have finished the first two years of my Bachelors in CS (T30 Uni)  and was able to complete all my degree requirements in that time, due to AP Credit, taking a shitload of classes, and summer classes. 

Knowing that I could graduate in ~2 years, i started applying to full-time positions just for practice and the chance i landed anything, listing my graduation date as a senior.

I got a ~$100k offer in a HCOL (not a coast) and now am unsure of whether I should just graduate and take the offer, or try to get an internship at a better company and land an even better offer.

I could stay in school and do an MS within the 4 years, or just stay for 3rd year and take whatever I want. Either way, I'd be shooting for even better offers the longer I stayed, (FANG/Quant). I could also just take the offer and try to job hop within the 2 years before my 4-year grad date.

any advice?"

I feel like every year you're supposed to apply earlier and earlier, and I always miss the optimal time to start applying to jobs/internships. Lastly, this subreddit also makes me feel incredibly bad about myself, with people flexing their 10 job offers. This subreddit has genuinely good information, but it's so tough seeing people be doing so well when I'm struggling. IDK. not much of a point to this post, mostly just a rant.


Edit: I‚Äôve probably applied to around 100 jobs so far. reading all of these comments and playing with my cat made me feel a lot better. Really, I think my problem was starting to really apply in late September, when I should have started late august. I also have had a few OAs, but I did badly on most of them.

Edit 2: another thing that‚Äôs tough is that I really want a job in nyc to be close to my family and friends, but like 90% of tech jobs are in Bay Area or Seattle or Austin."

My sister is now 22yo, two year ago, she had an episode of delirium/psychosis; she was not concious of what was happening most of the time, she was hospitalizied for more than a month. She ended up taking abilify everyday and was getting better and better.  The doctor gave her different diagnosis, some said bipolar, some said a psychosis episode. 
The days prior to that epiosde, she was chasing her ex-bf, she was dissapointed that her two best GFs were ignoring her, and the situation at home is not great as the parents are not in a good relationship.

This year, she was doing great and everytime her episode was mentionned, she accepted it and was focusing on living her life in a good way. She even did an internship abroad by herself for three months. When it comes to abilify, she decreased the pill little by little until she stopped it.

Two week ago, she went back to university for her senior year, the recent days she was acting a bit weird, scared from darkness, praying, she called me one time saying that the episode that he had was because of her friend and she told me that she feels so much better now that she blocked her.
She've been tired all the time because of school but also active, she contirubuted in organizing  an event with her school two days ago. 
Red signs were; she was pissed how they did not give her credit, she argued with her classmate. She was planning my dad's birthday and planning to buy stuff, etc.
Today she called me, she said I was in class and I started to have a bad headache and it's because of the too much focusing, she said when the professor explains she would imagine everything he says and its too much. Later in the day, she called her BF to take her to emergency because she panicked. The emergency gave her a letter to see a doctor. 
She told me that even the sounds, were too much and she sounds scared but at the same time she's trying to convince me that she will try her best to calm down and  not stress.

I'm 2500Km away from her and my parents are with her, I feel really bad for them all, my parents are old and stressing alot over her. 

Anyone has experienced something like this or know about episodes like this?"

Very briefly, I wanted to know if there are any good in-depth, more advanced but still accessible at the beginning, resources for Python. The question seems broad but, since I am pretty new, maybe you guys could help me narrow my self-learning targets. My background will surely help. 

I am beginning my journey in Computer Science now in a Master's degree. I have a Physics background, very broad, theoretical and pretty advanced (\~Bachelor and a bit further). Although, I do have a good predisposition for math (and I like this subject, so that might help). So no worries on that part, it is really more on the practical coding side.

During my studies, I mostly learned about Python for drawing and studying functions, solves systems/differential equations, any physical problems that is hard to solve on paper, and a few sorting algorithms too. We briefly overviewed the concepts of complexity. I have been programming more on my own for the past year (mostly JS/HTML/CSS projects) and got an internship for a few months where I learned about and worked with mostly django But, overall, it was very sporadic. 

I feel like the knowledge I have in python is good in foundations thanks to my studies, but very little and will rapidly be surpassed during the next few weeks. I was often advised to do some additional coding on the side to catch up, which I do not fear at all. I have no idea which chapters I should focus on (most of my courses are Machine Learning oriented + one Information Retrieval class) nor in which forms should I self-study. The tutorials I find online are either too basic or too advanced... I am not against the idea of following a book either.

I am open to all ideas or maybe you have a similar motivational story to share. Thank you for reading me and any other tip you might have is obviously welcomed !"

It's been 6 weeks (halfway through) since I've joined the team and the work I'm doing is not interesting at all. The team culture also feels pretty dysfunctional but at the same time, I am not motivated to push myself and frequently find myself slacking off.

A staff member said FAANG company comes to a/A sometimes yearly or X, depends on demand need X engineers, usually TA likely due to longer study time while teaching others &amp; more data on them (as a student &amp; what students rate them as teaching staff: [1](https://i.imgur.com/x0tVMyT.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/03DVGI6.png)).

Another ending note: not every job you apply to as an alumnus in their partnership network, gets actually sent to potential employers. App Academy reviews who's submitted an app before allowing your app to go all of the way through and reach the potential in-network partnered company. I asked my career coach about it and this was vaguely explained verbally, that there can be cases where I or anyone could submit one and it isn't selected to get sent to them. That's why they have you fill out a form if you're interested in applying with your resume attached (all sent to a/A not the employer directly). You won't be notified on cases of your application submission not getting sent to a potential partnered employer. We'd also be told not to apply to them directly on their company website if they had an opening and only through a/A if they announced it for the partnered company.

There's not 50-100 questions per exam, sometimes \~10 w/ most 1pt but \~2+ w/ 5pts so if missed 1-2ish that means fail, re: [1](https://i.imgur.com/zwWBqcl.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/eAX5jgS.png). If Yelp links still work, see more [here](https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/app-academy-san-francisco). Large class sizes too, 16w can be \~60+ while 24w \~120+ &amp;both dwindle down: [1](https://i.imgur.com/cFZ4wfb.png). In 24w case, mine reduced down &gt;50%.
* **Curriculum**: lower quality than city/community colleges or universities. Sometimes high school. Didn't match ads or price expectations. Curriculum person fired over 24w online. Typos. Iffy modules/curriculum months. Some broken. Outsource a ton with free online resources, even.

All except 2 (22+ education staff I encountered) had no professional software/tech experience. Those that did had 1yr or few freelance/contract some were cyber vs SWE.

[High staff turnover](http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-App-Academy-RVW46024661.htm). Forced to apply to # of jobs weekly or you'll get a strike like while in the program for X rules. Others: [1](https://i.imgur.com/ZE4nPHf.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/8OzHYDh.png), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxypjLa3a2g) video contents in 1/2 \~1:07:36, [4](https://i.imgur.com/P8gYiz2.png), [5](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png). Not all partnership jobs are SWE/SDE, includes tech sales/customer jobs, etc. Idk anyone who got a job via a/A alumni ([1](https://i.imgur.com/x314S55.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/io7ksrT.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/8OzHYDh.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/elIKzVY.jpg), [5](https://i.imgur.com/buP2rdk.png), [6](https://i.imgur.com/x0tVMyT.png), [7](https://i.imgur.com/Hf65M7E.jpg)) but not saying impossible. In a/A Slack channel an alumnus asked a/A to stop telling ppl to reach out via LinkedIn for jobs due to large inbox. Re: another ending note -- not every job you apply to as an alumnus in their partnership network, gets actually sent to potential employers. App Academy reviews who's submitted an app before allowing your app to go all of the way through and reach the potential in-network partnered company. I asked my career coach about it, and this was vaguely explained verbally that there can be cases where I or anyone could submit one and it isn't selected to get sent to them. You won't be notified on cases of your application submission not getting sent to a potential partnered employer. We'd also be told not to apply to them directly on their company website if they had an opening and only through a/A if they announced it for the partnered company.
* **SWE Job After?**: yes. But I have a degree from a ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù college, decent major, high gpa, student work, scholarship, honors, award, volunteering, extracurrics, internships in tech (non-engineering), etc. &amp; tech work exp. on resume before a/A. Was basically told at job that it was \~1.5yrs tech work experience that helped most, paired w/ GitHub history &amp; commits‚Äô code / solo projects. And the full stacks learned in a/A didn't translate or overlap with the full stack used on my job at all aside from sparing html/css (self-taught) and minor JavaScript use. My employer didn't care that a/A taught two diff. full stacks and you can see ppl hire those who learned one full stack, so maybe 2 isn't necessary or worth expensive price. Many alumni friends don't have the entire a/A full stack be relevant on job. Sometimes half of it is depending on person's company, it varies. To my understanding this is also part of the purpose behind apprenticeships that lead to SWE positions, is acclimating one's programming stack(s) learned in a bootcamp to the ones used within a company since it varies by firm.
* **Why a/A Bootcamp if Free AAO**: some started via AAO. Some thought parts were missing, didn't feel job app ready at end, or aspects were difficult. Chose a/A over other bootcamps due to AAO (familiarity &amp;attached after days &amp;hours in AAO). Others: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ohgg51/app_academy_open_frustrations_is_it_just_me/), [2](https://medium.com/@lynnshubbard/app-academy-open-is-not-free-or-open-source-when-free-comes-with-strings-attached-f3b51ba32fca), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dlm40n/psa_app_academy_open_is_handicapped_designed_to/). If gathered data on paid users (students/customers) w/o telling then same may be for free or paid AAO users.
* **Daily survey, report, pair feedback, etc.** [Progress Tracker](https://i.imgur.com/gcueGIs.jpg) **or elsewhere in a/A**: careful. Reported something at the halfway point. Told to wait for email responses that didn't come for days or at 8pm (have emails). Also noted I'd felt rushed during admissions process since I was pushed to make a deadline w/ \~1.5-2 weeks - they then told me they conducted an investigation on themselves &amp; found that they were not guilty (have an email, similar [here](https://i.imgur.com/tauGJyq.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/2QchRDO.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/2LIPFfX.png)). After this, I realized a/A [cut off all education teaching staff from being allowed to speak to me](https://i.imgur.com/7Fo1wW7.jpg) aside from HR when I'd attend class &amp;try asking a question, or Slack, or any email replies ([1](https://i.imgur.com/V43sjBu.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/cFZ4wfb.png)). I'd wait for hrs when staff were available, no meeting, &amp; 0 ahead in the question queue. Tried asking classmates to send TAs to Zoom room after their Q&amp;A was done, but staff told them not allowed. Tried being in a Zoom room in group &amp;getting classmates to ask a question so I could too, but then they said not allowed. Seemed like they wanted me to withdraw, academically fail out, or get kicked out for strikes (started [getting strikes over small things](https://i.imgur.com/hpAgtU0.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/tEL0Bra.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/U4S5Iz7.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/tLCECQV.png), [5](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [6](https://i.imgur.com/8OzHYDh.png) that should have been excused via proof, like power outage causing missing a check-in but they'd ""forgive"" strikes for other students that weren't me for similar or same situations). A/A started emailing &amp;Slacking me including on a weekend to see if I wanted to withdraw (&amp; then pay them). They also wrote in an email&amp; told me in Zoom mtg w/ witness that I'd be billed if academically failed out, even though for others they tell them they won't &amp;don't bill them. In all cases, this would be a win-win for them since it was at the halfway point so I have to pay $30k+ for it by law (they can say fulfilled their part of contract). Had it been if I had paid upfront, they wouldn't have given refund. What made it worse was that at this point, we hadn't built final portfolio projects yet. So if I had been removed and billed $30k+, wouldn't have been able to get an engineering job since my resume was unchanged after spending months in a/A. Additionally, pre-report [assessments were auto-graded usually](https://i.imgur.com/Zyg4Iza.png) &amp;I'd find out if I passed on time w/ classmates, but post-report I realized anything I submitted was now manually graded (fine) and wouldn't find out if I passed until near EOD vs by midday like classmates. You can see them doing cases like this to others online (`YouTube Video comments:` [`1`](https://i.imgur.com/BdnHuiE.png)`,` [`2`](https://i.imgur.com/AkxRBYM.png)`,` [`3`](https://i.imgur.com/C0jM5uc.png)`,` [`4`](https://i.imgur.com/U4S5Iz7.png)`,` [`5`](https://i.imgur.com/spzK9yN.png)`,` [`6`](https://i.imgur.com/BT15rTn.png), [`7`](https://i.imgur.com/fIBhY9W.png) `| Glassdoor reviews by alumni-turned-staff or general staff:` [`1`](https://i.imgur.com/jniSqZ8.png)`,` [`2`](https://i.imgur.com/3nLQ3Dz.png)`,` [`3`](https://i.imgur.com/78ew3yV.png)`,` [`4`](https://i.imgur.com/tauGJyq.png)`,` [`5`](https://i.imgur.com/Qh9MG7M.png)`,` [`6`](https://i.imgur.com/0ReSwBC.png)`,` [`7`](https://i.imgur.com/NWQsfs2.png)`,` [`8`](https://i.imgur.com/wE6q3AA.png) `| YouTube videos:` [`1`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew_qDA1KeU0)`,` [`2`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU4cy5rqZdY)`,` [`3`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxypjLa3a2g) `| Yelp:`[`1`](https://i.imgur.com/oTpj47J.png)`,` [`2`](https://i.imgur.com/gXgleGh.png)`,` [`3`](https://i.imgur.com/HBlc88n.png)`,` [`4`](https://i.imgur.com/eAX5jgS.png)`,` [`5`](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png)`,` [`6`](https://i.imgur.com/tlxsRUi.jpg) `| Reddit:` [`1`](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/nn9r0e/comment/h08fe19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Furthermore, for any group projects or pair programming, started getting assigned solo \*before solo portfolio project \~2 weeks\* (to do any in-class activities solo, despite solo is rare &amp;only happens \~1/month or X it suddenly happened [43x](https://i.imgur.com/qxk0mWl.jpg) many in a row) or mostly to people who'd been [reported on](https://i.imgur.com/WWUIWeD.jpg) by others (not myself) for issues, &amp;sometimes the very same issues related to my report ([1](https://i.imgur.com/HrhO83y.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/RooqarG.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/nTJxFNx.png), [5](https://i.imgur.com/g9IcV1I.png), [6](https://i.imgur.com/3ydfeRP.png), [7](https://i.imgur.com/KoSzhGM.png), [8](https://i.imgur.com/qc7ZQGm.png), [9](https://i.imgur.com/qdLdBlG.png), [10](https://i.imgur.com/tkzxIoT.png), [11](https://i.imgur.com/z65UCGp.png), [12](https://i.imgur.com/hpAgtU0.png), [13](https://i.imgur.com/zmXC1ee.png), [14](https://i.imgur.com/zwWBqcl.png)). When I asked staff why I was placed in group projects w/ people who'd all been reported on vs groups w/ppl who hadn't been, was told it was a leadership decision (have an email, similar [here](https://i.imgur.com/tauGJyq.png), [1](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/78ew3yV.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/2QchRDO.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/8pSeMxP.png), [5](https://i.imgur.com/HrhO83y.png)). [One of them put a ""joke""](https://i.imgur.com/q1SUhuI.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/gQPkB5L.png) in a portfolio project related to it all, &amp;[a/A](https://i.imgur.com/Id9RCSo.png) featured it as a top full stack project in cohort for everyone to see throughout the entire organization. Or another point where students put my full name in a project + readme (when/where I asked them not to) &amp;revoked my access to the group project repo. A/A finally stepped in &amp;had them remove my name, w/them committing message ""[removing unnecessary information](https://i.imgur.com/0Prn8m2.jpg)"". One was even later hired at a/A (so they do hire students/employees who've been reported on in at least one case, re: [1](https://i.imgur.com/3nLQ3Dz.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/tauGJyq.png) \-- bonus: this also means ppl reported on sometimes have access to student data, most of which was supposed to be anonymous or that you didn't know existed in the first place) [3](https://i.imgur.com/8pSeMxP.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/gcueGIs.jpg). There was proof that said person put inappropriate pics of my gender in a project &amp;I had to reason w/ them to remove some for at least professionalism reasons. One had a [404 game](https://i.imgur.com/4sV9t6n.jpg) joke about killing the user - where they were so in love with the user that they would want them to die featuring a knife (a/A approved final project w/ it in). When I reminded a/A of it months after, they had them remove 404 game but said pics of my gender could be considered art (have an email). A/A even did a spotlight blogpost featuring one of them/staff member to advertise the program shortly after this incident (similar [here](https://i.imgur.com/2QchRDO.png), [1](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/V43sjBu.png)). During my final days in the program for graduation where we're required to have cameras on for hours, one of the reported-on a/A staff members was allowed to, &amp;came to, my cohort's graduation capstone presentations for the entirety of it (\~3hrs [1](https://i.imgur.com/8pSeMxP.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/HrhO83y.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/WLHHLv0.png)), not to mention that it was recorded. On top of that, after eventually finding out I'd pass an exam or project week hours after entire cohort, I'd have to ask my teacher to ""grant"" me access to that weeks' worth of curriculum (you take exam/submit project Monday mornings with new week by midday Monday start) since they started forgetting to (have Slack msgs). In the past, &amp;for everyone else, it was usually automatically ""given"" as soon as passed. This meant I sometimes didn't have access to week's curriculum for 1-2 days past others &amp;was more behind than the norm of already being that in a/A (have Slack msgs). They repeatedly would tell me and my cohort later in lectures/mtgs how lucky we should all feel to have been accepted &amp;a part of the program. I managed to graduate despite this but just keep in mind that with the student contract, they can wield this power over you while in the program. If ISA they still can for years after until you've paid it off. It seemed that some of them liked being in positions where they had the power and control over some students ([1](https://i.imgur.com/tlxsRUi.jpg), [2](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/2QchRDO.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/hpAgtU0.png), [5](https://i.imgur.com/HBlc88n.png), [6](https://i.imgur.com/V43sjBu.png), [7](https://i.imgur.com/eAX5jgS.png), [8](https://i.imgur.com/djx3MOq.png), [9](https://i.imgur.com/tauGJyq.png), [10](https://i.imgur.com/OWu79iX.png), [11](https://i.imgur.com/8pSeMxP.png), [12](https://i.imgur.com/rdx5GN3.png), [13](https://i.imgur.com/bysoliJ.png)). Obviously, learned never to report in any context even in school [1](https://i.imgur.com/K2WXayf.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/W0iTLtH.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/j2cFe0d.png) but didn't know this at the time about schools.

Now the problem is that I'm struggling to get into a programming job. I feel I'm competent enough, but employers are refusing to give me a chance because I have no internship experience, prior experience or a comp sci degree (It's only a diploma). I'm not getting selected for interviews. 

My time on my permit is running out. I feel like I have to do something fast. My goal is to get at least 1 year of Canadian work experience to qualify for CEC. 

Since I'm struggling with getting into programming, I'm wondering what are some other options out there to consider? Are there any jobs (NOC 0, A or B) which are easy to get into? Where employment is almost guaranteed (maybe because demand is really high)? Preferably something that doesnt't require a driver's license.

So far I've only been applying for jobs in programming because that's my ideal career. But I feel like I have to be flexible in my immigration goals to make ends meet. It could be years before I get a programming job, and I need to at least try to secure permanent residence by then by any means necessary. So I'm willing to do any job for the time being. Even if its minimum wage.

Right now I'm working in a minimum wage job, however its a NOC Level D job (low skilled manual labour). So it won't qualify for CEC. I'm wondering if there's any merit to keep on continuing in this job or if I'm wasting time? The job was difficult to find so I'm hesitant to leave it.

What are some options here? Would appreciate any advice!

The sad result is that despite the fact that our team is full of wonderful, qualified people who work hard, get along wonderfully (read: laughing so hard until we cry), and have deep experience and passion for the work, the company ultimately is fucking us all by second guessing the work we do and cutting out entire parts of our (government regulated) processes, because they can‚Äôt be bothered to understand the niche work we do in this industry.

Understandably, since the new boss came in, the team is all in the process of fleeing because despite the fact that we love our boss, we all have professional pride, as well as the fact that we‚Äôre being put in the position where we will be asked to (essentially) falsify federal documents.

The following is my resignation letter. I hope I did him justice. (Before I sent it, I delete the part about how Mr J tried to promote me TWICE and corporate management shot him down both times.)
___________________

Dear Mr. J,
 
Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as Senior _____. My last day will be Friday, 11 November 2022.
 
From the bottom of my heart, I have truly appreciated the opportunity to work with and for you for the past several years. Together, and under your leadership, we have literally done the impossible, passing the government audit, working valiantly to fix the processes, policies and procedures as a lessons learned as a result of the audit, created, developed and implemented procedures to keep this organization safe from future audit scrutiny, trained countless employees &amp; interns in our work processes, and worked hard to boost morale in the effort to create a warm, happy and safe environment for all of those on this team. At one point, the happiness, laughter and joy that exuded from our team started to attract others from the organization to want to join our team--but that is only one example detailing the fantastic group dynamic we had.
 
All of this is a testament to you as being strong in leadership and strong in focus. These were such happy times and I can firmly attribute and credit this joy as coming from you. You really tried to help us and carry us through the darkest of times and laughed with us during the happiest moments.
 
Don‚Äôt forget the time when we pranked you on Microsoft Teams by finding your mobile phone ringtone and played it during a meeting to trick you into picking up your phone.

Don‚Äôt forget the time when we secretly created a bingo card unbeknownst to you of all of the hilarious and common catchphrases you have like ‚ÄúHoly Cannoli‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhatta Whatta!‚Äù and played it for a solid week to boost morale.

Don‚Äôt forget the time when I took a photo of you and created a repeating tile background and shared it with my teammates so that we all changed our Microsoft Teams backdrop photo to you with your huge grin and afro from high school.

Don‚Äôt forget the time when we all chipped in as a team for Christmas and got you a ticket dispenser for ‚ÄúTake-a-Number‚Äù system after we threatened to do it for months.

And I *know* you‚Äôll never forget the time we waited until you left the office the day before your birthday and we filled it chest high with balloons, big and small. You were comedically popping balloons for over a week.
 
These and many more times I will never forget, because these things transcend the workplace and end up being a part of us. In addition to all you taught me about our work and regulatory knowledge, I will certainly take all of these moments with me throughout my career. I am saddened that I must be moving on, and will miss you and the amazing camaraderie that we have fostered and enjoyed.
 
You know that I will do everything possible to wrap up my duties and train other team members over the next two weeks. Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything else I can do to help during this transition.
 
I wish you continued health, wellness &amp; personal success. I know we will stay touch in the future because you won‚Äôt be rid of me that easily. üòä
 
Sincerely,

Is getting an internship also possible in the spring if fall is a big failure?

I don't pass all of the OAs I get but I haven't gotten back from any that I have passed. Anyone have any advice?

Oracle pays full timers a lot more than GS and capital one but I‚Äôm not worried about full time pay as much since I‚Äôm hoping to do more internships down the line.

I just concluded my internship application process for summer 2023; here are the results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Sophomore at HYPSM, double majoring in computer science and mathematics, 3.8/4 GPA. Planning to complete my requirements early and spend my fourth year doing a master‚Äôs, so my bachelor‚Äôs graduation date would be 2024.
* Experience:  
   * SWE/DS Intern at a decent tech company last summer, but I didn‚Äôt actually do very much at this internship.
   * Research in applied mathematics, no publication
   * USA Computing Olympiad Platinum qualifier

&amp;#x200B;

**Applications:** I started applying in early August. In total, I submitted around 100 applications, mostly from the PittCSC github listing, using [simplify.jobs](http://simplify.jobs/) to fill out forms quickly. Received OA or first round interview from about 25 companies. Once I received my first offer I declined some OAs and interviews because I didn‚Äôt particularly care about the company, or because I was busy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offers:**

* Amazon SDE Intern, Boston
* Capital One TIP Intern, Chicago
* Chicago Trading QT Intern, Chicago

&amp;#x200B;

**Late Round Interviews**:

* Arrowstreet Quant Dev Intern (rejected after third round hiring manager interview)
* IMC SWE Intern (rejected after final round)
* Jane Street QT Intern (rejected after third round)
* Optiver QT Intern (rejected after 2-hour technical)
* SIG QT Intern (rejected after second round)

&amp;#x200B;

**Failed earlier round interviews:** Akuna, Belvedere, Citadel, Five Rings, HRT, several other smaller quant trading firms, a few mid-late stage machine learning startups.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflections:**

* I mostly got interviews from quant firms and got ghosted by most FAANG-adjacent software companies. I don‚Äôt know why.
* Late round QT interviews are really hard. I was lazy and didn‚Äôt do any sort of interview prep this year; I need to actually study if I want to try again next year.
* The machine learning classes I took in school were very theoretical, and I don‚Äôt have much practical experience, and it definitely showed during MLE interviews
* I was taking a very heavy courseload this term, so scheduling interviews and finding time to do OAs was often difficult.

I declined the C1 offer already; have yet to decide between the other two."

My internship ends in December and I think they're most likely going to offer me an extension on my contract but it'll be based on the same pay and to be honest I'm doing really tedious work, nothing remotely related to proper data science. 

I got into data science purely because of my love for solving problems and anything number related so i decided to take a look at a few Strategy Consultant roles because after reading what they do it intrigued me. Fast forward 2 months and i got an offer from PwC as a Strategy Consultant within their Strategy&amp; team ... the pay is almost 10√ó more, the benefits are amazing and it means i get to travel a bit more. And again, the work genuinely intrigues me. 

Sounds great but for the longest time my heart has been on data science and suddenly I'm in this position where I'm offered either to tough it out as an intern with next to no money for another year with the hopes of being absorbed as permanent or join PwC as a Strategy Consultant and finally make a living for myself ? 

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated."
yanfua,2,2022-10-22,"Man, i hate angry people.",IsaacLage,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/yanfua/man_i_hate_angry_people/,"I'm the son of the most peaceful man that has ever lived, and the angriest woman that ever lived.

Guess which one died young.

I really hate, to wake up EVERY DAY to screams of anger, and offenses.

She gets angry at any little thing. And at everyone.

she has this need, to repeat everything 5 to 10 times. and of course angrily.

And she has bad memory, or a necessity to remember the past and relive it actively.

So whenever she's talking to someone, everything goes like:

""Hey! Long time no see, nice to see you. Different from THAT *!?!#$#_## THAT DID "";'??$-""&amp;## 30 !#$@&amp;!@ YEARS AGO.  I PUT THAT *!#$&amp; IN HER IN HER PLACE, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN, OHH... I WANNA BEAT THST *!$#+ SO MUCH. THAT TRASH SHOULD #!@. But how's it going? I saw your post in Facebook, your son grew a lot! Very good to see.

And then, when the person leaves she start talking alone like: ""this @#$_&amp;, she !$&amp;#+@* DARES COME TO MY HOUSE AFTER WHAT SHE DID THAT ONE TIME 45 YEARS AGO? IM GONNA SHOW HER, LET HER STEP AGAIN THROUGH THST FUCKING DOOR""

and then, she calmly goes to my grandma, and repeats everything. First she tells how the visit was a *****, then how that situation 30 years ago made her angry, and of course. While screaming angrily.

Then, she calls my aunt and repeat.

Then of course. My uncle's have the worse timing in the world and arrive and she repeats to each one of them.

And if the day was calm. She repeats the rants from the day before AGAIN.

If people do things 100% her way, it's fine. But if only 99%. She starts to accuse people of stealing, of being careless, of being stupid.

I can't handle it anymore.

I lived with her in another city for 4 months, so that i could do my internship so i get to graduate on college. There, she had no one to talk to. Because i don't accept her conversation. She gets the cold shoulder. if she starts ranting. So she mostly stayed quiet, and went on Facebook to offend someone there.

When my dad was alive. He used to be her anger escape route. He would just stand there, while she screams without stop for hours, and that would make a week of peace. But then he had some heart problems.

And she feels the need to do it at someone. I'm the son of the most peaceful man that ever lived, so she comes to me. But I'm her son, and when she raise the tone, i raise the tone.

She's the only person in the last 10 years, who i had fights with and raised my voice.

She brings out the worse of me. And my family keeps accepting her rants, and she won't stop.

My brother moved away when he was 16. And hates visiting. And i agree with what he did. I'm just, stuck I'm my Bubble. It isn't my comfort zone, but i can't leave it either.

The best thing that happened in a long time was my brother giving her a Netflix account. She started watching. And stayed the day in her room, mostly in peace. I only heard screams like: ""YOU @#$&amp;!*_ IDIOT, I TOLD YOU TO NOT GO THERE, YOU PIECE OF $&amp;#@""

but my grandma fell on a nightly bathroom trip, and broke her arm. So, she's handling this situation. Trying to find someone to work, so she can go the bar in the weekends.

She's completely and utterly moved by alcohol. And she picks fights with men, who because of the law feel afraid of beating her up, and she thinks she's strong. Which lead to drunkards to call kid me at my house, during the middle of the night, to go bring my mom home. because she's trying to kill some drunk with a rock.

And of course, this drunks, a few years later went at my work trying to get back. But I'm a big and strong guy. So i just shoved them outside and closed the door. (With my boss permission)"

yaon0p,79,2022-10-22,"Some of my DS peers are making me feel worse about my bad salary. Tempted to leave, but isn't it too early?",FellowZellow,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/yaon0p/some_of_my_ds_peers_are_making_me_feel_worse/,"**TLDR. I make probably half of what most people think I should be making, but unsure of when to leave since I've only been full-time for a little over a month now. When would be the best time to leave? I have solicited interest from a number of recruiters, but I want to time my exit right so it doesn't look too bad for my career or resume.**

So I'm a Data Scientist with under a year of experience and am also a new grad from a really good DS program. I got offered a job at a really good company (well at least reputation-wise), so everyone thinks that they pay well. The truth is that they don't pay well at all, especially for entry-level talent. People who graduate from my program make good money too, like low to mid 100s on average according to school reports. I was a pretty good student too, and most students from my cohort know this, so when they hear how much I make, they often are quite baffled.

I was an intern making 25/hr (which I didn't mind because of the experience, and is standard for intern rates according to my peers), and got a return offer that's about 32/hr with benefits which is half of what my classmate's average salary was. The most they were willing to give me was 34/hr when I tried to negotiate. It was pretty shocking to get lowballed like that, but since I naively didn't look for other jobs during the internship since they made it clear they wanted to give me a return offer, and I liked the experience, I thought they were a company I could see myself with a long time. Now I know better.

I feel bad because everyone thinks I make 6 figures, but in reality, it would probably take me 3-5 years to get that with this company, and the national average for new grads is like 95k. Mind you, all of this is in CAD, so that should give some more perspective.

Finally talked about it with my mentor last night, and he's surprised my employer would even offer me such a low salary, and wants me to try for other companies he knows will pay me a lot more. He suspects that they usually lowball interns, which seems to be the case. Even my manager privately mentioned to me that he thinks I'm getting underpaid, and most DS' at the company are getting paid below industry averages. The only thing is, I love my team and manager, and have learned a substantial amount in such a small amount of time that will make me even more attractive to a lot of employers in the future. I'm about a month into my full-time DS role, but I'm not sure how soon I should leave. The shame of making such a low salary when everyone believes I should be making a lot more eats at me sometimes. If dealing with imposters syndrome wasn't enough, I feel like a fraud sometimes since my friends think I make 120k but I make just a little over half of that....

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the overwhelming response and advice. I couldn't respond to everyone but I appreciate all the effort to give me some perspective. Hopefully this thread helps others as well. Thank you guys! "

I got into accounting just because of my parents‚Äô suggestion but basically hated studying for it. I don‚Äôt plan to do CPA or any other accounting accreditation like ACCA or CIMA.

Recently found concepts in data analyst/engineering interesting from watching videos and I do have some background in information systems and a bit of webdev so it wasn‚Äôt really hard to understand and I feel like I can be passionate about it.

Should I keep pursuing finance/accounting roles that I‚Äôm obviously not competitive for or try to transition to data centric roles?"

I don't know how internships works in other universities but  in mine we can only do one internship and we can validate it with  optional subjects. My plan is doing my internship in my last semester  while I do my final year project, so if I get lucky I can finish college  with a job. I don't have a perfect idea of my final year project but I  know that it'll be something related with computer vision.

This  semester I'm taking an optional subject about Machine Learning (not  neural networks basic algorithms like linear regression, svm and random  forests) and the next semester I'll take an optional subject about  Service Oriented Architectures.

I  really enjoy both Data Science and Software Engineering but I think I  should focus on one. I'm more familiar with Backend Development since I  took a Spring (Java) course on Udemy and I'm not really good at math but  if I finally choose Data Science I'm willing to study a lot so I can be  good at work. In the Data Science field I'm familiar with libraries  like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn.

I  don't know where to focus my free time because I think that there are a  lot of backend jobs but also there are a lot of backend devs on the  other hand there are less data science jobs for juniors and I think in  the following years there will be more data scientist. Another important  aspect is that data scientist make more money.

There  are many companies where I can do my internships, but I would like to  point out that a few days ago a good company from my country came to my  machine learning class, offering to do the internships with them, as  well as offering their data to do the final degree project. . They said  that a couple of colleagues had already done their internships with them  and that they are now part of the data analytics team. It is also  important to note that I don't know if I will be able to apply for these  scholarships because next year I will not take Machine Learning and  because there are many people interested in these scholarships and the  professors filter by grades, and mine are mediocre.

In what do you think I should focus? Maybe a little bit of both?

Thanks! And sorry if my English is not good."

So this started from an injury to my hand, doctor had me prescribed for PT, and I was lucky enough to get that new one. She recently finished her diploma and is quite new to the hospital in the PT role (though she had some internship as one for about half a year) and lets say the first 2 days went kindof bland and not much talking going on, then I started to question her about my coworker Àô(her former band mate) in the way like does she remember him and such (upon his own request), and she was positively suprised how I knew him.  Also about the fact I knew her schoolmates, and that she is known to me, those unforgetable eyes and bold eyebrows I can't forget about, truly a unique individual.  Said he was my coworker and we talk between lunch and breaks (Great older gentleman with great sense of humor for context). Came to the topic of how she came into our conversation, told him she was my PT and so on. She chuckles and asks ""Hope you were talking good of me"" I respond with: "" Only the best"". She lets out a short ""awww"". Now here comes the 4th day (latest PT next one on monday) and we start of strong with him sending greetings to her and backwards, and asked again If we were talking about her again. Told her we talked for a few minutes then switched to a different topic, but that I had her on my mind. Felt like she had blushed or something, Wouldn't know but looked like a wide smile under that facemask. Then a bit more small talk back and forward. 

Thinking about her makes me feel all fuzzy and warm inside, she looks stunning but, I don't neecesarely feel that physical attractiveness, more like her character pulls me in. I really feel she could be the one for me. And I hope that she has the same attraction towards me.

And for even more context this is in Slovenia.

Now I am asking you my dear redditors, how could I go forward from here?

I was thinking of asking her if she was single and if she wanted to grab a drink? Do I shoot my shot? Is it even legal to date my PT? How about after completed sessions? 

Thank you in advance."

Nordstrom is not the first name you think of when it comes to tech but my interviewer talked about how their tech stack is very much modern which I thought would be a better experience in terms of developing my skills as a software engineer. 

The culture at Nordstrom seems to be a lot better in terms of WLB and code-base impact though JP Morgan pays more relative to COL. Not sure what to do here. I would be happy with new grad return offers from both companies. :)

I‚Äôm currently in Mexico due to my studies and I‚Äôm out of my medication. My doc back home didn‚Äôt want to prescribe me drugs for the whole duration, since he said I should get them here (due to the proximity to the US).

I took Vyvanse and Intuniv (Guanfacine) in combination and it was literally the best so far. Now I‚Äôm nearly out of both. Vyvanse is apparently not available for the last 2 years (as well as any other Amphetamine related medication, even the ‚ÄúMexican adderall‚Äù which is prescribed for weight loss is not available). Medication with methylphenidate (long and short lasting) was never really effective for me.

Now the doc here tried to prescribe me Armodafinile and Clonidine to substitute both‚Ä¶and after calling every pharmacy and searching their online shops, neither of these are available either.
I‚Äôm starting to get really worried. I‚Äôm at the end of my studies, which means I have my most stressful classes, applications for my internship for my last semester and have to write my bachelor thesis at the same time.

I literally don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs not possible to send the medication, I already asked at the embassy. My insurance doesn‚Äôt want to help (they could, they have a literal article about their emergency shipment of medication (a regulated one!), but they find excuses of why it‚Äôs not possible in my case). And nobody is allowed to bring it to me either.

I‚Äôm flying back home in December, but until then I have nothing and I fear to fail at my last steps of my studies. The guanfacine also helped me with anxiety and ease my sleeplessness (I experienced a traumatic event 2 months ago) and I‚Äôm afraid it will all go to shit now.

If I fail classes I would have to pay them and for a new semester since it‚Äôs one of the most expensive private universities and the partner university in my home country only covers every course once. So I could not afford continuing to study (I‚Äôm also not allowed to work, only the internship as part of my studies, where I‚Äôm not allowed to earn money either).

I could try to fly to the US for a weekend (Saturday-Sunday), but I don‚Äôt know how to manage that (costs, visa and to find a doctor on a weekend who would prescribe it and a pharmacy that is open and has it available).

The only available other medication here is atomoxetine, which I never tried and needs several weeks to even become effective.

It‚Äôs so ridiculous. I could find my medication here easier on the street than in a pharmacy. I‚Äôm so desperate I‚Äôm even considering it."

I‚Äôm a second year who recently switched my major to CS and this internship opportunity is something I never imagined I‚Äôd be able to get this early in my college career.

But recently, I‚Äôve started to fully convince myself that the internship is not good enough and the company isn‚Äôt prestigious or high-paying enough. Right now I‚Äôm interviewing with a higher-paying and what most people would consider a much more prestigious company and all I can think about is how all of my problems will be solved if I get the internship and how sad I‚Äôll be if I get rejected (despite already having an offer that I used to be happy with). I really think I‚Äôll be devastated if I don‚Äôt get this internship, even though I already have an offer that I should be happy with.

For those who can relate to chasing prestige, do you feel content with your life or can you somewhat relate? I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôll ever be satisfied with my life if I just keep chasing and wanting more and I‚Äôm not really sure how to change my mindset (like the hedonic treadmill).

I don't want to pay extra money for a lesser health plan that is required but for my mental health, I need to quit. I only work 3 hours a week and that is barely tolerable. 

I hate working in the service industry because of the almost humiliating practices that undermine a majority of the people who work there (young teenagers, people of certain religions, people of certain sexualities, people of a certain color) but it's like these people are brainwashed by the idea that CFA is a great company. Funny thing, is they compare themselves to the McDonalds right next to our store and we have kids who work for minimum wage and the MickyDs across the street start at 15.00.

What should I do, should I quit or should I stay?"

I achieved the first and one of the most critical steps by securing an internship with one of the top companies in this area. There where 3, and they are notoriously selective. I got the one that I thought was the best for me. 

I was even more elated when they told me they would extend full time offers to all interns in the fall before that summer. Throughout junior year as summer neared I was contacted by recruiting and pressured that the early I signed the better my start date would be and as I felt a lot of pressure and wanted a start date that would allow me to travel a little something I never had the opportunity to truly experience.

But at the end of the summer, on my second to last day of my internship. I was told that I needed to come down to the office to help with something. When I go there there was nothing and shortly Into the day I was pulled out of a meeting, sat down and told that they where rescinding my full time offer and gave vague reasonings that appeared over blown.

There was no warning and it took me and most people as a surprise.


I am now at the point where the pain of my past mistakes is becoming to much to bear.

I chose to be homeschooled in high school because I wanted to perform well enough to get into a top school. I gave up almost all the normal things in a childhood and studied for those years. I came to college and immediately made sure to get straight As and then COVID hit and it was too late to make friends like freshman. Recruiting came around and I chose to spend time securing the job I wanted rather then enjoy the normal parts of college and at the time it was all worth it. Until I no longer had anything left. 

I feel into a deep depression shortly after securing the job and this past year before the internship a struggled with deep depression but over the summer the joy that all my hard work had payed off helped me almost get out of it until I no long had the job. Now I am at the point where my grade are rapidly slipping to the point where I have been at risk for academic suspension multiple times. Very few people are able to help me as my situation is almost in heard of because most people in it keep quite 

I am at the point where I am struggling to get out of bed in the morning and finding a will to live. I can‚Äôt stomach having to go down a less desirable path after I gave up all the potential joy for this one and losing it all.

I also wanted to have other fulfillments in life like friends, love, happiness. But I wanted to have a career and it seems that those may not be able to go exist. And I have done so much damage to myself trying to get there 

I don‚Äôt know where I go from here.
I don‚Äôt know if this life is worth living."

He only knows some basic Python, R and then some SQL from coursework. No internship, no project (dude don't even have a github account). And he is set to graduate next year in May. 

And somehow, he seems confident that he can eventually find a data analyst/programming job in around 6 months after graduation because he would have a Masters degree from a relatively well-known company. However, dude is not the enthusiast type, like dude just follows whatever his course load gets him to do, which is very basic programming knowledge. 

This is Canada, the job market especially entry-level dev/data analyst is absolutely brutal. I don't even think he is gonna get an interview in 6 months based on how little experience and programming ability he has. 

I feel that he might have more luck doing something else, like foreign student application consultant or housing agent or a CSM, since he can speak Mandarin, Cantonese and English all really well which I think should be a great asset in doing those kind of jobs."

My name is Summer and I am having trouble figuring out what to do for my next semester of college.

I am currently attending the University of Alabama and I am having a rough time. I am studying biology. I am struggling with/failing a lot of my classes. Having a tough time making friends even with the family support system I have down in Tuscaloosa. I have joined/dropped a sorority. I have tried the clubs and have not enjoyed them. My roommate is nice but is more distant than I thought it would turn out to be. I do everything alone even though I attempt to talk to others in the dining halls. My dad went to the university and is a big fan of their football team and I have always gone to all the games ever since I was little. He really wants me to stay but I am considering transferring. Also, I had taken the biology degree that bama had to offer instead of doing the biomedical sciences degrees that I wanted because I wanted to join a sorority but it did not end up working out. Many I have talked to say it is normal to feel this way but everyone around me on campus seems to already have made some friends and look happy. I have crafted 3 possible choices I can do for next semester.

I have 3 possible choices for next semester.

1. Stay at The University of Alabama

I could stay at the college and hope things get better and maybe eventually make some friends. I can try to get my GPA and learn to study better to get the biology degree even though all the partying that goes on in the campus. I also try to ignore all the horrible things the sorority put me through and continue to pass the houses everyday on my way to class. I can get more involved with the clubs even though they are no fun and maybe meet people. I can still keep my family support system even though I don't use them much. This option will keep my dad happy and since he is the one paying my way through college. I will be able to not go through the hassle of moving and explaining to my roommate why I am leaving mid-semester. I still get to keep the college town feel that I want. But the possibility of me still be alone everyday and being even more depresssed is scary because being here has already made me very sad.

2.  Transferring to UAB for the Spring Term

I can transfer to UAB and switch over to the biomedical sciences degree I wanted and a minor in forensics because I am interested in it but not enough for a career. Not knowing anybody there and starting over would be scary but hopeful. I would not have to worry about a heavy party life or sorority life. I would be an hour away from home instead of two from Tuscaloosa. Since I want to be an OB/GYN I would be able to make connections which professors early on that would help me get a leg up on internships in the hospital in the future. It sadly does not have a college town vibe that I like since it is in the middle of Birmingham and there is a lot of traffic that comes with that. None of my ap credits would count so I would have to take some classes over again and work on getting my GPA back up. I would have no family support down there unlike Tuscaloosa. I would have to explain to a lot of people why I am transferring after only one semester as a freshman. My dad would not be happy but would prefer it over the 3rd option. I think the people at UAB would be more like-minded to me so I think I would possibly make friends easier but still no guarantee. But another bonus would be that I can start in the spring term and not have to wait a whole year so I won't be so behind compared to my peers who also decided to go to college.

3.  Go back home for the Spring semester and take Calhoun Classes then go to Auburn next fall

My dad has no problem financially paying for my college but my mom is struggling more (they are divorced) and my dad says he will only pay 1/2 to 3/4 of the bill. So this option would help her out financially so she could save up more for when I go to Auburn the next fall. I think with this option I would be able to stay home and have the support of my family while focusing on getting my GPA up and learning to study better. Also since everyone I know is in college I would have no friends and the free time to get a job and also save some more money for college next year. But I would also be alone until the summer or fall of next year. This option I thought this would be transferring to Auburn in the spring semester but since I don't have many transferrable hours as a freshman they told me I can wait and apply for the next fall but cannot transfer for next spring. The reason why I would want to go over there is that my cousin and my best friend from high school both go there and also many of the people I knew from high school are currently attending there. I don't want to go there and get in their personal space I think if I went there however just knowing they are on campus and having them as a support system would be better than nothing. I would also be able to get the same degree (Biomedical sciences) that UAB is offering and the minor I want as well. I am just scared that by the time I will be able to attend next fall my friends will have settled in and found their groups and I will. still know nobody and be new and also not have as many offers for internships in the medical field there. I feel although I would feel behind and I would for the spring before transferring to Auburn have to deal with my sister and dad fighting because they do it a lot. Also since I left for college my sister has reacted bitterly every time I come home for the weekend like she does not want me there and dislikes me. We were so close and now she is like a different person so I would have to deal with the new grumpy her (she is 16 and has recently gotten a job btw).

All of these choices are valid in my head and there are so many factors that it is almost a crippling decision.

I would love to hear what other people have to say who can step back and look at the options more logically and give critical feedback on why that option would be the best.

Any advice would be helpful!

Sincerely,

A lost 18-year-old girl"

I'm a 19 year old high school graduate, planning on doing University in Germany. Now I have ADHD which makes it really hard for me to concentrate on something I don't like. I love computers, and game development and of course cybersecurity. I've always struggled with school though and standardized education does not work out well for me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe I have a decent portfolio for both cybersecurity and game development. I have an account on Fiverr with over 33 5-star reviews as a game developer for both Unity and Unreal Engine. I am also Security+ certified, got it this August. I'm trying really hard to break it into cybersecurity and to at least land an internship. 

I know I will be struggling a lot in University, since the entire course is in German and I can't even do school in English haha. I want to try to land at least a decent entry level job in cybersecurity. I'm going to write the cysa+ exam next year around spring 2023, and I also have a good github page where I've written my own games and website bruteforcers, viruses, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan right now is to get the CEH which I KNOW I KNOW has terrible rep but I wanna break into the HR filter. I was thinking of CISSP too but I don't think it's a good idea without any experience at all. Of course the end goal here is to get the OSCP but I'm only 19 lmao I don't have a lot of money. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to do university, I know I will flunk it. Can anyone give me any advice as to if I'm trying to do the right thing? I can't even land an internship atm. What am I doing wrong? Any and all advice would be very very helpful. What do you think I should do? Should I just stick with University and try my best to finish it, or try and collect certificates to break into at least an entry level job?"

I am in a dilemma about moving to the Netherlands, Eindhoven to study ICT at Fontys. My plan is to work as a developer abroad when I am done with my studies.

The thing is I don't know if companies hire people, especially entry-level developers from abroad with no experience (I did apply for internships but no sign of hope for now). For example, if I decide to stay in Croatia and finish my study here and I apply for jobs in Netherlands or UK, I don't think I will have a high chance of landing a job. There aren't many developer jobs in Croatia and I've always wanted to move abroad, and see the world (remote work, but that's a topic for another time).

ybdyhd,3,2022-10-23,A Success Story?,Teapotsandcookies,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/ybdyhd/a_success_story/,"So I've been socially anxious pretty much my whole life. It became worse as a teenager/young adult because of some bullying incidents, and also because it is the time in your life when you're expected to start doing things on your own, so it was just more apparent than before.

At 18, I didn't know how to do anything and everything was scary. I'd avoided things for so long that I was completely clueless as to how things outside my house worked lol. Like telling the waiter my order at the restaurant, going on a walk by myself, going inside a store by myself, making phone calls, taking public transportation, etc. All these little things were just terrifying, sometimes impossible. (Needless to say, bigger ones like going to uni or getting a job were even harder to handle)

The worst part was that when I would fail to do any of those things, I would immediately feel really bad about myself, which fed into a vicious circle of self loathing.

Now, at 25, I live by myself so there's many things I have to do on my own, and among some of the things I mentioned previously, I now go to cafes by myself (almost) without a second thought, I make phone calls pretty easily, I get things done without overthinking it, even if it involves socializing, etc. In past years I also went to uni, studying things that required quite a bit of public speaking, I studied abroad for a semester, got a cool internship and then a job.

So on top of achieving those things over the years, I recently noticed just how much easier it had become for me to do so many things that seemed impossible and scary back then, and I wanted to share my story to give you all some hope. It really can get better.

Now of course, I'm not totally comfortable with everything, having to talk in a big group of people I don't know well is still hard for example, but I'm getting there, little by little. I'm also still really awkward when socializing sometimes, but the important part is that I care less about it lol.

Here's some stuff that helped me over the years:

- The realization that I needed to change my attitude and my perspective in order for things to get better (it was a hard pill to swallow though ngl): people out in the real world will be more appreciative of people who try to communicate, even if they're really awkward, than people who do not try and avoid them

- Hanging out with the more outgoing members of my family/friends: observing how they did things, what they would say and how people would react

- Keeping some helpful advice (that I've found to be very true) in mind: ""the cashier at the register does not care about you, they're just trying to get their job done and all you have to do is tell them what you need, they won't remember you"" ; ""people are always happy to be helpful to you when you feel lost or when you don't know something so don't hesitate to ask"" ; ""everything works out well with a polite hello/thank you and a smile""

- Learning to stop overthinking before and after something scary, because it's not productive in any way: it's good to think about it and prepare yourself, but then let it go, it'll happen (or it's already happened), and you'll manage somehow (and if it's already happened you can't do anything to change it anyway)

- The realization that satisfaction and happiness often comes from trying new things, and making yourself slightly uncomfortable (though in the case of SA the fear is exacerbated which is why you have to start slow), living your life only in your comfort zone is ultimately depressing for most people

- The realization that living your life with SA means you are a really brave person: you face your fears every single day, and that's something to be proud of.

I hope this helps you somewhat. Ultimately what helped was a change of perspective and doing things despite how afraid I was. There were many times when I couldn't do it and felt bad, but try to be kind to yourself: there will be ups and downs along your journey, it's okay to not always be successful, you can just try again next time. You guys will be okay eventually."

Have you ever thought that you know, you wasted your life? Could you have used your break better? Currently, I am in Poly Y3 doing internship. My academic life is alright with a GPA of 3.2, but how I did individually, is questionable. 


I did well for O-Levels. 


I admit that I wasted about 5 months of my life. Here's my story below:



Back in 2019, when i finished O levels, i had a plan. I would use every day properly to work and hangout with friends. 

However, the more i thought of work that time, I got lazier and lazier. I didn't feel any motivation to work. I just wanted to hangout with friends. I abused my freedom from school to let my brain rot. Work would stimulate your brain and get you some pocket money.¬† Instead, I laid at home 4 days a week at minimum. I would only go to the library and borrow books to read, besides family and friend outings. 


I only exercised once a week. 

When i saw people around me work and live their lives, I became more and more regretful, but what did I know? I was too blind to freedom and politics. I didn't see a bloody need to work at all since to me, the 5 month break was a time to rest and unwind. I shouldn't be spending so much time slogging cause I know we would work for the rest of our lives after school. I wanted to rest. 



To make things worse, I was a political diehard. Every day, it would be politics for me and i made them so personal. I knew something was wrong with the world, but some people couldn't see it. I pressured and condemned them. Every day seemed like the world was going to end. That marked the end of 2019.


Then came 2020, and I still slacked throughout the first half of 2020. I wondered what i was thinking? I was refusing to work, volunteer, and keep myself competitive. However, even after the thinking, I still chose not to work. I of course still cared about politics like I was living in USA. When Covid-19 hit and the circuit breaker came, I began to regret my choices. But guess what, I still slacked and loathed around. 


Now do you know where I am in life?


Ok before i say where I am, let me tell you something. I was told off by my friend in July 2020 to stop politics, and I did so. I broke down when receiving that message.


I wandered and continued to slack, not knowing what to do in life. I didn't own my life and I saw people around me succeeding. I wondered what I was doing you know? People the same age as me have already won competitions and got high positions, but I am here, STILL SLACKING!?? This continued until December 2020. 


But in February 2021, I turned it around fortunately. I worked for the first time and began to take more risks. It was hard, but I did so. I lived with the politics. However, a fire still burns in me. I started to find my interests and talk less about politics. I exercised six times a week and went out more with the right people. The restrictions brought me down, but it made me stronger. 


Come to now, October 2022, and I am facing these thoughts once again. When I saw my cousin of the same age winning in life, I wondered what I was doing all these years.


I had nice friends, but I drove them away. 
I had a good living condition, but I wasn't grateful. 


It brought back the past. I am doing well than ever before! But, this is not my final challenge. 



So, to all my juniors in secondary school, when the 2-5 month break comes after national exams, DO NOT WASTE IT! TAKE EVERY MOMENT TO FIND YOURSELF AND BE STRONG. When issues are bad, introspect and determine yourself. It is these times where you find yourself and know your real limit. My final message to everyone here.





DON'T. WASTE. YOUR. LIFE!"

Hello everyone, I am 19yo student of computer science at Zagreb University of Applied Science (Croatia) in my 2nd year. I am in a dilemma about moving to the Netherlands, Eindhoven to study ICT at Fontys. My plan is to work as a developer abroad when I am done with my studies.

The thing is I don't know if companies hire people, especially entry-level developers from abroad with no experience (I did apply for internships but no sign of hope for now). For example, if I decide to stay in Croatia and finish my study here and I apply for jobs in Netherlands or UK, I don't think I will have a high chance of landing a job. There aren't many developer jobs in Croatia and I've always wanted to move abroad, and see the world (remote work, but that's a topic for another time).

Do you think that moving to the Netherlands will fill my life with better opportunities and is the right move for me?

Thank you :)"

I just want a general opinion on the overall presentation of my resume.

The section I am most worried about is the ""Projects"" section as they are all older projects that I feel aren't very impressive or interesting and I think I didn't do a good job describing them. I also have found it impossible to use any quantifiers regarding them. I have a couple more old projects but I wouldn't be able to fit them in one single page so I just picked the two that I found better sounding. I also am working on a few personal projects at the moment that I'd rather have in my resume but I haven't been able to get them to a satisfactory point where I'd be comfortable to talk about them and I feel like it's more important to start applying now until it's too late.

Maybe I am overthinking this, that's why I would like to hear some outside opinions.

Thank you in advance!

     I met my girlfriend about 2.5 years ago, and things started off great. I had been single for almost 2 years because I decided to go all in on work so I can buy a house. Once I had the house I decided to start dating again. We both wanted the same things in a relationship, and we had fun. She would cook for me every time I came over, I‚Äôd take her out to shows and events all the time, and we had sex almost every day. She lived in an apartment with 2 dogs and her ex, but in a separate rooms. They only lived together for convince. 
     At that time she was in college, had a full time job, and was about to start an unpaid internship as part of her degree. Her roommates decided to not renew the lease, and she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to afford the place by herself. Her options were to move back with her parents 2+ hrs away and have to transfer schools less than a year before graduating, or to move into the house that I had bought. We had only been seeing each other for a few months, but I thought screw it. We are both looking for something long term, and I have the room. 
      As bad as I felt, I asked her to not bring one of her dogs. It was a small dog that barked all day and pissed and shit in the bed. I worked nights and I absolutely couldn‚Äôt deal with it. Luckily her EX was telling her he wanted the dog (probably just to be an asshole, but it all worked out). We agreed she would move in when the lease ran out, but she kind of just moved herself in about 5 months early. I know school work and her internship would be rough, so I made her a deal to not worry about bills or rent until her internship was over so she can focus on getting her degree and save up some money. When she moved in I had no idea that she had two large storage units of stuff. She moved it all in and my house became a building full of stuff. I also found out she had a shopping and a bit of a hoarding addiction. She started doing things like changing things in the house and yard without asking me first. She rarely cooked anymore, and if she cleaned up after herself she expected praise for it. I‚Äôm a bit OCD with my living space‚Ä¶she is not.
     After 9 months of living rent free, I asked her to start paying rent. Her response to that was that it means she shouldn‚Äôt have to do as many things around the house anymore. We got into a bit of an argument because I asked her how much she had in her savings after 9 months of no bills, and she hadn‚Äôt saved a dime. I realized that she was wildly financially irresponsible. 
     She doesn‚Äôt have many fiends, and only one that she really hung out with. I found out that her alcoholic friend was trying to get my GF to sleep with other guys so she could hook up with their friends. I told my GF that her friend wasn‚Äôt welcome to come to my home anymore. That caused a divide and now they aren‚Äôt friends anymore. Because of the dog she left behind, the friend she lost, and her having gone halves in a lot of stuff in the house, I now feel like an asshole if we broke up. I also know she NEEDS another person to live with because she‚Äôs not responsible enough to take care of herself. 
     Neither of us drink much,  but I found out recently that she can‚Äôt handle her liquor. She‚Äôs an absolute mess when she drinks and ruins the mood of anywhere we are. The other night she almost died because I found her drowning in her own vomit. 
     She begged me for a few months to get a new dog. I refused for a long time because we both work a lot. Eventually I caved. We now have an untrained, high energy dog that destroys the house and shits and pisses everywhere daily. She doesn‚Äôt have time to train it. 
     I don‚Äôt sleep in our bedroom anymore because her dogs keep me up. We don‚Äôt have sex anymore because I‚Äôm finding her less and less attractive. Not only because our relationship is becoming stagnant, but she doesn‚Äôt take care of her health. She asked me constantly if she is fat. I tell her no, and it‚Äôs never a good enough answer. 
     I haven‚Äôt been happy since she moved in, and I grow unhappier. I feel like I‚Äôm taking care of a child, and I feel like a prisoner in my own home. I care for her, I truly do. But I feel like I worked hard for good life, and she‚Äôs only become a burden. I can‚Äôt even think of anything she contributes. 
     Breaking up is easier said than done, especially knowing that it would ruin her life. 

TL;DR: My girlfriend is irresponsible and I feel too bad to break up with her.

ybh0r6,2,2022-10-23,Law student wanting to switch over to programming and need a guidance,Infamous_Computer_19,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ybh0r6/law_student_wanting_to_switch_over_to_programming/,"I  didn't know what to do in life, so I've tried multiple things. I don't  know whether that was a good move or not, but at least I have an opinion  on all of the core subjects that were taught to me in the past.

In  high school I mostly took Biology, Chemistry and Maths classes. What I  found out is that Biology was not for me, period. I was pretty good at  Chemistry, meaning I understood everything without spending too much  time on learning. The issue was, I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have  liked in order to pursue it full-time in the future. Maths was always  fun, but I've always felt that I didn't know enough and that everyone  was better than me at that time, so I decided not to carry on studying  in that direction, which was the first mistake I made. I wasn't exposed  to Physics, besides the absolute basics.

After  2 years of high school I had to make a decision what to do in my life  (in my schooling system high school takes 3 years and ends with exams,  then you apply to university and they accept your application or they do  not, depending on how high you scored on the exams) and I completely  switched over to social sciences, which was mistake number 2. In a year I  had managed to learn quite a lot and I eventually scored 90% on the  exams, meaning I had no issues whatsoever with enrolling in a  university. I chose Law as my major, which was mistake number 3.

Coming  back to the present, I am in my third semester and man, I've to say  that Law is just crap, at least in my opinion. The only course I found  interesting was, guess what, Logic, that I had to take in my first  semester, because it was the most Mathy course. Every other course's  been boring, I don't enjoy them at all, not that it means that I cannot  pass the exams, it's just the field that's a huge pain in the ass. Never  mind, everyone makes mistakes, the good thing is that I am still young  (20) and have no other responsibilities besides studying. The only  problem is that each day is 24 hours, so there is only so much I can do.

What  I've been doing in my free time, is continuing learning Maths on my own  and I've also been studying some programming on top of that, mostly C  and some Python as well. I ain't gonna lie, it has helped me greatly  with my general well-being.

What I  like is, like I previously stated, Maths, reverse engineering, security  and low level stuff. Eventually, I would like to pursue another degree,  that's relevant to my field of interests and hopefully get a job that I  will enjoy in the future. There are neither EE nor CE degrees available  to pursue in my area, there's only CS degree that has some EE,  microcontroller programming and IoT courses, at least according to its  programme, everything else is Java-like high level programming, that I  do not necessarily dislike, but I'd much rather take low level courses  exclusively.

1)What degree is for me based on my interests ?

2)What  should I learn besides C ? Language is just a tool and I definitely  need to know the theory in order to start building practical real world  things. I know that there are many concepts to learn, but I am kinda  lost on where to start. I also get that the IT domain as a whole is very  broad, meaning it's impossible to learn everything, so I'd like to  focus on some foundational concepts first and then specialize.

3)What field of IT is for me based on my interests ?

4)When is the right time to start internships ?

5)What is the interview process like ?

6)Which jobs should I look for and which I should avoid ? Or what should I look for in a job and what I should avoid ?"

The problem is, the current one doesn't have a room for me and as such, I have been place in the drawing room (common area) where‚Äîas you can imagine‚Äîthere is not a shred of privacy.

My father especially has no sense of personal boundaries and peeks into anything and everything I am doing, be that on my phone / laptop etc. and then comments something about it after staring for a while.

Much of the time, not only is that opinion unnecessary and in bad taste for me, but the presence of constant eyes on whatever I do is extremely restricting.

So forget about knocking the door before entering.
They don't even close it while leaving the room, giving the reason for having *fresh air*.
One might think that it'd be a genuine concern, but I know my father well and he likes to keep an eye and have control over as much as possible.

Asking for assumed things requires a lot of convincing here, and this one is simply out of bounds for now.

Problem is, that I am rather sick right now and would have to stay for a while here. I was considering doing an internship for the time being but I don't think I'd be able to keep up.

What should i write? How should i start? Whats the logic ahhh it's really time consuming and I end up procrastinating.

I just want to know how do i learn how to write the code even for small small problems. I get it that it will take time to learn but It's getting frustrating and I'm taking a lot of pressure on my head. The reason is that I'm a final year college student and yeah my future pretty much depend on this. With OnCampus placements going on it's hard.

ybo4hz,3,2022-10-23,Lack of Personal Space at Home (20M),TakeThatCB,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ybo4hz/lack_of_personal_space_at_home_20m/,"I am currently an undergrad student studying abroad and have came back for vacations to my parents' residence.

The problem is, the current one doesn't have a room for me and as such, I have been place in the drawing room (common area) where‚Äîas you can imagine‚Äîthere is not a shred of privacy.

My father especially has no sense of personal boundaries and peeks into anything and everything I am doing, be that on my phone / laptop etc. and then comments something about it after staring for a while.

Much of the time, not only is that opinion unnecessary and in bad taste for me, but the presence of constant eyes on whatever I do is extremely restricting.

So forget about knocking the door before entering.
They don't even close it while leaving the room, giving the reason for having *fresh air*.
One might think that it'd be a genuine concern, but I know my father well and he likes to keep an eye and have control over as much as possible.

Asking for assumed things requires a lot of convincing here, and this one is simply out of bounds for now.

Problem is, that I am rather sick right now and would have to stay for a while here. I was considering doing an internship for the time being but I don't think I'd be able to keep up.

This situation is mentally challenging for me and is deteriorating to my health.

Is this supposed to be normal?
I haven't discussed about this with anyone else so input would be very much appreciated."
ybocwb,52,2022-10-23,Gifts From The Sea,dlschindler,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ybocwb/gifts_from_the_sea/,"""Traditions. Our survival, as a species, depends entirely on our collective behavior. Traditions are collections of behavior that time has proven are good for our species survival."" Mr. Hisomeru told me before he ate some of the raw seafood between us.

I stared at him until my eyes burned. Meg and her mother were still in the bathroom. The whole restaurant seemed to be watching us.

I felt like that moment was the crossroad of my life. If I had gotten up and dropped my napkin and left, then nothing would have changed. I realized I could go back to school and leave Meg with her parents, and we would not get married. It would all be over.

""You do not approve of me, because I am not like you?"" I asked him. I heard myself speaking, unsure how I had the boldness to speak so plainly to him. Perhaps it was the realization that I could walk away or else he would make me walk away. I wasn't going to marry his daughter; Mr. Hisomeru was a powerful man and he had said 'no'.

Except he hadn't actually said 'no' yet. I felt like he had, but he hadn't. He had something on his mind. He wanted to confide something deep and dark and horrible in me. He saw me very differently than I thought he did, in that moment, in the restaurant.

""Sushi is uncooked fish."" He seemed to be ruminating something else while he spoke. I attempted to engage while some caprice of frustration made my choice of words facetious sounding:

""Sushi is half-assed and homophobic. The *Red Hot Chili Peppers* say: 'I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan' and that's that."" I snapped.

Mr. Hisomeru slowly raised one eyebrow and sipped his water. He cleared his throat, a satisfied 'ah'. He looked intently at me and spoke:

""You remind me of someone I have learned to fear and respect. You are defiant and a little crazy - inspired. An artist - no doubt."" Mr. Hisomeru spoke carefully to articulate himself with precision in his third language of English. ""And I like you very much. I understand my daughter's passion. I am not angry with you about the pregnancy. I am looking forward to having you for a son, David."" Mr. Hisomeru sounded sincere and strangely so, after my little outburst.

""Then what is it? What is this?"" I gestured at his demeanor, his coldness, his distance. Mr. Hisomeru had calculatedly put me down since we had met an hour earlier and relentlessly observed me, as though he were inspecting me for flaws and finding them in abundance.

""I need your help. I have searched for someone like you and my greater quest is at a standstill. I find it ironic that I did not consider the man Meg described as anything but a reflection. Yet here you are: perfect. I do not know what to think or say. I feel embarrassed that I have so much to say to you and I am so impatient to get to know you. I am proud of Meg and I am...I am...I am proud of you."" Mr. Hisomeru was not bothered by my insolence. He contradicted himself by telling me that his real feelings were positive. I felt my face go red and hot. I did not know how to take his sudden departure from his formalized degradations.

""I misunderstood you."" I said quietly to him.

""Don't."" Mr. Hisomeru said sternly. ""I was precisely like you are - when I was a student. I also found myself distracted and my studies halted by finding a woman that I loved as dearly as you love Meg. I also had the same initial goal of finding the last great secret of this world. I also knew where to look. Most of all, you are just like me, you do not know how to apologize.""

""I was going to marry her despite you."" I admitted. ""I knew I should go, but I couldn't.""

""I know."" Mr. Hisomeru had a strange, almost imperceptible smile. ""You do not know when it is time to give up, you do not realize when you are caught, trapped.""

""What is your greater quest?"" I asked him.

""To my business partners I am a happily married fisherman with one child: a grown daughter. I have humbly elevated myself to the owner of a small fleet and a facility where we now attempt to breed captive Pacific eels.""

""Attempt?"" I wondered. ""Eels do not breed in captivity?""

""Eels do not breed."" Mr. Hisomeru stated.

""The quest."" I realized. ""It is an old one. The Holy Grail of Science.""

""To my son I am King Arthur. A man only really cares about what his son sees in him, not the rest of the world."" Mr. Hisomeru's eyes watered slightly. He was being sincere with me.

""I feel like I've known you much longer than this dinner."" I nodded.

""We share a truth, and it is only the first."" Mr. Hisomeru made a smile and in that gaze: I saw a glimpse of the horrors to come.

The women returned to the table and seemed grave. They had discussed the bleak interaction between me and Dad and decided things were not going well. We (Dad and I) surprised and delighted them when we reached across the table to feed each other a piece of sushi with our chopsticks. Then Mr. Hisomeru ordered the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu and told the waiter that we were celebrating an engagement.

I thought about that dinner many times. I thought about how that was the moment when everything changed for me. I had begun a path of destiny, one that would lead to my fate and the discovery of a lifetime. It was a memory of my first step on a path towards ultimate horror.

While I sat in Venya Industries fishing fleet administration with my application: I felt strangely nervous. I couldn't speak Japanese or Hindi and I felt like I had no relevant skills or education. I questioned what I was doing there and how I had arrived. I wanted the job, I wanted to join Mr. Hisomeru on his quest, that is all I knew.

I knew I loved Meg and that she was even more nervous about my interview. If I didn't get the job, what would I tell her? What would her parents say?

""David Whitemoon?"" The heavily accented recruiter called me into her office. I looked around, wondering about the size of the international organization.

She had my file in front of her and had read it. I waited for her to ask me something but instead she just sat filing her nails. I cleared my throat and stopped waiting when I asked:

""Did I get the job?"" I asked.

""Nepotism is alive and well, Mr. Whitemoon."" She looked away from me to gaze at a giant crab claw taxidermied and mounted on a board on her wall.

""Jokes aside, what exactly are the qualifications for the job?"" I asked. She pondered my English and responded:

""You are incomplete of many skills: swimmer, scientist, diver, biologist. Son of important business partner. You have the job. Paid internship for student. That is job I have for you."" She didn't look at me. ""Details printed out for you. Staying at company apartment. You leave with expedition in three weeks.""

When she stopped talking and began humming to herself: I got up and took the printout and left. I spent the last of my money on the taxi back to the company apartment. Twelve other employees from Venya and Nippon were already staying there, with room for more. I became acquainted with all of them, although none of them spoke English. While the weeks went on, I studied my classes online and met more sailors and scientists gathered for the expedition.

Our vessel, *Miyamoto*, was owned by my future father-in-law. As we all went from the shuttle up the gangplank with our bags, I saw him there: Mr. Hisomeru. I looked at him watching his expedition team boarding. He looked very proud and regal.

Later, alone, Mr. Hisomeru told me the most vital details of our mission. Only he and I knew the exact scope of our search. Each of the other team members all knew what they needed to know to do their part and Captain Ishikawa and his crew were competent enough to get us to the expedition site.

""You must know we are going after the Atlantic eel, in the Sargasso Sea. The mythology, the facts, these are just the tip of the iceberg. We will find out the truth."" Mr. Hisomeru began. ""Years ago, there were researchers that tried to watch eels breeding under the sargassum using cages suspended from buoys. If all we had left to do to solve the great mystery is that, then it would have worked. Unfortunately, the cages were all destroyed by something unknown and unseen. Since the beginning this is always what happens, anyone who seeks the secrets of the eel only finds deeper mysteries. Maddening mysteries.""

""Something is down there."" I deducted.

""Is there?"" Mr. Hisomeru gestured for me to elaborate.

""The eels are born there and return there. They do not breed. Somehow, they find their way from fresh water back to the darkness and horror of their birth. What is down there, that is nowhere else?"" I thought-out-loud.

""Questions I have asked. Consider that the count of mature eels does not change from season to season. How do the eels know when they will arrive, if they all leave from different places and at different times to return home? The seasonal fishing of eels, traditional harvests, only anticipate where and when the eels will migrate. Greatly curious scientists have spent their lives and funding at sea, narrowing it down. Such knowledge is still missing the big picture."" Mr. Hisomeru walked slowly to a hand drawn map of the coasts where eels were fished for, colored to match the seasonal fishing and the maturity of the eels in the waters.

""We've known for a long time that they return to the Sargasso and never leave."" My voice trailed after his, following his thoughts to their conclusion. ""And that young eels come from there.""

Mr. Hisomeru sighed and reverted his thoughts to dismiss what we thought we knew already: ""Yet they do not go there and nest in the sargassum and they do not breed. Aristotle thought that eels must spawn from mud, Freud that they are sexless. Svennson wrote that Eel is, for lack of scientific quantification, truly mystical."" Mr. Hisomeru looked at me, from his map, over his shoulder.

A strange and alien sensation of horror began to rise up inside me as I imagined the shaded sea under the green umbrage full of writhing eels. I knew then what I was expected to do. There was something beneath the mass of knotted serpents that watched them and knew them. Something that lived always in darkness and felt worshipped. A pillar of the oceans, a monster, something beyond what I could imagine, something truly beyond comprehension. I must have looked pale as my mind's eye anticipated the world I would see down there.

""If you do not wish to discover it, if you are too afraid..."" Mr. Hisomeru turned and looked at me, concern, disappointment and relief all evident on his unmasked expression towards me.

""This is what you have chosen me for."" I said with my voice trembling.

""I chose you?"" Mr. Hisomeru denied it with his tone-of-voice. ""This is greater than you or I. This quest started thousands of years ago. It is more important than visiting the moon or splitting the atom. The secret, the last secret, is also the first."" Mr. Hisomeru sounded like he found Eel to be mystical.

""My fears and my wishes are in conflict. I want to see my child born."" I realized there was certain danger, even from imaginary sea monsters.

""My grandchild will be born into one of two worlds."" Mr. Hisomeru spelled it out for me. ""This old world or one that the father has made whole.""

""I see."" I agreed. I intended to conquer my fears. I was an expert swimmer, a diver, a student of biology and I was a scientist; I had a job to do.

The weather held up during the first four days of the expedition. We collected the buoys set out in the previous weeks by *Vimana* on the company's precursor expedition. The cages under them were all missing or mangled.

""The underwater trail cameras show the eels in the light. We uploaded as many pictures to satellite as we could and then we tried to recover the cameras. As you can see by the condition of the cages: the cameras did not survive."" Dr. Ryu reported what her team had found. ""These images show that the cages were destroyed while the eels were inside. When the cages were badly damaged enough, the eels escaped.""

""What destroyed the cages?"" I asked after there was a pause in the report. It was what everyone was wondering.

""Exactly."" Dr. Ryu pointed at me and then shrugged. ""Who takes it from here?""

""Thank you, Dr. Ryu and Team A. Your work will be handed over to my research laboratories at Nippon and also to Venya. We have to keep the investors informed of our progress out here. You all may go back to your cabins; Team B will be briefed independently."" Mr. Hisomeru told Dr. Ryu and the rest of Team A.

When only Team B remained, he looked at me and the others. ""You all have your orders when you go down there. You are there to support Whitemoon, your dive leader. The difficulties of this dive rate it as extremely hazardous, dangerous even. Nobody has attempted this before and if you fail, if we have any casualties, I mean, it will probably be the last. That is why I am going to say that we only have one chance. That is why only Whitemoon will complete the dive. David is the only one among you that I trust with our future.""

""Sir, may I ask?"" Riddin raised his hand. The whole dive team was required to speak English for my benefit and Riddin and Neveah were both Americans, like me.

""You may ask, but I doubt I could answer and if I could, I probably wouldn't."" Mr. Hisomeru disclaimed.

""What do you expect to find down there?"" Riddin seemed boyish and jocular as he smirked.

""The truth."" Mr. Hisomeru said honestly.

We prepared for our first and possibly our only dive. I felt like we should be getting prayed over by a chaplain or something, even though I had no beliefs. We all felt nervous and made our preparations in a kind of uneasy silence. Riddin kept telling inappropriate jokes that ended with him asking us ""Get it?"" until Neveah said to him:

""Nobody is laughing except you. Get it?""

I inspected everyone's gear and then I said: ""It is time.""

Neveah was to go first into the water, and I was to be next. After her and me the rest of the team followed. They remained in position, filming, holding lights and communicating with *Miyamoto*. I descended into the darkness.

The light quickly faded. The chatter became more scrambled. I was approaching my maximum depth and I had never felt so alone and helpless in all my life. Then the silence and the cold and the darkness were absolute.

I was in another world. The seafloor was below me somewhere. Down there, beyond my limits, an even darker and more terrifying landscape lay as a wasteland that had never known daylight. Down there something lurked, waited and knew the answers I was there to learn.

I could not control my imagination. Fear began to take hold of me as I hovered at my maximum depth, noting that I was surrounded by living creatures, all of them eels. They swam lazily, waiting for something as I did. They knew what we were there for, and I did not.

""What am I doing here?"" I asked.

""Unclear, repeat. Over."" Neveah's voice was digitally reconstructed by the communication equipment. She sounded robotic and far away. It only added to the surreal dread I was feeling.

The eels seemed to hesitate. It felt like the moment between a flash of lightning and a thunderclap. Then some massive thing I could not identify rose just past me and took them. It was there, taking them, then it was gone, swiftly descending back into the world of night everlasting.

""There's something down here."" I choked on the words, trying to whisper them quietly. I felt exposed, surrounded and watched. The eels were gone, would I be next?

Terror was growing inside of me; I could not say when it began or how it blossomed. I felt the edge of panic and fought it down, knowing that such hysteria would certainly get me killed. Whatever was there should strike if I tried any sudden movement. Even if I escaped and swam back up as fast as I could then the nitrogen in my body could boil and I would die even more horribly.

Two of my dive team moved into a closer position, thinking I wanted them to. They shone lights down on me and I gestured to them that I was alright and to hold their position. With the lights on me I somehow felt even more exposed than I did in the darkness. I still couldn't see anything.

I moved forward at my depth, slowly, while they followed me from above with the underwater lights. I found another swarm of eels congregating and I watched and waited.

""Is the camera getting this?"" I pointed. I was trembling in dread and barely able to maintain my composure. I fantasized about being safe at home and holding my newborn. My mind rejected the peaceful anticipation and insisted I was in serious danger.

""The cameras are rolling on Whitemoon. Over."" Riddin's voice assured me.

I checked my diver's watch and sighed. There was no more time to wait as well as the fact that my nerves were gone. I feared the part of me that was doing the job despite the obvious morbidity. I heard the voice saying, in my thoughts: *'Someone I learned to fear and respect'*. I had to begin my gradual ascent. It was when I left my position that the nightmares became reality.

At that moment I was trapped, caught, unable to escape. Between two worlds, one of light and one of dark, one that I belonged to and the other my bane, I was held. I did not see what happened to Riddin. There was a camera that he had which would show what happened, if it were ever recovered. Perhaps it will someday wash up on a beach; but judging on the capacity of the thing that took him, that would be unlikely.

After we listened to his screams of insane horror in our communications, all of us were pushed over the precipice of fathomless scare. I don't remember what I said, the recording failed to catch my voice. My team opted to take their chances with a rapid ascent. They wanted out of the water.

I couldn't blame them. I had reached a level of panic that I could not function within. I had frozen in hesitation, unable to see or know from which direction the greater danger was coming. Should I kill myself with a rapid ascent or feed myself to whatever had gone for Riddin?

Like a drunk I blacked out. My mind was gone somewhere else while my internal amphibian gave the commands from the reptile-layer in my brain. While my skull became the bedlam of an insane asylum my body gently hovered, taking calculated steps towards the surface until I was retrieved.

I was aboard *Miyamoto* in the sick bay. Only our nurse Yui and Mr. Hisomeru were with me. I blinked and recalled, like the black fog of an evil dream, the sound of Riddin being taken, as his cries explained that the horror was real.

""Riddin?"" I sounded hoarse. I sat up and cleared my throat.

""We have lost Riddin. The mission is over. We had to report his death and now we are done. They are shutting us down."" Mr. Hisomeru sounded bitter.

""It's down there. We found something. It was huge, taking eels."" I told him. He looked up and the spark of King Arthur was in his eyes for just one instant. Then he remembered the quest was at an end. We had failed.

""Leave us."" Mr. Hisomeru told Yui. She obeyed and silently left us alone.

""What is it?"" I asked.

""I cannot send the team back down there. We only have six hours until we must be underway. Captain Ishikawa insists on honoring our orders."" Mr. Hisomeru explained.

""That's plenty of time."" I heard myself saying. I couldn't believe I was tempted to return to the realm of inescapable night. Then I could feel the crawl on my skin of the nearby lunging thing, taking whole swarms of eels in a bite, or even a diver.

""I'm not losing you down there."" Mr. Hisomeru objected.

""We lose everything, then?"" I asked. He sighed and realized I was right.

""Let me speak to Captain Ishikawa. I do own this ship, should have some say in our departure schedule."" Mr. Hisomeru stood to go. ""Get some rest. Yui will have to approve of your condition before you dive.""

""She isn't a doctor."" I noted.

""For my own worries, son, for me."" He put his hand on my right shoulder before he left me alone.

When I was alone in the dark, I was back there, in the dark and all alone, the world above was far away. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine being home. It wasn't easy. Instead, my thoughts reassembled themselves in a dream, a memory, an epiphany. I knew what was down there. I realized: *Everyone does, we just choose to believe that it isn't real*. That is the eels' secret: Eel accepts it. It is their destroyer - their creator.

Captain Ishikawa wanted to see me before I dived. He couldn't speak English, so Mr. Hisomeru translated. ""He is telling you that he does not want you to go into the water. Losing one man is bad enough, he does not believe you will survive. He says that today he has come to believe in sea monsters.""

""The real monster we face is not in the water. The real monster is the monster of ignorance."" I told him. Mr. Hisomeru translated my words as the captain shook his head and looked at the two of us in comparison before he left us alone.

""There is a storm coming. We cannot hold back the weather."" Mr. Hisomeru plotted.

""Activity down there precedes the violent seas."" I hypothesized.

""We will find what we are looking for."" Mr. Hisomeru anticipated. He agreed that the approach of the weather was fortunate for our efforts, even while it limited them.

""I will dive alone, without support. I will have to take the camera and light with me."" I understood, with anxiety. Even without the danger the difficulty alone presented potential hazards. ""I don't know how I will do it.""

""I will go."" Neveah was there, in the portal.

""I don't think so."" Mr. Hisomeru told her without looking at her.

""Cameras rolling on Whitemoon, get it?"" Neveah argued strangely. ""Let me finish this.""

Mr. Hisomeru sighed as he saw the look on my face. ""Very well. Be ready to dive in one hour.""

""I'm ready now."" Neveah held herself akimbo.

""Let me suit up."" I got up, fatigue washing over me briefly, despite the rest I'd had. It was the fear, rooted deeply in me, that took my energy like the creature had taken the eels.

""It comes from below. So, we film from below, instead of the strike zone."" Neveah added her thoughts. Our eyes widened as we realized she was right.

""You are right. We both complete the dive. It is how we will find the Grail."" I smiled at her plan.

The time it took to get back into the water was spent in morbid illumination. Then we were in the holy black seas, waters filled with living things.

""I am afraid."" Neveah confessed.

""So too am I. Over."" I told her. I felt nothing. The fear had become so familiar that it had somehow become a comfort, assuring me I had not met a most horrendous fate.

We found a swarm of praying eels as they slowly circled in sacred holding patterns. Together they formed a mouthful for their god. We were filming, waiting while every second seemed eternal. At any moment the strike would happen, instantly and unavoidable. We were beneath the swarm and our light shone upward. I felt safer, outside the buffet line. We were not safe, it was only a good camera angle.

The eels slowed, coming together and holding perfectly still. I sensed it in the water beneath us, I felt what they felt. Neveah said ""Whitemoon."" and then she was gone, or rather, I was.

It had come from below and taken me in a single gulp. I was disoriented, engulfed and pressed. I was inside the Grail, as it retracted to the depths that were its home. Something slick was wriggling along the lining inside of it. I took a handful of it and felt a strange push from below. Inspired by the reaction I pushed my hand into the soft interior. Every time I did, I was drawn deeper into it and crushed more. I was able to get my dive knife in my other hand. I cut into the Grail, and I saw light as it launched towards Neveah for a second attack.

In a cloud of blood: I was ejected from it, still alive. ""You're alive!"" Neveah called me, shining her light into the murky crimson. All around me were newborn eels. I still grasped what I had taken from inside. We made our ascent, our horrible fears manifesting as manic laughter. Perhaps something was wrong with our mixture.

""Get it?"" Neveah kept saying.

The weather had begun to menace *Miyamoto*. In the diver's prep room I finally ungrasped my prize. They lay there wriggling on the table while Neveah, Mr. Hisomeru and I stared and smiled like lunatics. Living eels, freshly born.

Mr. Hisomeru hugged me and said into my ear quietly, so the monsters could not hear:

""While you were down there, I got a call from home. Just a few weeks premature, they will be fine. Twins.""

""I guess that is two good reasons to marry Meg."" I laughed and grinned.

""Well, son, it is tradition."""

ybqiqo,0,2022-10-23,Looking for Advice,ophelia_1113,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ybqiqo/looking_for_advice/,"Hi everyone -- new to the community here, so apologies if this should be posted somewhere else / something similar has already been answered (just lmk). 

I recently graduated in May 2022 and am currently working in finance, but I really enjoyed coding / data analysis in college (I was a stats / data science major). I'm thinking of maybe switching to the data science field in 1-2 years and was wondering what courses / bootcamps / education are necessary to land an entry-level data scientist role (ideally remote / in NYC). For context, my undergrad is prob considered a top 5 institution, but its data science program is not the strongest -- mostly focused on just R (no Python or SQL), so I would def need improvement in Python, SQL, and ML in general. 

Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to improve my Python / SQL skills (e.g., any online courses that I could do on weekends, etc.) and also wondering if a Master's is really necessary to land an entry-level data scientist role? I've seen some data scientist jobs prefer or require a Master's, but wasn't sure how beneficial a Master's would be. On the other hand, I've seen many jobs ask for 1-4 years of relevant work experience in data science, but other than my recent stats/data science major, I've mostly only done econ or finance-related internships (and am currently full-time in finance), so not sure what's the best path to get an entry-level data scientist position here (i.e. can I do it without a Master's and just study on the weekends, or would a Master's be the most helpful here?).

Sorry for the jumble of words, and thank you in advance!! Any advice would be much appreciated :)"
ybr4by,0,2022-10-23,I was offered both an internship opportunity in the IT department and a research assistantship in the CS department. Which one should I choose? (Or neither?),ScaredOfLife666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ybr4by/i_was_offered_both_an_internship_opportunity_in/,"I'm a junior CS major and work at the IT help desk for my university but I was offered an internship opportunity in the department since my supervisor hooked me up with someone else. 

He had told me that the internship would consist mostly of me helping with automating a lot of their processes through coding. It sounded like a cool opportunity. I would make the same amount of money as I would working at the help desk (one more dollar than minimum wage), but I'd get an extra stipend of 3500 along with free food and housing for the summer. 

 I was then offered a research experience over the summer with a professor. I would work on a very big research project with him and one other student, in the area of machine learning. I would only get the extra stipend and free housing/food but I won't lie, machine learning has always been a very interesting subfield to me. 

Would this be worth going with? I've applied to several places but I'm not a super competitive applicant. I go to a lesser-known school, have around a 3.0 GPA, don't have finished side projects, and only have the IT help desk as work experience so I don't want to bet on something bigger if it'd be better to play it safe for now until I have more experience. 

Thoughts?"

My sister is studying medicine and she'll finish her intern year on December and my brother is studying engineering and is currently working on his thesis. I have been working for a year now and when someone congratulates me for that my sister would automatically say my career is one of the easiest to study and that not graduating with excellence would mean you had to be really stupid, so it's not an achievement. She also complains that any higher education (I am saving for a second master's degree) is a waste of money cause it's useless for ""a mere lawyer"" to get one. Meanwhile, my brother only addresses me to mention how fat I am, he stopped calling me by my name and would only call me names, even in front of others. I'm not even that big, I weight 55 kg. He literally mumbles ""OP is so faaaat"" while driving or doing a task even if he's not talking to me.

I perform reactive and proactive hunts, having both data-driven and intel-driven approaches to identify threats and adversarial activity in a globally distributed collection of networks. For the past few years, I've been focused on learning and applying data science principals (statistics, probability, linear algebra) and classical machine learning. I'm just now getting into deep learning but I'm making decent progress. The prior experience and knowledge helps a lot.

I've built numerous models (regression analysis, classifiers, decision trees, time series decompositions, clustering) and analytics that implement these types of capabilities to help enhance detection, provide insight into activity, and to bridge the gap towards predictive and behavioral analysis. However, my current role is more centered around traditional reactive analysis, so I've been wanting to look around but I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for. I've seen a ton of roles for data scientists and others for cyber analysts but not really anything that does both. I don't want to do just pure research and tool development; however, I also don't want to be relegated to just performing indicator-based hunts. What kind of role should I look for?

I'm nervous that while many organizations _want_ data science and machine learning to be part of their cyber analysts toolkit, most aren't willing to accommodate, either due to a lack of organizational maturity or a hesitancy to be one of the first to break through. Some companies offer summer internships to grad students and have them work on a sprint to solve some complex problems (often involving DS/ML) but there doesn't seem to be something similar on a full-time emoyment basis.

Anyone else in the same situation, can offer some insight, or point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated."

1. Consistency
2. descriptive names

So I am asking about methods and conventions here.

The reasons for this is that I am an intern that's coding in Python. My immediate superior is super nice and open and told me I could suggest improvements. Then he put me to make flowcharts of the code and then explain them to him (suuuper smart move guys, I was at a complete loss before, you should use this with your juniors).

After that, I understood what every single function does and when they're called. That's also when I saw most variables and functions have bad names. They:

1. Mix two languages (Native language and English)
2. Often too long or too short
3. the current names don't convey their functionality, in general

So I'd like to know how you'd go about this. The code in question has only a few thousand lines, I think it would not take more than a week to come up with new names for everything, but I'd like to know how to better approach this and not mess up because, well, I'm a beginner.

Key facts about me. I deal with high general and social anxiety and ADD, so I can get overwhelmed and task execution can be hard. Brain fog and feeling stuck or not knowing how to start something is huge for me as I get fatigued very easily. I have mild cerebral palsy so I feel I can‚Äôt do a physical job field or career. I‚Äôm in treatment, well, will be again for mental health if I get Medicaid.

My two passions are college sports and politics/military history. I did speech and debate in high school and love to follow politics, world events, and news for fun. 

But when I‚Äôve had an opportunity to work in either realm (athletics marketing and a political journalism internship) my anxiety burns me out fast. So now I don‚Äôt know what to do for a career.

I have an AS in History/Poli Sci, I‚Äôm close to an BS in Communications, and have significant progress towards a national security degree if I wanted that. But I‚Äôve burned out when it comes to working in these fields and I‚Äôve halted university due to mental health struggles.

I‚Äôve been financial dependent on my parents so I‚Äôve never had to pay for major expenses, (rent, food, car, cell phone), I live with them, and I work a part time job with no savings as I don‚Äôt know what to do to build myself up.

I can do my own laundry, clean, shop, but cooking has always been a huge mental block to me. I eat out or eat junk food or something made by someone else because cooking seems like this big chore that overwhelms me. 

Socially, getting out of the house even for friends can be scary or exhausting and it‚Äôs hard for me to get out and see friends. But I do have them.

My main hobbies are indoor, video games, podcasts, YouTube, watching sports, and I want to change that. But I feel overwhelmed.

I crave romantic companionship so badly. I‚Äôm a virgin, only had 2 short lived relationships, and get rejected a lot. I try to date a lot and I do feel frustrated at how natural it seems to come to those around me even if it is hard. I have friendships and get along with co workers well but I‚Äôm just a friend not anything more to anyone.

I just turned 26, so losing my parents insurance definitely is a big stress.

Key facts about me. I deal with high general and social anxiety and ADD, so I can get overwhelmed and task execution can be hard. Brain fog and feeling stuck or not knowing how to start something is huge for me as I get fatigued very easily. I have mild cerebral palsy so I feel I can‚Äôt do a physical job field or career. I‚Äôm in treatment, well, will be again for mental health if I get Medicaid.

My two passions are college sports and politics/military history. I did speech and debate in high school and love to follow politics, world events, and news for fun. 

But when I‚Äôve had an opportunity to work in either realm (athletics marketing and a political journalism internship) my anxiety burns me out fast. So now I don‚Äôt know what to do for a career.

I have an AS in History/Poli Sci, I‚Äôm close to an BS in Communications, and have significant progress towards a national security degree if I wanted that. But I‚Äôve burned out when it comes to working in these fields and I‚Äôve halted university due to mental health struggles.

I‚Äôve been financial dependent on my parents so I‚Äôve never had to pay for major expenses, (rent, food, car, cell phone), I live with them, and I work a part time job with no savings as I don‚Äôt know what to do to build myself up.

I can do my own laundry, clean, shop, but cooking has always been a huge mental block to me. I eat out or eat junk food or something made by someone else because cooking seems like this big chore that overwhelms me. 

Socially, getting out of the house even for friends can be scary or exhausting and it‚Äôs hard for me to get out and see friends. But I do have them.

My main hobbies are indoor, video games, podcasts, YouTube, watching sports, and I want to change that. But I feel overwhelmed.

I crave romantic companionship so badly. I‚Äôm a virgin, only had 2 short lived relationships, and get rejected a lot. I try to date a lot and I do feel frustrated at how natural it seems to come to those around me even if it is hard. I have friendships and get along with co workers well but I‚Äôm just a friend not anything more to anyone.

[LONG VENT POST]


I'm 25F. 
My go-to job due to my degree was video editing. As a disclaimer, I have hereditary bipolar 1 from my maternal family, whom i do not communicate with very much for many reasons.

I graduated in december 2020 cum laude (i pushed myself real hard for those federal pell grants) with a BFA in a small major that gave me lots of practical skills in the adobe suite as well as 3D modeling. That final semester was entirely online, i was living in a shitty apartment in my college town (in a city), and never got a grad ceremony (i almost didn't buy a cap and gown out of spite).

When i graduated i was utterly and severely burnt out, and this has essentially gone on for 2 years. I've gradually gotten my stuff together (made my artist website with portfolio, &amp; i've been told i have a good looking resume by recruiters). My mental health had gone through highs and lows, and its been mostly lows, because i feel like everyone else in my class has either gotten more internships, has a job, or is atleast happier than me, considering i got dumped after 5 years with someone i thought i would marry, due to us drifting apart and when i had a severe manic episode this past winter and she couldnt deal with it. 

My issues are a couple of things.

1)  I've been hospitalized 3 times this year. The first 2 were january of 2022, immediately following a trip abroad to visit family members in Iran. My father was absolutely abhorrent to me the entire trip, and at one point threatened to tear up my passport and ""leave me stuck in that country"". He essentially acted a million times worse once we got there because he knew he was in a country where he could essentially say and do whatever he wanted with my life [i am a dual national]. The final time was this past september. His mother - my grandmother- passed away suddenly. He had been stressing me out so much to the verge of my breaking point (waiting till the last minute, doing things to push my buttons and then telling me i'll end up ""right back there""- alluding to inpatient mental hospitals. ) It feels like he does it on purpose- driving me to the point of wanting to kill myself, i get taken involuntarily to an inpatient facility, and then he essentially gets to go ""i told you so. You are 't stable. You're not independent, you're not incapable of controlling your emotions etc. "" All the while blame shifting and gaslighting, because he refused to apologize or ever acknowledge the fact that i did fine for 4 years of college, and this only happens when i have the displeasure of returning home to stay with him. 
But my main issue here is that i have medicare, and apparently the sh_ttiest possible plan there is to offer (Aetna better health of VA). I desperately need to bite the bullet and get private health insurance at this point, because I currently am not seeing a PCP, i have a new diagnosis of Grave's disease, and all in all, I just want decent healthcare for once in my entire life.
[Since my father and sister are both on disability, and we live in the U.S, I was never qualified to be under my dad's insurance, so I went over 10 years without proper insurance, before going to college. ]
)

2) I desperately want to live on my own. 
I have a very unique situation, in two regards-
 1) i only had a 3k student loan , which i payed off.
 2) My sister (downs syndrome) and i are part of a trust, and I also am to inherit the property we currently live on, which has been steadily increasing in value due to more development in the area. My father is 70 years old, hence the cosigner of the trust is my uncle (whom i have an excellent relationship with).  So while i loathe the area we live in, it has (i think) about half an acre of land, and while i don't own a car yet, i can atleast drive. 

Our relationship had been rocky since my mother passed via suicide in 2009. He essentially never properly grieved. He denied i inherited bipolar from her for the longest time, he denied she hung herself (despite me being the one who found her while he was at work), and he very clearly denies the fact she was ever an alcoholic (when she filed a false restraining order against him, i never got to testify despite being 12, and would regularly watch my sister at all hours of the night while she would go out and disappear till the next morning or come home severely drunk. ) He thinks his version of things that have happened is the *only* version, essentially. My experience hold no weight due to ageism in my family. I'm the second youngest besides my sister, and a female. Hence 'clueless' by proxy.

He also has had severe anger management/ emotion regulation issues for as long as i've known him. My friends all used to be legitimately scared of him and would tread lightly, so to speak. 

Like most middle eastern fathers with their daughters, i would play a game of 50 questions before i could even think of going out with a friend (even fellow female friends). Mind you he's been living in the U.S since he was 18, so he is very much Americanized, and not a practicing muslim. He just has mental remnants of imbedded cultural crap, along with the stark generational difference between us due to how late he chose to have kids (he had me at 45. He's also older than my maternal grandmother).

I have had romantic interests that have essentially said ""nevermind"" sheerly due to how toxic my father is and how unstable our relationship has been , and its only been getting worse as he's shown signs of dementia. He's always been a hothead, but nowadays there's no buildup between the calm and him immediately yelling.

He was a also a smoker for atleast 30 years, has diabetes (well managed), and Allergic Respiratory Aspergillosis, due to a mystery immune disease. Basically, his lungs are extemely bad, and i got severe cabin fevere self isolating for the duration of 2019-2020, especially since we live in a very trump-ey area that constantly had covid surges.
So by cultural and my own moral standards, i refuse to put him in a nursing home. But caring for him alongside my sister with downs syndrome (she is 24 but is mentally more like an 8 year old). Is chipping away at my sanity and ability to care for my own mental health, and be telling him that warrants me being called a selfish bitch.

I feel like i've been robbed of my twenties. I live with someone who makes me want to hang myself regularly, i legally work as the caregiver for my sister (which is fine because ive been doing that since my mother died anyways). So while i make decent money, it's not in my field, and my father had essentially solidified me into this homemaker / housewife role, yet constantly criticises how selfish, cold hearted, rude and ungrateful i am as his daughter. I'm constantly belittled, yet he turns around the next day and has zero memory of any grievances i tell him. It comes so naturally to him that i am convinced it's some level of BPD, or he's just really good at gaslighting, or maybe its partly his memory loss setting in.

Then he tells me how much of a disappointment i've become, and how he raised me to not be rude but ""me being on my own in college"" was a ""huge mistake, and he shouldve moved to my college town"". I am essentially at the point where i cannot deal with this man while sober. He has ruined my life. He has deprived me so much of social confidence growing up, has enabled my body dysmorphia, placed the blame on my chronic lifelong insomnia on me, refuses to ever admit he is wrong for anything, and since i'm the family scapegoat and he's the eldest brother in his family, he has always had the final say on matters. 

I feel like i have no life anymore, and i'm terrified that my future is falling underneath my feet. I feel like i have no way out of this living situation with him. I fucking hated renting in my college town due to so many bad experiences, so i really don't want to go back to that again.. I just don't know what to do anymore in my life. I've been applying for video editing + videography jobs left and right, but i don't have a demo reel, i'm terrible at writing cover letters, and since being out of the hospital, especially after my grandmother's death, my mood has never been more than a 5/10 on a good day. 


My ex gf ghosting me has essentially convinced me that unless i cut off my family completely (they are all to some degree complicit in my father's antics), i will always be depressed and a walking billboard that says ""i am insecure and have severe ""daddy issues"". 

I just want financial independence, to stop depression spending, and to one day fix myself enough to where i can one day have a partner again.



TLDR;
I've been sheltered my entire life due to my emotionally abusive father &amp; he gets to do it again since we've moved to a very isolated area. Expensive cost of living means i cannot feasibly live anywhere else in VA at the moment. I am working in a job outside my field, and feel stuck, unlikeable and unlovable due to all my friends living far away from me or being busy with work."

With computer science, many people stress the importance of getting a software engineering internship, however, I‚Äôm not sure if its as important since I don‚Äôt plan to go into industry right after graduation (and also i feel like SWE can be loosely related to DS depending on the position). Then there are REUs (prestigious summer research) that I can apply for, however, since I am already doing research, I don‚Äôt know if it would be better to focus on applying to internships. 

I don‚Äôt really know what competitive grad school programs are looking for in applicants aside from gpa, GRE, and research, and would like advice on how to improve my chances of being accepted into a good program."

My greatest fear is that I will begin searching for a job and won't be knowledgeable enough to qualify for a solid position, this is why I study so hard and push myself as I do. My roommate just graduated as a lawyer and passes his bar exam and has even made comments that I even study more than him or as much as him. Of course, he doesn't know what I do but I guess he hears how passionate I am when I talk about my work/studies or tutor/aid classmates. I don't actually have an official job given that I put so much time into my studies, but I do freelance in developing and maintaining websites for local businesses and local nonprofit organizations. I have classmates and professors who either work or have retired in the field of Cyber Security and Programming who stress to me my potential and encourage me not to settle for less when it comes to looking for a job.

I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, tech is known to pay well where I live and I've been previously asked about being referred by a State Farm to apply as a Software Engineer. Looking upon their career page I noticed they have a Software Engineer Intern position only being offered for the Summer 2023 and require you to return to school for at least one semester after the internship, but I have graduated by then. There are other positions in Software Engineering but most are not all require me to know AWS which I honestly haven't studied yet (but now plan on taking courses on in my personal time). Is there any solid advice that I can be given, I feel like I'm really burning myself out but I am dedicated and I have a goal in mind, and I don't plan on anything getting in my way of it.

yc3tal,1,2022-10-24,Was agreeing to volunteer for a previously paid position a mistake?,thalamust,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/yc3tal/was_agreeing_to_volunteer_for_a_previously_paid/,"I‚Äôm a recent college graduate with genuinely no clue about what I‚Äôm going to do now. 

Although I enjoyed my program and did well, the pandemic made it incredibly difficult to connect with professors or to gain experience in different professions related to my studies while I was still in college. However, in my final year I managed to land a semester-long internship within one of the most competitive programs in this particular field in my country. 

While I thought this program would be an amazing experience and help guide me towards a future career path, it ended up being incredibly toxic and some of the most stressful and upsetting months of my life so far. Not only were people in my department unwelcoming towards the other interns and myself, but employees in other departments would frequently make passive aggressive and hostile remarks towards us. Despite this, I finished the program and ended up receiving a lot of praise for my work and really stood out compared to the other interns. 

At this point, I was ready to leave and never come back knowing that I definitely didn‚Äôt enjoy this type of work but secured a solid reference letter for my work at this highly regarded organization. That was exactly what I did up until about a month ago where, in a panic of not being able to find a full-time job related to my program, I reached back out to that organization about any open positions in my previous department in hopes that the additional experience would help me out in the future while I keep thinking about what I want to do.

They emailed back a few days later saying they could only take volunteers at the moment, which is not uncommon for this particular position, and I quickly accepted because I figured something is better than nothing. About 2 weeks ago I was sent the on-boarding forms and after reflecting on how horrible the experience was I‚Äôve been unable to bring myself to fill them out. I know that this isn‚Äôt the career for me but they‚Äôre also one of the only references I have at the moment. 

If I back out now will I be ruining my ability to use the former paid position as a potential reference in the future? How do I properly go about rescinding my acceptance in a way that doesn‚Äôt ruin this connection? 

TL;DR: Previously had a paid internship position that I accepted a volunteer position in after my contract was over to gain more experience. Now want to back out of volunteering (hasn‚Äôt started yet) after remembering how toxic it was but I don‚Äôt want to ruin my reference. What do I do?"
yc48ft,29,2022-10-24,"I was offered a simple job, but it's become much more than that",Harbinger_51,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yc48ft/i_was_offered_a_simple_job_but_its_become_much/,"‚ÄúHelp wanted. Easy work. Big Pay‚Äù.

This roughly made and atrociously designed advertisement almost made me burst out in laughter upon reading it again. Any five-year-old who can open google docs and print a piece of paper could have replicated it. The only other thing on the entire sheet was a phone number. Even worse, this number didn‚Äôt appear to have any local area codes that I know of. 

It was posted inside a classroom building at my university, right next to where various clubs, student groups, and local employers would post their advertisements. I am not the most social and so I hadn‚Äôt been looking for student groups or clubs as much, but potential employment was something I was going to need. As classes started and summer ended, so did my internship and only source of income. I picked up the ad.

As much of a joke or scam as I assumed this had to be, I thought, why not? I‚Äôll try calling. I did need some money right now so I figured taking a minute to entertain the possibility of this being a legitimate opportunity was worth it. 

I picked up the paper. Walking to my apartment window to get a better look, I couldn‚Äôt help but shake my head in disbelief once again at how incredibly ridiculous it was. The cool light from the cloudy skies illuminated the sheet of paper in my hand. I pulled out my cell phone and typed the numbers into my keypad before dialing. The taps of raindrops on the window filled the gaps of sound between each ring. 

I began to rethink my choice of even attempting this nonsense, then the ringing stopped. I paused for a few seconds. Hearing nothing, I slowly moved the phone away from my face. I thought I had been disconnected or that the call failed. The screen lit up and at the top of my screen displayed the call time. Someone did pick up. I held the phone back up to my ear and controlled my breathing. 

If I pick up a call that I suspect to be spam, I typically stay quiet and wait for someone on the other end to say something first. That‚Äôs the strategy I tried to employ here. This went on for longer than I would have expected. Usually, the person on the other end will disconnect or say something after ten seconds or so. Whoever this was wasn‚Äôt saying anything. After two whole minutes of this, I decided to finally speak.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHello‚Äù

A monotone voice returned. I hadn‚Äôt expected it. With how long I was on the phone, I assumed it to be a bogus number or some sort of bot. I waited a moment before remembering my reason for calling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling about this advertisement that was posted at my school. Are you still looking for help?‚Äù

The man on the other end breathed out heavily before replying.

‚ÄúYes, we are still looking for help. If you accept, the payment is $4,000 cash for this job, in any denomination of bills that you would like. It will only take one night of work. We can pay you by tomorrow if you complete the job tonight‚Äù.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you said four grand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it is very important to me that this gets done, and done soon. And one more thing, I neglected to mention it first. We can‚Äôt let you tell anyone that you are taking this job. This needs to stay confidential. If anyone were to know about what you‚Äôre doing for us, the consequences would be disastrous for not only you and the people who fund out but for me as well‚Äù.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶Alright. I need to think for a moment‚Äù

Of course, the money excited me, almost to the point of accepting it right then and there but this mention of confidentiality put me on edge. For all I knew, this was a serial killer with a burner phone looking for a way to attract his next victim. I think the man on the other end could tell what I was thinking. He broke the silence.

‚ÄúListen, I know this seems weird and suspicious but I can assure you that what I am offering you is legitimate. I work for a very large, very powerful company that just needs a small job done on the side, off the records. I‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what to say to you that would‚Ä¶look, we just need this done. I can meet you in an hour, at a location of your choosing and it can all be done right then and there‚Äù.

What the hell was he on about? I didn‚Äôt believe his ‚Äúpowerful company‚Äù nonsense but hell, if he was offering to meet me in an hour, this would be the easiest $4,000 I could have ever imagined making. Of course, I would choose somewhere public on the University grounds that I knew like the back of my hand. I didn‚Äôt see how it could go wrong. I adjusted the hone back up to my ear.

‚ÄúSo you can pay me on the spot too?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶well I suppose I could. Fine. If you want to be paid tonight, you can but I need a promise that the job will be done. I‚Äôll have the cash ready‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt will‚Äù

I replied, assuringly. I‚Äôve always been true to my word and I‚Äôve certainly never been a lousy worker. There wasn‚Äôt much I could imagine not doing for a night‚Äôs work to earn $4,000. Then again, I hadn‚Äôt a clue of what this man wanted me to do.

‚ÄúYou still haven‚Äôt told me what the job is‚Äù.

‚ÄúI will tell you when we meet. That information cannot be given over the phone. It isn‚Äôt much, I can promise you that‚Äù.

Though the doubts were mounting in my head, I couldn‚Äôt help but be blinded by this opportunity thrust upon me. I was willing to risk it.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm in. Meet outside the building you posted the advertisement. I‚Äôll be there but if you don‚Äôt have the money on hand, this is all off‚Äù.

I acted tough, but I was still skeptical and unsure about all of this. I think he and I both knew that I wouldn‚Äôt really ""call it all off‚Äù when that much money is on the line.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there at 4:30 with the money. Be ready‚Äù.

The phone went silent. There was no feedback on the other end anymore. He hung up. I stood, stunned by the fact that such a conversation just took place. I spent the next half hour looking out my apartment window, to the dark clouds above down the wet street they rained on, laughing occasionally at all my thoughts of this uncanny scenario. 

The trip from my apartment to the university building I agreed to meet him at felt like walking to an awkward first date except the awkwardness presented itself in an even more unorthodox fashion. Well, this was all very unorthodox, wasn't it?

I arrived a little early so I decided to sit inside the entryway of the building. I browsed my phone, looking up every few seconds to see if someone was waiting. My eyes were on my phone the moment it turned from 4:29 to 4:30. Looking up, I saw one man who stood out. 

He wore a formal suit and a long black coat, holding a black umbrella over his head in one hand and a leather bag slung over the other shoulder. His appearance resembled something you would expect of a professor walking around on campus. He stood still, unlike the students passing around him. They had somewhere to be, it was clear that he was where he intended to be.

I hesitantly pulled open the door, turning the smooth and soft ambiance of rainfall back to a coarse static to accompany me as I approached the man under the umbrella. He noticed my approach and attentive stare as he turned around to face me.

‚ÄúAre you here for the job?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes‚Äù

I almost couldn‚Äôt believe anyone showed up. The fact that someone did frightened me a little. They were serious. He tilted his head down, in the direction of my hand holding my cell phone.

‚ÄúI need you to turn off your phone‚Äù.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶okay?‚Äù

I showed him my screen as I powered it off completely and put it back into my pocket. He watched but didn‚Äôt give any sort of acknowledgment.

‚ÄúAs I said, the job is a simple one‚Äù

The man undid the straps on his leather bag and pulled the flap up. I took a step back and braced myself to run, as the images of handguns and knives or needles full of tranquilizers filled my imagination. What he took out of the bag was much less threatening. He pulled a plastic bag out by the handle and the label and design on the front looked familiar. It was a bag from the university bookstore. He slowly reached his arm out to me with the bag in hand.

I accepted the bag, looking down to take a peek inside as soon as it was handed to me.

‚ÄúWait‚Äù

The man said softly, placing a palm over the opening. 

‚ÄúYou need to know the instructions first‚Äù.

I looked back up.

‚ÄúYou need to plant it in the dirt, standing straight up. It can be anywhere you like but it needs to be on soil with grass. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the whole job‚Äù. 

The man slowly removed his hand from the plastic bag. I opened it. Inside was a wooden cross, not more than a foot tall. The wood was old and worn down with cuts and chips along its surface. The center was bound with twine. I stared down in confusion as I talked to the man.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶I just have to put this in the ground? That‚Äôs it? I could just do it right here?‚Äù

I asked, pointing to the grass only a few steps away from us.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt‚Äù

The man replied.

‚ÄúWell, why not? You said I could plant it anywhere that has dirt and grass‚Äù.

He sighed.

‚ÄúI would get far away from here before you do it but it‚Äôs your choice in the end‚Äù.

The man had a look in his eyes as if he had lost all hope and he broke eye contact.

‚ÄúI just need to be sure that you‚Äôll do it‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you got the money?‚Äù

He reached back into his leather bag before pulling out an envelope. To my surprise, he handed it to me faster and more gracefully than he had handed me the cheap wooden cross. I didn‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but It wasn't for him to deliver on the money. My eyes went wide as I quickly pulled one bill from the envelope and held it up to the dimly lit sky. I‚Äôve worked plenty of retail jobs before and know what to look for in a fake bill. Everything checked out. I quickly counted out every bill. There were 40. My draw would have dropped to the floor if it were possible. I couldn‚Äôt believe this man seriously brought $4,000.

‚ÄúFour thousand, as promised. You will do as I instructed? I need it done tonight‚Äù.

‚ÄúCertainly‚Äù.

I assured, pocketing the envelope excitedly. The man nodded before turning around and walking off. I watched him until he turned a corner around the building, out of sight. I broke down in laughter. What a fool, I thought to myself. I just got paid $4,000 to stick a wooden cross in the ground. I contained my excitement enough to get serious for a moment. 

I couldn‚Äôt forget why I was being paid and as I said before, I am true to my word. I looked at the grass before me, this perfectly kept lawn between all these buildings. Why not just put it here? No one would care. If the school had a problem with it, they could simply pull it out of the ground. After all, I was paid to stick it in the ground, not watch over it.

I walked along the path that connected two rows of university buildings until I was near the center.  My shoes squeaked on the wet grass as I moved off the stone path. I knelt and began a little hole with my fingers. Though I wasn‚Äôt all that worried about anyone having a problem with what I was doing, I didn‚Äôt want to stick around to find out either. I removed the cross from the bookstore bag and placed it neatly into the ground. 

I crumpled up the bag and stepped back to admire my work, the work I did to secure a few months worth of food and rent. I laughed once again and shook my head as I walked away, depositing the bag in a nearby recycling bin. My walk back to my apartment was fueled by brisk excitement. I couldn‚Äôt wipe the smirk off my face the entire way home, nor could I contain the random giggles I coughed up every few seconds. When people walking by made faces at my silly behavior, it only made me laugh harder.

That night I could hardly concentrate on school work of this excitement. It took a three-hour gym session to calm me down enough to sleep, the stack of hundreds on my desk smiling back at me as I turned the lights out. 

I found it easy to get out of bed the next morning. I stuffed my backpack and grabbed my newly acquired wad of cash. I know it‚Äôs not smart to walk around with that kind of money, but I felt better carrying it than keeping it in my apartment. The wind that met my face as I stepped outside never felt so good. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I walked to class in such a good mood, with such excitement. That was until I walked past the lawn.

I crowd of students stood around where I had placed the cross the day before. The smile melted from my face as I picked up my pace in their direction. I squeezed my way through the crowd to the center. I almost fell into the hole that lay before me. That‚Äôs right, a hole. The cross was gone and all that remained was this six-foot, empty hole surrounded by the dirt that had once filled it. 

‚ÄúIt looks like a grave‚Äù

A voice from someone around me commented, accompanied by affirmations by at least a half dozen others and I can‚Äôt lie, that is exactly what it looked like. I must have stood there for a good five minutes before I checked my phone and realized I was about to be late for class. I walked away, peeking back one last time before heading in.

That lecture, along with all of the others I attended that day, was impossible for me to give focus on. I was sunken in my thoughts, drowned by the confusion. Why would someone dig a grave? Why on that cross? What had I done? 

I forced myself to spend the rest of the day at the library. From where I sat, I could see the hole being covered back up by some of the groundskeepers. What little studying I managed to accomplish was overshadowed by all the questions I had in my head. 

By the time I left, it was dark. I got a call about halfway to my apartment. I took my phone out to find the familiar number on the screen. I answered immediately and didn‚Äôt hold back my questions.

‚ÄúWhat was that cross? A fucking grave got dug up right where I put it. What the hell is going on?‚Äù

The man said nothing but I could hear his breath on the other end. I got frustrated.

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù

Still no response.

‚ÄúAnswer me god fucking dammit‚Äù

He paused but eventually spoke.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve unleashed hell on yourself‚Äù

He hung up without another word.

‚ÄúFuck‚Äù

I exclaimed. What does that mean? My conclusion was that it was some sort of sick game. Maybe this man had a dark web audience that loved a little prank. Maybe he‚Äôs got a way of entertaining them with all of this. In any case, I quickened my pace and was back at my apartment minutes later. 

I set my backpack down and sat on my desk, resting my head on my palms. What have I done? I knew that little job had to be too good to be true. A thought came to mind. If that creep did have a way of entertaining some sort of audience, he might be looking through my window right now. I stood up and walked to my window to shut the blinds. That's when I saw him. 

With a wicked smirk, a pale man looked up at me from the street below. He stood in the narrow walkway between two transit train tracks. His skin was white as snow, his hair blacker than the night, his suit crimson like blood, his boots long and pointed, his hands covered in black gloves and his fingers intertwined. He was waiting for something. Waiting for me.

I turned around to fetch my phone, turning back to see that he had vanished. A heavy knock at my door made me jump in shock. I began to walk over to see who it was before a voice carried itself through the metal. A voice that seemed split into many.  A voice that spoke loudly yet had the tone of a whisper.

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶dug my grave?‚Äù

I stopped in my tracks, not sure what was happening or what I should do. I didn‚Äôt have time to decide before the voice appeared behind me.

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶dug‚Ä¶my‚Ä¶grave?!‚Äù

I felt the scream from his last word like a lion‚Äôs roar. I felt it fill my chest, shaking my heart. Suddenly my vision went black and the last thing I remember was falling.

I woke up, hours later on my bed. The lights were off and my blinds were closed. I sat up with a raging headache. What kind of nightmare was that? I checked my backpack to see if the money was still there. It was. I checked my call history. I had, indeed, gotten a call from the number. When did I fall asleep? I began to piece it all together again when the shades on my window were pulled back up in one quick motion. I gasped and jumped out of my bed, and back onto my feet.

Outside, the wooden cross was pressed against my window like it had been hung there. I stood, staring and breathing heavily in my fearful and shaken state. It started to turn, slowly and consistently in a circle until it hung upside down. I looked around to see if something was attached or if there was some sort of string that someone was using to pull it around with. I got closer to the glass to get a better look. The moment I placed a hand on it, the upside-down cross burst into flames. 

My body froze, against my own will and I was left with a hand on the glass, looking at the burning cross outside. I couldn‚Äôt pull away. I couldn‚Äôt so much as move my eyes. Something had control of me. The voice came again, talking from behind me, whispering right into my ear.

‚ÄúYou have awoken him from a long, long rest. He comes to lay waste to all before him. He comes to engulf the world of man in flames and destroy his kingdoms. He comes to devour all. He comes to claim the throne for his father, for it is he who is the true king of kings. For it is he, who will raise his throne above the stars of god. You will serve him, you will serve his father. For eternity you are bound‚Äù.

I passed out once again, only to wake up the next morning in my bed. I proceeded through the next day and every day since like nothing had happened. I don‚Äôt have free will anymore. I don‚Äôt have any control. I don‚Äôt have a sense of right and wrong. 

Every day when I go to class, I see the man in red above me, on the ceiling. He‚Äôll walk, he‚Äôll crawl, he keeps a watchful eye. Every night he stands down on the street below and looks up. I want to close my blinds but I can‚Äôt. I stay glued to my schoolwork. I don‚Äôt talk to friends anymore. When family calls, the words that escape my mouth are not my own, and they assure my family that all is well. Now and then, I can force a tear through the cage that is my own body, but that‚Äôs it.

I don‚Äôt know how I can write what I‚Äôm writing now. I suspect he allows me to do this to warn of his coming. Maybe he wants the world to know.

He has awoken from a long, long rest. He comes to lay waste to all before him. He comes to engulf the world of man in flames and destroy his kingdoms. He comes to devour all. He comes to claim the throne for his father, for it is he who is the true king of kings. For it is he, who will raise his throne above the stars of god. I will serve him, I will serve his father. 

For eternity we are bound."

Update 1: Rescheduled to next Monday. :/

Update 2 (10/31): Just finished on-sites. I collaborated heavily for both the integration and programming exercise, but I did make multiple tiny mistakes that by the end, my interviewer helped me checked.

I got my Bachelor‚Äôs of Science in Computer science a couple years ago with the intent of becoming a software engineer/developer. Throughout college and when I got out, I was making projects, building my portfolio and other things to make my resume look as desirable as I could make it. 

I was able to land two internships a couple months after graduation. These internships helped tremendously with my skillset. My current job at TCS (I‚Äôve been with them almost two years now) is Software Engineer, but I‚Äôm not really developing any software. They moved me to a testing environment where I keep track of features being built by other developers.

I‚Äôm always applying for new jobs constantly as I‚Äôm not happy with my current position, I feel my skillset is stagnating. However, there‚Äôs just something that I‚Äôm a little intimidated by and that‚Äôs my lack of real professional developer experience. In my recent interviews, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt really bring anything to the table and feel massively under-qualified to most of the positions that I apply to even though I‚Äôve been working in this industry for \~2 years now.

I‚Äôm wondering what my next move should be. Should I continue to apply for positions and roles, even though I think I will be under qualified with no true developer experience? Or should I try to move to a different position within TCS to gain the desired experienced I‚Äôm looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

What should my mind set be in all of this? Thanks so much for the advice! :)"

The intern known Python and some ML knowledge (he is still in final master year), also don‚Äôt know web dev. 
We are discussing about his responsibilities and mine. I am more interested in the business side, so I  will be doing all the market research, fundings, customer side, finance, and also building the product.

But right now i don‚Äôt enjoy the internship much, but i can keep doing it if i want to. Was thinking about if i should start working in Consulting once i finish my bachelor degree which will be next year. I also wanna do a Master degree afterwards, but not sure which will suiting me best. Probably Business Administration if i wanna go in Consulting, right? 

I feel that i would like Consulting more.
+ Consulting has no busy season and Audit does, which is also something i will take in my decision. EY Consulting and Audit in junior, staff, senior, manager &amp; partner rank pay exactly the same amount of salary. I‚Äôve checked this in a internal document of EY. So i‚Äôm thinking, why would i work humongeous hours in Audit and follow this long path RA/CPA if i can go Consulting which pays the same for less hours? 

I had a review interview with my Counselor 2 weeks ago and they were really positive about me at Audit.

I've loved tech for a long time, but I still don't know a whole lot about it to enter a helpdesk position. I'm aiming high and working towards getting into tech and eventually something involving cloud development or maybe even full on repair specialist. I love tinkering. But from what I've been reading and seeing has been a little discouraging and I'm wondering if the jump is worth it for someone who doesn't have a degree of the finances to get a degree. 

I am currently in an internship position and loving it, but the pay for tech positions on Canada seems to be abysmally different than that of our US neighbor. I'd say I've got another 4ish months before I'm A+ certified and another 8 in the internship. 

But other than the love for tech I am also really looking to get financially stable for the long run. Is this even feasible in Canada? After looking into pay I seem to be getting more as a manager in retail and I'm scared that I'll be throwing away a good current position for a stagnant financial situation.

The team now knows that my manager will not send me out of the team because i have his support.But i get tortured every day and i can't work because of her. I was taken as an intern and so after six months i am supposed be given a permanent position however my manager asks my mentor and she has asked to hold the permanent position for me. She gives my review every month and it's always bad. No matter how I perform. And when i asked my manager about this he says that i have saved you from multiple escalations that your mentor has y passed on to me and also i have fended off the team when they didn't want you.he says i can only save you this way and if you want permanancy in this company then i need it to come from your mentor, which i know will never come.This has become an endless cycle and i feel iam trapped between mu manager and my mentor playing a game of keeping me intern however that is not true from my manager side.

Abstract: Thiazol-2-amine-5-thioethers serve as key intermediates in the synthesis of FabK inhibitors in our anti-C. difficile research programs. Further, the aminothiazole heterocyclic motif is commonly found in many pharmaceutical and medicinal molecules such as the third 4 and fourth generations of cephalosporin antibacterial agents. As such, modular synthesis and high throughput chemistry facilitate drug discovery endeavors for compound library synthesis and subsequent biological screenings. In this context, we developed a facile thioetherification process from thiols and heterocyclic halides under the selectivity control by changing bases and temperature.

Abstract: Thiazol-2-amine-5-thioethers serve as key intermediates in the synthesis of FabK inhibitors in our anti-C. difficile research programs. Further, the aminothiazole heterocyclic motif is commonly found in many pharmaceutical and medicinal molecules such as the third 4 and fourth generations of cephalosporin antibacterial agents. As such, modular synthesis and high throughput chemistry facilitate drug discovery endeavors for compound library synthesis and subsequent biological screenings. In this context, we developed a facile thioetherification process from thiols and heterocyclic halides under the selectivity control by changing bases and temperature.

I feel like a baby who has been left in the middle of a forest. 

What do I do? - Where do I start? - Do I apply to developer internships now or don't even think about it?"

Recommendation letter: 

comp sci teacher: 8.5/10? I have a good relationship with him and I think it will be a positive letter, at the same time I‚Äôm not super sure? 

English: 9/10? I worked hard in that class and I think she often likes my work


Common App essay: 10/10? I talked about my journey with cancer at a young age and how it shaped my development and causing me to strive to me worth the value of saving me.Gotten it reviewed by teachers and college writing centers and all say it hit the marks 

Writing Supplement: Work in progress, but I think I can make it strong like my common app

Worries: biggest worries is my courses rigor regarding math and sciences . Did 4 years of math but this year I‚Äôm doing Pre-calc when most want calculus done by college. And only 3 years of science which were the standard ones, I don‚Äôt like science and once got the credits done didn‚Äôt care to do more. I‚Äôm just banking on my essay and EC to get me in lol"

yctj2f,3,2022-10-24,Black Boy wants a chance me for Princeton and other Ivys,WispyBo1,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/yctj2f/black_boy_wants_a_chance_me_for_princeton_and/,"Hooks: URM - Born and adopted in an east African country

School: Midwest Public school with 1500+ students

GPA (Unweighted): 4.0

Class Rank: 1/422 - technically tied with 13 other students cause we don't have a weighted system :|

AP's: 7 - 5 5's and 2 4's

ACT: 35

&amp;#x200B;

EC's:

1. District Strategic Planning Committee - Student representative among 20+ exec members in my district including the superintendent, principals of the middle and elementary schools, and various staff; I work with the rest of the members in the committee to form and regulate the rules and commitments my district will be operating under for the next 5 years.
2. Developed an app used within my district - Worked with my computer science and math teachers to develop an app that gives students assistance with their grades by providing analytics and data using the grading software my district uses. Had to develop algorithms and models to give the best aid to students where I learned a lot from both of my teachers. I also taught myself Swift so this project was especially meaningful to see it pay off.
3. Tech Internship - 2 month internship during the school year where I worked with experts in data analytics and astrophysics for a pretty niche purpose that I won't mention for doxxing purposes. Created my own project at the end of the internship with the help of said experts and got to present the final product to them.
4. Club Soccer - State champions for multiple years. Team elected captain for 3 years running. We compete in national leagues and tournaments, and this is by far the most time consuming EC.
5. High school soccer - 3 Years varsity. Team elected captain this year. Made it to state semis every year I've been on the team.
6. Book Club founder and president - pretty self explanatory. we have about 50 consistent members and my club advisor is the head librarian which makes my life a lot easier. Normal club stuff and this year we hosted a book drive where we got received nearly 600 novels that will be donated to various organizations.
7. Superintendents Advisory Board - 8 student representatives who essentially report information to the superintendent on the current state of the high school, and then with his team executive team we help create and change policies.
8. Graduation Committee - Self explanatory
9. Student speaker - Kind of hard to explain. Essentially I've been selected to be the student speaker for my school: when there are any important events taking place in the school, I act as the student guest speaker. Some examples include speaking at board meetings, all district staff convocations, and at the NHS events as the keynote speaker.

Other minor stuff like playing guitar, working as an official referee, and small leadership roles in clubs. Oh NHS too.

&amp;#x200B;

Awards

Only ones that aren't just NHS or something like that...

1. Gold Medalist in NAACP competition - not gonna say which one... this was a pain in the back because I was invited to compete really late :|
2. State level award that recognizes students for their academic achievements and roles in leadership 
3. All state soccer recognition
4. State champions for soccer for multiple years

&amp;#x200B;

LOR

\*not gonna grade cause... ya know... cant see them\*

Math teacher (Calc ab, bc, and stats) - Same teacher who helped with the app so I've worked with him outside of class a lot, along with having him for the past 3 years. We're close cause we poke fun at each other a lot and I don't put up a goody two shoes facade around him so it doesn't feel like the typical teacher-student dynamic. I also help teach his lower level math classes when I have a free period.

&amp;#x200B;

Superintendent - We've worked a lot together so we're also really cool with each other. Surprisingly, he was the one who asked me if I would want him to write a LOR so I'm taking it as a sign it'll be good.

&amp;#x200B;

Orchestra teacher - Helped me out during a really hard time and he's a really genuine guy so I expect nothing but good things.

&amp;#x200B;

Others will probably be pretty average.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on what I've seen from some applicants in previous years, I really have no idea what to expect. If I got rejected from every school I honestly wouldn't be shocked considering the state of applicant pools. I kinda just tried to make the most out of what my area has to offer, so I'm interested to see how you would think I will fair during this admissions process. Brutal honesty would be much appreciated."

I know it‚Äôs very hard to refer a complete stranger so a bit of background info about me: 
- GPA 3.8
- Technical skills: R, SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, Microsoft Office 
- Prior internship experience as a Summer analyst for a local bank
- on campus jobs related to customer service and IT
- 2 leadership positions in college

I have applied to big4 before but never heard anything back. I tried to improve my chances by going to events and networking but big4 only recruits for audit/tax at my school and consulting/advisory roles are entirely off limits. I have also made efforts to improve my resume multiple times but it was to no avail. I tried to shoot my shot by cold messaging recruiters/current employees or school alumni on LinkedIn but the furthest it got me was a hello from an senior associate who stopped replying afterwards. 

Reddit is my last resort and I would really really appreciate it if someone here would be kind enough to give me a referral for EY or any other big4."

The tests for Calc 2 are worth 85% of the grade and the grading scale is the standard scale(70% for a C). I studied hard and devoted more time to this class than all of my other classes combined. I genuinely thought that I did well on the exam too. I was wondering if other people found this class to be incredibly challenging and general advice on what to do. I have an internship for next semester and with higher level compsci classes being most of what I have left, I don't see myself having more time and I am really not confident in my ability to pass this class in another semester without delaying my degree. Should I stick it out or should I just withdraw and try another semester? Does it get easier?"

To first take a break from uni and gather some professional experience, I thought it was a good idea to take this year to work in software- engineering/development, data science, or machine learning. 

After being rejected at numerous applications for internships, I realized being a student helps in finding an internship. (got through the entire application process a few times, but since I wasn't a student anymore they rejected me)

Right now I'm not sure what to do,  should I just apply for junior roles? But at the same time I don't want to work for an entire year, since I still want to start my master's studies in the near future (2023-2024).  Most graduate jobs take up 12 -24 months...

What do?,AirlineEasy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yd04g0/32_year_old_recent_law_grad_with_little/,"Hello, I'm a 32 year old law graduate, that recently finished and with a very average score. It took me ten years instead of the 6 it normally takes in my country, because of huge psychological blocks created in my youth through my parents with finishing my degree. Those issues have been resolved thanks to years of work in therapy, and a very supportive but cultivated environment of friends and family (through my wife.). 

I have no issues with public speaking, have an analytic mind, deep interests, and a healthy and active social life. 

I've had two internships, one in criminal law, and one in labour law, but I want to work in corporate law because that is where the money is.

I'm old, I'm in a bad career, I'm behind, have average scores and little experience. I'm ok with all of this, but where do I go from here? What is my best bet to get a successful career. I don't mind working heavily for a few years to get where I need to go, which is financial stability, professional abilities, and as much job security as I can get.

Considering the disadvantages, how can I best leverage what I have to get the professional success that I want?"

I wanted to be a professor after getting my PhD but In order to get my degree I need to do a compulsory 6 month internship. And here is where I'm stuck I have never really thought of getting a job apart from being a professor so I don't really know where to start the process of sitting for interviews and stuff. 

I'm interested in getting into data analytics or mobile application (android)  domains. 
Place doesn't matter I'm more in for experience.
Work form home or office doesn't really matter. I have been through various places both south and north in India so I can adjust pretty fast. 
I have residence in Udupi(karnataka) and Mumbai so I would prefer places like these since it would cost less on rent but again it doesn't matter much. 

Could you guys recommend me sites that are well versed with Indian based companies and towards Indians. 

I specifically only need to do internship.
I'm not understanding where should I start need guidance.. 
There are too many sites out there so don't know what and where to start."

Hi,
3rd year student here,
I was wondering if anyone more experienced could give me some insight what would be a better choice.
My main goal is to learn as much as possible, money is not really a decider since its only an internship and both pay pretty much the same for graduates (according to glassdoor)

Amazon offers 6 mos, sig offers 8
Sig pays more
Amazon is a brand

I have spend the last 2 days reading about the differences between roles.

Working in tech and the whole faang culture seems appealing to me

At sig i would probably be writing c++ for a 5 ms faster algorithm. (Also interesting work)

I have also heard theres a lot more room to grow career wise in a fang than something like sig.

What would be better for me exposure and learning wise?"

I will be graduating in July 2023. I am relatively anxious about finding a job after graduation. I am looking for advice to set myself up to easily find an occupation after graduation and to make sure my resume is good for this purpose.

I am already aware of general advice provided to students such as: expanding your network, doing side projects, finding an internship etc. I am looking for advice more specific to my situation, so here are some questions, preceded with some context.

* I am taking part in a research program ([https://www.monash.edu/study/fees-scholarships/scholarships/summer-winter](https://www.monash.edu/study/fees-scholarships/scholarships/summer-winter)) at Monash in the coming Summer. The focus of the Project is in Interpretable AI. I participated in the program under the same supervisor last Winter. While this opportunity is paid and supposed to be full-time, I am not sure if this is something that I can ""sell"" as an internship in my Resume. While I have already included this opportunity in my resume would it be fitting to sell it as a research internship?
* I recently completed a subject called IT Project at unimelb where-in I (as part of a team of 5) utilized the MERN stack with Typescript to develop a relatively simple Web Application while following Agile practices. Unfortunately, I have not engaged in any other side-projects related to web development. Should I emphasize this project in my resume or leave it out as my participation in the subject was part of my course at University?
* I am looking for entry level roles in Data Science/Analytics and Software Engineering. Is it worth having different resumes for each role, or should I have 1 resume wherein I highlight the experience I have in both fields?
* I have applied for some internships early 2022. I found myself lacking the required practice in Leetcode style questions for some of the screening involved (I look forward to practicing on this till I graduate). How common are Leetcode style questions in interviews for smaller/medium sized companies?
* Finally, how to find opportunities in smaller companies? I have heard that most open positions in these companies are not advertised on job boards like seek, indeed etc. Cold emails? LinkedIn messages? Any other resources?

Edit: I think it would be relevant to include that I would be working under a 485 visa.

Thank you."

# Chapter 51: Shot Across the Bow

**June 4th, 2263.  17:45 CNS Fargo ‚Äì Interrogation Room 1**

John walked into the room and lazily tossed five data slates onto the table.  They made a loud noise, surprising Dr. George Patel, who looked pale as a ghost and generally terrified of what was happening.  He quickly glanced at the mountain of a man, in comparison to him at least, before returning to stare at the desk.

‚ÄúAlright George, out with it,‚Äù John said as he leaned back in his seat.

‚ÄúI did not know‚Ä¶‚Äù

John interrupted him, ‚ÄúApologies, I suppose I should start with some simple guidelines.  If you are honest with me and tell me information that leads to the convictions of others and you weren‚Äôt involved in any sketchy bullshit, I can work with you.  Lie about anything and I may just space you to speed up your due process.‚Äù

George‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ how‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶‚Äù he stammered, ‚ÄúHow does that speed up my due process?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means the guilty get their just punishment for their crimes.  In this case, crimes against humanity.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, I am not a geneticist.  I was sent here to oversee the rollout of this lab.  It wasn‚Äôt until we were running for four months that I found out most of the scientists here are amoral and unethical,‚Äù George sighed and stared at the table, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have the power to do anything.  I even told my bosses, and they didn‚Äôt seem to care.  Doctor Weller went over, or around me, to get his ‚Äòstudies‚Äô green lit.‚Äù

‚ÄúTalk to me about NIfTA,‚Äù John asked quietly.

‚ÄúWe develop arms and technology for the military and citizens of the Mercantilist Union.‚Äù

John nodded, ‚ÄúDid you ever bother to think or ask why there‚Äôd be labs in Confederate space?‚Äù

George looked back down at the table once more in shame, ‚ÄúI did but I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI presume you‚Äôve heard of the rather unsavory rumors surrounding NIfTA‚Äôs leader?‚Äù

‚ÄúDr. Norman is brilliant, truly brilliant.  But with that brilliance comes some dark eccentricities and attitudes towards the civilian leaders.  If what I‚Äôve heard is true, then human life means nothing to him, everyone and thing is a legitimate target for studying.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorge, I‚Äôll level set with you since you haven‚Äôt tried to blow smoke up my ass yet.  We‚Äôve already reviewed every single conversation you‚Äôve had on that base that was recorded.  Which is basically everyone since there were a plethora of security cameras.  All those electronic letters you sent, video conferences, and hell, you name it we reviewed it,‚Äù John paused to take a drink of water, ‚ÄúYou are one of six partially innocent people on that base.  Out of eighty-four.  Well, innocent of any genetic crimes, you are guilty by association with those people and certainly guilty of overseeing a foreign powers research lab that was conducting illegal research here.‚Äù

George sighed as he ran his hands through his hair as he stared at the ceiling, ‚ÄúMy initial remit was to oversee a lab that conducts theoretical research on the human genome.  That is not illegal.‚Äù

John shook his head, ‚ÄúAccording to Confederate laws, which supersede the local lack of laws here, you are dead ass wrong.  The theoretical research you were doing did in fact violate our laws.  Just because your Mercantilist Union believes it‚Äôs legal means jack shit here.  Whoever your lawyers did a shit job,‚Äù John held up a data slate and handed it to George, ‚ÄúJustifying how they could do this work and not get into any trouble.‚Äù

George was about to speak as he skimmed the data slate before John continued speaking.

‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs ignore the fact that a foreign power was footing the bill and had forged documents to prove the base‚Äôs legitimacy,‚Äù John pushed another data slate to George, ‚ÄúYou do realize that because of NIfTA‚Äôs close ties to the government I could, rather articulately too I might add, argue that this was an act of war.‚Äù

George set both data slates down on the table and sighed, ‚ÄúI was told to report back monthly for six months and then I‚Äôd be home.  My focus and area of specialty are plasma cannons and railguns.  I don‚Äôt know a damn thing about genetic manipulation.  I can‚Äôt go back home anymore anyways, if I do, I‚Äôm a dead man.‚Äù

John raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúDr. Norman doesn‚Äôt tolerate failure.  This is a proper fuck up, which I‚Äôll be set up to take responsibility for.  I‚Äôve heard of peers disappearing for less egregious offenses.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you remotely access NIfTA‚Äôs servers from that base?‚Äù

George nodded, ‚ÄúNot everything but I do have read access to all my projects.‚Äù

A data slate was slid across the table.  John simply pointed at it.  George understood the non-verbal cues clearly and entered his access credentials.  He then slid it back to John.  An email was sent to Jerad who was working in the hangar bay on the enemy server.

John stood up after Jerad responded and walked to the double-sided mirror.  He whispered something that George couldn‚Äôt hear.  A tense, and very awkward, five minutes of silence started.  John stared at George while he himself stared at the table in shame.

That terrible feeling was temporarily broken when Jerad contacted John via the internship coms, ‚ÄúLieutenant, his access was rescinded while we were in, but we have a copy of everything he had access to.  The copying of the file likely triggered the removal of access.‚Äù

John nodded, ‚ÄúSo they know about this lab.  And now they know we have everything he had access to.  No matter, transfer that to Titan, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be curious about the state of the Union‚Äôs weapons technology compared to us.‚Äù

George looked even more nervous than he had before.

John took a seat again, ‚ÄúAlright George, give me everything you know about Dr. Norman.‚Äù

The conversation continued for nearly an hour longer.  John was convinced that he was being truthful, though utterly reluctant to part with most of the information he had given up.  He was upgraded to some nicer quarters, though he would still be under watch at all times and wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to leave the room unless his captures wished him to.

**June 6th, 2263.  04:35 Brig Interview Room**

John watched as the latest scientist was chained and then led out of the room.  He let out a deep sigh and rubbed his eyes.  Exhaustion had set in, the hours since the operation had just flown by.    He looked down at his watch to catch the time when Lieutenant Erickson walked in.

John raised his hands, as if to stop the fellow lieutenant from speaking, and spoke, ‚ÄúLook, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been up sixty-eight hours straight.  Twenty-two interviews deep too.  I have to shut you down until tomorrow morning at 08:00.  You need food and sleep badly.‚Äù

John nodded, ‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù

Darryl laughed as he sat down in the questionee‚Äôs chair, ‚ÄúShit, that was easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, I am fucking exhausted.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo we have enough to go to war?‚Äù

John shook his head, ‚ÄúOh we have enough for a diplomatic incident, but I don‚Äôt think we have enough to convince the naysayers on their cabinet.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven with their experiments?‚Äù

John handed Darryl a data slate, ‚ÄúTake a look at the roster on that base.  Notice the citizenship?‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus.  How in the hell are there that many?‚Äù

The names on the data slate were split into three groups.  Two were from the Mercantilist Union, though one of them had been attempting to gain Confederate citizenship for four years.  Eight were from the Alliance, and all of them were highly wanted criminals there.  The remainder, seventy-five, were fellow citizens to the pair of Naval officers.

‚ÄúThis is a joke, right?‚Äù Darryl asked.

John shook his head, ‚ÄúWhere in the hell are these people being radicalized?  It makes no sense.  Thanks to their attach√© to this base, we got the goods on six other bases.  Three of them were raided hours after we hit this one.  His access wasn‚Äôt canceled either,‚Äù John laughed, ‚ÄúFucking rank amateurs.  We think there was a VI that was doing maintenance and bounced him from the server.  Oh, and three more bases are being hit today.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been meaning to talk to you about something.  Have you noticed how there‚Äôs progress now that Commander Murphy isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Darryl let the sentence hang.

‚ÄúFucking up everything by existing?‚Äù John said directly, ‚ÄúHer work hasn‚Äôt improved that much for the record.  at least from the reports, she puts together that I have the misfortune of reviewing.  I thought there was something untoward about her, but I think she just sucks at her job.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt exactly a ringing endorsement.‚Äù

John laughed, ‚ÄúIt is definitely not.  How long is the trip back to Manchester?‚Äù

‚ÄúFaster than expected.  Tides have shifted dramatically.  Should be there in six to eight days' travel.  Maybe five but you know how accurate long-term forecasts are.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, not accurate in the least,‚Äù John slid the chair back and stood up, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm heading to the mess for some food or leftovers, then I‚Äôm off to bed per your orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnically the doctor gave them.  Oh, also bad news.  Doctor Kipling wants a word with you before you go back on duty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe shrink?  Why the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be wise to meet with the shrink.  Those come from Admiral Nelson, I‚Äôm not fucking around with his orders.‚Äù

John sighed as he looked down, ‚ÄúFine after I get to rest, I‚Äôll reach out to him.‚Äù

**June 7th, 2263.  07:45 Medbay ‚Äì Doctor Kipling‚Äôs Office**

John stepped into the office, which was full of goofy crap.  Movie posters, models, and even miniature figures for wargames were strewn everywhere in the mess that was an office.  John grinned as he picked up a Warhammer model and inspected the paint job before sitting down.

‚ÄúGood morning, Lieutenant.  How are you feeling?‚Äù

‚ÄúRested with a full stomach,‚Äù John answered in a harsh tone.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt much care for my profession, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really, no,‚Äù John laughed, ‚ÄúOf course, I married one so there‚Äôs that.  But she doesn‚Äôt try to psychoanalyze me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you think this is a waste of time?‚Äù

John nodded, ‚ÄúI do.  I have work to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúDiscussing the frustrations and problems you feel can reduce the amount of stress you feel and deal with.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoctor, with all due respect here.  I am only present because I have been ordered to do so.  I would appreciate it if you cut to the meat of the conversation and skip the appetizer.  I have a lot of work to do.‚Äù

Doctor Kipling looked down at his notes, ‚ÄúYou feel nothing about what you saw in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I felt plenty, sir.  But I‚Äôve successfully compartmentalized my emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven when you threatened to flay or space those we captured?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe threat wasn‚Äôt legitimate, but it needed to sound as it were.  Besides, I doubt very much I‚Äôd be able to space anyone successfully.  Now if I were the captain of this vessel‚Ä¶‚Äù John let the sentence hang.

‚ÄúYou are aware that threats like that are not lawful.  We aren‚Äôt allowed to do that because the individual may tell us lies in order to save their skin.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware of that Doctor,‚Äù John said dismissively, ‚ÄúMost of these scientists aren‚Äôt career criminals, as such they aren‚Äôt aware of what we can or are willing to do.  Also, extra-judicial justice is acceptable in a case like this, as detestable as that may be to you.‚Äù

Doctor Kipling frowned and looked at John worriedly, ‚ÄúMurdering someone in cold blood is never acceptable.‚Äù

‚ÄúMurdering someone that injected poison into the veins of individuals which changed their genetic structure, then starving them over the next thirty days while they are strapped to a lab table isn‚Äôt just for that?‚Äù John asked as he shook his head, ‚ÄúDoctor, there will be no trials for these people.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you so sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really think Naval Command will let the civilian government know that illegal genetic testing was done within our territory?  What do you think our neighbor‚Äôs response would be?‚Äù John stared at the doctor defiantly, ‚ÄúNo.  Killing these despicable people would be a mercy.  Most will rot away in jail; the lucky few will get the death penalty.  In either case, none will come face to face with a judge or jury.‚Äù

John took a deep breath and spoke again just before the doctor was about to say something, ‚ÄúKilling them would end their suffering and save the Confederacy an incredible amount of money.  While I wish I could end these despicable people‚Äôs lives, it is not my place to do so.  Are we done here, sir?‚Äù

Doctor Kipling took his glasses off and leaned back in his chair, ‚ÄúNothing seems to faze you, does it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMany things do, sir.  My life has been full of conflict.  This is no different.‚Äù

‚ÄúAside from some questionable language around our prisoners, I see nothing in your action to suggest you are a danger to the crew.  You have cleared once again for active-duty Lieutenant.‚Äù

John nodded and stood up.  He gave a bad salute to the doctor and left the office.  His duty was done but he did not appreciate the second-guessing of them.  They weren‚Äôt on the frontlines, and they absolutely didn‚Äôt understand how evil the enemy really was.

**June 10th, 2263.  14:45 Boardroom**

The CNS Fargo‚Äôs boardroom was the finest room on the ship.  Its table was rich mahogany with gold trim.  That combination was fairly common throughout the fleet.  John sat at the center of the table across from the largest viewscreen in the room.  An agent from Titan was regurgitating information John already knew.

John was reading a data slate that summarized the data that was recovered from the enemy server.  Access codes from four other individuals on that base were uncovered which unlocked additional information.  Though not it led them to the central location of Dr. Norman‚Äôs organization.

The lack of that information rubbed John wrong.  If he knew where the base was, he was of the mind to commandeer a stealth shuttle and end the organization in one fell swoop.  There was talk of apprehending this asshole, but John had other ideas.  Brutal ones that not even God himself would be able to prevent him from following through on them.

‚ÄúLieutenant Lief, do you agree with these conclusions?‚Äù

John looked up and apologized, ‚ÄúI am sorry, my focus was elsewhere.  What was the conclusion?‚Äù

Agent Destiny Becklund sighed, ‚ÄúWe believe this is enough to discuss with our contacts within the Mercantilist Union‚Äôs government.‚Äù

‚ÄúI firmly disagree.  We‚Äôve got them outsourcing this work to largely Confederate sources.  It‚Äôd result in more eggs on our faces than theirs.  The Alliance will flip the fuck out if they find out this shit is happening.‚Äù

Admiral Nelson leaned forward and interjected himself into the conversation, ‚ÄúWhat is your next step?‚Äù

‚ÄúContinue what we‚Äôre doing.  We need to make it so horrifically expensive that their talent pool, which is far larger than it ought to be, dries up and they move these operations into Alliance territory.‚Äù

Dexter Watanabe then spoke, ‚ÄúNaval Intelligence seems to be split into two camps.  Act or continue the status quo.  I lean towards the status quo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to do a thorough review of Ph.D. holders, or those in graduate or doctorate programs as soon as possible.  The main thing is to look for sociopathic or psychopathic tendencies and monitor them like hawks.  We don‚Äôt yet understand how they are recruiting all of these assholes.‚Äù

Commander Benjamin sarcastically said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rich coming from you.‚Äù

John grinned as he looked at her on the screen, ‚ÄúThe difference between their sociopathy and mine, is I direct mine at our enemies, not our citizens.  In any case, we do need to both find out where these scientists are and ensure Dr. Norman‚Äôs organization doesn‚Äôt get its hands on them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù General Mizrahi said, ‚ÄúWe have active leads on another dozen sites with teams either engaging them in hours or within a couple of days.  How many sites were they running?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to tell but they were operating twenty-six at one time recently.  If that number is consistent then there are eight that we are unaware of,‚Äù Commander Murphy said.

‚ÄúHow have our efforts in gaining access to our colonies' official request?‚Äù Admiral Nelson asked.

Director LeCroix then appeared on the screen, ‚ÄúThe civilian government is unwilling to give us access to that information.  They worry that once that door is open it will never close.‚Äù

The meeting grew silent until John spoke up, ‚ÄúWhat if we did an end around them?‚Äù

‚ÄúLieutenant, the last thing we, and especially you, need to do is make enemies of the civvies,‚Äù Director LeCroix rubbed his forehead.

‚ÄúConsider that idea scrapped,‚Äù John said.

He was tapping away at his data slate.  Then he transferred what he was working on to the terminal in front of him.  Eve then scanned the run time that he pulled from his server and offered several suggestions for it.  John was determined to modify his text analytics program to monitor the incoming official colony messages to the civilian government.

They would only review those messages that involved problems with a group or unexplained abductions.  The VI would only pass on what colonies were submitting such requests.  All other requests would be ignored and scrubbed permanently from his server.  He grinned when he came up with a plan to leak that information to the task force, he still didn‚Äôt trust Naval Intelligence with handling this intel correctly.

‚ÄúIf that is all then everyone is dismissed,‚Äù Admiral Nelson said.

John could see people drop from the meeting or walk out of the meeting room.  It didn‚Äôt take long until Admiral Nelson, General Mizrahi and he was alone.  The meeting room was then secured and recording devices were turned off and blocked from activating.

‚ÄúWe have confirmation that there is a mole in the task force,‚Äù General Mizrahi said, ‚ÄúWe are not convinced it is NI, but it could be the most likely outcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do we know that sir?‚Äù John asked curiously.

‚ÄúA message was sent three hours ago.  The connection to the server was then cut, for all users that we were aware of,‚Äù Admiral Nelson said.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get a copy of Eve uploaded to the server; all the IDs I had compromised were read-only unless physically onsite.  By the way, still have no clue where their headquarters are.  The official documented ones are not it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJohn, I read your plan of attack.  We aren‚Äôt risking you or any of our assets on that at this time,‚Äù Admiral Nelson said, ‚ÄúYour case was persuasive though.‚Äù

‚ÄúSirs, I think we may need to do this to kill two birds with one stone,‚Äù John smiled as he leaned back, ‚ÄúBut I will need to redo my plan.  I think we also need to plan on heavier resistance going forward.  At least until we break their will in running these labs in our space.‚Äù

‚ÄúI agree and we will await the revised plan,‚Äù General Mizrahi said, ‚ÄúNow a bit of bad news, for you anyways, Commander Murphy has demanded to have her team accompany Marine Platoon Three on their next mission.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou obviously told her to fuck off, right?‚Äù John snapped forward and spat out.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in a position to deny Naval Intelligence requests.  Even one as low as her,‚Äù Admiral Nelson said, ‚ÄúDirector LeCroix and Chief Watanabe were very, very clear with her over who is in charge of the operations and what her limited roles would be on the ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood sir.  I will attempt to play nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo more than attempt, Lieutenant,‚Äù General Mizrahi said, ‚ÄúBut for today, good work out there, son.  The last two months have more than justified this operation.‚Äù

The meeting then ended.  John leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.  As he did, he smiled and took a deep breath.  They finally had momentum.

I don't know what happened to me. I was such a good student as a kid and even my first semester of college. But quickly it became a struggle.

Nevertheless I pushed through, I would work on schoolwork all through the night, take 5-6 classes a semester, volunteer as an EMT, I would work a job and also run clubs, sometimes even an internship too. I found a way to do it all all the time. I dealt with other life stuff all at the same time and still somehow got through it.

But, now here I am, my final semester of college, I am unable to get up from bed most days. I barely eat anymore. I skip classes all of the time and do the bare minimum for everything. I procrastinate, feel hopeless, want to sleep all the time and I am struggling to find any motivation.

I used to work shitty jobs where I would work in warehouses for 10 hours shifts, and while I hated it I was able to do it. Now I cant even get myself to work more than a week.

Ive been tossed around on different meds. And everyone diagnoses me with something different, one week its anxiety, the next week is ADHD, the next it might be bipolar.

I dont even know what I want to do as a career and I am scared Ill never want to work a day in my life again. I keep canceling on things and people at the last second all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont even know what to do anymore Im lost. :("

A bit nervous tbh lol. I'm still considering perhaps taking a masters but so far I'm leaning more towards getting a job next year after I graduate. Unfortunately, I think data analysts jobs for junior level or fresh graduates are pretty hard to get (I assume unless you really have a strong inside connection or something). Anyways, as title mentioned, I was wondering, what other job title(s) that might not seem to require such ""high qualifications"" but if you get into this job, you can grow in time and improve towards the direction of becoming a data analyst later in your career? Hope the question is clear enough lol.

A bit context, I don't have years of work experience or whatsoever. My only professional experience was an internship for 6 months under the Digital and Data Analyst department. But suffice to say that I am quite experienced in data analytics tools, such as Power BI, Tableau, Python, SQL, and I am now learning SAS too. Though I still wouldn't call myself an expert in those fields, however I have done tons of projects with those tools."

I'm hoping some current Capitol Hill staffers or ex-Hill workers could help guide me a little, as I'm at a bit of a crossroads. I'm a very recent college graduate (spring 2022) who just moved to an apartment in D.C. I currently work in a business development role in the Regulatory practice of a large law firm, but I previously interned at a D.C. think tank during college, and have campaigned for state political candidates. 

I like my current job, but I always considered it a stepping stone before law school or a career in politics, and I am now leaning heavily towards the latter. Between what I do for my job and my academic background in polisci from a good state school, I think my skillset and knowledge would be applicable to Capitol Hill, though I have no previous experience working there. I am thinking of applying for internship programs and staff assistant positions, though I've been lead to believe that a chance at the paid staff positions is quite low without prior Hill experience.

I did receive a previous interview request for a House internship program (though I ended up having to turn it down for financial reasons), so I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that I could land another. Financially, I am more prepared now; I do not have student loans, but would probably need to dip heavily into my savings to support a foray as an intern given my current rent and expenses.

**TL;DR** Needlessly long introduction aside, I do have a few questions and I was hoping those with prior experience could answer some of them:

* Is it common to hire college graduates rather than students if they have no Hill experience? (some internships say they accept recent college grads) How young do you have to be to be considered?
* Is it better to apply for internships or full-time positions given my age and experience level?
* Is it smarter to take a Spring internship or save for a few more months and apply for a summer or full-time one? (I'd be a year out of college then)
* Is there enough of a chance at a full-time job after an internship to justify quitting a decent job and making almost nothing for a few months?  
* Did you enjoy the experience and do you feel you learned a lot at the early stages of your career?

Thanks for the help and I'm grateful for any answers y'all can give me."

\- Cat ar trebuii sa cer la marire?

\- As vrea in cativa ani sa incerc si viata pe cont propriu de PFA/SRL. Cu embedded doar e mai greu. Ce cunostinte sa mai adun intre timp? (primul meu gand e C# pentru aplicatii desktop)

ydedn2,86,2022-10-25,A Few Pointers for Boot Camp Grads and Uni Students From a Sr. Engineer,uncomfortablepanda,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/ydedn2/a_few_pointers_for_boot_camp_grads_and_uni/,"So for the last 3 months, my time has been almost solely dedicated to interviewing, onboarding, and training new people at my work. Throughout the whole process, I‚Äôve been able to identify a couple patterns that I think would be useful to work on before going into interviews or if you are looking to have better chances at getting hired at popular companies.

Needless to say, these are my opinions alone and should be taken with a grain of salt. I might be a Sr. engineer but I still have much to learn and my experiences might be not a true reflection of the market.

# Things To Consider:

* This is more specific for boot camp grads. An interviewer will see the same ""Airflow pipeline with &lt;insert name of free API  here&gt; data"" project a million times with the same structure, tests, and GitHub readme. A lot of bootcamps (and online courses) tend to steer their students to reuse projects from previous years over and over, which leaves you at a huge disadvantage. If you think this is you, take the time to work on other things.  

* I thought everyone knew this but obviously, some missed the memo. Data engineering is not exempt from TDD practices. If can't talk about testing during the interview, this is a massive red flag.  

* Unwillingness to learn SWE concepts/topics will hurt you in the long run. It will not make it easy to interview at companies where Data Engineers are treated as specialized software engineers, or where you are expected to work with other engineers (Backend, DevOps, Architecture, Networking, etc).   

* Focus on collaboration during technical interviews. Getting to the right answer is great, but a lot of companies will not consider you if you don't communicate with whoever is interviewing you. Being silent during the entire coding session makes it awkward and makes interviewers think you won't be a good fit in a collaborative team.   

* For the love of god, come prepared with questions before an interview. And something else besides ""what is &lt;insert name of company&gt;, what do you do?"".   

* If you are applying to a position but have no experience (internships, coops, freelancing, etc.) or just come straight out of an 18-week boot camp course. Please understand that you must put in 300% more effort in the interview and your portfolio than most candidates. I would love to hire folks like this, mentor them, and see them become great developers (and I have). Unfortunately, for 1 job application I publish, I get \~170 applicants within a couple days sometimes. It is hard to say no to experience when jobs in the DE space are so popular these days. Maybe get an internship first or find a small startup that is willing to give you a shot.   

* There are sooooo many companies out there misusing the term ""Data Engineering"" in job postings. Some are just glorified BI/DA positions with fancy titles or jobs where you don't code and end up becoming stuck in a career where you will have a hard time making moves to other engineering positions. In my opinion, data engineers shouldn't settle for such jobs. Ask questions to weed out these jobs during the interview process if you really want to become a proper DE (sorry if it sounds a bit harsh, I truly appreciate good BI developers and Data analysts)  

* Finally, weekend projects and open-source contributions are always cool to see. I support those who want to keep their personal time completely separate from doing anything related to development. But you know, it's cool to see folks passionate about learning or contributing to our community. 

These are just a couple things that jumped out at me during the past three months. I think paying attention to some of these points will make you a more well-rounded candidate and possibly give you better chances in the long run."

ydf08n,2,2022-10-25,Tips for successfully including parent(s) in counseling session with teen clients,yarrowbloom,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/ydf08n/tips_for_successfully_including_parents_in/,"Hi everyone,
I am a counseling intern who has an adolescent client. I have only met them and a family member that brings them to sessions. Most of the sessions and concerns are about their difficulties with one of their parents and the lack of care they feel from them. I've looked online for advice but most of it is when a parent has a concern (about a teen using drugs, for example), and is the one asking to be included- not the child requesting it because of interpersonal/parenting concerns.

Both my client and their family member think it would be helpful for me to talk to the parent in session and try and get their behavior to change. However, this is a situation where it seems really difficult for the parent to be able to openly recieve any feedback without feeling like they're being ""called into the principal's office"" and need to explain themselves. I have told my client that we will need to be tactful and gentle so the information can be recieved by their parent, and that the parent's behavior may not change following our meeting. 

My plan is to meet with the adolescent at the beginning alone, bring the parent in for the middle, and then end the session with just the adolescent again. I am meeting with them (parent and child) in a few days. 

Does anyone have any advice?? Truthfully my impression of the parent is that they will feel defensive, maybe will gaslight the client or blame them, that they engage in some levels of emotional abuse- but since they and their family member both think I could be very helpful as an ""outside source"" of feedback for the parent, I'm willing to give it a go. I've talked with my supervisor but she has been very general without any specific advice (saying things like ""be tactful""..).trying to be vague about specifics to maintain privacy. Thank you."

I may not be the best case to model studying off of, but heres my story! I am a senior computer science student (extra year left of college still) with no IT background, but have been using computers since I was six. I have messed around slightly with Kali Linux on my university's ethernet (Got into some trouble, oops, but then got offered a job as a student infosec specialist so a win?). As far as my studying routine, I basically just spent the last week watching the entire Messer video series and taking non-stop practice exams. I failed all three Messer exams and failed 5/6 Dion exams with an average of 82%, but passed my most recent Dion practice exam. I found the Dion exams on-par with the actual exam. My advice? Just take it slow, use all 90 minutes! I had 74 questions and flagged 42 of them.

I will say that I started listening to the Darknet Diaries podcast about six months ago from a recommendation from a friend, and fell in love with it. That is actually what made me decide that I wanted to look into pursuing InfoSec as a career. It talks all about threats, vulnerabilities, penetration testing, and much more, and coincidentally, I didn't miss a single question from section 1.0 Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities!

My study materials:

* All Professor Messer videos at 1.25x/1.5x speed
* Bought Professor Messer practice exams/course notes
* All ExamCompass practice tests
* Jason Dion Udemy practice exams
* CompTIA Security+ Exam Prep by Thanh Hung on iOS app store
* Darknet Diaries Podcast

Moving forward, with this Cert boosting my resume, and just recently being hired as an Information Security Specialist, I hope to get hands on experience and will be looking to apply for some cybersecurity internships for next summer. It's a good day!"

ydl8k3,1,2022-10-25,"I (19M) have fallen for someone (20F). However, she lives in a different country, and some problems have come up. What can I do?",bad-at-life26,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ydl8k3/i_19m_have_fallen_for_someone_20f_however_she/,"As the title suggests, I've fallen for a girl who's currently living in the UK. I've known her through a mutual friend for more than a year at this point, but she came into my life at a time when I had no one to lean on or talk to, and in the past 8 months she's changed the way I look at life and is truly a remarkable person. We've pretty much spent almost every day talking with each other since then, have really gotten to know each other, and even call each other when we can (which was a pleasant surprise, seeing as neither of us really enjoyed calling people as it was usually too much work). We found out we're quite similar in terms of mindset, humor, and values, and she's quickly become one of my best friends.

In late August, after some miscommunications (caused by me being indecisive), I eventually confessed and told her that I was quickly falling for her, and felt bad that I was hiding that from her and trying to play it off. Turns out that the feeling was mutual, and we've been happily flirting and enjoying this feeling of adoration for one another.

The problem arises because I was originally supposed to be going to Europe for a few months for a study abroad program, where we were finally going to meet and, regardless of romantic intent, spend time getting to know each other in-person, as well. However, due to unforeseen circumstances and this time being a crucial juncture in our lives (we're both graduating from our respective Unis in the spring, and are currently applying for our post-undergrad programs), I can no longer go on the study abroad program. This hasn't stopped me, as I am currently looking into other internships or opportunities so that I can spend some time near/with her, some time next year before heading to med school.

We've both been really open with how we feel about each other, but recently, just due to the helplessness we both feel in the situation, unable to go and visit one another, at least to confirm and finally make things official or just to finally be in one another's presence, we've both been feeling more and more despondent and helpless. I've been able to handle it well, as, being on the medicine path, I've more or less come to terms with the fact that any relationship I might have will definitely be hard to navigate, due to long hours of studying and clinical rounds that might lead me to be emotionally detached or extremely busy at times, in the future. Waiting has never been an issue for me, or at least, is one that I've accepted in my life. She, on the other hand, has been having a slightly hard time dealing with it. I know that we feel the same way about each other, as she has reaffirmed that she's more than willing to wait for me (even though she's generally a little impatient at times, by nature). Still, she's been open that it's been weighing on her mind, that she feels helpless and wishes that we could just be together, at least just for a little bit, to serve as an interim between now and what lies in store for us in the future.

I know she's upset by this, and we both know there's not a lot we have in our control at the moment, but I need to ask: What can I do? What would help ease the burden that's weighing on us?

Would it be better to put a pin in the romantic aspect and stay as friends until we're sure we can change it? How should I go about treading through this?

I live with my parents and don't have to worry about feeding myself. Apart from that I used my savings for occasional monthly hangouts with friends, entertainment subscriptions and putting aside money for investments (I've just been brought up that way). Because of my massive student loans, I felt like I have no choice but aim to be a high income earner.

I'll be having a final interview for a data reviewer position at a big company. In my country, the salary + benefits for the role is great enough for a fresh graduate. Heck, getting a job at all is amazing. But naturally, I want to utilise my degree and all of the extra effort I did to get into data analytics/engineering. I've been applying to internships (because I don't have prior experience) and had some offers but I felt like I should be doing more and getting real jobs. 

My concerns are (if i get the role at the good company):
1) will there be much career progression? I'm not the biggest career driven person but I believe I should be earning more every year. 
2) is it a good move to go for tech internships, so I will get experience? Some of the places I've interviewed in had tasks like ticketing issues and not exactly hardcore stuff 
3) Can I do the shift later into a permanent role with better career prospects after being in the first role for a while? I don't mind having extra money saved up for a bit before pursuing other opportunities. It won't be related fields though.
4) Some older people had said that the first role determines your next pay, so its apparently very crucial to have a ""above market"" first salary.

Honestly I'll appreciate any thoughts, I'm so new to all this and I'm trying my best to ""succeed"" this job/career game."

ydqxgj,0,2022-10-26,My Loan Was Approved For An Un-liveable Amount...,UpAHillToTheRight,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ydqxgj/my_loan_was_approved_for_an_unliveable_amount/,"TLDR: My loan amount was approved for way less than even my rent for my off-campus apartment, much less for all the other costs associated with living. I'm writing an appeal regarding cost of living but I could use some advice/guidance regarding how to go about asking for more, and how to factor what they did approve me for into my figure. 

So in summary, my college is agreeing to give me only about 1/2 of my requested loan amount which hovered somewhere around $6,000. Please be aware, this money was going to be used towards rent (a little over half that), transportation costs, my laptop, and of course, food/household supplies. I.e., everything a person would need to subsist with an employment status of student and a full time internship alongside 4 classes as well. I literally cannot get a part time job of any kind this semester. I just don't have the hours in my day between my classes and internship. 

This loan is very late in the process because I had extreme difficulties acquiring it to begin with, but that still doesn't negate the fact that I owe my landlord the full amount. We both agreed and had it in good faith that I would pay him the full sum of money owed when I received my student loan check, however I still haven't gotten it and he is getting frustrated/pushy. -Understandably so. 

I did receive a refund from financial aid (FASFA) and I've been living off of that as well as money borrowed from friends/family. My laptop was very expensive, however it was one of the few ones they had left in stock at the place I purchased it from. It has features I never wanted/needed, but obviously was skipped over by others because of its price tag. I purchased this on a charge card with the store, and was told by the financial aid office this would be covered by the loan (hopefully). This IS why I'm requesting a bigger amount for my loan (not even an absurd amount in my eyes) as I wanted to use it to pay for my laptop to begin with, as well as some living expenses. And just so it's known, on-campus meal cards start at over $1000, so what I'm asking to subsist off of is far less than what they charge. 

This is where I get into the heart of my questions: Is what they approved me for going to my cost of living, or is it going towards rent? I am going to call Financial Aid with these questions, but I wanted to ask anyone on this thread who may have experienced the same issue. 

If what they approved me for was cost of living expenses, then I shouldn't (hopefully) have any trouble getting the amount approved as it would go towards rent, correct? If what they approved me for WAS supposedly going to off-campus living, which I did put on my application, how do I go about requesting more for cost of living/laptop purchase? 

(I do feel the need to justify my laptop purchase as it is really a necessity for a student. I have online textbooks I need to purchase for classes, homework to do on them, emails, assignments such as writing or graphic design programs, etc. These are things I wouldn't have access to if I was limited to using campus computers.)

I got myself into this mess because my last 2 semesters were done with on-campus living and I found that the money I needed to borrow for it was too high. This is why I opted for off-campus living as I could save thousands of dollars by doing so. Now, even though my total for this semester is going to be thousands of dollars cheaper, they still will not give me the necessary amount even if it is less than last semester which is just absurd. It almost feels like they are punishing me for choosing off-campus living because I'm not giving them my money for housing. For reference, my dorm for last semester was like $4500, and my meal plan was like $1200 (this was the lowest one btw and only bought me 5 meals a week!!!!). Additionally, parking was like $100. So in total, this was $5,800. 

I hope this all makes sense and some people can help me go about asking for the money. On one of the forms it listed transportation costs, parking, and money for food were not things I could ask for in a cost of attendance appeal, but I was told to ask for it anyway because ""it can't hurt"". What can hurt, I will say, is not approving me for anything to live or eat off of because it's not with the University. 

Neither one of my parents went to college and I really feel like I'm stuck with trying to figure this mess out by myself. One of my parents has been helping me as much as they can with loans, but they really don't know much else to do. They can't give me advice with what to do at all because they have no idea how to go about it themselves. Please, anything will help! Thanks!"

Going into school I, like most, didn't know what I wanted to do but still wanted to pursue higher education even if I didn't know what I wanted to end up doing specifically. To that end picked a versatile and high-demand degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Now here I am in my senior year and I don't feel like I know what I am doing career-wise. I have had 3 internships, 2 business, and 1 engineering as I wanted to get a feel for both. I never felt satisfied or excited about anything I was doing for any of the internships. I thought the idea of some of the projects I worked on were intriguing, and they certainly look good on a resume, but the work itself was never satisfying to me. I don't feel drawn toward any specific career path beyond pay at this point. I have offers coming in for a few engineering jobs I applied for but I don't know if it is a good idea to accept an offer for something I'm not truly invested in. 

Is it worth it to take an offer for something you don't feel like you want to do long-term?

ydrhj9,3,2022-10-26,stressed out kid who broke the promise of never going to A2A ever and going to talk about life and ranting,FakeFruityFeet,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ydrhj9/stressed_out_kid_who_broke_the_promise_of_never/,"Hi,

Basic shit: just turned 18, asian male, divorced dad (more than 100k), and mom is in California and housing status is still confusing to me. 

Right now: common app nowhere done at all (actually crappy PS and 0 supplementals) but top early is REA Stanford. Thinks he might have ADHD but also knows it's not good to self-diagnose on the whole internet. 

Reflections on life about wealth status and such: 

* it's hard to be appreciative of what you have provided, especially going to a competitive school. My dad does make enough for us to live and he did instill some kind of work ethic in me, but I just can't help but feel frustrated that he could have done more and that I should've had the initiative to look out for these things. 
   * Throughout my childhood, there's only a few places constant in my life: home, my grandma's house, school, and the fucking YMCA (for showers and gym). In the summers, my brother and I would be stuck at our grandma's house with a computer and nobody else but my grandpa who has a chronic addition to TV (thank god they have a dog). No summer camp. No ""enriching"" experience. Not even friends cause I didn't know anyone in the area. 
   * My dad is a conservative man. What I mean by that is risk-taking isn't really a thing for him. I have no older sibling. My dad does have a degree from the state university and from JHU but in terms of actual college advice beyond ""x university is a great school"" he's not very helpful.
      * And this relates to me--why haven't I researched this shit myself. Answer: I didn't fucking know. I switched in the middle of the sophomore year and basically panicked for a whole year and ended up doing a bunch of random shit that isn't the most coherent for capps. I felt that freshman year I was literally trying to exploring as many things that I can but when the pandemic hit I didn't know where else to look. I was trying to find new interests and friends and all that jazz (at that point, I have never been on a sports team or even a hobby, especially having quit sax after an atrocious middle school band director --- basically I came into high school directionless and entered the pandemic directionless and lacked the resources to find a direction)
      * addendum----my one fucking regret out of all this is why I haven't been researching this shit myself and asking more people like the counselor or even watching youtube videos and sticking to them?? I guess it's a me problem. Throughout the pandemic I had no way of communicating but via Discord on a FUCKING chromebook (phone got broken by dad) with the few friends I had. Discord was literally my only outlet ---- it was the fucking YMCA but not anymore then. I'm not a huge gamer boy but discord was where all my friends (out of the friends a couple were close and actually really really helpful).
      * addendum addendum---being stuck with the same three people sucks especially if two out of the three are hotheads (i'm less but I get more unresponsive during a conflict). I remember each other getting pissed over small shit--for example, I had long hair and every time my dad looked at me he was pissed and told me I looked homeless and it also usually instigated more conflict, given an initial conflict NOTHING related with the hair. 
      * In short: pandemic was hell for me. Stuck with the same three people. Did not know where to look (or even having the confidence to just ask anyone any-how). Luckily had few friends that basically listened. 
   * Junior year: basically I thought I knew what I was doing but I didn't. 
      * Joined a couple more clubs. In an ideal world, I could've had 3+ board positions but I currently have 0. 
      * For further context of my self-perception, I actually won secretary for speech and debate but I ended up rejecting that position because a) I thought it would be a lot of work b) I was underconfident (i.e. I did speech virtually --&gt; I really have no experience in speech (I qualified for something but it was kind of small) --&gt; discussed with board --&gt; rejected position)
      * anyone reading this, CONFIDENCE IS EVERYTHING PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS 24/7 NO ONE IS BITING YOU
   * So far, do I have the right to be mad? I know I know I know I CANNOT BE REGRETTING anything but it's so fucking hard not to.
   * ok there's more shit but I can't remember
* Current status:
   * Just returned from flight from Cali visiting Stanford and Berkeley. But please do understand: I was my first flight. Ever. In my whole life. I went by myself. 
      * I had to fight to fly to Cali. My mom had asked me during the summer but my dad would not let me. It's a combo of family conflict and suspicion and yadda yadda. I finally was able to go, but after gauging my dad's reaction after faking that I already booked a ticket
      * I realize there are people who are just like me and haven't flown before. I looked it up and it said that less than half the population haven't flown in the last year. 
      * Right now, I am filled with both despair (common app) and motivation (from an internship at JHU APL i applied and was able to get istg it was not bc of nepotism but bc ironically my application was the ""less bio"" out of ""bio/chem"" and ""comp sci"" applicants) 
      * I went to Stanford and had the most confidence I never felt before in my life. Everyone is so nice (and good looking -- I suspect applicants are the most social and out there and sociability is definitely related to attractiveness). I remember particularly asking a question in a lecture (i stumbled across launchpad) and just made my mark (if you are reading this and remember me please say hi) 
   * The highlights of my current application is that I have two internships.... one that is JUST about to happen (school of pharamacy) and a semi-continuation of the former (different mentor and different topic because I was able to ask around and network -- I will never stop saying networking because it's how you get places ---- I have personal advice on that that I might even write a whole PS about)
* Ok so there's a lot on this post but maybe I should do a tl;dr

Frustration and Regret:

* Parents: wealthy? terrible parenting? just ok? 
* Low confidence and not asking around
* Despite wealth on paper, I don't feel I had that many resources (prior my asking every single person I see phase) 
* Not exploring more (or exploring too much): stick to one thing and grow on it and then add more. also cut things after doing it twice and not liking it. I have a love-hate relation with speech and debate.
* Writing a long ass reddit post but not my common app

Outlook:

* I could be fine. 

Ok but a question I do have for y'all: how should I word my current internships? They are pretty significant to me but it's a little too late but I do believe this is my passion (for at least right now--- maybe I find to despise wet lab)

thanks for listening."

I am an international student and I have recently been accepted by the 23 Fall SYDE Meng program, so I have a few questions.

1. Is it easy for a SYDE Meng student to seek software related jobs? My bachelor degree is Computer Science, and I have 2-3 years of working history in tech companies. And I plan to look for software jobs after graduation from the program.
2. The program does not offer co-op option, so is there any possibility for me to seek internship at the last semester if I finished all the courses in the previous three semesters?
3. I heard that in the 1st semester I can transfer to the ECE program, which included more software related courses. Is that possible?"

I recently switched to Computer Science and thus, don't have any software engineering experience outside of personal projects. I wrote a generic cover letter template that I've been using to apply to most jobs and have been adding a paragraph specific to companies if it's a position I'm particularly interested in. I've been struggling with getting interviews so I would really appreciate any feedback. Thanks!

Cover Letter:

Dear \[Company name\],

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

I am currently a student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Computer Science. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to learn many computer science skills both in and out of university. At Berkeley, I‚Äôve taken data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture and am currently taking an IOS mobile development course.

Outside of school, I‚Äôve learned Frontend development through a myriad of sources: I took an online course on React.js, and used that knowledge to build a personal project of mine. As well, I self-taught myself React Native by building a passion project, The Adventure Scroll, that I designed from scratch. I‚Äôm particularly passionate about building things and seeing the resulting impact on the customer experience.

Last summer, I interned as a product manager at an augmented reality startup. Getting to talk with customers and iterate product features and designs was a really satisfying experience, and something I think will help me as a software engineer because I have learned to understand how to build for the customer. In addition, I have a UI/UX design background, as I have wire-framed many apps on Figma for myself and others.

I believe I‚Äôm a good fit for this position because I have both specific experience that will give me a direct leap ahead and experience in surrounding fields that will enable me to present a unique opinion.

Thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I keep getting this impression that these are two different worlds. 

First of all, here, to even consider FAANG as internship is pretty uncommon. Most people choose small, local companies or companies such as Nokia or Capgemin. 

Second of all, the courses taught. Here, curses that we have are web development, IoT, Linux, data bases etc. But it seems that in the USA there is more pressure on math, algorithms and data structures? 

So, is it true? What courses do you have, how do u learn the technical stuff (technologies)?"

I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. People around me wouldn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm from a conservative country wherein most people don‚Äôt take mental illness seriously- it‚Äôs taboo. Say you‚Äôre feeling down, and they‚Äôll say you‚Äôre just looking for attention. Another reason why I know they won‚Äôt understand me: I came from a very privileged background. I‚Äôm an only child to 2 very successful people. I had everything I wanted and needed, and more. I‚Äôm already 27 and I haven‚Äôt worked a day in my life (well except for an unpaid internship for 2 years) and to be honest, i could live comfortably &amp; unemployed with my trust fund alone. I know they will say how shallow I am.

I‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts since I was around 17. It comes and goes - usually something monumental happens that I feel like I was given another chance, then I‚Äôll be okay and feel normal again. This time, I see no future. 

I finished medical school. I was about to take my licensure exam a few months ago but something came up. My parents who are both doctors do not understand this delay. A few weeks ago I learned that my mom told her colleagues that I was just making excuses for the delay, etc. She actually told everyone who asked. I accidentally saw a conversation, then read about 2 group chats and a few direct messages. I felt numb, embarrassed. These people were supposed to be my future colleagues. People who I hoped to be trained by. People who held high positions in hospitals I planned to apply to. Now they have formed an opinion about me and I haven‚Äôt even started yet. I know I can‚Äôt face them again without thinking of what they have said about me.

Now I don‚Äôt care anymore. I feel like all the motivation I had vanished in an instant. I find it hard to think about the future. I have asked myself what I see in 10 years and the answers the same: nothing. I think that‚Äôs too long to be alive. All the suicidal ideations I had when I was younger came back.

The problem is I only took my first coding class as a sophomore (switched from poli sci) + took gap year to do internships, so I'd be graduating in 2.5 years. I feel like this means I'm missing out on a lot of foundational classes like cs162, and I'm worried this will bite me in the back down the road. I also feel like I'm getting rushed through the whole process without enough time for exploration.

At the same time, I feel like the tech recession might get worse and it might be better to lock down a job. (although given that the startup is in a very unstable industry, it might be better to do internship...?) Especially since I interned this summer at a company that didn't give return offers to a vast majority of interns despite the fact that I thought it was stable, I'm worried this might happen again.

A little background on me: I'm a woman who was diagnosed w/ ADHD at 32 (went for an eval. after returning to finish college and nearly falling flat on my face, again). I started my meds and made it through school by the skin of my teeth (pro tip: Vyvanse does not make up for a lifetime of terrible study habits, especially when you *actually need it*).  


I'm now a software engineer who's been in the industry for 6ish years (2 as an intern &amp; 4 full time). I know that my ADHD effects my work, but I've never asked for any kind of accommodation because A) I hate asking for things and B) I can't think of anything reasonable that might actually help me. But, now that I'm trying to make the push to senior level I'd like to think of things that might make my job just a little easier for me while I pile more responsibilities onto my plate.  


I'm hoping that hearing about some of your asks might give me an ""Ah-ha!"" moment. Anyone out there in a similar industry that has had to make requests? What are your main issues and how have your employers helped you to solve / work through / around them?"

I'm extremely grateful for this job but I almost envy the 10 hour days of working at a car wash in highschool with people around my own age because we actually had things in common and shared interests / could hang out outside of work.

I'm in the wholesale industry rn, Would working in finance or marketing analytics be a more suitable place to be around young driven data people? Am I just being entitled?

Pretty much I currently have an offer from Amazon for a solutions architect intern role. I make this post because I think after graduation, I‚Äôd like to do SWE (though I‚Äôm not 100% set on this). However, I haven‚Äôt done much leetcode and can only really confidently solve some mediums which I doubt will be enough for me to land an offer similar to the one I currently have. Regardless of that, I haven‚Äôt been getting many OAs besides from companies that send everyone OAs.

Pretty much the way I see it, I have two options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Grind leetcode like crazy and try to get a 2023 summer SWE internship; I‚Äôd consider this because I‚Äôve been told that a non-SWE role at amazon probably won‚Äôt help me much with future job search. However, I‚Äôm not too sure of this because I feel like it‚Äôs already a bit too late and I have a pretty busy schedule with university already so my grades would probably tank. I‚Äôm also a student-athlete so I have to dedicate a certain part of my day to practice. 
2. End my job search for summer 2023; take the amazon offer and focus on improving my resume for the rest of this school year (projects, classwork) and do some leetcode. I think if I take a pretty difficult course load next semester I could realistically hope to land a Fall 2023 SWE internship (after doing a lot of leetcode this summer). I think this option is pretty appealing to me because Fall internships are generally (I think?) less competitive so I might have a bit more luck than I‚Äôve had this semester.

On paper it sounds like a sweet deal, I get to finish on average time with a fancier degree and save money by taking grad courses for undergrad tuition. I just can't help but wonder if it's worth the extra year as opposed to entering the workforce; or if a masters is even necessary.

Little bit of a specific scenario that I do not want to mess up or give a bad second impression. Internally, I'm between approaching this 2 different ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background: Last summer, I had an internship at a place that I like and that seemed to like me. I am interested in returning to the company when I graduate in the Spring, but want to be in a different department that better suits the career path I desire to have, is more tailored to my skills and the skills I want to learn, and is in the area of my degree.

\- I was in a different business area from where I would like to end up if hired full time (similar example for context: being in a role like Customer Relations where you interact with customers a lot, but wanting to end up in Sales. Same general idea, completely different application of the skills used).

\- I had an hour and a half meeting with a boss-level person, that does the hiring for the team I want to be in, near the end of my internship. I have his contact info and will be reaching out to him about this. He knows, and was brought into the company by, the C-Level exec overseeing my old team, who said he wanted me to come back after graduating. However, it won't be a department the C-Level is in charge of. I did meet the C-Level in that area and am connected with all of the above on LinkedIn. I feel like I could leverage the being on great terms with the C-Level but don't want to set the wrong tone by name dropping him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm conflicted whether to approach with, like, straight up ""I want a job on your team in the Spring, what would you recommend I do to achieve that goal"" or more along the lines of requesting an informational interview (which, to be honest, I would have no idea where to go from there).

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a sophomore pursuing my BSCS (B.S. Computer Science) degree with an expected graduation date between 2024-2025 (more on that later). I am also working as a part-time security officer on the weekends with some side shifts that I plan on using as work experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am currently not applying to that many internships as before, but I am confused as to what I should be doing in preparation for the summer. I was thinking of either traveling abroad, going to school &amp; graduate early (hence 2024), or going for an internship, or do one of the three. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the internship experience, I do not have that many ""professional"" experience except for a brief stint on working at my campus IT department. My goal is to graduate as early as I can while also getting the most experiences I can get. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I think it is unlikely I will nab any internships from this time frame in October-November as I haven't applied that much and I haven't heard back from most of them. I am also probably not going to consider traveling abroad as the cost is asinine to me (about $2,350 for everything, plus plane tickets, hotel reservation, etc.), so my last option is most likely to continue working as a part-time security officer, while going to school for the summer, and then hope for the best in applying to new-grad positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I, of course, would like to hear your opinion on this, and what I can do so to make the best out of my professional experience."

If I stick with college, I should be able to keep computer science in as a minor, and am questioning if majoring in mathematics or information science would still allow me to get a coding career.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** What is the next best college major for finding a job in coding other than Computer Science?"

yecjqf,1,2022-10-26,Should I stay or should I go? Advice needed on whether I should relocate to a new state.,BigYeet1996,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yecjqf/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_advice_needed_on/,"For the past year, I have wanted to move to a neighboring state. I had lived there previously, as I had attended a college in the state for a year, but had to move back to my home due to unforeseen financial concerns. After graduating last year with my bachelors, the idea of moving back kept creeping into my head. I have many good friends and my sister and her husband living there, and my parents are planning on retiring there in a few years as well. While I don't hate where I currently live, I have been here for the vast majority of my life, and would like a change. The problem is, moving to the neighboring state is proving more difficult than I anticipated. 

This past year, I did a paid internship with a nonprofit, hoping to save some cash and bolster my resume. Nearing the end of my internship, I started sending out job applications in the neighboring state. While I did get some interviews, nothing panned out. To what I thought was a stroke of luck, my manager said that he could hire employees in neighboring states, as we are working remotely, and I jumped at the opportunity to take the position. Having gotten settled into the position, I revisited the neighboring state, which confirmed my desire to live there. Unfortunately, less than a week after apartment hunting, our CEO noted that we would be moving to a hybrid model in the spring and be expected to come into the office, with very few details about what this would entail. 

Clearly things aren't panning out the way I was hoping. I would still love to move to the neighboring state. But with the distance between my employer and where I would live, this might make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain my job. Add into the mix a possible recession next year and my high, sometimes debilitating anxiety, moving at this moment seems very risky. However, I can see myself happy in the long run, and I don't see much of a future in where I live currently. The cost of living is very high, I only have a handful of friends here, and my parents are likely to move in a few years. However, my job is located here, I don't hate it, and I would be much less likely to fall into a paralyzing spiral of anxiety. 

What do you think? Should I take the risk and move out to chase my dreams? Or would I be better off playing it more conservative at this point and plan on relocating at a later date? Any advice is appreciated!"

yef7oo,1,2022-10-26,How difficult would it be to figure how to write a script to extract data from an android app if I know general programming but have no experience with programming mobile apps in particular?,dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yef7oo/how_difficult_would_it_be_to_figure_how_to_write/,"To be specific, there's an obscure fitness app that I want to extract my heart rate data from into an Excel sheet.  The app itself has no built in method to do this and, while I can play around with premade extraction tools and try to find something that works, I wondered if it might be easier just just write something myself.  How complicated would it be to that?  I'm competent at writing console apps in C/C++ (I completed an 8 month firmware engineering internship), and I've done a bunch of data analysis amd visualization in R and Python in several courses, so I'm not a newby to programming, but I haven't done any actual app development or really tried to do anything coding related with mobile apps before. 

Given that background, is this task something I could reasonably figure out how to do own my own in maybe a few days time, or would I need to learn a whole bunch of stuff about mobile app development and/or the Android OS in particular?  Basically, just how big of a rabbit whole would I be digging myself into if I attempt this?  I wouldn't be opposed to spending a bit of extra time (maybe a week or two) figuring it out, as this type of script is something I've wished I knew how to write previously and I expect it will come up again in the future, but I don't have a whole lot of time to devote to it right now, so I don't want to start digging too deep of a hole."

yegewf,866,2022-10-26,"How to Survive College - but seriously, how do you manage to make dinosaurs boring???",fainting--goat,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yegewf/how_to_survive_college_but_seriously_how_do_you/,"Let‚Äôs recap.  It‚Äôs been a little bit since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xyjhib/how_to_survive_college_the_old_and_the_new/).  [If you‚Äôre new here](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/), I grew up in a small town with a campground that some of you are very familiar with.  I worked there through highschool with nothing unremarkable happening until after graduation.  My boyfriend was killed, the future I thought I was doomed for vanished, and I decided to take my life in my own hands and go to college instead.

I thought about writing something insightful about how we can‚Äôt escape our pasts, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here.  I brought my past with me in the form of ties I can‚Äôt bring myself to sever and as knowledge most people don‚Äôt have and don‚Äôt want if they know what‚Äôs good for them.  And what‚Äôs happening at my college isn‚Äôt like what I grew up with.  It‚Äôs different.  It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve been swaddled here into this cocoon so that in four years we might emerge as something new.  And the college and the *things* contained within are also changing into something new.  A process that started before I arrived and now I‚Äôm just wandering through the ravine and marveling at how much the river has worn away and how much further it has to go before the landscape is irrevocably changed.

I wish I could say that after finishing my freshman year everything settled down, but that‚Äôs not how these things work.  I‚Äôm not naive.  When I returned home for a short break before the start of the fall semester, I already knew that when I went back to campus I‚Äôd be marked.  I had a bargain with the devil and I‚Äôd traveled into the depths of the traveling river and returned.  These things can‚Äôt be set aside so lightly.

But at least I had a brief reprieve back in my hometown.

Hah.

If only.

The town‚Äôs gossip network got to work spreading the news that I was home.  After two days, the parents of my ex-boyfriend showed up at my house.  Not Steven.  The *very* ex-boyfriend.  There‚Äôs been rumors spreading in my absence because this is a small town and of course there were.  His disappearance was suspicious enough but then I went to college, which is not something people in this town commonly do.  With no prior interest?  Against the wishes of my mother?  But no, it couldn‚Äôt be because I‚Äôm trying to get away from this stupid fucking town, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm *guilty* of something.  Surely I *know* what happened or - gasp - might even *be involved*.

Which I guess I do know something, but what am I supposed to say?  Oh your golden child wasn‚Äôt really all that great and apparently there was a lot more going on with him than even I knew about, because Krampus saw fit to make a personal appearance and strangle him to death before dragging his corpse away to some wintery hellscape.

No one will believe me.  Or at least, his parents will never believe me, and I have no desire to be hounded and blamed by these people every time I come home to visit my mom and my siblings.

Because they‚Äôre borderline accusing me of being the reason he disappeared and all I did was try to have a future of my own and not join them in their life of misery and mourning.  We weren‚Äôt even married.  I‚Äôm realizing that I didn‚Äôt even like him as much as I thought I did.  My life isn‚Äôt over because my boyfriend died when I was 18.

Maybe the devil knew what he was doing in keeping me out of that community college that was closer to home.  I need to be an inconvenient distance from this place.

So they showed up on the front door when only myself and my youngest sister were home.  I opened the door because I felt I should.  I figured they were only there to ask how I was doing, as that would be the polite thing to do for someone that presumably was important to the deceased, right?

Oh no.  They showed up to start *drama*.

‚ÄúDid you take him with you?‚Äù his mother demanded, growing increasingly hostile as I repeated over and over that I didn‚Äôt know what happened to him.  ‚ÄúHe left his car behind.  Someone had to drive him.  Did you leave him somewhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt the sheriff tell you everything?‚Äù I sighed wearily.  This was going to go nowhere.

‚ÄúBut where is he?!  Is he at - at that *school*?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe told him he needed to take over the business,‚Äù his dad rumbled.  ‚ÄúThat it was time he grow up and stop daydreaming.‚Äù

Oh my GAWD I hate this town sometimes.

‚ÄúIf he left,‚Äù I snapped, ‚Äúthat was his choice to make.  And he‚Äôs not at my school.  I haven‚Äôt seen him and I‚Äôm trying to move on.‚Äù

Then I shut the door in their faces.  Locked it for good measure.  I stood there, heart pounding, listening to the muted discussion taking place on the doorstep.  They finally decided to leave and talk to my mom over at the store.  Let her know what a disrespectful daughter she had.  Fine.  My mother and I might not agree on everything but we agreed on this at least.

My ex‚Äôs parents needed to mind their own damn business from here out.

I at least texted her to let her know they were coming.

Then I turned around to find my youngest sister staring at me from the end of the hallway.  She‚Äôd watched the entire confrontation.

‚ÄúThey suck,‚Äù I said, jabbing a thumb at the door.  She nodded solemnly.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been bothering mom too,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúWas he bad too?‚Äù

I sucked in a breath.  My youngest sister was the quietest of my siblings and she was also the most close-mouthed.  I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd tell anyone anything.

‚ÄúHe was,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHe vanished at the campground, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù

I asked her how she knew that and she said it was just a hunch.  I watched her carefully but she wasn‚Äôt meeting my gaze and I wasn‚Äôt certain if she was repeating what she‚Äôd heard somewhere or if this was her own idea.  Then I told her that yes, he did vanish at the campground.  And that she should stay away from there because even with an ancient being watching over it, it‚Äôs still dangerous.

You can‚Äôt leave some things behind, once they‚Äôre a part of you.

But it looks like I‚Äôm no longer going to be as welcome back home as I used to be.  It made going back to college easier, once move-in weekend rolled around.  This time my mom drove me.  She was disappointed that I hadn‚Äôt transferred to the community college closer to home, but she was making her peace with it.  Then, after she‚Äôd helped me carry my things into the dorm room (same one I had for the spring semester) she took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eyes.  We were standing by her car, parked by the curb, ignoring the harried volunteers that were trying to get people to unload and get out of there.

‚ÄúYou come back,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúYou have to keep coming back.  I can‚Äôt handle losing someone else.‚Äù

Like she‚Äôd lost dad.  I just nodded, urgently, trying not to cry and then we hugged and she drove away.

It feels surreal to be back here.  I was only home for a week but move-in felt like my first day all over again where everything was new and unfamiliar.  And there‚Äôs all these buildings and landmarks that I know but I‚Äôve been seeing them mostly empty all summer and now they‚Äôre filled with people and everything has changed again.

I feel incredibly lonely seeing all these people I don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm not sure why that is.

Cassie and I have picked up right where we left off.  She‚Äôs talking about internships already.  There‚Äôs a job fair early in the fall semester for her degree program and she‚Äôs making a list of which companies she wants to interview with, ranked by how much the internship pays.  I wish I had that kind of direction.  I‚Äôm still not sure if I picked the right major.  In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure I didn‚Äôt.  I just had to pick something, right, so I picked the one that fell in line with the classes I found interesting in my first year.

Yeah, I‚Äôm majoring in geology.  I don‚Äôt even know what you do with that kind of degree yet.  I‚Äôm telling myself it‚Äôs a placeholder until I get the rest of my life figured out.

No pressure.

I haven‚Äôt talked to Maria yet.  There‚Äôs been some messages in the Rain Chaser‚Äôs discord channel but I‚Äôve been ignoring it.  I actually uninstalled the app from my phone, late one night when the sky was overcast and my chest felt tight and I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep.  I want to keep going, just keep walking forward and not look back.  The eye is gone.  The dead students are forgotten by everyone else.  I don‚Äôt want to look back, I don‚Äôt want to think about it, I don‚Äôt want to talk to Maria.

This is how I feel.  Realistically, I know I can‚Äôt avoid it forever.  She deserves to know that the eye is gone and the students that were killed are at rest.  Besides, I need her help to distribute my flyers.  They‚Äôre nothing fancy.  Just a sheet of paper titled ‚ÄúHow to Survive College‚Äù and a list of the rules such as they are.  I printed them off campus and have enough to leave a stack of twenty in each dorm‚Äôs computer lab.  I just need people that can get into the labs and for that, I guess I need the Rain Chasers.

Let‚Äôs review the rules.

1. Don‚Äôt go outside when it rains.
2. If you fall asleep in class and no one is around when you wake up, stay at your desk. Pretend you‚Äôre taking notes. Don‚Äôt look up and don‚Äôt look around, no matter what you hear. You‚Äôll be returned to your classroom when it leaves.
3. Don't leave your laundry in the washer or dryer for too long. If you do and someone has folded it for you, put it away nicely. If you don't, the person that folded it for you will know and will come for you.
4. If you break campus rules and go into the steam tunnels, be aware of your surroundings. If you see where steam is leaking into the open air, run. Get out of the tunnels as quickly as you can. There's more than just steam down there.
5. If you get caught out in the rain‚Ä¶ you are not seeing things. There is something out there, between the raindrops. Get inside as quickly as you can.
6. Campus does not flood. If you see water beginning to accumulate any larger than a puddle, get to high ground as fast as you can. The river is coming for you.
7. If you‚Äôre in the steam tunnels and a door doesn‚Äôt open to where you expect, close it and open it again. It should lead you to the correct location on the second try.
8. If you absolutely must venture out in the rain, go in groups.  Do not be caught in the rain alone.  Similarly, never swim in the gym pool alone.  They hunt in packs and are looking for easy prey.

They don‚Äôt have everything, but those are the rules I felt most confident putting into print.  I can always put out updates.  I‚Äôll be honest - I feel silly with these.  Kate always complained about how they didn‚Äôt work but she kept doing it, so it must have had *some* effect, right?  And maybe it‚Äôll be different here because people are already passing what to do with the rain around by word of mouth.  I feel they take it more seriously.

But yanno?  Distributing these is a problem for another day.  For the first week I only wanted to focus on my classes and my new job (more on that in another post).

I‚Äôm taking more geology classes, obviously.  I have a class about dinosaurs and that sounds interesting, right?  It was even taught by a different professor than Mr. I-Believe-In-Stereotypes-But-Not-Monsters so it seemed like it was all going to turn out great.

Hah.

Hahahahahahhaaha.

I‚Äôm not sure how you make *dinosaurs* boring but this professor is managing to accomplish it.

It‚Äôs an early morning class.  Starts at 8AM, which is a special kind of hell in of itself.  But it gets worse.  It‚Äôs in a big lecture hall with like a hundred something students and we all file in and once we‚Äôre all seated he turns the lights off.  And turns on the projector.

And starts *droning*.

I just have so much regret right now.

Like most everyone, I suspect, I‚Äôm having trouble staying awake.  I‚Äôm doing my best.  It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs going out of his way to make it as difficult as possible, though.  Phones and laptops are banned and since the room is semi-dark, it‚Äôs easy to see who is breaking the rule.  I try to take notes but I‚Äôm kind of a shit note taker to begin with and it‚Äôs not enough to keep my brain engaged.  I‚Äôm just hoping this is one of those classes where you can read the textbook and be okay for the exams.

‚ÄòLet me guess,‚Äô you‚Äôre saying.  ‚ÄòYou fall asleep on the regular.‚Äô

Yes!

‚ÄòAnd when you do, something weird happens.‚Äô

Well, it was only the once so far.  But it was in the first week of the semester so that doesn‚Äôt bode well.

Something ran across my foot.  That was what woke me up.  The professor was still droning down at the front of the lecture hall.  I covertly glanced around to make sure no one had seen me startle awake, though I‚Äôm not sure they could have judged me for it, I‚Äôm sure they were all falling asleep as much as I was.  Everyone around me was quiet, watching the presentation or staring blankly at their open textbook or sleeping.

There was something odd about the floor, though.  The shadows were off, subtle, but enough to catch my eye and I took a harder look.

The ground was covered in tree roots.  They grew together in thick cords, reminding me of the tangled cables in a computer server room.  They ran down the stepped levels of the lecture hall, flowing steadily towards the middle, rarely branching, rarely veering.  Then they pooled around the podium, swirling to a thick knot right in front of the podium, and then branched out again towards the back wall and beyond.

I leaned over, pretending to look inside my backpack.  This could be another situation like the thing in the hallway and I felt it best to act natural until I understood what was happening.  But while I was bent over, I touched the tree roots.

They felt real enough.  Smooth and cold with a slight chalky texture.  I stared hard at them, trying to make out details as my eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness under the table, shielded from the glow of the unending presentation.  They were covered in lines like cracks, dark paths running perfectly parallel to each other, sometimes crossing over to form bridges between each track.  It reminded me of computer circuitry.

I was strangely calm.  There was a whole other world next to the college and sometimes it veered into ours, but there was always a way out.  That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been telling myself about the traveling river and the flooding library and the thing in the hallway and everything else.  There was always a way out.  I just had to be patient and wait for it to pass by.  The tide would recede and I‚Äôd be left here standing on the correct bank.

I straightened.  As I did, I glimpsed a dark shape on the underside of the desk.  A lump the size of a soccer ball.

I froze.  It did not.

It *unwound*.  A long, sinuous body uncurled, hundreds of legs clinging to the underside of the particleboard.  Its carapace shined as it caught the light of the projector and two antennas flitted in my direction, each as long as my forearm.

Look, there‚Äôs only so much a person can take and still remain calm and collected.  I apparently found my breaking point right then and there and that point is a giant ass bug monster inches from my face.

I screamed.  I threw myself away from it, falling out of my chair.  It reacted to the noise, skittering down the table leg as fast as thought.  I heard the click of its multitude of legs as it stretched out to its full length.  A yard long, at least, and as thick as an apple.

A millipede.  A giant millipede.

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù I shrieked, jumping onto my chair as it came at me, mandibles clicking spasmodically.  ‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME!‚Äù

I stood on my chair, hyperventilating as its head reached the chair leg and its body curved upwards.  I cast about desperately, trying to figure out where to flee, and then my eyes fell on my textbook.

It‚Äôs very heavy.  I seized it and threw it as hard as I could at the millipede.  The book struck it squarely on its body and simply fell to the side.

The creature, however, recoiled.  It hissed and then ran from me, swerving across the ground as it traveled up and down over the roots.  It reached the wall and began to flee up it.

Then I made the mistake of looking up.

The ceiling was covered in them.  A roiling mass of chitin and flashing antenna.

I next remember someone calling my name.  The person that sits next to me, staring up anxiously, repeating my name over and over.  Slowly, I looked around.  I was still standing on my chair.  Everyone was staring at me.  I opened my mouth, trying to speak.  Everything felt like it was happening so slowly and I didn‚Äôt know what had happened in the past few seconds.  Like my brain had simply turned itself off after seeing what was on the ceiling.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù my neighbor asked directly.

‚ÄúUh,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI saw a rat.‚Äù

A ripple ran through the students.  Everyone around me glanced under the table and I saw a couple of them pick their feet up off the ground and huddle on top of their chairs.  Finally, one particularly brave hero got up and made a thorough search before proclaiming the area was rat-free now.  I sat back down.  I didn‚Äôt put my legs under the desk.  I kept my feet up on the edge of the chair.  I wasn't the only one doing this so I guess they believed my excuse for panicking.

Throughout all this, the professor didn‚Äôt say anything.  He looked at me for a long, hard moment and then continued talking about the pikaia.  I sat there with my heart hammering, not really listening.  The incident had made sure I was *wide awake* but I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything anymore.

There was a touch at my elbow and I about jumped out of my skin.  At least I didn‚Äôt scream this time.  My neighbor slid me a note.  He jerked his head, indicating it came from someone else further on in the row, but no one was looking in my direction to fess up to who sent it.

I unfolded it.

‚ÄòI saw them too,‚Äô it read.  ‚ÄòThey weren‚Äôt rats.‚Äô

No one stopped to talk to me after class, even though I took my time packing my backpack to give them an opportunity.  I guess they wanted to get out of this room as fast as they could.  I kind of did too.  I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm going to keep going back to that classroom, after what I saw.

My delay gave someone else the opportunity to come talk to me, though.  The professor made his way up the aisle and caught my eye.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúOh, yeah, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I said nervously.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what I saw anymore.  I just thought something ran across my foot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, feel free to move if it makes you feel better.  There‚Äôs plenty of open seats near the front.‚Äù

Like hell I‚Äôd sit near the front.  I didn‚Äôt need him to see me drooling into my hand when I fell asleep again.  If I fell asleep again, that is.  But I thanked him for his consideration and said I‚Äôd think about it.  I left hurriedly, hoping the other student that witnessed the tree roots and the millipedes would be waiting for me, but the hallway was empty.

Alternative career paths for developers

I've been working full time as a back end developer ever since I completed my studies 3 years ago. I got fired for the second time a couple minutes ago during my performance review due to poor performance. I feel like I gave it a fair shot after 3 years but I guess this line of work simply isn't for me. Even after all this time working full time I've been outperformed by interns and new developers pretty much all the time. I simply can't catch up to cover the gaps in knowledge I currently have and I know that I cannot accomplish what an employer expects of a developer with 3 years of experience.

I've always been good with computers, networking and databases and whatnot but i feel like the skills I'm lacking are the skills needed for software development no matter what language or framework I'd end up working with.

That being said, what would be an ideal alternative career path. I'm asking because I know that switching language isn't the solution here. I can't the take the risk of learning a new language and ending up with the same result and waste some precious time when I already have bills pilling up. I was thinking of data analysis but I really need some other ideas. I heard that apparently some no-code/low-code framework like MS Power Apps are becoming more popular and wouldn't require going back to school but would it be possible to make a career out of it? I guess I don't really know what to do.

Thanks."

Kind of tricky situation.,geegol,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yeiorl/how_long_would_you_wait_to_apply_for_a_job_again/,"So me and my friend both work in IT. I was working an internship while he was working a help desk job at a different company. While I was working the internship I was debating on jumping ship but I decided to stay because I saw a post saying ‚Äúbe careful about jumping ship‚Äù. But in the details what he did was he recommended me and they sent an email to me I never responded. They sent another one that I did not respond to. About 2 months down the road after this had happened my manager fired me for being late (even though I was showing up to work doing nothing. But yes I should have been there on time lesson learned in a previous post) so I applied for that job my friend was working at. 

My friend told me his boss came up to him and said ‚Äúyour buddy applied I have his application up should I give him another chance?‚Äù My friend said ‚Äúit‚Äôs up to you‚Äù to the manager. 

Manager never ended up contacting me back. I‚Äôm currently working a different IT job. But I asked him today if I did apply would they give me another chance and he said probably not. 

So what I was thinking was stay at my current job and work there for at least 6 months then reapply to the company my friend is working at. Any advice would be helpful. 

The company I got fired from the internship I would go back to but they require 2 years of experience to get a permanent position and I‚Äôm coming up to around a year of experience."

I'm 24, don't have much knowledge of cs or tech-related things but I'm in a hurry to learn it asap.

I'm a little lost in life. Broke af and got nothing going on and just not happy. I have a useless bachelor's and I am not proud of it. Dropped out of my graduate program the first week and decided to enlist in the military for an opportunity to finance and earn some extra money and gain experience in the tech field. Initially, I wanted to get into cyber security but things didn't work out and probably won't due to things out of my control, and now I need a plan B.

My current plan:

1. Join the military to get the benefits and get away from my repetitive stagnant life. Choose a meh IT job and do a 2-year at Oregon State University Post-BS computer science program. The contract is probably 2 -4 years and I will at the very least know some basic help desk IT stuff while getting the benefits. After 2-4 years, I will reenlist with a 6-year contract to get experience in cyber. However, this is not guaranteed because of issues out of my control. I will not be able to get any internship during the service. And, there is no guarantee I can finish the 2-year program during enlistment because of military bs that takes up lots of time. My parents can also rent out my room because my parents are low-income and can at least can earn some extra money.

My other plan:

2. Join the military to get the benefits and get away from my repetitive stagnant life. Choose a likely shit job and do a 2-year at Oregon State University Post-BS computer science program. The contract is probably 2-4 years and I will at the very least know some basic help desk IT stuff while getting the benefits. I will likely finish my degree by then and possibly do other things needed in my free time that may build my portfolio because I think that can help with the experience. My parents can also rent out my room because my parents are low-income and can at least can earn some extra money. I will not be able to get any internship during this time. Assuming I do a 4-year contract, I can probably finish the 2-year degree. Would I be able to get a job in software engineering or cyber security?

3rd plan.

3. Skip the military. Reenroll back into my average university and pursue a computer science degree. My college may waive all the dumb general ed requirements that I've taken and just focus on the math and computer science courses. Hopefully, try to get an internship during the summer and try to do things in my personal free time and boost my portfolio. The internship is not guaranteed and I will have no tech-related experience. Worst-case scenario, do a coding BootCamp after I finish the degree. I will be heavy in debt.

So what do you think?

Again, if you can help me or guide me in the right direction to success, I would really appreciate it."

Hey everyone,

Location: Australia  
Seeking advice

Final semester of electrical engineering here. I am most likely going to fail an electric power systems course as 75% of the class including me failed test 1 and I barely eeked out a pass for test 2 (where 56% failed). I also feel insanely nervous about my honours thesis I recently submitted earlier this week even though I did most of the feedback suggested by my professor. I feel nervous as somehow I put wrong units in one of my graphs and it made it into the final copy. 

As such, I highly doubt that I will be able to pass university this year, and hence I will lose my space related graduate offer. I am highly passionate about space and as such, I am looking to restart and do a law degree. With this law degree, I aim to go into Space Law, of which Australia is seen as a global leader. While Australia is a laggard in the technical aspects of space, we are [leaders](https://law.unl.edu/space-telecom-law/woomera-manual-project/) in the law sector. 

I do have good high school results (91.45 ATAR) and I also have recently done a project management internship, which I hope can take me to where I want to go.

Is this a credible path to achieving my career aspirations?"
yek9ox,52,2022-10-27,I read my UIUC Grainger CS admissions file!,Foreign-Birthday-233,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/yek9ox/i_read_my_uiuc_grainger_cs_admissions_file/,"I saw the recent posts about people reading their UIUC admissions files, so I'm here to give some more insight as a sophomore.

First of all, I am very grateful‚Äîthe admissions officer who showed me my final decision mentioned I was admitted only 10 days before the decision release date. If any of you remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/x95dlk/i_viewed_my_uiuc_csstat_admission_file/), I was in the same position as them.

* **Major**: Computer Science (Grainger)
* **Applicant**: International
* **Stats**
   * **GPA**: 4.0 UW
   * **ACT**: 36
   * **Index**: 95 (They also have an index from 0-95 comparing you to all the other applicants with scores / grades)
   * Also numerical comparisons relative to your school and cohort in college, all above average
* **Classwork**: AP CSA, AP Physics C Mechanics and E&amp;M, AP Stats, APUSH, AP Euro, AP Spanish Lang
* **Extracurriculars**: Nothing too special, lots of robotics, a CS internship, volunteer teaching, some awards from school and chess competitions
* **Results (EA round)**
   * Officer 1: *Waitlist*, good stats and extracurriculars, but not much demonstrated societal goals
   * Officer 2: *Waitlist*, has potential, seems a bit scattered with no solid goal
   * Officer 3: *Admit* (the officer who showed me the file mentioned that they under-admitted in the EA round, so they had lots of space)

Overall, I did not see anything about my specific extracurriculars and awards (probably because I had nothing special there), but it seemed like the singular essay prompt (why Grainger and what are your future goals) was a big focus in their review of my profile. Unfortunately for me, my essay was absolutely trash at conveying my goals. I will definitely concede that after reading my short essay, I would not admit myself.

The main takeaway for me was that I shouldn't have rushed my short essay, especially since UIUC only took 1 short answer my year (I believe now it is 2 short essays &amp; a personal statement, which actually gives you leeway to elaborate on your ""societal"" ambitions and goals!) My essays for my regular round were definitely much more cohesive and showcased my ambitions. I applied and was accepted to Rice for CS with my ravamped essays, so I believe **the essays make a huge difference, even at a massive engineering school like UIUC.** Academics are not everything (which is what my officer said as well)!

Applied to specifically character design and Illustration. And I'm damn good at it should I say so myself. 

Before you read any further, 

This isn't a call for therapy. I need sound advise on what to do here. 
I do not need reassurance because I know I am good at what I do. 

------ 

I see my classmates get job placements and internships hand over fist while I struggle to even create a portfolio in that matter. 

Why? 

Because in my 4 years of communication design, not one second has been spent on educating me in my field of interest. And around this time.. It's too late to back out. 
I've asked the faculty and staff for some improvement in the curriculum to no avail. 

My entire motivation to draw or come up with anything has just become dulled and there is no particular reason other than the ""heck of it"" to even attempt to do something worthwhile. 

I am feeling lost, scared and pretty much uncertain writing this in a subreddit which I've never been to before. 
Most likely to get attacked for this too so I'm preparing myself. 

But I really need help. I can't approach anyone in real life anymore because no one gives a shit beyond their own interests or are too busy to do so. Thereby leaving me with wise words of ""you have to do it"".

What that... "" It"" is I have no idea. How to do ""it"" I have no idea. There is nothing to guide me with real experience. 

People just expect shit to happen and I am bloody scared of adding another thing in my list of failures to be the one thing I actually loved. 

What do I do.. Who do I reach out to? Everywhere I look for jobs it's about marketing or UI/UX which is blasphemy to even look at. (I am horrible with grids and digital understanding) 
If there IS a job opening, it's for people with a few years of experience. I have barely a project to show for it. (Something which took an hour extended for 4 months because of the company's incompetence) 

That's just it.. There is so much to live up to right now I feel like I'm stuck. There is zero progress. 
Should I just give up trying..?"

yel7f4,0,2022-10-27,How to sell in my CV my NOT successful entrepreneur experience?,JoSupertramp,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/yel7f4/how_to_sell_in_my_cv_my_not_successful/,"Hello,

2 years ago I decided to quit my job to be full time entrepreneur. Now retrospectively I can say it was a mistake. I shouldn‚Äôt have quit my job, or at least instead get a quiet job, to still have income and be employed until my business is working. Anyway, I will know for next time.

As you have guessed, my business is still not working, and I need to go back to work to have income. The thing is I don‚Äôt know how to sell my last 2 years entrepreneur experience. My last job was in international business development/operation, mainly following all the projects, orders, shipment and teams of the office. The business I tried (and still trying) to do is online marketing (for my own projects or for clients). It‚Äôs not directly related to my last jobs, but I did actually work in marketing products development before, but a long years ago.

I‚Äôm struggling about what to write in my CV:
- If I try to do what I was doing before, the recruteur will think I might be rusty for that work. Even if as an entrepreneur I had to handle projects, business, freelances, clients, problems, etc.
- If I try to get a position in online marketing, the reality is there are many specialized employees already, younger than me, with more experience for a specific tasks/positions. As an entrepreneur, I did everything at first to know about it, then give the tasks to freelances. So I know the job, but less than someone who worked years at the same particular position.
- What skills/experience are really useful to write in my CV? How to sell this experience? My business didn‚Äôt work, so it makes me feel I‚Äôm not legit, being an impostor, even if again I learnt and gained so many skills and experience the last 2 years. Yeah I learnt skills on online marketing, but I feel it‚Äôs not the most important, everyone could learn this. As a recruter I would value more the projects management, handle clients/freelances, develop a business from scratch, better organisation, understand and sense the global market and business, pressure, etc. But‚Ä¶
- ‚Ä¶ I still remember what my teachers at University told me when I wanted to do 2 internships in 2 different industries. They said it was a bad idea, because recruteurs won‚Äôt see stability in my choice, and companies want ultra specialized people. Entrepreneur is the opposite, it‚Äôs being generalist, at least at the beginning. So I feel that what I learnt is not what recruteurs need‚Ä¶ And in my professional life I did change industries few times, also switched from marketing to business development, management, etc.

Now I‚Äôm kind of lost, I feel paralysed, I‚Äôm scared to looking for job. Some day I don‚Äôt even know if I shouldn‚Äôt change my career path, I‚Äôm at that point!

If anyone would have advices for me, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks!"

Where and when do I go from here?,cheoso,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yenryk/usa_feeling_stuck_in_current_job_where_and_when/,"I started my current (and first) job in the beginning of 2022 and graduated from college a few months before. I have what I think is a pretty impressive resume. I started my own business in high school that made around 60k in around 5 years, did a year long ""internship"" as the CMO of a student organization abroad, completed a dual major, certificate &amp; minor in college, and so on. I was really struggling to find a job around graduation, and took a call center job for a financial company out of desperation. The job only consists of taking calls on people's financial accounts, but during training, I got a few financial licenses to be certified to do the job (SIE, Series 7, Series 63).

While there's nothing wrong with a call center job, it's just not for me. I don't enjoy being yelled at for issues that are not my fault and I'm starting to feel stuck. I'm: 1) not gaining many transferable skills outside of the call center ""industry"", 2) 3-5 years away from getting a job off of the phones, although I don't even want any of the non-phone jobs, 3) not able to build much of a network to help me in the future, and 4) competing against many other employees in the same/similar role(s) for the few non-phone jobs that I don't even want.

In terms of where I would go, I've thought of looking for something else in the Financial or Tech industry, or doing a masters abroad in Finance, Computer Science, or Math. I have a degree in Finance, took a few Comp Sci classes in college for my certificate, and am working on an algorithmic trading programing project that I could potentially use in my portfolio to find a tech job. The issue is that almost every job posting I find seems to want 2+ years of experience, even for entry level positions in Finance or Tech. I simply don't have that much experience yet, which makes it feel like a waste of time to even apply.

Looking at when to leave, I got a good relocation bonus that I would have to give back if I leave/get fired before the first year of employment. For that reason, I want to wait until being employed for at least a full year before leaving. If I want to look for a new job, it feels like I should leave right after a full year of employment, but if I wanted to do a masters, it starts to get a little harder to understand what would work best. I would also need to decide between starting one in fall of 2023 and 2024.

My main questions are mostly about where to go from this job, and when to leave.

Questions if I want to start a new job: Do I even have enough work experience to find another job easily? How would I sell this experience to a future employer? Is it really worth it to apply to jobs that I feel slightly under qualified for (ex: jobs wanting 2+ years of experience when I don't have it)?

Questions if I want to do a masters: Would it make sense to do a masters so soon after graduating? Should I try to get more work experience before going back to school?  If I started a masters in fall 2023, what I would do from the beginning of 2023, when I can quit, to September/October when it starts? Do I leave and find a new job for 6ish months? How bad would that look to future employers if I only had 2 jobs for 1 year and another for 6ish months with 2 companies? Do I stay until June/July and rough it out? If I started a masters in fall 2024, would it still look bad to future employers to have such a short employment history of 1 year and 1.5-ish years at 2 companies?

Would really appreciate any insight you may have as I'm completely lost on what my next move should be and when. Apologies as well for a longer post"

A little background information before I get to my question:

I just finished my master's degree in Business Informatics. (My focus areas were Business Analytics and Data Science) Before that, I did my bachelor's degree in Human Resource Management. Initially, I wanted to work in the field of HR Analytics to combine those two study fields. Unfortunately, in the area where I live there are no job offers for a position like this and I don't want to relocate. Now I received two potential job offers in consulting. Those two are:

No. 1) A consulting firm that is specialized on banking. Here I was offered a position in Data Management where I would work on solutions that are helping to ensure a sufficient data quality, meta data and overall data lineage. The good thing about this position is that I don't have to relocate and can work mostly from home. Also I would kind of work in my latest study field. The cons are:
- That I would have usually have to travel a lot (not right now due to Covid)
- I would have to do a lot unpaid overtime
- The overall salary is technically lower in comparison to the other offer (There is a bonus that is payed out once a year and my salary there + the bonus = salary from the other offer. For this bonus I need to accumulate around 1662 hours on client projects that the company can invoice)
- The work with a specialized software for their sector. Therefore, I don't think that I could transfer the knowledge from this job entirely to future jobs.
- I have the feeling that all the exists would lead me to join some bank or something like that.

No. 2) Would be a SAP HCM consulting position in a corporation. Currently, they are planning to implement and/or update their time management module in all their subsidiaries world wide.

- I would not have to travel to the subsidiaries. I just have to travel to the office in my country once or twice a week(with a total travel time of around 3 hours per day) and the rest of the week I can work from home.
- I would work in a field that would combine my bachelor's and master's degree and also a field where I probably could later on have a easier time finding work in my home town, if I choose to leave the company.
- Generally working in a Corporation where I could maybe switch positions internally.
- Better base salary and additional benefits than 1) (but no bonus)
- I really like the international aspect of it and it would also boost my profile when I work in a global context.

The cons:
- It's the HCM module of SAP, which is a on-premise solution (software is installed onto the computer). SAP is pushing their cloud services very heavily so therefore I'm afraid that I will lose my employability when I start working with HCM
- I would probably abandon my chance to ever work in HR Analytics because I would not do any data-driven work
-  My CV would have another strange position change (starting from working experience in recruiting to an internship in machine learning then a short student job as agile coach and now this)

I have a tendency for the 2nd offer but I'm afraid that I would negatively effect my future employability with this. And I need to take one of this job offers right now because I can't financially afford to wait anylonger. 

Does anybody have any advice for me?

I would appreciate any input :)"

The internship was my dream internship and I hoped I would be able to continue in the company afterwards. I truly think the past 4 months have been the best in my recent life so far. 

Unfortunately they do not have a position in the current location, but they have one overseas (7h time difference, 9h hour flight).

I went through the process because the job seems amazing, the city incredible and it would allow me to stay in the company. In my field, it is rare to have a position like that right after finishing school. Also my contract would offer me good advantages.

My managers were behind me the whole time and even directly recommended me to the other team. 

And now I am terrified. It is so far away, and for 1 year I would be alone, far from family and friends. I know I would be able to meet other people there, from my nationality as well but now I am so filled woth doubt. 

I know part of my doubt is also due to meeting someone amazing and I am trying to not take that into account as it's really recent but I can't really say how much of that is bothering me. 

I know it would be an amazing experience, great for my r√©sum√© and for my bank account as well. The team seems great but I am so scared. 

I have already said pre-yes and I have 6 days to give my final written answer. 

I have just so much trouble being sure of my decision. My life is so great right now as is, I have difficulty accepting so much change. 

Could anyone give me advice on next step ? Or opinion on the situation ? 

TLDR : got an amazing overseas job opportunity and cannot manage to be happy about it"

Started my job hunt since the start of semester (this is my final semester) but all I gotten are rejection emails and a lot of ghosting, interview opportunities have basically been non-existent, and I didn't even get past the resume screening stage. I thought that it could be an issue with my resume, so I approached my career advisor in school. Surprisingly, he felt that there was generally nothing wrong after he had a look at a few of the resumes I sent out (I tailor my resume for every job submission) and even shocked that I can't get certain roles that are rather niche but perfect for me as it is my area of specialty. It is quite depressing when everyone around me is saying that by right, I should be getting some offers as my grades are in the high first-class honours range on top of having 2 internships and a few freelance roles in related sectors to what I am applying. I don't know what else I can do as I have sent resumes to over a hundred places (both private and public), and I am running out of places that I can apply to. It is not like I can even sign on as I am not medically fit. It feels such a scam when my friends apply for the same roles with a much weaker resume and get interviews and eventual offer, but I can't even get an interview.

On top of that, I been using dating apps for the past 3 years but haven't had much luck. Matched with over 100 girls but been ghosted by most of them. It is hard to even get to the meetup stage because every time I mention of possibly meeting up (after 1 month of talking), they just suddenly never reply ever again. Sometimes, I don't even know what I did wrong that got me ghosted.

It kinda is depressing when I am not just ghosted by girls but companies too. It felt like I been putting in so much effort for nothing. It is not like in academics where I do get rewarded for putting in the hours and I am just not used to seeing hours and hours of effort going to waste. It doesn't help that I been sacrificing my academics this semester just to apply for spend more effort on applying for jobs because it just makes me feel much worse that I am just not capable enough. Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed or what kind of attitude I should adopt that could help me cope better?"

I was wondering if someone has already had experiences with this issue.
So just some background info: I have a Bsc in Business from Germany. Through self-studying (udemy, bootcamp)  and internships in the field of IT, I was able to land a job as a consultant at a consulting company. My role is in the field of software engineering, not as a developper but more of a technical coordinator ( Note that my official role is consultant, with no field specification this will be important later on). I also tested software although at a superficial level. 
After approximatelly a year, i got to know more about the client system and was asked to support the test engineers in their work because i have specific knowledge that would take a new employee months to acquire. So now about 2 years later, I have learnt Linux, Cybersecurity, Networking, Software Testing etc..  Since the field I am working in is a very niche field, it is not to find new employees, so my client is now asking me if I would like to work for them directly and that I would fit in several positions. 

This is where my problem comes in:  the position would be a technical position and I only have a business degree. The positions would be something like test engineer, software quality manager usw... 
The pre-requisite for applying for a work permit in germany is having ""appropriate qualifications"" for the job, mainly a uni degree in a related field. So now I find myself in a dilemna, where I might lose the job offer if i don't take it or risk my current job if the work permit does not get issued for being ""unqualified"". 

Has anyone had similar experiences? Do you know if job experience would count as a qualification? Or maybe someone went through the process themself and could tell us more about it.

Btw, the ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde lady said she doesn't know. They apparently decide in Berlin and she has no infos regarding the grounds for application rejection. 

Would love to hear from you guys!"

I‚Äôm an current sophomore who got accepted to participate in JPMorgan‚Äôs Code for Good Hackathon at Columbus for the 2023 software engineering internship.

I have participated in 3 hackathons online. However, CFG is the first hackathon that I am participating in person and working for a full 24 hours. Because of these facts, I thought that it would be great if I can get some advice from people that are familiar or participated in CFG. 

I have heard that JPMorgan considers the CFG hackathon as a final round for their software engineering internship. Because of this, I was curious of what my odds are of receiving an offer from JPMorgan after participating in Code for Good. Do they send out offers to most of the people that have participated in CFG?

Are there people who received an offer for an internship/full time after conducting CFG?

Also, after conducting the code for good hackathon, are there additional steps or interviews for the internship or do they just send out offers? If so how long do they take to get back with the offer?

Lastly, are there any tips and tricks for success while participating in code for good? Are there any stacks and programming languages that I should learn?(I am familiar with HTML/CSS Java and Python and conducted a couple projects on them)

Thanks for reading my concerns! It would really help me a lot if I could get some advice from you guys!"

He's currently working a remote job in marketing and making a good salary, so he's all figured out. I want to get some kind of tech job (preferably software engineering but I'm open to the idea of other stuff as long as I can make a career with it). Since we plan on moving around March, that means I've got months to study and grind to do whatever it takes to make myself a good candidate.

The difficult part is that I graduated with a CS degree in June 2022, with no internships. No need to lecture me on why that was a terrible move - I'm perfectly aware, but I was admittedly quite depressed so I'm lucky to even be here right now. I spent the past few months after graduating just taking a mental break, since I really needed it. I have a GPA of 3.75 which I feel is pretty alright, and I was a teaching assistant for 2 years, but yeah, no serious projects or internships. I had a capstone where I built a website with a team for a client, but it was quite rudimentary and disorganized. I'm aware that NYC is fiercely competitive, so from the get go I know I'm not exactly a choice applicant, and that it'll be difficult. 

What can I do to increase my chances of employment as much as possible in NYC over the next few months? I'm open to working less software oriented positions, such as technical sales or QA or DevOps. I understand the general idea is to make projects, grind LeetCode, and sharpen my interview skills, but are there specifics to NYC that I should take into consideration? What kind of tech stack is most common there, what industries are hiring the most people, etc etc. I tried looking into this and couldn't find much specifically for the entry level. 

And to clarify, my top priority is working in NYC. If I have to accept a job making 50k and working 60+ hour weeks, so be it. I can be picky later, but I really just want to get an in. 

Appreciate any and all advice."

There's been a lot of emphasis placed on landing an internship for this upcoming summer- so far I've applied to 3 places and been rejected by 2. I'm a teaching assistant for the university's introductory programming class. I have decent knowledge of C++, some Java from high school, and experience operating Linux.

Over the weekend I attempted to learn some Python. I essentially just reverse engineered some of my university C++ projects so I could get used to the syntax.

At the moment, I feel I don't stand out in a pool of applicants in the least bit. I was wondering if you guys know of any starter projects that are worth being pushed on to GitHub or if you know of any other ways to catch the eye of a talent recruiter.

Apologies for the ambiguity in what I'm asking- I don't know any relatives/friends in the CS field to consult instead."

What to expect?,Dizzy_Albatross_7241,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yfclww/threatening_email_from_recruiter_after_reneging/,"To begin with, I am a third year engineering student who‚Äôs looking for some experiences this summer.

I applied for a summer internship position at company A to no success initially. Since then I continued with my job search and managed to get an offer for an internship at company B a month later. I eventually accepted B‚Äôs offer since I had a feeling I wasn‚Äôt gonna get another and didn‚Äôt want to miss out on the opportunity. A few days ago, I received an email from  company A. They told me the position I applied for is open again and I was the top candidate and they are immediately able to offer me the position. 

This put me in a difficult spot because I already accepted my offer at B (No contracts signed, the acceptance was done through a third-party recruitment website). However, company A is much bigger and more prestigious, offered me better hours, talked about potential of becoming full time, and is located overseas in Sydney which is where I want to work after I graduate. I spent an afternoon weighing my options and finally decided if I don‚Äôt accept A‚Äôs offer I will regret for a long time. I signed the offer at A then immediately notified my boss at B. They didn‚Äôt seem to be too offended and I tried to be as polite and respectful as possible in my email.

This morning I woke up to an email sent by the manager lady from the third party recruitment organisation where I applied to company B. They were quite harsh with their wording and was borderline threatening. It was along the lines of ‚ÄúYou have tarnished your reputation in the industry and you probably won‚Äôt get another job from our circle again‚Äù as well as how much damaged I haved caused for them in regards to their relationship with company B. Moreover, this organisation has heavy connections to my university and I‚Äôm afraid they might contact my department.

What should I do from here on? Should I reply to the email sent by the third party recruiter? Will this have severe repercussion on my future career and is it likely they will contact my university?"
yfea8k,9,2022-10-28,How important is your first job out of college?,AnonymousBanana01,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yfea8k/how_important_is_your_first_job_out_of_college/,"Hi, I'm a current college junior majoring in CS. Unfortunately, my school is not particularly known for its CS program despite being an a well-known ""prestigious"" school, so we don't have a huge focus on getting students corporate roles after college (no co-ops, partnerships, etc.) unlike some other schools. No one in my immediate family works in the tech industry either, so I honestly have no clue on how career progression and hiring works for software engineers.

From my very limited knowledge from lurking online and talking to a few people, it seems like the biggest salary increases are made from jumping ships, and swe salary appears to plateau out pretty evenly after working for awhile in big tech. It also seems that the demand for you in the job market increases drastically after 3+ yoe even though entry level competition is fierce. A lot of my peers here are grinding their ass off to land a FAANG+ or HFT internship/New Grad role straight out of college, but it also seems like its easier to get the same entry roles after spending about 2 years at a decent company (please correct me if I'm wrong). I do come from Seattle, which has a big tech culture, and literally everyone's parents and siblings eventually ended up working for a FAANG(+M) even if they started out somewhere else unless they purposefully chose not to. Another trend I've noticed is that a lot of them eventually leave their FAANG position to work at a start up even if they make less money.

My questions is, given the trajectory of SWE careers in general, how important is your first new grad role (ie. landing a FAANG position) after college? For example, let's say person A landed a $200k TC New Grad offer at a HCOL area for Google and person B landed a $100k TC at some F500 company in a MCOL area. Obviously, getting that extra $100k and Google on resume is great regardless, but assuming that they are both proactive about career progression and jumping, would they be in a similar place in terms of pay/experience after about 15-20 years in the future? If not, how so and what could person B do to catch up to person A? Are there things besides TC and WLB that you should  consider when choosing your New Grad offer?

Mostly asking because I don't think I will be able to secure a good internship for the summer and I am worried about next year's new grad cycle due to recession :("

EC's are often difficult at home, because my mom likes to scream and rage almost daily (usually at me). Though I've stopped crying over it and begging her to stop breaking things years ago, it certainly presents a problem for extracurriculars, like writing articles for an internship I have at a magazine which I usually do at home.

For example, I have just spent the last hour of my life listening to why \[insert award\] I've achieved is not really my achievement and that somehow I constantly lie about where I am. I *intended* to spend this hour working on an article.

I cannot go into my room, since she just follows me and starts yelling there (there is also a slight risk of breaking my stuff).

Furthermore, she doesn't really care for clubs (im the leader of a tutoring club, which is apparently a waste of time) so its tough to use a club or going to the library as an excuse to stay out of the house.

I've recently tried staying up late, but it makes me lethargic at school and also look like an alcoholic raccoon.

Anything else I can do?"

I was previously in healthcare, but switched over to Health Information Technology.

My job is fully remote and I find myself having a lot of time on my hands. I'm thinking of pivoting to the CS field. I'm interested in having a second job, contract jobs, freelance, internships, or something that might be possible as overemployment. However, I don't have any background in CS, and am mostly learning how to do HTML and CSS through Youtube videos.

My question are:

1. Are there CS entry-level roles that lend themselves to overemployment? Something easy, lots of autonomy. Contracts would be ideal where I set my own hours and work on a deliverable project.
2. Are there CS roles that have synergy with the health industry?
3. What CS jobs are out there that will hire someone who is self-taught? Do you recommend something more formal like a CS bootcamp?
4. What CS skills are the most important for entry-level remote jobs for self-taught individuals? HTML and CSS? Jave? Python?

I‚Äôm a senior undergrad now, and have been taking online classes since 2020 spring. Got no attachment with any of the professors. I might still have one semester (next spring in person)+ summer/winter session left before graduation to fulfill all credits. I am supposed to file the application for master‚Äôs now, but I think I might do it next year. Which means I will have a gap year.
Right now, my gpa is 3.5, I‚Äôm double major in Applied Math and Economics. I am thinking about going in phd after master‚Äôs (but not 100% sure). I had two internships (out of U.S: equity research and private equity) and I have no research experiences at all. I think if I push the application to the next year I might have more time to find some research opportunities. 
I‚Äôm feeling really anxious, and I am thinking about two solution:
1. Graduating next summer. Then I have a whole gap year, and what should I do during that time? If I‚Äôm not in school, then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do research with the professors.
2. I might be able to apply for part-time student (cuz I need less credit) for Fall 2023. Then I would be able to work with professors if I got a chance.
For MS programs, I‚Äôm thinking about machine learning, DS, Stats or all the math/cs related. And title of the school is important for me. 
Can I plz get some advice for which solution is a better plan, and what are the things that I could do from now on to make me more competitive?

I'm very close to graduating with my Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems from a medium state school in the Midwest. I already have two IT internships at public institutions but I was wondering what I should do before and after I graduate. I see post all the time about people who apply to 500+ jobs only to get rejected, even with a degree and experience. 

I would like to pursue DevOps as that's what a lot of my classes focused on it in context of Software Development Lifecycles. I like the idea of DevOps as you get automate task and maintain software solutions. From what I heard, DevOps is NOT entry level but it is possible to pursue. I'm thinking about getting a Amazon DevOps certificate.

I want to make myself stand out to employers and get something beyond helpdesk. I have VMware Workstation and VirtualBox installed on my desktop computer. I'm also working on carbon footprint web application. Business Analyst is another option but I don't know if my communication skills are good enough for that. 

 What should I do?"

In fact, I might argue that your general attitude and vibes you give off with the interviewer are more important. Being specific: I just completed two final-round technical interviews with Microsoft this past Monday. I won't specify the questions I got (that would make my entire argument here pointless), but there were \~10 high-level technical questions in the first one, and then 20 mins at the end to do an LC medium. I didn't solve the question or optimize my solution. Next interview, BAM, 5 OOP questions I literally knew nothing about. But I was candid about being clueless and we both were laughing and vibing about it. Then he asked the LC Medium final question, which I literally blanked on. Legit, he held my hand through 20 mins of stumbling through the code. I immediately was like, I'm fucked. I should've prepped more. I see people on this sub saying the interviews are easy but hard for me. I'm incompetent. The works. But I kept my cool, and after our allotted time, we talked for 15 mins about what we both enjoy about being in an office and the interactions that come with it, as well as why he likes Microsoft, etc. I left the interview feeling awful in that I failed it, but good in that I vibed with the interviewer. I ended up getting accepted yesterday, and I was genuinely shocked. Not here to brag at all, but if I didn't get it, my entire argument would be false anyhow. My entire point is, relax, you won't be able to memorize the 2,000+ LC problems, or know all the patterns for every data structure perfectly, you just won't. And even if you do, it's not about just knocking the problem out of the park. Connecting with the interviewer is super important, and as I learned, more important, than solving the technicals correctly.

Long time lurker of this sub. Am a current junior at a non-top CS school w/ one fintech f500 internship last summer. If I can do it, anyone can do it. Have faith, STOP comparing yourself to these fucks on here humble bragging about ""omg, i dont know what to choose between Two Sigma and Jane Street, plz help"". I recognize there is some inherent bragging in my post, but I literally have 15 LC problems on my belt and that was enough. LC is not everything, show your true colors!"

I am currently in grade 10 and failing life, and I see everyone else in this subreddit made IMO when they were still sperms and got NASA internships in grade 3, and am wondering if it is too late for me to dream of T20s.

course load and stuff- I go to an accelerated STEM program and have decent grades (high 90s in STEM courses cuz I tried, low 90s in non-STEM courses because I watched anime in the back of class)Tests- This year, I am planning to write 5 APs- Calc BC, Physics C mech and e&amp;m, and micro and macroeconomics.I am confident that I can get a 5 on calc and physics (I have already studied and tried past exams)Havent taken SATs yet but I plan to

&amp;#x200B;

Current (significant) Achievements - (this list is smaller than my last dying brain cell)

* first place in the CMIMC programming contest (hosted by CMU) - this is probably the only remotely impressive achievement here

Other achievements I currently have

* International top 50 in the Sir Isaac Newton Physics contest (hosted by the University of Waterloo)
* national top 5 % in Canadian Association of Physics (CAP) High school prize exam (Canada's qualification round for IPHO)
* done a bunch of Canadian math contests, I get top 1-3% and consistently
* did well in some coding contests like google kickstart, etc. hope to get better
* done some hackathons, won some hackathons

Forecasted achievements this year- most likely making AIME, very small chance of JMO ( I get like 8 on AIME mocks)- doing CAYPT this year, and as my very epic teammate who overestimated my physics skill says,  ""we all have a decent shot at IYPT qualification""- taking CAP contest again, and if I can survive on 5 hours of sleep, might make it into top 20 and potentially IPHO

\- currently hard-struck USACO silver -  hope to move up to gold.

\- CCO maybe (qualifying for CCO from CCC = Canadian version of usaco plat)

Disclaimer- This stuff will only happen in the small chance that I don't fuck up on a problem I can otherwise solve.

ECs- I write a bunch of software, but for myself and a group of friends - Nothing that big like missile tracking n shit the us military uses that I've seen from other ppl in the subreddit, but some AI/ML, or server-backed stuff. Got into a computational model research program at University of Toronto which is starting soon. Currently an exec in my school's physics and CS club, and am one of the leaders of a student STEM organization, where I write problems for small student-run math and physics competitions, and write some software that is used by them. I hope to get a software development internship at some company, and also write some open-source contributions to something at least slightly significant.

This is quite one-sided and only STEM, but other extracurriculars like sports n stuff are expensive, and also I'm not good at them.

Thanks a lot for reading this far. Do you think it is possible for me to get into any top20 university or is it too late to dream of this stuff? Am I on track to get in? What possible next steps are there for me, and how can I improve?

My parents put a lot of effort and money into immigrating here (we went from luxury car and 4-bedroom house in a good neighborhood in India to a very shitty 2-bedroom apartment and 15-year-old used car), and I don't want to disappoint them.

I wasted my time in grade 9, watched too much anime, and played too much of whatever games my old ass laptop back then could run, but leaving that behind, what are the next steps for me?

Some people say I'm delusional for thinking of unis like CMU, while others say It's within my reach. What universities are within reach for me and which ones are out of the question?  


I am fine with Canadian uni like University of Toronto or University of Waterloo, but I really want to get into a T20 to make my parents stop thinking im a failure. 

Again, thanks a lot for reading this- If you read all of this stuff, it is probably the most interest someone has had in me."

It was a great experience and I mentioned I was interested in coming back. The responsibilities were similar to desktop support, as T1 had to relay the tickets to us to respond if they couldn't resolve the issue.

I just accepted a part-time role at Geek Squad for PC support during my studies.  I am going to client homes working on PC setup, printer troubleshooting, cameras, etc. It's more responsibilities and less sales like in the Best Buy stores so it's a nice upgrade.

My fork in the road is an offer to return to the internship for the summer. 

I am slightly worried about looking like a job hopper with an internship/ 6 month job/ internship, relocating again and no guarantee of a permanent position, but I want upwards experience. Plus I feel there's a cap at PC repairs after a while. I can't find internships above support with freezes and stuff, but as a returning intern I would be asking for more responsibilities to advance my skills, maybe work on security/networking.

I would like some advice or guidance on what won't be a rash decision, even though there's no wrong option here. Thanks!"
yg5830,1,2022-10-28,[USA] Does getting unrelated experience from a famous company helps in getting role for software development?,0xR001,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/yg5830/usa_does_getting_unrelated_experience_from_a/,"Hi everyone, my name is Jay, 

&amp;#x200B;

From my last post, as I've done - I have been reached out (haven't applied) by a big tech company (hint: rainforest) university recruiter for an internship role that is happening on Summer 2023, but it does have it caveats. 

First caveat is that I must have my degree finished by August of 2024 at most, which if I go for my current path is doable, but I cannot do it with an internship at the same time as it require travel on the internship path and also time on the class part, so I am already kind of stuck there. 

Another caveat is that the role is a ""area-management"" type role, which mean it'll be more of a supply-chain/operation type role, more-so than a tech management role, plus I'll be on my feet for half of the role, and another based on me getting projects to complete. 

I am conflicted as to whether or not I should take this opportunity, as I am open to any roles in business, IT, software development, or management role in tech, and this seem like a good stepping stone, plus it'll be a benefit for my resume &amp; work experience. On the other hand, I feel like it could be a determent to me, as I don't have any sort of roles that are directly related to the career path I'd like to go in as (software development), except for a help desk position I was doing. 

Would you take this opportunity, or would you recommend that I try to finish my college summer semester as much as I can ? 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I cannot choose an internship and the class(es) at the same time, as I am planning on taking science-based classes with labs over the summer semester. I don't think that it would mean anything in the long run, but it could potentially deter my graduation to Spring 2025, and I am trying to graduate with as little debt as much as I can."

The interviewer told me over the phone that he would tell me whether or not I would be moving into the next round of interviews by latest Wednesday (it's now Friday and I haven't heard back)

I'm getting nervous because this is a company I really want to work for and haven't really been hearing much from other companies. Should I send him an email on Monday asking if there's any updates?

It is the one I wanted to do originally, but I thought I was too dumb. Now I have transferred to a cheaper school with a good CS program that I can commute to since I will be graduating late. My favorite class currently is data structures and I love the professor. I love my computer organization + assembly class as well, also taught by a great professor. I am taking an SQL class which is a lot harder than I thought, but overall it feels great to solve problems whether it be circuitry, assembly, C++, or SQL (my other classes are not very difficult or noteworthy)

Still. I had an internship over the summer and I hated it. You would think I would have enjoyed it so much. I was making $15 an hour, working for a respected on the rise company, it was remote. The thing is I just hated it so much. I was isolated from the other interns doing web development. I was using JS, angularjs (not angular, literally angularJS), C#, html, CSS. In theory I should have enjoyed it so much. The thing is the vibes were terrible despite everyone being very nice. I did not put forth the greatest effort as I did not really enjoy the work I was doing. For some reason angularJS was very hard for me to figure out. To give credit to myself they said I exceeded expectations and invited me back, but I declined.

My favorite part was probably making a working email form.

After my internship I dread the future. I can't imagine having to deal with clients, having to be on tight deadlines, having a manger and dev team to constantly report to. I don't know what I would do if I can't figure something out. I want my job to be stress-free

That being said, I guess this is more of a rant post, but has anyone shared similar feelings? Loving their classes, but hating the future? If I had a choice I would do something relating to CS and fish, as I am an aquarist and I love doing that. Is there a pathway for mixing CS and research of nature? Specifically of the aquatic kind?

Now I am on the search for another internship, and that is something I would really enjoy."

**Background**

I am 22 years old, graduating engineering at a large university. I have gone through 3 major internships, and basically have a job guaranteed out of university. I have some friends, but due to some disagreements, we rarely speak now. They wanted to party and smoke/drink, and I never was into all of that. I went along with them for several years now, but I gave it all up, because I was miserable through it. I have a girlfriend, a lovely one, who would do absolutely anything for me. 

I have several vices though. I never cared for drugs or alcohol, but when I was in my late teens, I became obsessed with women. I have engaged in particularly pathetic habits... daily. Its taken a massive grip over my mental state, and I've tried to break it for years. I am in good shape, but I don't really work out that much, its mostly genetics and luck.

I've grown up (and go to school) in one of the most boring places you can imagine. Literally, if you look up the most boring states in America, my state will guaranteed be in the top 5. 

For several years now, I've become obsessed with moving to another state. I have been on several ski vacations, and its the only thing I've consistently loved doing. So I want to move somewhere where I can do that easily. 

I'm sure everyone has a dream, maybe multiple. I've had many dreams in my life, and they've never been fulfilling. I've basically dedicated the past few years to becoming successful, and here I am. I finally got the girl of my dreams, and here I am. I'm in great shape, but does that matter?  I've become a slave to this next dream, to move to the land that I want to be apart of, amongst nature and the mountains. 

How do I know that It won't be in vain?

I sometimes wonder about having a son, and what that would be like. But what if I'm disappointed in my son, not because of him, but because ***I*** am unfulfilled. What kind of a father would go into having a child with that mindset. Am I sick?

I've come to the conclusion that there really is no way to know. I just have to keep moving forward and hopefully I figure it out.

I'm a student at a community college (Clark College in Washington) and I want to apply to the UW computer science program next fall. I'm looking for some advice on how feasible this is for me and what I should do for the next year to improve my chances of getting in.

My first question is how I should salvage my GPA:

My GPA right now is 3.480. This is because I procrastinated a lot and did pretty terribly my first year at Clark College, but the second year I got a 4.0. My bad GPA is due mostly to two history classes that I can retake and bring my GPA up to 3.78. I've gotten a 4.0 in every math and science class I've taken at Clark, and I think I can continue to do so.

If I continue to get 4.0's in my stem classes, will UW care that much about the two history classes I flunked a few years ago? Depending on the answer to that question, I can either retake those history classes (10 credits) to boost my GPA, or I can just concentrate on taking more CSE and math classes. Here is what those options would look like by the time I apply:

\- 3.701 GPA, where my last 90 credits is 4.0 and my last 45 credits are all math/computer science classes, or

\- 3.84 GPA that is exactly the same except I took 10 credits of history instead of some stem classes.

The reason I would have a 3.84 and not a 4.0 is because I flunked English 101 during my first year and I can't retake it. So besides that one English class from a few years ago, I would have 4.0's all across the board.

I also have some questions about extracurriculars:

I'm in the aerospace club at my college, where we are building a drone for a competition. This seems like it will be good for my application. I'm also a math and computer science tutor. I know tutoring will also be good for my application, but I don't know if I have enough time to do both tutoring and to do well on the drone team. So my questions is whether I can get by just with being on the drone team, or if I need to do both, or if I need to drop tutoring and do another extracurricular that is more relevant to computer science, such as a personal project or an internship or volunteering somewhere.

And my final question: How feasible it is for me to get into the comp sci program? I also won a first place writing award for an essay, in case that's relevant.

I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance."

I am applying for an internship wherever I can at the moment, but many of the companies ask me if I will require sponsorship for work authorization in the future. Actually, I will be in the US from January till May as an exchange student with a J-1 visa and after the exchange, I believe I will be able to extend my J-1 visa to do off-campus AT (=Academic Training, something like OPT afaik) which will give me work authorization for the summer at least. But still, I have some questions in my mind:

\- Up until now, I always ticked off the options in applications which said things like ""I am authorized to work in the US"" or ""I will not require sponsorship now or in the future"" because I was thinking about my Academic Training opportunity, and if I ticked something else I thought they would never recruit me. But now I am not sure if this is the right thing to do because they might essentially be asking if I will be able to work full-time **after I graduate** without any sponsorship, which I probably won't be able to. So I'm not sure now how should I proceed with other applications when I'm answering such questions.

\- How can I get (permanent?) work authorization in the US anyway? Sorry, I am not well-versed on the topic, so I am not sure if asking for a **permanent** work authorization makes sense anyway. But permanent or otherwise, how can I get work authorization after I graduate from my university in a third-world country? As far as I know, there is the H1B visa lottery. But is that the only way? Isn't there any other way that would give me a much higher chance of getting work authorization? Ideally, I wouldn't actually start working full-time after I graduate but instead I would move onto some graduate program like doing a Master's in Europe or doing a PhD in the US. Would that be any help if I wanted to start working at the companies in the US I mentioned **after I get a graduate degree**?

Any help or tip whatsoever you can give, I will very much appreciate it."

4 years ago, after 4 years of grad school, for a mix of reasons I decided to get out of academia and start looking for a real job. My area of research was bioinformatics and unfortunately I was not able to finish my PhD (although I picked it up later and managed to write my thesis - I‚Äôm going to defend it next year). Soon after I set up my Linkedin profile, I started a position as a Data Analyst in a top 10 pharma company. It was a very independent role, where I constantly worked at the interface of IT and business (regulatory area). Because my main focus was (initially) to develop dashboards for workload forecasting and analysis, I had to quickly get to understand and map many key business processes. I often acted as a mediator between business and IT, developed and owned a couple of smaller systems and pipelines. It was a DA position in a regulatory team (so basically mostly people with pharma degrees) so I quickly became the go-to IT guy. I constantly worked with managers and senior managers, trying to figure out ways to automate processes - and then I was the guy that figured out the right technology and implemented the solution. After 2 years I was promoted to a senior role where I led small teams in different regulatory data related projects.

I let my managers know that in the future I‚Äôd like to take more leadership-oriented roles, so they let me act as an informal manager of a small group of interns. I informally took care of their time reg, days off, development etc - I couldn‚Äôt approve anything in systems but it was a good simulation of the real thing. I received many awards for my work, and I was on really good terms with people pretty high in the hierarchy. I now know that they considered me one of the ‚Äúkey talents‚Äù of the department.

Unfortunately, there were some things that bothered me. First of all, the salary was not great. I‚Äôm in an area (central Europe) where, at least pre-Covid, that pharma company I worked for was pretty much the only option for people who wanted to work at a big pharma corporation. I think that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt really have to compete for employees. Also, my position was an IT position in a non-IT department. I asked my manager for a raise and the response I got after 3 months was that I‚Äôm in the upper range for my position already so there‚Äôs no chance for a raise.

Additionally, I felt uncomfortable as the most competent IT guy in my department. It was my first commercial position after I left academia, and I felt like I was not developing too much - I was kinda learning new technologies, and it was great to be praised all the time for solving different problems, but I had to discover everything by myself, and had no one to teach me any good practices.

A year ago, a recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin. I got an offer for a position in an IT consulting company that supports life science organizations. The job was a fully remote data consultant for life sciences - a bit of data engineering, data analysis, data migration, software dev etc. They offered 50% more than my pharma employer. Even though the pharma company offered me the same money when I said I was leaving, and they offered new development opportunities, I decided to leave anyway. As a young dad, money was a super strong argument, but additionally, I would finally have a chance to work in a team of technical people, mostly more experienced than me. Also, I was hoping that participating in different projects for different clients would get me a better overview of the industry and accelerate my development. That was also exciting considering I only knew how things were done in academia and one company.

So, I switched jobs, and here I am now, one year later. During the last year I participated in two projects, and in both projects I was quickly put in independent, lead-ish positions. That meant that again I had no chance to learn anything from anyone. Both projects were successful and I guess it‚Äôs good that the new company noticed and appreciates my soft and problem solving skills, but my impostor syndrome goes through the roof. Even though I was invited several times to the HQ to mingle with people, I quickly noticed the downsides of a fully remote position. Before I went 100% remote, I had no idea how the fact that I can dress properly and go to the office and see people face to face affects my motivation and self esteem. That is probably amplified by the fact that my work now is very technical, completely devoid of the strategizing (is that a word?) aspects of my previous position. Also, I don‚Äôt really see myself climbing up the ladder in the consulting company - it feels like the higher you climb, the more you have to focus on selling. I‚Äôm completely not interested in that aspect.

Two weeks ago I got on the bench again, and I‚Äôm currently waiting for my next project. I don‚Äôt know if this is what triggered my reflection, but I feel like I made a huge mistake and I should have accepted the offer the pharma company made when I announced I was leaving. The thing is, I was really afraid that if they really pay me so much above the range for my position, I wouldn‚Äôt get another raise in 10 years. But perhaps I could get promoted sooner? I don‚Äôt know. I realize it might be that I don‚Äôt like where I‚Äôm now, and I‚Äôm idealizing the only other option I know.

I started looking around for new positions, but I‚Äôm afraid that in order to get on a purely technical path, in a proper data engineering or data analyst role for example, I would have to accept a junior position first, probably also a lower pay, and then climb up again (I base my suspicion on the lists of requirements I‚Äôve seen in job postings). On the other hand, I feel like the jobs that could use my soft skills better - ones where I could be involved more in higher level planning, and support my colleagues by ensuring mutual understanding between IT and business - do not consider me senior enough based on my CV (and this suspicion I base on the fact that I‚Äôve sent a couple of CVs for senior positions already and haven‚Äôt heard back from any of them). I feel like that pharma org that I left was the only group of people that really realized what I was capable of.

I‚Äôm 32 and I feel like I need to decide what to narrow down myself to and I really don‚Äôt know. I think (I know it sounds lame) I have a hard time separating my emotions from logical approach to my career. If you could please give me some advice, even on how to guide my thinking, or what the holes in my current thinking are, I‚Äôd appreciate that a lot!"

I currently work at a big company and have found an interest in software. I studied Electrical Engineering, so I had an intro to C++ in my curriculum but that was about it. 
I also had an internship with a challenging C++ project, and I currently analyze a lot of data using sql in my job now.

Would you recommend applying to jobs and trying to get into a software engineering role of some sort with my current experience? I sometimes think I don‚Äôt know enough and would move back a pay grade if  I went with an entry level role. 

Or 

Would you recommend applying to a masters in computer science or trying to find a boot camp that I can do with my current work schedule?
I try to learn stuff on the side, but without a curriculum and long hours at work I don‚Äôt always stick to my plan. I think I could manage a structured course, although it would be a lot of work. 

I‚Äôm sure there are several other routes, so any other suggestions would help!"

2.5 months in and after a lot of feedback of how I'm not performing up to standard and not doing as much as I should be all the way to this week where my boss again, expressed that:
-I am still no where near where I should be 2.5 months in
-How she shouldn't have to baby me or do this much hand holding
-Someone who is at my level shouldn't be performing like this
-She can't give me more interesting work because I'm still stuck trying to do well at my current work
-I should reassess if I should even be in accounting in the first place

and at this point she is willing to give me a week to see if I have a ""lightbulb"" moment and can turn things around. if not, I give my two weeks in. but honestl, i just want to leave immediately at this point.

ive attempted to take all her feedback as constructive and ive tried to correct the places where I was falling short, scheduling checkins, taking more notes, being more thorough, taking my time, etc. but with each and every effort I make, there is just more feedback of all the other things I'm doing poorly. she has emphasized from the start that she wants questions, is willing to take out time to show me things again if I need it, being a guide for me, etc. as she knew I was starting from scratch and didn't have experience, but liked my personality.

But It's difficult to even want to ask her for help at this point because when I have tried asking, I would be told ""I should know this already because we did this together"" or ""I'll let you figure it out first"", or if she did answer she would emphasize how ""obvious"" this should have been to me that I shouldn't have had to ask her, or that she's just swamped with work (this is a small company of 10 people and she is the vp - I work directly under her as the only property accountant). 

there was even a moment where she was unhappy that I was not asking more questions, so I tried to rectify that by asking more questions, and was told that she found her self feeling disappointed in my questions because they were too ""basic"". 

i know I have been falling short and have been trying, but it's been more and more discouraging each time to keep hearing how poorly im doing, and is really messing with my mental health and confidence. 
im ready to throw the towel in - my recruiter is aware too, but of course she wants me to stay there as long as possible.
im just thinking that I was not ready for a position like this, and need a slower paced environment to really learn and take everything in. 

is it just a poor fit, or am I truly doing so poorly that I should really reconsider my path? what went wrong? was I just not ready for the responsibilities this job entailed? do I keep trying?"

What are my options moving forward?,Classic_Stand4047,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ygpvic/got_lucky_and_landed_a_service_desk_role_with_no/,"Earlier this year I (25, no degree,Texas)quit my blue collar job to learn how to program once a friend told me he‚Äôd get me a dev job. 

Not long afterwards I was basically handed an IT internship then full time service desk job at a mega church I have been employed by for a couple years (part time, playing music) so I put off learning how to program to focus on my job

I‚Äôve been here for 3 months and really enjoy the work for the most part. We support 300 employees across a few campuses and do a lot of work with high end AVL equipment. Its a very robust IT infrastructure with an absurd amount of funding directed by people with decades of experience in much more high level roles.It‚Äôs also a small IT team so I‚Äôve been able to be involved with larger infrastructure projects and can continue to take on more responsibility as I skill up (doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean more pay)

My question is, could this be sufficient experience over the next few years if I want to move up in my career outside of church world or am I stuck here due to my lack of degree? I can basically get my hands on /get experience in whatever I want so long as I learn, but I have much less education than others here."

I've never touched leetCode and i have less than a year of internship experience due to world events, Its all about showing that you do have some practical skills, are approachable, can communicate, and are willing and able to learn. I don't go to a major big name school either.

I've been ghosted, rejected based on resume more times than i can count, interviews and rejected, failed skill assessments the works. Its all about finding the right fit for you.

The JP Morgan Chase offer comes from a failed skill assessment, a horrible technical interview but one of the best feeling behavioral / attitude interviews I've ever done. 

I'm not allowed to talk much about my internship due to the nature of the work but it is with a very large company working with a little older code base but its practical agile SWD experience. I work primarily in C/C++ and python with only academic Java experience (this seems to be the main thing holding be back from other places).

I‚Äôm looking to crowdsource some advice, as I am in a bit of a predicament. I need to start working before I can finish my degree.

My exp:
I have probably over a hundred college credited units, 

embedded systems and logic design (which both involved assembly lang specifically ARM and C)

intro circuit analysis (so I can use an oscilloscope, and DMM to trouble shoot)

completion of math and physics requirements for mechanical Engr degrees (multi variable calc, Differential equations, physics: thermo and oscillations, Electricity and magnetism)

materials science and Engr, Engr statics, and I also took a Engr design SolidWorks class. 

I recently switched majors and currently I‚Äôm taking an object oriented C++ class, and Comp architecture and Linux based assembly lang course (NASM), and discrete math. 

I‚Äôm also fairly comfortable using excel and MS office (for the most part). I even have taken a couple welding courses, and know how to solder.

In addition, I do have some work exp, I have interned at Lam Research as an assembly intern (less than 3 months), worked at a car shop as a technician (less than 3 months), and at a pizza shop as an assistant manager (for about 1 year as an assistant manager, and about 2 years total)

I was wondering, what kind of jobs I could qualify for that are relatively flexible (as in less than full time), that still pay decent(hopefully over 20 an hour) and that I would be able to get relatively immediately (within the next month or two). I don‚Äôt have any IT certs, but I have been trying to look for Groupons for compTIA certs (but it‚Äôs kind of hard to tell which ones come with just prep courses and which ones come with actual compTIA certs as I am unsure of how it all works). Trying to look for something that will allow me to work on completing my degree (even if it means only taking 1 or 2 classes a semester).

IT seems like a decent place (especially since my career of interest atm is cyber sec) but I don‚Äôt have certs yet and am worried about the competition as I don‚Äôt have a lot of exp related specifically to computer networking. 

Looking for really anything and everything (short of joining the military, not that it‚Äôs off the table but I‚Äôm looking for alternatives, mainly because I found out if I can go to school for another semester I can basically get 3 AS degrees, one in math, one in comp Engr, and one in I think electrical Engr), I just want to get my foot in the door and have something on my CV that isn‚Äôt just another soft skill position, and rather a more technical one. Not looking for crazy pay but preferably over 20 an hour, I have even consider Starbucks as they offer free tuition for ASU.


TLDR: 
I don‚Äôt have no skills, but I have no degree and no certs, and would like a job that is engineering or tech related (could be hands on technician type or hands off desk work type) to gain fairly relevant technical exp (really anything in stem), even something really entry level or being an engineers monkey (software or electrical engineer).

I‚Äôm open to pretty much any and every job I can qualify for as is, that would possibly help me continue my education and/or give me somewhat relevant exp (I say somewhat relevant because as long as I‚Äôm learning or using a technical skill in stem, other than back breaking labor like working at a auto-shop, and pure soft skills like being an assistant manager at a pizza shop).

I am looking for any advice, input, two cents, career opportunities, or specific job types I should look into for my relevant exp. I‚Äôm willing to learn anything, work on any project type but understand things are tough without a degree and certs.

I tried applying to a bunch of places for various engineering related roles (both ones that req a deg and ones that didn‚Äôt) and they all seemed to genuinely consider me until they would ask how long I have in school left, at which point they would say they don‚Äôt think it will be a great fit."

It's getting worse and I'm kind of lost. I really hope that some one can provide me with some advices on how I should approach my lifetime goal at this stage. I've listed my strengths and blocking factors below for your reference!

My life time goal:

1. Start and manage a large company with the option to go IPO.

My Strengths:

1. Accounting major for undergrad, CPA eligible from a top 30 universities.
2. Computer Science master degree from an ivy league school.
3. Perseverance: willing to work 10+ a day to achieve my goals over an extended period of time.
4. Some start up experiences and I'm looking to try out my current project when I visit China this year.

Blocking factors:

1. No green card and looking at a 7+ years of waiting time if I choose to work for a company. The jobs I do can only be related to my major.
2. My home country is economically messed up because of political reasons and is likely to stay so for the next 10 years (Yes, it's China).
3. I'm not from a very rich family so not so much start up support.
4. I'm not a CS genius.

The thing is, I study accounting and CS because I've always wanted to start my own business. I LOVE making money from trading with others and buying and selling things. But the legal constraints are just stifling in the U.S., especially for a person born in China. I could spend the next one year and it's pretty likely that I can get into big tech companies and get paid around 180k a year. But I constantly ask myself if this is the person I wanted to be. I feel like my career path get narrower and narrower because of the legal requirements in the U.S. It also makes the normal career path less promising because you get much less opportunities for internships and full time jobs.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!"

Long story short, I failed my Jane Street and IMC final rounds, and then I failed my SIG and 5 Rings rounds. And recently, I failed my final round with Belvedere as well! It was easier than the final rounds for the other 4 firms, so I'm really beating myself up over it.

Is there anyone I can DM who has also final rounded with Belvedere? I really need to get my act together and figure out what I did wrong and how to improve. I have a possible final round with 1 last company I'm still in the process for, so any improvement still goes a long way.

This recruiting season has seriously taken a toll on my confidence. If I'm not able to convert the ongoing process with this 1 last trading firm into a summer internship, then I'm taking my return offer to do a 2nd internship with the FAANG I worked for this last summer.

Family and friends tell me that it's not too big of a deal and to take it easy, but I am really disappointed with myself.

As with my previous posts, for those who are still applying and want advice, feel free to DM, or ask your question in the comments where I can attempt to answer. Always happy to help, despite the blind leading the blind etc.

Which begs the question, are most SWE jobs CRUD? And should I try to pivot to something else to make myself relevant for the future? I am completing a computer engineering degree and feel like I have a good grasp on math, calculus and linear algebra.

Update: Wasn't expecting this thread to blow up. I really love CRUD but I feel like I don't use any of my school knowledge that much. However I prefer a cushy boring job that pays well over a stressful one which underpays, so I would really choose CRUD over game development any day.

Regarding my company: I wanted to be as anonymous as possible which is why I used that acronym.

Thanks again for insightful and awesome posts so far."
yh53xv,0,2022-10-30,I want to go back for a CS degree but worried about burnout,rando765108,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yh53xv/i_want_to_go_back_for_a_cs_degree_but_worried/,"I'm 22(M) and currently work in a warehouse. I had no clue what I wanted to do after high school so I spent my time working and saving up money. I became convinced that pursuing a CS degree was the right choice for me. My employer has a tuition assistance program that would help out a lot. On top of that, I live with roommates which saves me some money. 

 However, I work full-time and can't afford to cut my hours at the moment. I would attend part-time starting at a community college and it would take approximately 5 years to finish. I understand it's generally worth it but I hear stories constantly about burnout doing both. I enjoy coding and learning about CS overall but I'm worried the workload will be too much. I'm also trying to figure out how I would do internships. 

Am I overthinking this and should I just do it? For those who have done similar, how was life during that time and how did you pull through."

They wanted me to stay but with my classes I couldn‚Äôt, but they also couldn‚Äôt offer me a position due to a hiring freeze. I thought oh well, at least I gained experience and have been job searching like crazy for my college graduation in December.

My supervisor from the internship has emailed me a few times and emailed last month checking in and saying that they wished I was there to help and asked how my job search was going. This week he emailed saying he and the COO would like to meet for lunch for a Q+A if I hadn‚Äôt made a job commitment. I know a job offer is most certainly coming I just don‚Äôt know what to expect from the meeting, especially how to negotiate salary because IT specialist pay can vary so much especially being in a small city and not a big metro area.

Any advice is welcome on what I could possibly expect, salary negotiation, etc."

yh618l,888,2022-10-30,Lazy gamer landed a job after 1 year of applying,BumbaDude,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yh618l/lazy_gamer_landed_a_job_after_1_year_of_applying/,"Been long time lurker in this subreddit, and want to thank you all for the motivation and replies. I am sure that without reddit communities like these I would not seek further in my career. 

So a little bit of back story (you can skip this section):

I am young fella who is studying CS in Eastern Europe. Getting university degree is fairly cheap. Something like 1600$/yr, so I went there just for fun. Never had technical background or interest in programming, mostly due to bias around the myth that programming requires math. But after I failed my application into medical field,  and wanted to try myself in programming.

Since I am very lazy person, figured it out quickly that without any supervision and deadlines I can't get shit done and even finish small project. First year of university was very vague and abstract. It basically was introduction to CS and how the hardware works. Programming started on the second year. Long story short, picked PHP as the language that I am going to learn at on spare time on second year. That's how I narrowed down my path to web-dev and mostly back-end. For the framework picked the most popular at the time - Laravel. And God bless all the videos on youtube about tech stacks, tutorials on frameworks and etc.

Searching for the jobs: 

Here is the thing, since sending your CV is not something to be feared of. Started sending my resumes as soon as I learned to write simple calculator. Yes, I feel sorry for the recruiters and HR's who received my resumes. But some of them even gave feedback, like some thing that I need to learn to join their companies. Sometimes they sent test tasks, which I failed of course or haven't completed on time. I take it as a part of the learning experience. 
To be honest, the amount of time I was programming wasn't consistent ir organised. Have been stuck in tutorial hell many times in a row. 
Everything changed after I got an assignment at the university to write full stack web application as a project. That's when I actually connected all the knowledge from those small tutorials and figured out that googling the questions or reading documentation is 100x faster that watching full video and trying to find the answer.
Project was really crappy and poor quality. But it was something that was made myself and ofc It was added to the resume with all the new technologies used. That's how I spent my free time applying for the jobs and chilling gaming all day and coding when I don't feel lazy. 

Call it luck or maybe just consistently spamming resumes for every job openning, but after endless applications finally got interview where they sent me job offer. Weirdly it was the easiest interview where they asked for easy questions. Not to mention that first job interviews were rly stessful, it was hard to swallow my pride and admit that I don't know half of the questions and accept the L. 

Hear me out!:

- Finding junior job is hard af. Most of the times I haven't got any answer to my resumes. Out of 400 sent resumes only 23 companies replied. And only like  8 invited to try myself out for an interview. 

- After more and more interviews you gonna loosen up and also ask company questions about their culture and work specific. Never skip this part, because interviewer will acknowledge you as a proactive person.

- Don't set yourself hardcore deadlines. Haven't mention it in the text, but I was expecting to get a job in 3 months and was daydreaming about becoming a senior in one year and other bs. First 100 sent resumes gave a good reality check, lol. It doesn't really matter if you land a job on first month or after X amount of years, it's not a sprint, rather a marathon.

- Scan local market for job descriptions and tech stacks. You can make yourself some excel spreadsheet and list what technolgies are popular in your country or area. It's way easier to land a job when you don't use some ancient tech stack

- BIGGEST TIP FOR LAZY FOLKS LIKE ME: 
Bro, listen here. If you don't code on your spare time for 8 hours daily that's OKAY, do it for 30 mins a day, even doing it once every 3 days but systematically will produce lot of output. As mentioned above, I am very lazy person, and at home can't focus on job. But when at office It's easier to focus and code. So if you feel like you can't concentrate, don't fill discouraged. Maybe change of environment will help!
You don't have to talk about coding and be obsessed. It's okay to think about it like a job. I often hear about this unwritten rule that you have to do the job that you really enjoy and make your hobby into a career. You got the point, right? Take it with the grain of salt. The truth is that you don't have to hate your job, that's it.
Here's my take - I don't love programming, but I would rather code and work on tasks that require my brain to be activated all the time and be in learner/googling mode rather than laying bricks all day or answering calls as tech support. Preferences basically. We just want to feed our families, and not hate our jobs. That's it. Do your hobbies after work. 
I find this bs with passion = job to be toxic and sign of burnout in the future. Make yourself boundaries between study/work and rest. 


TLDR - University student was spamming resumes for full year until got lucky and landed full stack job in fancy company without internships, courses and job experience. Don't be shy and apply for every opening, fill out the gaps of knowledge on the way.


Feeling cute, might delete later




Edit: 

Forgot to mention, that after working for a few weeks at the office. You get this habit of coding automatically (you basically can spend more time coding while focused). Which I've tried to build myself and failed miserably many times using pomodoro and different goal tracking apps. Some people just don't have enough self-discipline.

Also wanted to highlight main idea of the article.
It is okay to be a cog in the machine of IT company. You can become great programmer if you love your job, but you also can be a good programmer if you don't. Especially if you work in bigger company, you often can get away with being slower paced and relaxed after first year at work"

yhcf1u,39,2022-10-30,Is it worth to join a new startup to start your Career?,rharshit8,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/yhcf1u/is_it_worth_to_join_a_new_startup_to_start_your/,"I am from a 2023 student from Tier 3 College. Its October and very few companies will come now for Placements oncampus. 

I am selected for interview in a very early startup that basically provides services and develop applications for international clients.

They will train me for 6 months in MERN Stack and provide 15k stipend and after that give 8-10 LPA CTC.

Given: I have good development experience. I did an internship as Full Stack developer in a startup. I am a specialist at CF and did 550+ questions in LC. 

Issues:

1. Company is very new and If it fires me during the recession, It will make things very hard for me as I cant sit for another company if I get selected in this company.
2. (Main Concern) Company is not recognized and rarely there are employees of that company on Linkedin. Will this create an issue while switching as this company is not at all known?

Should I give interview for this company properly or rather wait and try my luck on last few companies such as Hashedin, ConsultAdd etc."

Five  years ago while doing my degree in software engineering , i was  introduced to the basics of programming in C, Java , android and python.  however after my degree i didn't continue with the career path of  software engineering or computer science, i instead was involved in  things to deal with public administration and social works which i have  since abandoned past covid.  
Am looking for an Environment where i can  get back to my career path and specifically python with which i had  interests in, an environment with projects i can contribute on while  learning .  
Am willing to work as a remote intern and maybe when my skills grow i can be  hired as well.  
Am determined and willing to follow the guidelines given , do all assignments on time and ready to learn.

If  anyone knows a company, organization or project  dealing with python  that can take in novice individuals like me and train them ,please also  recommend them to me so i can check them out.

In case i get a opportunity in India i desire to work in MUMBAI / BANGALORE .
Actually as i am just starting my career i want to take huge risks and also learn,explore etc.
I also have been thinking of Working in a startup but not quite sure .
Would prefer to work in a big corporate due to better pay but as i said i like to take risks and if i come across a cute  startup i might as well join it .
Recently a relative of mine graduated from a tier 3 college and has still not received a job offer even after applying to 100 of companies.
I recently went to a job fair and it was embarrassing to see that even mba graduates were offered same starting salary like B.com graduates. 
I would love to join a good college but couldn't pay the fees due to my financial situation. 
Also i tried looking at options abroad but due to the expenses involved it wouldn't be possible for me .
Taking  a loan also wouldn't be a option for  my family as they wouldn't bet on me lol.
Thanks for reading and would appreciate any leads or advise."

yhj6dv,4,2022-10-30,Fired from 1st job out of college and unsure whether to go back to school or take new position at this time,axiom60,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/yhj6dv/fired_from_1st_job_out_of_college_and_unsure/,"I finished undergrad in civil engineering last fall and then started working for a consultant firm as a transportation engineer. My school background was in the transportation category; I did an internship at a DOT and worked on a handful of aviation-related research projects in undergrad for senior design capstone. At this firm, for the most part I just did construction inspection being out in the field to keep track of contractors and carry out material testing on road construction jobs.

I have severe ADHD and unmedicated (wasn't properly diagnosed until recently) which made the transition to work life pretty hard for me, and I especially had trouble in construction because of the regular long hours and the fact that the work was very detail oriented with a lot to keep track of. While I did like being out in the field and getting to see something new each time, I'm also terrible at ""on-the-job"" practical learning that construction entails and need clear-cut instructions in order to learn and be able to develop skills (e.g. in college the courses I struggled with the most were ones which didn't use a textbook and you were just tested on whatever the professor said in lecture. I found it much easier to read a textbook, notes, other resources etc. as opposed to being limited to listening to the prof lectures alone). For a few months I did get to do design work at this firm using AutoCAD and that seemed more up my alley because I found it much easier to learn by looking at documentation, online resources, asking more experienced people in the office, etc. Even though CAD work isn't like my dream job, I am at least a lot more competent in it than construction so if I were to work a similar position it's what I'd try to do.

I was fired from this job 9 months in for poor performance in construction. I was trying but I really found the on-the-job learning part of field work difficult. On the first construction job I was placed on I got written up for needing to be told directions too many times and the project managers were under the impression I was uninterested/didn't want to be there. After reprimands like this I seriously made efforts to improve and also ask questions constantly to show that I was taking interest. Eventually I could do inspection (monitoring a crew and recording diary entries, measuring stuff as needed) without a problem, but my issue was later in the office when I'd have to look at construction plans and enter quantities. I was yelled at a few times ""you were out in the field on this job and you're still fucking up the spreadsheets and taking too long."" Despite me being more comfortable in design and never being reprimanded when doing that type of work, they still fired me for making one too many mistakes in construction tasks and not improving at the pace they wanted. Although I definitely made errors that contributed to this, I still think it was shitty of them to fire someone who's still on a learning curve and not give enough time to prove myself in a different area such as design, which I had already done work in earlier without the same problems as in construction.

After being let go, my first thought was ""I'm not mature enough for an adult job, I should go back to school instead of looking for a different opportunity at this point."" I figured that going for a civil masters would have the following benefits over jumping to a new position right away in the same field:

a) it would let me take more classes and learn more about the science/theory of civil engineering which I find interesting and is never something we use in the professional world,

b) with doing research/thesis in grad school, kick me into the right mindset of ""thinking like an engineer"" which is crucial for the real world (at my job I was definitely guilty of trying to ""cut and paste"" rather than thinking about how to solve the problem for each of the tasks I was given, and it showed in my work and was something I got constant complaints about),

c) generally, going to school again in-person would allow me to meet people and have more of a social life. I was incredibly lonely under job life and it eventually took a toll on my mental health. I went to meetups, joined local clubs, etc doing most of the things they tell you to do in order to make new friends as an adult but I was still very lonely. On the other hand I found it much easier to make friends in college with people who were in my classes or in the same clubs/extra-curriculars.

d) I think now is the best time to go to go back to school while I'm still young, its been less than a year since I finished undergrad, and because I'm still not quite used to the 8-5 work schedule entailed by a full time job I would say I'm still in ""student mode"". Maybe it's just how my ADHD brain works but learning something academically and then doing well on an exam or report, etc. gave me much more of a dopamine boost than anything at work did, again because I like the science and theory of civil engineering a lot more than the stuff I did at my job which seemed to be loosely/not based on that.

I had already been accepted to a Civil MS program for spring 2023 (since grad school was at the back of my mind even when I was working I had applied in advance just to have school as an option to fall back on if I wanted to) so after being fired I thought I'll just enjoy a few months off and then start the MS program in January. With the MS I wanted to dip my feet into structural engineering which I have read is more math and theory based than other fields of civil engineering, even in the job world (which is why many structural engineering jobs require an MS) so I felt it was a better fit for me than construction. I had applied to several entry level structural jobs earlier but got rejected/ghosted by all of them, likely because my undergrad emphasis and experience so far was only in transportation and I had only taken 1 structural class in college, so I figured the only way to get into structural was by going back to school.

However after a little while I figured it may be too soon to make a judgement that transportation is not my cup of tea after just 1 bad experience. I had figured out that I am much better at design than construction so I figured looking into design/CAD positions can't hurt. I also limited my job search to public sector this time instead of private firms where I had just worked since I had interned at a DOT and knew that public sector work is generally more chill and not as stressful based on the workload they have. I landed an interview with a municipal government for a suburban city in a large metro area. During the interview I was open about how I struggled with on-the-job learning in construction inspection and much preferred design. A lot of these things which I said were echoed by the engineers in the interview panel (about how it depends on the person and some are just not great at practical learning), which was a relief for me as it proved my concerns and strength/weaknesses area were valid and didn't mean I'm stupid and can't do work properly. This place made me an offer; while they have both design and field work it's a bit different on the public sector side rather than being a consultant. Instead of doing the inspection work and being out with contractors all the time, all the city engineers have to do is manage the logistics of the consultant inspection staff and loop them in on what to do. Similarly in the office setting, while there would be some CAD design work, for the most part it is outsourced to a consultant and not something that would have an intense workload as in the consultant firm I just worked at. This job is also paying a pretty good salary, significantly higher than what I made at the last job due to the fact that it's a fresh grad position and I have my EIT cert and \*some\* work experience. The only thing that bothered me a little is that it's a very small department and I was told I would have to be a ""jack of all trades"" doing all different types of work, which made me a little concerned I could be roped into tasks I'm not good at like with the last job. They are also super understaffed and seemed lowkey desperate for me to join. Despite that I did visit the office in person and was shown around some of their projects that they work on and I got the overall sense that it's something I could handle and that the aspects of my last firm which caused issues for me personally wouldn't be present here. The other caveat is that this employer is transportation and water resources (latter is not a field I'm interested in, I took some environmental classes in undergrad and honestly didn't care for the topics) only and doesn't do any structural work, meaning that if I were to work here I would not get to try out structural at all.

Prior to receiving the offer my heart was pretty set on going to grad school in the near future since I wanted to dip my feet into structural engineering and after being fired I had very little confidence that I could handle another adult job at this time. The school I got accepted to has a very good program and financially it seems worth it (if I were to go off my savings now I would still be in some debt but I did the math and it's something I could easily pay off within a year or so of working after masters). However since I got an offer from this municipal government I've been super torn whether I should just continue with my original plan of going to school to really figure out what other branch of civil I like and want to be employed in, or just accept the offer considering it's too early to decide that transportation is a bad fit, and, knowing that this job lines up with my strong suits a little more just try it out and see if I can redeem myself in a different area of transportation. They gave me a week from today to give them a yes or no answer on the offer so in that time I need to choose one of the following:

a) **take the offer** and give another area of transportation a shot before making a judgement that it's not for me, also knowing that this job pays a lot and seems a little more aligned with my abilities. The downside is that I wouldn't be able to go to grad school at this time obviously.

b) **go for a Civil MS in the spring** and throw away this opportunity now (while also keeping in mind that after I complete an MS, there will be enough job opportunities that would pay me around the same/more, and I'd also have a much better sense of what area I want as well as the ability to take more classes and try out things. Additionally, going through a rigorous master's program would also better enable me to handle the workload and demands a private sector job like the one that just went badly.)

c?) **take the offer and defer grad school until next spring** that way if I decide I don't like the job after a year I can jump right to school, and going back to school full time is always a valid reason to quit a job so it wouldn't look bad like my last one where I only lasted 9 months. I'm not even sure if my grad program allows deferral so it's something I'd have to talk to the school about. Even if it does work, my main worry is that after another year I may no longer be on ""student/academic mode"" like I am now and not feel like going back to school. Worth noting that I cannot handle taking classes on top of full time work and I'd also much prefer an in-person school experience, so doing a masters while working there is not an option. From experience it's be much harder for me to take classes and learn in this situation Even though this employer does provide some financial assistance for tuition, this is not something I'd want to do. I would rather just pay on my own for a full time masters (and like I said the financial sacrifice is worth it for my case)

[I hade an exhaustive list of pros/cons of doing master's right now vs taking the job offer right now.](https://imgur.com/a/q1Saz0p) Honestly after writing it out the # of pros and cons for each are similar but the fact that now is the optimal time to go back to school and that I'd probably regret it if I didn't is the main thing pulling me towards just doing that right now and focusing on work later.

I just wanted some advice on which option seems better given my situation. I realize it's not a decision someone else can walk me through or make for me but since it is such a tough choice, the more feedback I get the better. Thanks for reading this ridiculously long dilemma post if you have made it all the way through :D

tl;dr was fired from first civil engineering job which gave me low confidence I could handle another job so I decided to go to grad school. However I was offered a seemingly great position since then and am now torn between which one to choose very soon."

Because I didn't do so well (3.0 gpa and &lt;1000 SAT), I just went to a community college and took some business courses to get my AA degree.

The good news is that I was accepted into the University of Florida for the spring semester and I am in the Information systems program. I wanted to switch to CS but the advisors strongly advised against it since I have business prerequisites and information systems is in the school of business so i thought I might as well stick to that and minor in CS.

The issue is that i don't know where to start, I have a passion for IT but since i am a junior, I am worried that I won't have any time to get an internship before I graduate so I don't end up in some helpdesk position. Based on the research I did I am interested in Data/Business analytics or a sysadmin/DevOps position but I'm not sure what skills I should be learning for those positions, I know that I will learn a lot of skills in school but I would like to get a head start.

A few of the posts I read recommended a few things.  Learning a programming language like Python or SQL, CompTIA A+ and Net+, learning how to use Linux, learning AWS, and something called ""home labs"" and learning about servers I believe.

If anyone can steer me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it!"

My background:  
I am a 33 year old CS Graduate that lives in rural Illinois. I graduated in May and since then I have been door dashing for extra money and studying and applying to entry remote webdev jobs. I studied and put together a portfolio for a couple of months immediately after graduation. More recently I have put out 100 applications on LinkedIn with radio silence. I can't afford to move to a city but even if I could I have always wanted to work remotely. I'm currently living with family until I can land a serious job.

I am specifically seeking a remote position and I have and believe I will continue to have trouble obtaining that kind of role as an entry developer with no internship experience (I have realized since school how important internships would have been now). A remote career is important to me because I have Crohn's Disease and simplifies many of my needs. 

I love problem solving, and automation. I have a long work history in management at a restaurant where I've developed customer service skills and communication skills. 

I've read that ""IT Support Specialist"" could be a good match for me but I've heard about ""help desk hell"" and people getting stuck or trying to get out. Would this be the best job to go for at the moment?

Long term I could see myself collecting certification and pursuing a career in Linux Sys admin / Sys admin / Cloud engineering / DevOps / DBA. 

If I want an IT route what should I pursue short term and long term to stay remote (automation is a plus, not too extroverted is a plus)?

What salary should I be after short and long term in those positions?

Are there Certs I need to get my foot into a better help desk or better IT Support position?

Overall what would you do if you were in my position? Continue to pursue a webdev or java role (without work related experience just the B.S. in CS) or move into IT.

I'm an INTJ and I enjoy supporting and training others. I could see myself enjoying a career in IT. 

Thanks for any feedback!"

I would be very grateful if someone could share any advice regarding writing a CV + cover letter for internships between second and third year of study (BSc Computer Science).

I have seen plenty of advice on CVs, but I‚Äôm getting worried. According to job listings for summer internships, they accept only students between second and third year of study, and applications are open now (I already seen upcoming deadline in the next week for one listing). I think I can say I have idea how to write the CV, but I have no idea what to put there, since I‚Äôm now in the beginning of second year. I obviously don‚Äôt have any experience, all my skills are on beginner level, I don‚Äôt have any real projects - I don‚Äôt think static website will do any magic. I receive very good feedback from lecturers, but still, my knowledge is at level of someone in the beginning of second year. I was thinking non-industry experience would slightly boost my CV, as I heard multiple lectures mentioning importance of soft skills, but common advice found online is to skip everything unrelated. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something, maybe I‚Äôm doing something extremely wrong, but at the same time I highly doubt that average BSc CompSci student in the beginning of year has lengthy CV with industry related experience &amp; big projects.

What would you recommend in this case? Just make somehow the CV work with what I have + cover letter, and focus on my studies, or try to quickly come up with some projects? 

For reference - if it changes anything - I‚Äôm located in London, UK. No name uni.

I will be very grateful for any advice, or to hear experience from someone who was in similar situation.


TL;DR All internships I found are designated for students in between second and third (final) year, applications started now, absolutely clueless of how my CV should look like in this scenario as I just started year two."

Even though I solved 300 problems over the year, wasn‚Äôt passing any phone interview. The current economic situation and the fact that I‚Äôm an international made it more difficult for me. 

From August 2020 I started my job hunting process. Applied on more than 500 positions for Summer‚Äô22 internship. Didn‚Äôt get any offer after just 2 virtual on-site. I kept grinding whole summer. 

Again started the full-time hunting, but this time I was more prepared and more confident. And very soon every hope was going away as I kept failing phone interviews. Some rejections were so brutal to digest. I know lots of people have felt this way at some point. People were telling me to try for less technical roles. But I knew, I can do this sooner or later. Believing in yourself and keeping up the hard-work is the key. 

Anyway, after seeing all the suggestions and motivation from the previous post I decided not to beat myself anymore over m a job. I was still applying like crazy but wasn‚Äôt getting more interviews due to the hiring freeze and economy. 

Fast forward today, I signed an offer as a Full Time Software Engineer at a pretty big corporation.  

Remember, It‚Äôs always darkest just before the dawn.

TC: 123k (first year) at a MCOL area.

yhw3rz,96,2022-10-30,[OC]Life goes on.,Infernalism,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yhw3rz/oclife_goes_on/,"You have to understand, none of us thought it would turn out this way.  We had hoped that the revelation that Erralia wasn't alone in the galaxy would...I don't know...dampen the nearly mindless hatred that had consumed us.  Give us all a common enemy, maybe.  To be completely honest, it was a last desperate grasp.  We all saw what was coming at that point.

The Twelve Nations were at each other's throats.  Constant skirmishes on the borders of our tiny world.  Increasing violence and, worst still, each nation's cities were turning into blood pits, with the minorities of all Nations being targeted for attacks and accusations.

And here we were, just a small token group of scientists focused on trying to determine if we were alone in the galaxy.  A joke, really.  A joint effort by the Twelve Nations fifty years ago when we weren't bent on destroying each other.  No one at all took us seriously, except for ourselves, in the beginning.

By that point?  When the vids were mostly war propaganda and religious leaders preaching the inevitability of the coming new wars?  When leaders were seemingly racing each other to see who would go the furthest and make up the biggest lies about their neighbors?  No, none of us took it seriously anymore.  

And then we found it.  

It was buried in a rock the size of a small den.  Records indicated that it fell from the sky two centuries ago on one of the other continents and a task force had stolen it just because they could.  Brought it back here and after a short little bit of time spent on it, humiliating the small nation that they'd stolen it from, it was put into storage and promptly forgotten about.

Ferel was the one who's responsible.  Just one of the many interns that sign up and quit within a few months after learning that we don't actually do anything.  Ferel still insists it was an accident, but I do wonder sometimes.

He broke it, you see.  Dropped it and it split open, bam.  And right dead center, in the middle of a mass of fused metal was a hunk of...something.  It had a pattern that was clearly artificial.  

We spent six months studying it before realizing it was some kind of storage technology.  And, let me tell you, THAT got the attention of our leaders.  

Alien technology with something stored on it?  Gods, they went absolutely mindless at that point.

We were classified again, interns chased off, except for Ferel.  All the resources we needed, asked for, or even hinted at were given without delay.  

Well, yeah, I might have vaguely insinuated that it resembled military technology.  I mean, they can't arrest me for it now, now can they?

Anyways.  Six months into the project and we realized that the storage was intact and there was data stored on it.  None of us could have been properly prepared for what we found when we finally managed to rig up a system that could draw on that data and display it.  

It was...some kind of religious ritual.  That's the current theory and I'm not about to go disputing it.  Not now, not after everything that happened.

What?  Oh, we had the same kind of reaction as everyone else.  I mean, you have a single race of bi-pedal creatures, but look at them!  All different!  A dozen different hair colors, or no hair, wildly different appearances and they're all singing to Maul'leh.  

You can't imagine how we felt.  These alien creatures, playing their stringed instruments, joyfully crying out to Maul'leh.  So happy, so gleeful, so much love and...Well, you've seen it, you know.  We all know.  Now.  

We never could decipher the language and after a while we stopped trying.  Did it matter?  The perfect joy and delight in the song to Maul'leh was apparent and without dispute, so we brought it to the heads of our government.  

The government immediately shut us down.  Confiscated our copies.  Tried to bury it.  The wars had to happen, you see.  Too much was at stake.  Too many people at the top on all sides were too invested to stop them.  Monsters.

Thank Maul'leh for Ferel.  Again.  *laughter*

He released it onto the Sea.  The Digital Sea was the one place that once you put something out there, you can't ever take it back.  And once it was out there, the whole world changed.

Twelve different nations, so wildly different in appearances, skin and pelt colors, and we'd grown accustomed to judging them based on those appearances and beliefs and ideas, but ONE thing united us all.  We all followed our different Gods from the same Pantheon, but Maul'leh was one of those common things.  

God of life and love and our many peoples.  

Overnight, governments crumbled or bent under the weight of this religious epiphany.  No more war.  Not on our brothers.  

So many saw it and recognized it for what it was.  A plea by some ancient and alien people, pleading with us to remember what unites us.  For if these poor hairless things could find it in them to unite in worship, so wildly different from each other, then what was our excuse?  

It was like being dropped in a cold spring in the depths of the coldest winter.  It shocked us all into waking up.  

The wars shut down because no one was willing to fight.  We had too many other things to do now.  

People were making rough facsimiles of the stringed instruments shown there, and other more adventurous people were trying their hands at the bizarre keyed flute instruments. 

It's been twenty years and our best computers cannot make sense of the language, but it doesn't matter.  It's a new world now, inspired by a three minute homily.  

Maul'leh reached down and delivered us through the joyful song.

Our once-mocked department is now the most well-funded from all the United Tribes now.  A friendly competition now, to see which nation will be the first to build a ship to send out into space to find this race that saved us from ourselves.  

I wonder sometimes.  Did they know?  Did Maul'leh touch them, too?  Inspiring them to put to song and voice something that would save us all these thousands of years later?  

Are they still out there?  I hope so.  I hope I get to meet one of them before I die.  And talk about Maul'leh and how she brought us all together.  

Oh blah dee, Oh blah dah to you too.  

*The following is the original song, unedited.  Thanks be to Maul'leh and Her servants everywhere, on Erral and beyond.*

**Demographics:** White gay guy from normie state, big public high school that is basically an American high school stereotype

**Intended Major(s):** Computer science (yeah...)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1570 SAT (800 math, 770 reading and stuff)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 4.0 UW 4.71 W, school doesn't rank

**Coursework:** 5s on Chem, CSP, CSA, US Gov, Bio, Calc BC, Lang, Spanish Lang, taking Physics C, Stats, Lit + dual enrollment math rn. Mostly top rigor except social studies, all As.

**Awards:** 

Don't have nutty awards: 

National cyber award (not as good as it sounds, they gave out like 1000) 

National merit 

AP Scholar w/ Distinction

Basic GIAC cyber certification

Other than that, have some school awards for math/CS, honor roll and all that jazz, a not-very-impressive team robotics award, some other cyber things here and there. 

**Extracurriculars:** 

Summer internship with Fortune 100 company, kinda lucked into an interview off of their coding contest, the big kahuna of the app I guess.

Team captain for robotics, lots of time and it's a blast but we're pretty mid

Co-President for cybersecurity club, do CTFs and teaching and stuff

Varsity Tennis, have a couple team state championships and a doubles state championship, not good enough to play for college unless it's a really crappy D3 school.

Teach a free coding class on the weekends + did some free COVID tutoring

Umpired baseball 9-10th grade

Have tutored/given tennis lessons for $$

NHS

**Essays/LORs/Other:** 

Got one LOR from a CS teacher who thought I was CS Jesus, another one from English teacher who was super chill and is probably good.

I think my Common App essay is pretty fire, people who read it really like it, supplementals are probably good enough, idrk.

I do need financial aid, my family basically had 0 income during COVID.

**Schools:** (no ED)

I'm basically applying to my state school that's still pretty solid (\~60th in CS), I would still be happy at and I will very very likely get into with merit money, a couple total safeties, and then just shooting my shot at a bunch of hard ones

Hard ones: CMU, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Cornell, UW, UIUC, WashU, Harvey Mudd, Swarthmore, UMD.

thanks so much!!"

I almost feel a sense of anger and disdain for developers with the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù prefix that call themselves professional but soil the profession with copy-and-pasted code, poor design, and a general lack of care for quality and performance.

It‚Äôs a question of when you will make it‚Äù. 

For some previous background on me, I go to a T30 CS school and currently a 3rd year student. I had zero SWE intern experience (had 2 previous tech related internship), basic projects, and very surface level understanding of CS topics.  Only thing I had going for me was good GPA and 400 LC (grinded over 80 days). I applied to 200+ places late September and only received rejections for the first month. I was defeated and was at the lowest point in my life. Felt I wasn‚Äôt good enough and was about to give up. But I kept going and rolled with the punches. Just this last weekend, I was able to get my dream position and I never felt more proud of myself. 

Trust me. Keep going. You‚Äôll make it eventually as long as you don‚Äôt stop now. 

Also, if anyone needs general advice for the search, my DMs are open."

yhxvnl,1,2022-10-30,Should I transfer?,Amristars,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yhxvnl/should_i_transfer/,"I can't stop thinking about it, so any perspective you could offer would be super appreciated! Sorry about the length, I've been arguing with myself about this in my head for a long time.

For context, right now I am a freshman at a school about 16 hours away from home. If I did transfer, it would be to a school very close to home (like 5 minutes away).

My reasons for possibly transferring:

-- The school I would be transferring to is cheaper. Even if I received no scholarship or aid money, it would be at least 10k cheaper per year than the school I'm at now (including my current scholarship). I don't think I took the cost seriously enough when I first decided, but now it's become a pretty big concern for me.

-- My sister has always struggled with mental illness, and recently both her mental and physical health have been pretty bad (she has had to go to the ER multiple times). It kills me to be so far away from her. I have always been able to understand and support her in ways other people can't, and I want to be able to be there for her. In addition, she has been struggling a lot with college, and she has said before that me going to the same college as her would help her do things like live in the dorms, make connections, and just feel more comfortable in general. I feel like I can do this without giving up my own life and independence.

-- I always planned on getting jobs and internships back home during the summer rather than staying where my college is. Being close to home already would just make that whole process easier, as well as the possibility of keeping the same job/internship part-time during the school year.

-- This may just be a lie I'm telling myself, but I feel like I might be more willing to step out of my comfort zone at home. Part of the reason I moved so far away was to try to force myself out of my shell (I'm very shy + have social anxiety), which has sort of worked. I've pushed myself a lot and I've definitely grown. However, I feel like pushing myself so much just to exist here leaves me with no energy to push towards things that I actually want beyond my everyday life, if that makes any sense.

-- I would have more to do and more access because I would have both a bike and a car (somewhat) at my disposal in a bigger town. Here, I can only walk (for now at least) so I rarely leave campus. When I do, there is still not much because it is a pretty small town. Plus, I already know a lot of opportunities in my hometown, such as the shelter that I loved volunteering at.

-- I would be able to see my family much more often. They are my world, and I have missed them so much. I know everybody misses their family when they go to college, but I don't know if missing out on four years of time with them is worth it, especially if I don't make any connections in college. Right now, I don't have any friends, and I am so incredibly lonely. And it's small, but I miss my dog a ton.

-- I was always planning on moving back home after college, unless something changed during that time. It would be a little sad to spend a lot of time making connections here just to lose them when I graduate.

-- It's small, but I like the location back home a lot more than where I am now.

And now reasons not to transfer:

-- I'm not sure if all my credits would transfer. I know that's a big thing to consider, but I'm nervous to take a real step towards transferring by contacting an admissions person at the other school. I have looked at Transferology, but it didn't know for most of my courses. I am fairly confident I could make up the credits necessary to graduate on time even if they didn't transfer, but I don't want to feel like I wasted my time here.

-- I would be leaving behind the connections I have already made here. I don't have any friends, but I do have people who know me that I see fairly often. I'm on an ultimate frisbee team with lots of really nice people, and although the other school has one too, it makes me sad to think of leaving them behind. I also joined a really wonderful and accepting religious community with more super nice people that I would miss seeing if I transferred.

-- I would have to tell everyone. I really hate the thought of this. I don't tell people my favorite band, much less something like this. I don't even know how I would explain it, and I would have to do that over and over again. Plus, everyone would probably think that I just got scared and homesick and gave up.

-- The school I'm at now is a higher tier school, both in general and for my major. I believe it has a higher job placement as well. It feels a little like a failure to go from a pretty good school to one of my safe schools.

-- I already signed a housing contract with my current roommate to room together again next year, and I don't want to leave her in the lurch. She wanted to stay roommates because she already knows me and I'm super quiet and chill all the time, so me leaving would mess all that up for her.

-- Similar to other things I've already said, but I would have to start over with a lot of things, like making connections, planning my path of study, finding resources on campus, etc.

-- I feel like I'm wasting my family's kindness and resources. They paid for me to go here, paid for flights to visit the campus beforehand and flights to come back home during the holidays, sent me care packages and college merch, and have really supported me in every way during this transition. I don't want them to feel like it was all for nothing, or that I take their kindness for granted in any way.

I'm sure I've missed some things, but this gives a general impression of my situation. I know part of the answer is probably waiting a little longer to see if I adjust, but this has just been weighing so heavily on my mind. I have also been questioning my career and life path, and with so many unknowns, I feel like I don't have anything really solid to work for right now, and it's making me almost completely lose motivation. I feel very empty a lot of the time right now and I've been crying a lot more than usual. Thinking about going home makes me feel a little more alive, but I'm worried that I'm pinning my happiness on circumstances rather than making it my own responsibility.

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read through my mess of thoughts and I would really love any advice you have to offer!"

I've already taken the data structures and algorithms class, so I have a decent understanding of such topics. That being said, a lot of my friends have been doing leetcode for months now, and I've barely done 5. When I tried it for the first time a week ago, some of them were super easy, but most of the ""medium"" difficult ones, I find are difficult for me.

My dilemma is, whether I should wait a month or two more so that I can do more leetcode, then apply to these internships (so I don't fail the online assessments), or if I should just start applying right now. My friend tells me that I should just start applying now, but I want advice from people on this subreddit.

I attended community college for a semester, but school just wasn't my thing since I didn't know what to do. I have come to the conclusion that I want to work in the IT industry and perhaps become a network administrator or engineer. My initial plan was to quit my current job and look for a entry level helpdesk job, but most companies are looking for experienced workers. I have very little knowledge about computers, all I've done is build my gaming pc and that's nothing compared to what others my age have achieved or learned.

I was introduced to a 1-year program called year up, pretty much you're in a class learning about your occupation for 6 months and then intern for a company for another 6 months. The program will choose which company best suits you. I was skeptical at first, but my sister's roommate graduated from the program and has a stable job as a data analytic. I am currently writing my essay for the program and after the interview I'll wait to see if I'm accepted.

My other option is joining the military not just for an IT career, but for the benefits too. I'm not to familiar with the army's IT mos besides information system technology, but I'm just looking for some opinions and advice because I'm very lost and confused in life right now.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I'm also very slow and forgetful with everything in life which makes me think the military wouldn't be the best place for me."

For context, i'm studying a double degree in Software Eng(Hons) + CompSci at Monash University. I've just finished my 4th year, and i've got 3 semesters left since I took 3 units this sem (and am planning on continuing to do so for the remaining semesters if i stay).


I've just been offered to be kept on at a relatively small company after an internship as a fullstack SE. They are planning on training me on becoming a full on QA Engineer. This company is full of young but extremely capable engineers, and coming from zero experience just 4 months ago, I feel like the learning pace here is astounding, even more so than what my peers at uni get at their placements. The company's contract requires minimum 4 days a week, which is what I've been doing but it has been difficult to juggle with uni and life.

My end goal is to have a stable, (high paying hopefully) career, but this juggling of full time uni and work has been really, really tough on my mental health and relationships. I just need advice as to whether I should take a gap year, or early exit my uni, or do the opposite of dropping this workplace and smashing out the next 18 months for uni.

I'm leaning towards getting out of uni asap, but would love to hear some advice.

Thanks!"

I‚Äôm currently an international second-year CS student at an Australian Uni. I may have the option to choose between different internship positions at the end of this year (in both AUS and my home country in Southeast Asia) but am not sure about which one I should pick. I have a few options because I‚Äôve been applying for months to any and everywhere, even if they‚Äôre a far cry from being prestigious. This might seem like a ‚Äúcounting eggs before they hatch‚Äù situation but I only have a few days to make up my mind once I receive the outcomes of all my applications so I‚Äôd love your opinions!

I currently have two offers: 
1. A web dev/ analytics intern position at an Edtech startup. A bunch of their stuff is hosted with AWS so that would be good exposure, also the people there seem nice 

2. An AI engineer internship position at an AI/telecommunications company, I‚Äôll be working on a NLU project

but there is also potential for two other options: 

3. A data analyst intern position at a startup for an app that just launched this year. Really small company with seemingly nice people, also with a bit of exposure to AI 

4. An Australian research internship at a biomedical institute where I‚Äôll be doing data engineering/ visualisation. Mainly Python, R, PowerBI. The main plus point here is that it‚Äôs the only offer I might get from an Aussie company (all other offers are from SEA companies). It‚Äôs also the only unpaid position tho.

All of these positions are for 3 months. I don‚Äôt really care too much about pay cos I just wanna learn and gain experience in any field of personal interest.

TLDR: what factors are most important to consider when choosing between internship options? Field (AI, Web dev, data analytics, data engineering), prestige (Aussie vs SEA companies, or size of company), prospects, payment, flexibility, people, tech stacks, etc.?

Personally it‚Äôs AI &gt; data analytics &gt; Web dev &gt;= data engineering in terms of interest for me. I would do a masters in AI in the future if I ever fully decide on pursuing it."

Background:

My parents are very overbearing and love to overstep into my life (although I'm pretty sure they don't see it as overstepping boundaries and that they have the right to). 

My mom gets mad whenever I don't follow her rules or ask her for permission (I am 25 and fully financially independent and living on my own). She wants me to share my location with her, but knowing what she's doing with my brother (18 years old), she is going to stalk my location multiple times in an hour, text me why I am at a certain location, not sleep because I am out at night, etc. She wants me to ask for permission to do things such as traveling with my friends, having a friend over, which apartment I should live in, my career, etc. She also wants me to ""give"" my brother an internship. There have been multiple times when she just expects me to drop whatever I'm doing to help my brother, and then gets mad when I am busy.

My dad wants to control my finances and thinks he's an expert in finance (even though I am the business major). He wants me to buy a house in the NYC area, which I do not want to because a) I can't afford it, b) I'm not sure if I want to even settle here, and c) the HOA fees and maintenance fees to the apartments (that he approves of) is way too high and renting is actually a more affordable option. He gets mad at me when I decide to invest in index funds/mutual funds with my 401k and brokerage account, and tells me that I don't know anything about managing my money. 

I really don't want to cut them off because they are my parents, but they really need to learn boundaries. Does anyone have experience in how they managed to set these boundaries?"

Because of this, I'm trying to prioritize TC + benefits, location, culture, interesting work, and good internship program. For context, I interned at Meta last summer.

* Uber (NYC)
   * $52/hr, $1700/mo housing, Uber credits, cell phone stipend, meals
   * Pros
      * good location, can just live at home/close to home
      * good benefits (not sure about TC though for new grad)
      * team seems pretty cool (matched to Maps team)
      * probably the most resume value?
      * not a startup anymore, but still fast growth like a startup
      * allegedly not suffering within this economy, so not too worried about job in the future
   * Cons
      * seems to have the least interesting internship program (haven't heard a lot from former interns and the recruiter didn't seem to advertise it very well)
      * company business model is unprofitable (from what I've heard), so not sure what that means in the long run
      * was aggressively recruiting from my school for no reason, not sure why? but this was giving me meta vibes lol
* Convoy (Seattle, WA)
   * $60/hr, $2500/mo housing, commuting credits, meals
   * Pros
      * late-stage unicorn, no IPO yet, will different experience than my previous internship
      * Problem space is quite unique, will probably have really meaningful and impactful work to do
      * super small internship program, interns get catered to well
   * Cons
      * startup, so will unstable in this economy, apparently layoffs were recently happening
      * worst TC and fewest benefits, probably because it's in WA though
      * don't really want to live in Seattle
* Twitch (San Francisco, CA or Seattle, WA)
   * $52/hr, $2425/mo housing, meals, unlimited PTO, rainforest discounts/benefits
   * Pros
      * good benefits and good TC out of undergrad, as it's supported by a larger company
      * seems to be a cool internship program
      * use the product frequently, so I care about what I'm working on
   * Cons
      * the whole twitch thing is kind of going down the shitter (due to recent controversies)
      * location meh
      * rainforest company, not sure how this plays into the culture, but it seems more chill at Twitch
* Pinterest (remote for internship, headquarters in San Francisco, CA )
   * $51.92/hr
   * Pros
      * pretty high TC out of undergrad, I think (according to levels), but mid benefits
      * seems to be a well-supported internship program despite it not being in-person
   * Cons
      * no support for relocation due to their policies (you can be in-person, but you'd have to pay those expenses out of pocket)
      * not too fond of working at another social media company

If anyone could shed light on their experiences at any of these companies, I would appreciate it as well. I'm slightly more partial to Uber, but I would be open to any other thoughts. Thank you!

yikhla,0,2022-10-31,Problems with my best friend,ZealousidealHurry398,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yikhla/problems_with_my_best_friend/,"Hello,

I've been feeling pretty bad lately and I think a big part of it is because of my friendship with my best friend. I am a 22 year old lesbian woman, and I met my best friend (a gay guy named Nick) five years ago, freshman year of college. We were originally a group of 4, although one guy left the group, and eventually there were two guys (Nick and Lucas) and me.

In second year of college, Nick and Lucas moved into a student apartment together, although due to a series of problems with Lucas, Nick and I became inseparable to an extreme level. By third year of college, Nick and I moved into a new apartment together, forgetting about Lucas, where our friendship was perfect, we made plans every day and spent a lot of time together because we were classmates as well as roommates.

That same year, Nick met a guy and they started dating, it was a crush. This is when our friendship started to drift apart, even though it was going really well. His boyfriend, let's call him Henry, I really like him and we have a lot in common. By fourth grade, Nick and I moved close to where Henry lived, although Henry spent most days at our apartment. In addition to Nick and I, we also had a friend of ours (also a lesbian), let's call her Samantha, living with us.

Samantha and Nick would often engage in joking about me (sometimes Henry would join in on those jokes as well), and doing little pranks on me as a joke (many of which I didn't like). Finally, after the end of fourth grade, Samantha left town and Henry officially came to live with us.

In the fifth year is when I started to notice that my friendship with Nick has been declining more and more. That same year, Nick started sneaking around looking for college internships in big companies in my country, and finally got an internship. I found out literally months later when he was in the selection process and he was already encouraged to tell me about it. He also hid something else from me, and it turns out that Nick, while doing the internship, found a part time job from home as a Community Manager for a small business in the city, and instead of telling me about it he decided to talk to Samantha and have them both do the job and split the salary, and I found out about it more than 6 months later because of a fight Nick and Samantha had.

Nick urged me to also apply to be an intern for the company a few months later and I got it, although I eventually ended up in a different branch from him, although we have contact sometimes at work through the internal company chat. After finishing both internship contracts we were both hired full time in our respective departments, and to this day we have very different schedules, so we don't see each other hardly, only when we get home (and sometimes not even that, as there are weeks when we have totally opposite schedules).

As of today, our friendship has been reduced to being roommates, sending each other a few posts on Instagram and little else. We never go out together, not even to make plans, and he in his free time is going out either with his boyfriend, i.e. Henry, or with his new friends/co-workers, while we see each other very little and already our relationship is almost non-existent.

Although, it's not just this. In addition to the above, she also has some hostile behaviors towards me from time to time. I recently bought a new laptop because my previous computer was somewhat obsolete (it was over 6 years old and had broken a piece overnight), and I overheard her whispering to her boyfriend that instead of saving up to buy a car I bought a new computer. And the day the laptop arrived, the first thing he said to me as soon as I passed by him (he didn't stop to look at it or ask me anything about the laptop, or anything) was ""you're going to regret it"", because my previous laptop was smaller, and this one was bigger. I have never reproached him for what he spends his money on, in fact, he himself bought a computer in a higher price range than mine two years ago and I never said anything to him.

I'm sorry to have extended myself but I honestly do not know what to do or who to talk to about this issue because he was the one I talked to when something happened to me with a friend, and today this is our friendship....

What do you think?"
yikk7y,0,2022-10-31,"An aspirant, does my degree or marks matter?",Teszaract555,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/yikk7y/an_aspirant_does_my_degree_or_marks_matter/,"I am a pretty smart guy (I know because many people told me that I have very high potential when I was growing up). I tried to write a competitive exam for some highly reputed universities in my country seeking a good course, but unfortunately due to some circumstances I ended up wasting 2 years in the process and didn't even get admission in my dream university.

I moved on from all that, and joined a pretty badly reputed community college near my house pursuing a Computer Science Engineering degree. My first year went well, and I scored good marks..... It appeared as if everything was becoming right again, but then came 2020.
The year 2020 had many things going on in my life, I was trying to get lateral entry in a great college, one of my family members got infected with COVID, etc.
Even after that year, I went through some mental issues and had one of my closest relatives die because of cancer.
Long story short, I messed up my 2nd year and 3rd year too and currently have around 15 backlogs in my entire engineering education record from which I cleared 7 till date. Now all I can do is, perform well in my 4th year (just started), and clear all my backlogs (which I am very confident I can do). 

But the issue I am facing is that I am not eligible for many campus placement interviews because of my backlogs and drop years I have taken. I was really afraid about the future of my career if this is the start, so I decided to look for my options.

Somewhere on the internet I found that high paying cyber security jobs don't really require a degree if you have certifications like OSCP and CSH (don't know how much true that is). If it's true, I am in a better condition I guess because I have a degree.....if I just crack one of those exams, I could increase my market value. According to my research, OSCP is a very tough exam and I would require at least 2 years of experience in cyber security to crack it. Starting in my 4th year of the degree, and studying one more year while I do an internship in some startup, I will probably be ready by 2025, so I will write it then. 

Just wanted to confirm if it's true that exams like OSCP are so valuable that you don't even require a degree to get a high paying job if you cracked it?
Can someone who personally did it, share their experience?

Would it make sense for me to switch my career from software development to cyber security just for the sake of a high paying job (I have interest in both right now, I have tried both a little bit)? Like are cyber security jobs in general better paying than a software development job? 

If I consider pursuing a masters degree in future, would cracking the OSCP help in the admission process?"

Chevron is Data engineering instead of SWE (I feel like that's still pretty similar though? I honestly have no clue)

Similarly, I'm getting 2 of my LORs from college professors, so do I need to mention the courses I completed under them and their name just to emphasize their involvement in my career or will a mention of only the relevant courses and projects (without their names) do?

Apologies if this is redundant. I am really struggling with bringing down the word count.


More details:

I am applying to MS in CS and have done 3 technical internships in domains like Deep learning, Big Data and Core backend. I also have full time experience in Big Data.

I have obviously included them all in my resume, but I don't think the backend development internship (it was a 6 month internship if that matters) is too relevant to the MS specialisation I am applying to which is more DL-AI oriented and I need to reduce my word count on my SOP."

Currently I'm trying to decide if I should continue doing Android development for new grad.

Pros:

- It is much easier to get into a company's pipeline if they offer Android (Pinterest, Google, Meta, etc.)
- Kotlin/Android clearly teaches me SWE (design patterns, OOP, tangible product)
- I can actually understand Android dev articles when I read them for fun

Cons:

- Unsure if pursuing Android would lock me out of alternative niches in the futures (Backend, web, systems)
- Would a company hire me in the future even if they don't do Android/mobile?

Anyone know how it is for an Android dev out there?"

Many assignments seem too trivial (little java programs for OOP courses, etc) and as a first year I'm not yet at a place where I have any notable completed projects of my own. (though I have some ideas and will get there in time)

I have a search and replace program in C which recursively looks through the current directory and any subdirectories for .txt files, which it reads and changes any 'target word' matches to upper case in the file.

Would this be worthy of including at this stage or better to have nothing for now and work on a more notable project? Thank you"

I am located in Idaho in the United States if that information is relevant. 

In 2018 I went to a state university studying computer science. During my time there I got an internship through the school doing some web application work that I worked for 2 semesters. In 2020, with the COVID pandemic hitting my state hard I went back home to finish my second year online. Online classes on top of depression caused me to do poorly and I decided to take a step back from school until I was in a healthier position to continue. This also ended my internship as I was no longer a student 

Soon thereafter I was offered a job in a field unrelated to computer science that I worked at until recently. Unfortunately with my current living situation and being newly jobless I don't have the financial stability to return to school in the immediate future. My passion is programming but with an unfinished degree and minimal experience it has seemed impossible to get in the door for an entry level position or internship. With my internship I am confident I have the skills required as well as an incredible eagerness to learn but don't know if I'm wasting my time trying to get a programming position or if I should just push my efforts to finishing school with an unrelated job in the meantime.

Big fear.,Gumenopus_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yiqxqu/moving_to_another_company_for_the_first_time_big/,"I joined this company when I was 16 as an intern. Now, with 3 YOE, I'm joining another company for the first time. It's a big and well-known company in where I live, so in theory it is a good place to work.

However, I'm concerned by the fact that I never focused on a single technology during this time. Started with Android development, then front-end and finally (something that I always wanted) back-end development. I know this isn't necessarily bad, but the thing to keep in mind is that I'm not a master-mind on any technology.

I have a good experience with back-end development in general (DevOps too), but only 6 months working full-time with .NET - which is the role I applied for on this company.

Since I'm joining as a mid-level developer, I'm afraid of not being able to handle all the work. I consider myself a good developer, but my fear is stronger.

Can I consider myself a mid-level developer even having only 6 months of experience with .NET, but being considerable good with programming, good practices and algorithms? Did I do wrong for applying to a mid-level position?"

Everything was great, we used a modern tech stack composed of Angular for the frontend and primarily used Google Cloud Platform as a SAAS backend along with some other technologies. I eventually accepted an offer to start full time after graduation in May of 2022. Since this is such a small company with a small dev team I pretty much assumed the same responsibility as an intern as I did during the full time position.

About a month into my full time position there was pretty much a mass purge of the entire development department and the only two people left were me and one other developer mostly because we were in our early 20's (I was 21 at the time, now 22) and paid the least. With our new boss we are now developing with a stack composed of Visual Basic .net Framework 4.8 (not even .net core) with a backend of sql server. At to be frank from what I have seen of .net, we are not even using any design patterns, just razor pages which I am not a fan of compared. Side note, I also have no relevant actual .net development experience.

I feel like the technology I am using now compared to that in my internship just looks very bad on a resume. Now because I only used what I consider the relevant stack for a 1 month period during my now 6 months as a full time employee.

I was wondering what benefits and downsides there might be of listing my intern and full time employment and one big experience instead of two separate experiences (I have no professional DEV experience outside of this), and how would be best to list this entire experience best to obtain future jobs?

Again, I feel like this current tech stack I am using will negatively impact my ability to get jobs with modern tech stacks when it is 90% of my full time experience and not at all what I want to be working with.

I have been applying to jobs and internships nonstop for many months but I cannot even get one single interview. I don't have any previous job experience related to this field but worked on multiple large projects for school. This is also shown on my LinkedIn profile which I submit in my job applications.

I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I feel like the resume I made looks good but I am not having any success at all whatsoever. I performed well in college to the point that my classmates would come to me all the time and ask for help with assignments. I know many people who obtained a degree in Software Development/Engineering and received interviews/jobs right away without any actual experience. This includes some of the people that I always helped in college. Why is it different for me?
