I'm considering Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands or Finland cause they feel really modern and open societies, fit well my professional field along with high wages, speak English, and are said to be beautiful and comfy place to live. 

I'd like to hear what Wikipedia won't tell me, how it's like to live where you live.
For instance I love it when it's easy and very common to go around by bike, with few cars.
Proximity with natural landscapes, mountains, seas, lakes, etc is also really much enjoyed. I like the cold weather as long as it's dry too.

How do people see foreigners, and is it possible to lead a pretty seamless social life ? Feel free to report about your own experience of your city, youth life, activities, sightseeing, etc. Also, how hard is your language to learn, knowing French, English and German ?

Consider as well that I first need to find a internship in IT research, embedded systems, or automation engineering. As such can I expect a wage sufficient to fully support myself there ? And are placements seen as part of a career plan or a single mission by itself ? I'd appreciate any tip on how to find it."

For the past 3 months, I have been interning for Company 1.  They make household products (this is an important detail).  I've been looking for a full-time job the whole time, and my supervisors knew this.  Company 1 had an opening that I applied to, and they interviewed me for this position.  It took over a month to interview internally as they scheduled me in for a total of 8 interviews before they gave me an offer last Friday.

During the interview process, I applied to other jobs and landed an interview with Company 2.  They make consumer electronics.  They asked me to come in this past Tuesday for an interview.  So, when Company 1 gave me an offer, I asked them if they could wait until Tuesday for an answer as I had another interview coming up.

At the interview, I found out that the hiring manager for Company 2 is an ex-VP from Company 1.  I thought it was neat because it gave us something to talk about.  It took one interview for Company 2 to decide that they wanted to give me an offer.  I had been mulling over Company 1 and Company 2 for awhile, so I knew when Company 2 offered me the job that I wanted it because it fits with my career goals better than the role at Company 1.

So, I told the HR manager, hiring manager, and my supervisor at Company 1 that I had decided to go with Company 2 and that I would be working with the ex-VP.  I told them this at the end of the day on Tuesday because I knew they needed to move forward with their back up candidate.

Well, I got a phone call today saying that yesterday was my last day with Company 1 because they did not feel comfortable with me there.  My internship is supposed to end next week.  They told me the reason was because:

* 1) I am going to go work for a competitor and I signed a non-compete agreement.  I was shocked because I had no idea they were competitors... household products vs. consumer electronics?  Am I missing something?

* 2) They told me I should have been more forthcoming with them about my other interview, especially since I was an internal candidate.  They did not appreciate that I told them about the interview until after the offer.  I also think I'm missing something here... I always assumed that you didn't need to tell an interviewer that you have other interviews until you get an offer?

Anyway, I'm supposed to go in later today to go collect my belongings and turn in my time sheet.  I apologized on the phone because I had no idea they were competitors and the HR manager essentially told me to chalk this up as a learning experience.  But... I don't get it.  What was I supposed to learn?  All the people I talked to at Company 1 didn't know Company 2 was a competitor either.  What good would have come if I was more upfront about my other interviews?

Is there something I'm missing here?

**tl;dr I was told that my internship was being terminated 3 days before my true end date.  They told me to take it as a learning experience because I'm going to work for a competitor, even though they don't compete in the same product lines or market.  What am I supposed to be learning??**"

I was working for a large engineering firm for the first two summers of my college career but the economy tanked and they couldn't bring me back for the 3rd year. I reapplied but didn't back on there or anywhere else for that matter. 

I am a good student (3.55GPA overall). I am involved in a hand full of groups and clubs mainly related to engineering. Outside of that I am an amateur programmer and tinkerer. I am taking graduate level classes as an undergrad and I am thinking about grad school.

Last year I worked my ass off looking for an internship. I was in and out of the engineering career center, writing cover letters, and perfecting my resume. I went to the engineering career fair on campus and spoke to the companies I was/am interested in. I sent follow up letters but still came up with nothing, most of them didn't even reply one way or the other. 

I am disheartened, I thought that by doing exceedingly well in an accredited engineering program I would be able to easily find an internship and eventually full time work.

I have tried the conventional way of getting hired for a few years now: what tips do other students or hired engineers have?"

I have no student debt, thankfully, so that isn't an issue.

I know that most majors say that your major gets really interesting after you get through all the pre-requisites you have to take around sophomore year.

This has not been the case for me.

The more classes I take in my computer science major, the more I realize it isn't for me. There are little things here and there that I find interesting, but for the most part I couldn't care less about the logic of low-level software or parsing or the big-O running time of algorithms. 

It isn't that I don't want the degree; it's that I hate the subject material, and if I'm already disliking what they're making us do in school, I certainly wouldn't look forward to doing it as a full-time job. Furthermore, my GPA is tanking pretty badly (as in, &lt; 2.0), thanks to lack of interest, and I've only got a year to try to bring it up, so applying for internships or grad school is pretty much out of the question at this point.

I'm wondering if I should try to cut my losses at this point, grab a high-school job, and try to discover what I really would like to pursue while working rather than struggling through a year of working on assignments that feel to me like pulling teeth and graduating badly trained for an industry I'm not interested in working in.

Advice? :)

Basically, I'm a third year engineering student (Mechanical, for anyone who is wondering) at a highly ranked engineering school in the US. I'm paying out of state tuition so I have amassed a nice pile of debt coming to this school. And it really hasn't paid off. My GPA is above passing but not by too much (to be fair, it was much better at the start of this year). I won't be able to get an internship this summer due to how low my GPA is. My parents are continuously on my case because I probably won't be able to get a job even when I do graduate. I've tried talking to my counselor here and he's basically brushed it off saying to just work hard.

That's basically the problem. I work my ass off. I don't drink, I don't party, I don't do anything stupid. I have friends bugging me because I haven't spent much time with them in the past year (its hard too when you lock yourself in a room/run away to the library to study). I go to study groups (whenever I can find one), I go to office hours, etc. But regardless, my grades just don't reflect what I've put into my classes. 

So, basically, I have no clue what the heck I'm doing anymore. I have no clue what I should do from here on out. Any suggestions would be great Reddit.

I've applied online, called, emailed, and actually gone into some places, but to no avail. No one will even give me the opportunity to come and interview for a position. 

I'm looking for work in the health/ fitness industry - I have a degree in clinical exercise science with a minor in nutrition. I'm looking to work in more of a wellness type setting (fitness center with ntrition counseling, psych support, massage therapy, ect....).

There are tons of places like this in Philadelphia (which is where I am looking for work), but it's been impossible for me to actually find work! It's so frustrating, because I have bills to pay and my college loans looming over me; and, because of the loans I cannot afford a minimum wage type job (seriously, I have $120,000 in loans!).

k9x5u,1,2011-09-09,To what kind of jobs should I be applying? (Cross-post from Red Stick),[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k9x5u/to_what_kind_of_jobs_should_i_be_applying/,"I quit my private school job voluntarily in May (or rather chose not to renew my contract) in an attempt to try to find a better paying one, but teacher jobs in the area are pretty frozen. It is extremely difficult to look for a job while having another in teaching.

Let me give you some background:

I have been looking for work since May. I have applied to literally hundreds of jobs (had a few interviews) and am doing the state job application thing right now. I have taken and passed the Coast and PET, and apply for jobs I qualify for daily. I do everything, apply from Craigslist, local job sites, go in person with my resume, call and e-mail afterward, the whole nine yards. 

I have a degree in Secondary English Education, a teaching certificate, and am highly qualified in the state (PRAXIS I and II).

I have four years professional teaching experience. I have taught high school literature, ESL in South Korea, and 5th-8th grade social studies and ELA.

I have been a political intern for David Vitter (this may help or hinder, haha) as well as a volunteer at an orphanage.

I have excellent office/clerical/communication skills, am female, and in my mid-20s.

At this point I am just looking to pay my bills, but, of course, I would prefer something serious that pays upwards of $12 an hour if I am going to commute 2 hours a day (to bigger cities like New Orleans or Baton Rouge - I live somewhere in between them). I am realistic, however, and know personally how terrible the job market is right now.

I have to stay in the area because my husband is in college. I would prefer to pay in-state tuition. We would consider moving if I could find a decent enough job out-of-state.

A lot of potential employers don't seem to understand that I have skills beyond teaching, and that teaching is also a clerical type position in which multi-tasking is crucial. It seems like they just see ""teacher."" 

If you have any advice it would be much appreciated.

tl;dr Who would hire a former teacher and to who should I be applying?"

A little about me? Well, long story short, I'm a Web Design student finishing up in the spring. Between working to pay off debts and studying, I haven't really had much time to get together as outstanding of a portfolio as I would like to have. That said, I do have one with a handful of front-end web projects, as well as some animation! 

Where is this mysterious portfolio, you ask? Right here: http://zachgod.in 

Why I'm looking for freelance jobs? I'm currently doing an unpaid internship with a local company (as is requirement for my graduating). While I do have enough to support myself for a little bit, there's a long story that I can sum up with saying that a) I need more experience so I can build a better portfolio, and thus get better work... and b) my mother and I are going to be moving from Ontario to Birmingham in England in April, so I figured the more money helps!

**What I Do!**
HTML/CSS (including HTML5/CSS3) / Fluid &amp; Responsive layouts / Flash Animation (I don't do, or believe in, Flash sites, but if you would like one, I'm more than willing to negotiate) / Basic graphic design / Email forms / Light Javascript/jQuery / Light PHP / Adhere to web standards and practices

**What I Don't Do!**
Back-end web development / Setting up servers / Trade sexual favours for divs 


Ideally, updating websites, static pages (though I can work with setting up dynamic pages; I'm not *that* useless!), banner ads, logos, inquiry forms and more of the awesome stuff that just makes your work look good!

I'm very, very, *veeeeeeeeeeeery* easy to negotiate with when it comes to cost. For example, I'd say a static 4 page website with a simple email/inquiry form would run for $150-$175. That said, I'm not going to overcharge you. You need a project done cheap, I need experience and some money: we can help each other out!

If you're interested, fire me a PM or just email me at zachjgodin@gmail.com! Look forward to hearing from y'all!

Cheers,

kcd36,3,2011-09-11,On moving out and travelling. Would love some advice on my plans.,SturmD,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/kcd36/on_moving_out_and_travelling_would_love_some/,"I need a bit of help figuring out the next few years of my life.

Right now, this is the plan:

2011/2012: 3rd year of School.
2012/2013: ~14-16 month paid internship
2013/2014: Last year of school + part time job
2014 onwards: Work

I will turn 23 about two months after I graduate school. Right now, I live at home since I go to school at the local university. I want to continue living at home throughout the internship. 

My girlfriend and I plan to move out/get married sometime in the last year of school. Living apart and with parents is stressful, and it will keep getting more stressful as we grow older. With the internship and saved money, we should be able to put at least a $40,000 down payment on a ~$180,000 condominium.

We don't really want to rent if it means paying around the same amount per month, but for someone else's mortgage.

We plan to have children at around 30 years old, so that gives us about 7 more years after I graduate to be child-free. In those 7 years, we would love to travel around a bit.

Now, this is where I need advice. Let's say we move out in my fourth year and put $40k down. I'm not sure how much condo fees will be, nor how much a mortgage will cost. I'm also not sure if it would be a better idea to get a student loan to pay off more of the condo and pay that off instead of a mortgage.

But since we want to travel, we need to save up, too. Especially because we plan to travel for an entire year. So I'm wondering if we should travel right after I finish my last year of school instead. But then we might not have enough to move out. Also, I've noticed that people that take the internship program can sometimes get jobs right after school at the place they interned. I guess that would be cancelled, too. 

So I was considering working for around 3 years. We'd be 26 then, with a condo, and hopefully a bit saved up to go a-travelling. I would be able to quit my job if they wouldn't let me take a year off, but still have that vital experience when looking for other work.

Does this sound like a good plan..? What would you do? Does anyone know if there are specific people you can talk to about this?"
kbtbt,7,2011-09-11,"Bad grades in first year, can I still manage to get an internship?",[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/kbtbt/bad_grades_in_first_year_can_i_still_manage_to/,"I basically spent 3 years doing first year engineering courses, which were general physics, chemistry, mechanics, and some calculus, because I had to withdraw from university and attend community college. I failed most courses in first year, and my GPA in the two college years were pretty dismal as well. Probably in the low 2's.

I am now back in university, finally majoring in EE, and did okay in my second year. 76%, which for us Canadians is around a 3.3/4.0. 

Is there any way to save my ass and get an internship for the coming summer with those grades? I did not join the co-op program last year and that was the deadline, because of laziness and stupidity. I speculate that my grades will be even higher this year, so I'm hoping the fact that I am doing okay in actual EE-related courses will help a little. Any ideas?"

kctfv,31,2011-09-12,Has any engineer found a job with a GPA lower than a 3.0 when they graduated?,whaddddda,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/kctfv/has_any_engineer_found_a_job_with_a_gpa_lower/,"I'm a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering.  Right now I'm freaking out about my future because I'm afraid that I won't find a job with my low GPA. My current GPA is a 2.5.  

I know I'm not a lazy person.  I have a very good work ethic.  I work very hard.  I have a few jobs to help pay for school and I also had an internship this past summer.  Even my professors can say that although I do make mistakes, I work very hard and always put effort in my work. 

Although I'm hard working, I'll admit I've made plenty of mistakes.  The reason why my GPA is low is because I used to major in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering because I did not know which engineering discipline I wanted to go to.  It was the second half of my sophomore year that I found that Electrical Engineering was my calling.  

Upon switching, I struggled with the courses because my advisor told me to start off by taking the junior level courses instead of taking the sophomore level courses first. Now that I'm a senior, I'm making up the sophomore level courses (which is extremely easy now that I went through the junior level first) and taking my senior level courses (which isn't so bad since the workload is light compared to junior year).  

Anyway, I'm worried that companies won't even look at my resume because my GPA is low.  Having this GPA is also killing my self esteem for finding a job.  

How can I convey myself to these companies that I'm a hard worker and possess other great skills (Interpersonal skill, organizational skills ect)?

Is there anyone who have found a job with a GPA lower than a 3.0?  If you have, then how did you get there?"

I thought the interview process went very well and I ended up getting the offer. 

However, due to unforeseen circumstances (family issues), I ended up saying that I cannot join as an intern due to these reasons. And that was it...

I did not hear a single thing from them after that. No confirmation. No nothing. I recall writing that I am still interested in working the following winter of the following summer. Still nothing.

I sent them another email stating that I would still like to be in touch with Silicon Labs (even emailing the interviewer), still nothing. It was as if they hated me passionately.

Is this right? Do other companies treat their rejected interns like this? I know that I don't amount to much, but I feel like I am entitled to some dignity (especially after seemingly doing so well in the interviews).

This is not a throwaway, because I'm not ashamed of anything I'll put here. I'm a 20-year-old software developer studying Computer Science at a highly-rated public institute, and I'm starting to regret everything.

I've burned out from three summers of codemonkey internships in a row, and I no longer have the motivation to further myself; I'm resigned to simply sludging on until I get my degree and then who knows what after that.

I've abandoned most of my friends, to the point that the only people who really know me at all are my roommates (who, granted, are awesome). I spend my free time playing League of Legends and Eve, and am a night owl.

My ex-high-school-sweetheart is dating ""that other guy"" from high school who I always disliked, and seemingly blissful; I, on the other hand, am miserable, lonely, and a train wreck.

I'm at extreme odds with my father but not my mother, which leads to a ridiculous amount of family tension that just makes me hate going home, and I feel like I really have no support system or solid friends at all. The last girl I emotionally invested in ended up using me for homework help and ditching me once I switched majors and was not in her classes anymore. I feel afloat and horrifyingly alone.

I'm not sure how many of you have been in my position, but if you have... What the hell did you do to get out of it? Is there even anything I **can** do to get out of this?

Any kind of advice would be appreciated, if only to know someone out there is actually taking notice of my existence."

I'm a newly minted college grad who is lucky enough to have found a job as a software engineer at a fairly big company.  One of the other new hires has been repeatedly been insulting and unpleasant to talk to.  If it matters, I'm a guy, and she's a girl.  

Examples:

* She suggested that I get a better face 

I'm not very handsome, but she decided to say this to me in front of another co-worker.  I laughed it off at the time, but obviously I found it insulting.  

* She told me about how she mistook a 40 year old guy for me.  

implying that I look nearly 20 years older than I am.  She thought it was pretty funny

* repeatedly mentions that she dislikes me.  

She has said a few other things while we were interns together.  It's long enough ago that I don't clearly remember exactly what she said, but I remember it was not nice.  


Situation(continued):
We do not work directly together.  Our teams are only tangentially related.  Sometimes we end up in the same lunch group, but I've noticed she's more guarded about what she says to me when others are around.  I do my best to sit as far away from her as possible.  

So these are my options, as I see it:

* talk to her about it.  

This could work, but I'm worried that she will be encouraged by knowing that she 'got to me'

* Talk to her manager about it

He was my manager during my internship.  He's a good guy but I'm not sure how he would handle it.  My best guess is that he would talk to her about it and tell her to knock it off.  

* Talk to my manager about it

I'm not sure what he would do.  I'd guess that he would either recommend that I speak with HR or try to handle it on his own by talking to her manager.  

* Talk to HR

I read the handbook, there is a zero tolerance policy here.  I'm a little worried that this would be making too big a deal of it, and that they might not do much about it since I don't really have any proof.  Other than one witness.  

* Do nothing and avoid her.  

This is doable.  I'm still going to run into her occasionally in the hall or lunch.  


I haven't had any problem like this except for when I worked with some asshole during a summer job in highschool.  Back then I ignored it because I was quitting in a week anyways, but I'm looking to have a long career here.  With my luck she's trying to do the same.  

This is a difficult situation for me.  She's the only fly in the ointment at an otherwise awesome job.  What the fuck should I do?  

edit:

looks like the consensus is that I should either take it up with HR or she is trying to flirt with me (do **not** want).  thanks for the help.  And I'll keep watching this for a while even though It's fallen off the 'new' page.  "

I graduated in '07 with a degree in Aero Engineering and have not been able to land an engineering position since graduation. While in school, I did a pretty extensive internship (3 years) with an aerospace company and gained some pretty good experience with satellite communications/telemetry/mission planning/pre launch..etc.. I was not offered a job at the company by the end of my internship though ( I still had a 1.5 years left to graduate). Once I graduated I applied and interviewed for many positions within my field but ultimately was not chosen. So instead of staying unemployed I started to work in IT. Ive worked for a few companies since graduation but all have been in the IT field. 


The problem is that I am getting less and less call backs for engineering positions and I feel its because my resume being full of IT/helpdesk/sys admin work. I recently started grad school and im working towards a masters in EE in hopes of giving me some sort of edge over other candidates (i live in DC so the market is saturated with people who have more years of experience than ive been alive).

I enjoyed this position but then the IT guy left the company.  Thinking this was my dream job i promptly applied and was given the position.  it was a ""jack-of-all-trades"" position (programming, support)  I enjoyed it for a while but found the on-call aspect very annoying.  The programming aspect also became annoying as the software i was maintaing was written in VB6 with an access backend.  I approached the manager on many occasions to try to talk to him about updating to a more maintainable system, request denied.  So i stick it out and try my best but i slowly lose interest in anything IT realated.

Fast forward to a year ago... I had met a girl through a friend that lived 4 hours away.  We hit it off and soon i found myself making the drive every weekend to see her.  We get engaged and I am able to find a job in her area doing web development.  I take the job and find that even though I'm not trying to keep a bad system maintained  (which i thought was why i hated my old job), I still do not get satisfaction out of my career.  

I don't feel as if i can get a job in a field outside of IT because I really have no experience anywhere else.  The upside is that my degree is basically a Business degree with an IT emphasis so maybe that would help.  

I basically want a job that i can leave everyday feeling like I accomplished something and it feels like anything in the IT field doesn't give me that feeling.  What should i do?"

It went pretty badly as most of them gave me some stock material (not their business cards, just company pamphlets and stuff) and told me to apply on their sites. I think it had a lot to do with the way I started off conversations. I would go up to them, give them my name, year, major, and tell them I was looking for a summer internship in software development. After that they would kind of pause and wait for me to say something else, but I was at a loss at that point. Do I start spewing all my accomplishments thus far? I get that I should be pitching myself in the best light, but I'm not sure how to do that without coming off as bragging irrelevantly about what I've done. How should I be starting off conversations with these recruiters?"

I'm a neuroscience major in my senior year of college. I'd like to enter a Ph.D. program right after I graduate, and my future goal is to research mental illness.

Ideally, what I would like to research in graduate school is neuroscience from a computational standpoint, preferably somehow related to mental illness. I'm having trouble finding programs. I've found a couple of programs I'm interested in, but I was curious if anyone out there knows of schools that have programs like this? Say, bioinformatics with a lot of neuroscience involved or vice versa?

kjvp7,13,2011-09-18,"A fat, poverty stricken girl needs help getting motivated and budgeting weight loss on $2 a day. ",FatNSassyAintClass,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kjvp7/a_fat_poverty_stricken_girl_needs_help_getting/,"I apologize in advance if the details seem too... detaily. TL;DR at bottom.

Bit of a sob-story, please bear with me: 

I'm 5' 10, and have that magical gene that keeps the fat proportioned so well that I could gain 30 lbs and not shift a pant or shirt size. This is a blessing in some ways, and a curse in most other ways, but I'll get to that in a bit.

I've been fat pretty much all of my life, except for a brief dance with adderall in sophmore year that left me at the skinniest I've ever been - 118 lbs. As soon as my doctor took me off of it, I immediately swelled back up to 200 lbs (my lifelong average). I came from a family that swore I would be fat no matter what I did, and I didn't have any friends to tell me different, or the confidence to challenge it.

The summer after highschool, I got a job that didn't require me to go out very often, and when I did go out, it was mostly to meet new coworkers that I would be coordinating online with later. For an entire year, I sat on my ass, and it soon dawned on me that something was amiss. I couldn't fit in my pants. When I went to buy clothes for the first time in forever, the weight gain finally set in. I stopped by the grocery store on the way home because of their $0.25 bathroom scale. I hadn't been on a scale in two years. 250lbs. I went home, and had another twinkie. This was last June.

Skip ahead to December, which was by far the worst month of my life. I had just lost my job while starting an unpaid, work-heavy internship, and had the worst possible miscarriage while on an IUD, that left me unable to function until February. I ballooned from 250 to 287 in a little under two months because of all of the medication, swelling, and crippling depression. 

I can't name the exact moment that I saw the light, but soon after, I pulled the proverbial handbrake and did a total 180. I started exercising, eating better, and generally taking care of myself. I pulled myself out of my funk, and today, I weigh just under 240lbs. 

I should be happy and excited. I've lost 50 lbs. But the glorious gene that kept me from noticing the weight gain, has kept me from noticing the loss as well. I don't look or feel any different. My body looks the exact same to me, and apparently it does to everyone else around me, too. My mom saw me for the first time since Christmas yesterday (when I was at my absolute heaviest). ""I can really see it in your face"" she says.

My face. I've lost 50 lbs, and the only difference it made was in my face.
If most other people lost 50lbs, the end result would be extreme. But not me. Apparently I had the head the size of a 5 year old boy, and nobody had mentioned it before.

So here I am, 50lbs later, and I realized that the savings that were supposed to get me through 2 more months of internship is gone. Without going into the the mindfuck that is Bank of America, I am completely broke and still have about 95lbs to go before I reach a modest weight for my height. The amount of internship I have is keeping me from having a part time job, and it looks like the only thing that is going to get me though the next two months is plasma donation money.



Reddit, I need an attack plan. How do I get by on literally $2 a day, lose weight, and still have the energy for my 50 hour work week internship for the next 2 months? HELP.




**TL;DR: Fatty's feeling down about the lack of difference a 50lb weight loss made, and has no clue how to survive on $2 daily while keeping up the energy for work and healthy weight loss at the same time. **

EDIT: Throwaway for the purpose of this incredibly personal post. ighest"

I noticed the worst offenders come from Taleo. They are some of the most outdated, dysfunctional online solutions I've seen recently. It's not just Taleo though. I thought that some tech firm would've developed better, cheaper software for job applications by now. It's probably that people are set in their ways, but I hope it changes as more computer-savvy people move into the workforce. Anybody have a similar experience? When an internship posting has a fully usable application, it's so much more appealing."
kkjru,3,2011-09-19,"Confused about my college and living situation, what should I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kkjru/confused_about_my_college_and_living_situation/,"So this is kind of a screwy situation I've gotten myself into. I really regret not taking a year off between high school and college to figure this out.

My situation is this:

My home state is Michigan. I went to a community college there for a year, and took on a very small federal loan to do so. After a year, I decided I would rather transfer to a bigger university, due to the fact that MI is having some big issues politically and economically, not to mention that there are very, very few computer-related jobs in the state.

So I decided to transfer to a school in Massachusetts. Lots of computer jobs here, more opportunity and it's fared well in the recession. So I go to a university here, which is $10k in federal loans per year. This is my second year, making my debt $20k so far.

Up until now, I've taken on nothing but federal loans, as those can be deferred, forbearance etc, and are generally not as ruthless as private loans. (I would hate to have to take on private loans, because if something happens to me financially, I'm screwed.)

Anyway, that's great and all. I like my school and my financial aid covers my tuition almost exactly. My problem is that I can't afford to live anywhere.

See, right now, I'm staying at my girlfriend's and her family's house. I feel incredibly guilty about this and promised them I would only stay until I'm eligible for dorming at the school. I have no doubt that I would get in spring.

Again, that seems reasonable, and they're nice people. Unfortunately, I feel that I've overstayed my welcome and that I really need to move out some place, whether it's the dorms or an apartment. So providing I get a dorm, they will expect me to move out in the spring.

So what's the problem? 

Like I said earlier: my federal loans just about equal my tuition; that is, I've maxed them out and cannot take out anymore. Room and board is another $4,500 on my bill every semester, for which I cannot get anymore federal loans for.

I have no savings, and am a full-time student, working work study at the school (which pays shit) and an internship, meaning I'm busy Mon-Fri, 8 AM to 6 PM, every week. I could get a part-time job that's nights and weekends, but nothing seems to be hiring, and even if I got one, the pay wouldn't cover half of what it would cost to dorm.

There's also private loans, which I am completely disinterested in. Even if I wanted to get one, I physically do not know anybody with good enough credit to co-sign it.

So yeah. I'm kind of fucked, if only for next semester and the coming years.

What I *really* want to do is take a year off of school, figure everything out and get some serious life experience in. Figure out my loans, figure out my job, living situation, etc. I would, but I'm worried about my loans, especially since I took them out in two different states. How does that work? Is there any way I can defer them for an entire year before going back to school?

Thanks for any advice, and if there is an appropriate subreddit for this post, let me know."

police officers couldn't care less.",orvisdriver,Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/kn3vk/driver_hit_and_injured_me_on_the_way_to_class/,"A copy of a complaint I wrote to the Philadelphia PD following the incident this morning. I have a ton of respect for cops (and want to work in law enforcement), but this guy was truly an ass to me for no reason.

I was involved in a bicycle-automobile collision at 16th and Poplar streets at about 9.45am this morning. Prior to the collision, I passed two PPD patrol cars, #934 and #935, stopped facing northbound on 16th at Parrish street, 1 block south of Poplar.
 As I was riding northbound on the right hand side of 16th street, I was struck on my left hand side by a car that suddenly turned right onto Poplar without signaling. When I was struck, I was legally proceeding north through the intersection and had the right-of-way. The car, a black Kia (PA plate # xxxxxx) operated by xxxxxxx stuck me on the left side and caused me to crash into the street, injuring both of my knees and slightly damaging my bike. The vehicle operator stopped and exited his vehicle. A bicyclist behind me (witness xxxxx, information taken by officers) called 911 to report the collision. Approximately 5-10 minutes later, PFD ambulance M-11 arrived and a medic treated the injuries to my knees. It was not until roughly 15 minutes after the initial call that the PPD cars stopped at Parrish (less than 500 feet south and in direct view of the accident) drove up the street to assist me. The first officer to arrive (and the one which I am filing a complaint about) was P/O Lewis, badge #2930 in car #934. He took both of our information and discussed what had happened. Shortly after he arrived, P/O Davis, badge #5330 drove the 500 feet up the street in car #935. P/O Lewis issued a ticket to the motorist for failure to provide insurance information, which is obviously unrelated to the collision.
 My specific complaint is that A) P/O Lewis refused to issue a citation to the motorist as a result of the incident, and B) that he was rude to me and ultimately left the scene without resolving the issue.
 Both myself and witness xxxxx noted that the black Kia did not have its turn signals on when it initiated the turn and collided with me. As per PA Title 75 §3334(b), a vehicle MUST signal their intended movement, either by turn signal or by hand, within 100 feet of the turn. Both myself and the bicyclist who was directly behind me can confirm the fact that this was clearly not done by the motorist. When I told P/O Lewis that Mr. xxxxx broke the law by not signaling his turn (thereby resulting in my crash and injury), he dismissed it and became rude when I insisted that this was the case. He repeated to me over and over again that 'I didn't see it' when I asked as to whether the motorist would be cited for failure to signal, reckless driving, or some other violation. He informed me that if he were to ticket the driver, he would ticket me as well; he gave no basis for this statement, and then decided that he quote 'won't even give you (sic) that pleasure' (presumably of giving me a ticket for lawfully riding in my right-of-way).
 Whether or not P/O Lewis saw the collision (which indeed happened in plain view of himself and P/O Davis) is immaterial as to the actual violation that occurred. For example, if a motorist runs a red light and crashes into a lawfully driven vehicle, will the offending driver not face a citation for breaking the law if an officer 'didn't see it'? This explanation is obviously insufficient, and he made absolutely no attempt to find out whether or not Mr. xxxxxx violated the law by not signaling within 100 feet of his turn, and asked 'what's wrong with you (sic)?' and also laughed at me when I reiterated that Mr. xxxxx injured me by breaking the law.
 He again ignored me when I asked if there were other options for having the driver cited or made liable in any other way for injuring me. As a former intern for the DA's Office, I am aware that one can file private criminal complaints somehow; however P/O Lewis again ignored me when I asked about this option. I also asked if I could have a copy of the 75-48 incident report, and he refused, saying 'I ain't gonna help you (sic) out' and instead gave me a DCN number on a scrap of paper. He then ignored the other questions that I had, and instead told me that he didn't like me and walked to his patrol car and left.
 I feel that the attitude and response of these officers, particularly P/O Lewis was utterly ridiculous, and that both P/O Lewis and P/O Davis failed to even attempt to enforce the traffic law. Furthermore, it is absolutely ridiculous that I was treated with such negativity and rudeness as a victim of an ignorant driver."

I have a solid GPA and have a couple years of internship experience. So, I think I should be able to get a few different job offers.

My problem is that my real passion is more for business than tech. I enjoy coding, but it is definitely not something that I want to do forever. I think I have good people skills, can write well, and don't mind speaking in front of groups. I know I would eventually like a job in some sort of managerial role, but am not sure how to best go about doing that.

Should I try for a job where I can work in a more business role right away and risk losing out on a few years of experience as a software engineer? Should I take a job with as a software engineer and then attempt to transition to a more business-like role?

How important is getting a job with a big name company? If I get a job with Microsoft or Google, would I pretty much be set? Is considering smaller companies a good idea for a first job?

I have worked really hard the past 4 years to get good grades and have solid internships. I just want to make sure that I do not waste that work by not getting the job that best sets up my career.

I am an undergrad TA, and one of my students wrote ""You don't need to be so nervous in front of us we all know how awesome you are!""

I also had an interview with a large software company last semester. I didn't make it past the first round, but the recruiter just told me that the interviewer thought my nervousness played a big part in me not getting the internship.

kobio,1,2011-09-22,Startups and Interns,prezjordan,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/kobio/startups_and_interns/,"I spent my past summer with a startup in Manhattan, doing a variety of projects from Ruby on Rails to PHP. I must say that not only was the work fun (especially for someone of my skill level), but the environment itself was absolutely fantastic. I love the fast-paced quick-thinking habitat of a startup, and I hope to work at one once I'm out of school.

How typical is this sort of behavior? For a small startup to hire a part-time college student to intern? It was a ton of fun (and I think the company got a lot out of it too!) and some great experience. Of course I'm not looking for a job in r/startups (I'll leave that to r/forhire!), but some advice for someone in my position would also be extremely appreciated!"

Throw away account, just on the off chance anyone I know sees this.

I am currently working an internship that ends on the 30th of this month. I've spent the last few weeks job hunting, with little success. After at least two weeks without any response from the places I sent my resume to, I was contact by a former employer asking if I was interested in some part time work. I know the nature of the work, but the details (how long would it last, how much would it pay, etc) were vague.

I responded and said that I was interested, but that I was still looking for permanent employment. I said that unless something suddenly comes up within the week, I would be available. My previous employer said that sounds great, and would work on the details.

About an hour after this exchange, I got a call from a prospective employer. She wanted to have a phone interview. I took the interview that day, and I believe it went really well. She said she would try and get back to me on Monday or Tuesday, to let me know if I would have a second (in person) interview. This job sounds really exciting, it's permanent, the pay is good, and I think I would love it.

So, Reddit, what's the best way to ask the previous employer to wait, while I wait to hear back from the potential employer? I think I could just drag my feet in responding until Monday or Tuesday, but that might annoy him. I don't want to just say ""yes"" to the previous employer, and then blow him off if I get the potential job. He has helped me in the past, and I do not want to burn any bridges.

Also important to note, money is tight, so NOT accepting the previous employers offer would be a big gamble that I am not sure I am prepared to make.

Thank you in advance!"

I'm not trying to trick anyone here so I'm putting that out here now. Also, experience with version control systems, especially the distributed kind like mercurial and git, is a plus.

But I've come to assume I won't be working in a security-related position right out of college, so I was looking for some suggestions as to what certifications I should get instead. I've have had multiple internships and have a decent GPA, so I think adding a few certifications would really round out my resume for a recent graduate.

I don't want to be someone relying on certifications achieved by regurgitation, I don't want to rely on knowing people, I don't want to rely on a GPA, I want to know my shit pure and simple. So help me out SysAdmin, I'd really appreciate it.

kpvxw,3,2011-09-24,advice on transferring?,alecbenzer,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/kpvxw/advice_on_transferring/,"I feel somewhat unhappy with the school I'm at. In high school I got in to 3 of the 9 schools I applied to. I ended up going for the one that I thought would be the best fit, primarily based on its rankings and reputation for my major. I've been here almost a month and I'm feeling like I'm not loving it here. It's not awful, but it's not great either, and I feel kind of like an idiot paying so much for something that doesn't feel all that right. I'm considering transferring, but my issues are that, for one thing, there are only a few schools I can think of that I want to transfer to. While I have issues with my school I don't want to sacrifice the quality of my particular department too much. This leaves me mostly with choices that all have very low transfer acceptance rates (all &lt; 5%, I think). Even a bit further down the list, things don't look so hot. The schools are all either difficult or not much different from my current school (and so not really worth transferring to). I haven't really looked at LACs, which might be an option, but I'm not sure if I'd want to go to one. I'm also wary of going through the emotional stress of applying, and especially of being rejected yet again.

My grades in high school were good, but my SATs were a little weaker (didn't really study for them). If I decide to transfer I would probably work on getting them up. I've also had (well, had/have) two internships at relatively high-profile companies since I applied (whereas before my only work experience was at a summer program my school ran).

Anyway, any advice, /r/college? Should I transfer? Ideas on figuring out where to?"
kr8um,8,2011-09-25,Need to get over the fear of seeking help... no clue what's wrong with me.,allusernamestakenwtf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kr8um/need_to_get_over_the_fear_of_seeking_help_no_clue/,"I'm not at risk of killing myself anytime soon (I hope), though I do think about it a lot, and whatever is wrong with me, it's ruining my life. The worst part? It feels like it's all my fault, like everything's in my control, I just can't do shit about it. I can't help but think that my problems aren't real, that I'm just a lazy bitch, who's got all the odds stacked FOR her, but is just letting everything crumble away.

I'm in my 3rd year of college and on academic probation, and it's only the 3rd week of classes and already I'm missing classes, homeworks, quizzes... though at this point it requires so little effort. I mean getting up in the morning, how fucking hard can it be? I just think ""oh I'll get the notes from someone else later"", or ""oh I'll just do the other homeworks this term and my grade won't drop by much"", but the thing is I thought these same things last term, didn't actually do it, and ended up failing 2 classes and getting on probation. Right now I should be catching up on everything I missed, at least doing the reading... but that's the thing. I can't do readings. I read maybe two sentences and I'm utterly bored (regardless of how fascinating the material is, I'd rather think about it than read or do it) and I switch over to Reddit or video games. I haven't done any work this weekend, just gamed. Actually doing problems, once I get down to them, is a lot simpler, UNLESS I need help, which requires looking through a book or Googling or asking a friend, then I decide I'll do it later, which never happens. Oh and forget studying... I can't study. For the same reasons obviously. Never read over the day's notes, no matter how many times I tell myself I should...

I held an internship over the summer, and I can't fucking believe how hard I failed at that. I'm surprised they didn't fire me, honestly. The hours were 9 to 7, the first day I came in at 8:30, but after seeing how lax everyone is, I began slipping. First few weeks I came in around 11 or 12, then slowly I slipped further and further until I'd be coming in around 2 or 3, sometimes 4, even missing meetings. I really wonder why no one approached me about it, but they may not have noticed (as I was mostly working on independent work).

Other things that have to be done in a timely manner... paying bills, returning library books, responding to e-mails, holy shit I cannot do any of those things. I have my own apartment and no matter how hard I try to pay rent on time, even when I fucking have the money right there, I just need to click a few buttons online, I cannot do it. Every night when I come home I tell myself ""oh, I'll do it later"" then I'm so tired and I think ""oh, I'll do it first thing in the morning"" then I have to rush to class or work (which I'm probably fucking late to) and the cycle repeats. I can't even count how many final shut-off notices I've gotten from Con Ed until I pay the several months' worth of bills finally. Late in the summer I finally returned books that were due at the end of last semester, racking up several hundred dollars in fees. The library is a few blocks away and open practically 24 hours. Sometimes I can't believe myself.

Oh and cleaning. My apartment is always a fucking mess because each time I say to myself that I'll clean, I end up postponing it. Even after I found and killed a mouse a while ago, I cannot seem to clean more often, unless I'm throwing a party, in which case I'll spend an entire day cleaning because that's how fucking dirty it's gotten because of how rarely I clean. Even though I hate every second I spend in a messy/dirty environment, this does not force me to actually clean... just hate myself.

The anxiety makes all these things snowball, in a way. I think ""oh shit I didn't respond to my professor's e-mail yet"" and I feel sick to my stomach and dizzy, and scared of actually doing it (why!?!?!), and then I get even more anxious... Sigh.

A few weeks before the end of last term, my very first relationship (which dragged on for ~2.5 years) ended. He dumped me, though I no longer wanted to be with him (he had been ""dumping"" me then taking me back the next day over and over) so I consider it mutual... it was mainly due to my low sex drive, he constantly complained that I didn't give him enough oral but as time went on I didn't want to have sex with him either. Somehow my body found it 'gross', and I just didn't want it, and to this day I don't know why that happened. I was on birth control while I was with him, but since he was my first, I don't know whether that's the problem or not. Slowly over the last year or so of the relationship my mood also got considerably worse, I would be in a slump all the time, so that didn't help. It went away a tiny bit over the summer, but now it's back full force.

Ever since I got with him we'd smoke weed together every once in a while, but he grew to dislike it (and become paranoid/anxious whenever he smoked) and seemed to have an extremely negative attitude toward it, and toward me smoking. Over the summer I bought my own and smoked practically every day, it helped with the anxiety a lot (which is probably why my mood problems sort of went away over the summer) and helped me control the constant, 24/7 sick-to-my-stomach feeling. I don't know if I should still keep smoking, as recently (we're still friends, sort of, though he keeps trying to hook up with me) he's blessed me with the news that among our friends and sort-of-friends in college I'm known for being a 'stoner', which of course sent me into another bout of anxiety. It helps so much, though, but I don't know...

Now... I've always been perfectly honest with myself, and tried my hardest to steer away from being a hypochondriac, but I'm beginning to think that maybe I should actually seek professional help, and perhaps medication. I don't know what exactly is wrong with me obviously, and I really really really don't want to self-diagnose, but I seem to match the symptoms for ADHD and depression, and to a lesser extent bipolar disorder. Again, I'm not saying I do have these conditions, as I'm not a doctor, it's just what I suspect the most. However, the idea of seeking help is absolutely frightening. I've always viewed myself as incredibly strong and able to overcome everything, and I'd hate to admit to anyone that I'm seeing a therapist, or taking prescription drugs, or anything like that. I mean, what happens in the future? Will I have to get help for the rest of my life? I'm just so scared... there's such a strong stigma associated with it. Plus, my ex was on anti-depressants as a young child, and thinks that they ruined him, and is generally anti-psychiatry. I just don't know what to think or do.

I don't even know what my question is... I'm sorry for the long post. Just, these problems are actually beginning to SEVERELY interfere with my life, and I have no fucking clue how to stop it."

I've always been interested in computers and have ALWAYS been leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else in my classes. I haven't learned much from my college courses, but more from exploring on my own. I'm so under challenged in school. I currently have a job working as an intern in a Datacenter. This has given me quite a bit of experience in the physical world of IT infrastructure. I run my own linux VPS where I host a few websites and try to improve that system on a regular basis. I'm quite proficient at programming but it's not where my passions lie. My experience is not worth going into detail about in this post, if you have a suggestion and I've already done it, I'll let you know!

I'm looking for more ""stuff"" to learn. My desktop is powerful enough to run quite a few VMs, and I have a spare laptop that can also be used. I have access to MSDN-AA with everything from Exchange to Windows Server 2008 R2 to Microsoft Songsmith for free. I have quite a few resources where I can get some hardware if necessary. I guess the only limitation at the moment is that my University network doesn't allow students to run certain services (DHCP/WINS/SMTP/etc). If there's a decent way to setup a private VM network which would still have internet access (IE run my own Domain Controller and play with that), I'd love to hear it.

Specific ideas on something to setup would be awesome, but more than that I guess is how should I go about finding things to learn? I've been having this struggle for a while and I feel like I may have peaked my computer learning trend at the ripe old age of 21. Maybe a better way is to ask: What kinds of non-professional experience would an employer like to see on a resume?

TL;DR I don't know what else to learn about computers and systems administration, what should I learn next?

Edit: I want to clear up the above part. I'm familiar with setting up DHCP and Domain Controllers, joining machines to domains, etc. I just don't exactly want to risk getting caught my the university, OR doing something that might actually interfere with other student's connectivity. I also never said that I knew everything, just that I didn't know what else to learn. Who says ""I know everything, what else can I learn?"" That contradicts itself. I don't think I know everything, I know there is a LOT I don't know... I just don't know what I don't know?"

Right now my Japanese is so-so conversational level, I can also speak semi-fluent Chinese, and of course English.

I'm also open to working but I know that pretty much out of the question trying to work somewhere in the EU with my skillset...unless someone knows otherwise.

",RabidCoyote,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ksye5/geomatics_professionals_grad_students_and_azca/,"I'll try to offer as much information as I can, but I know I'll miss some things. So if there's anything I glossed over and you need me to expand on, I'm more then happy to do so. 

*TL;DR : Thinking of going to graduate school in Geomatics because I hate business and need to do something else. Wondering what the best plan of attack for grad school / professional career is. Also pondering a move from NJ to AZ/CA

I started off my college career, not really sure what I wanted to do. So I took general classes in business administration at community college. I had some struggles - math, mainly - but I worked up through the remedial classes and got up to the required levels. I never bothered getting an AA because it was never really a goal for me, and I needed to get out to avoid getting complacient. So after two years of taking general education stuff like english, sociology, etc. and some basic marketing + business, I transferred out to Rutgers, and I moved out and lived on my own. 

Living on my own sucked, but that's partly because I picked shitty roommates. I got too caught up in their drama and shenanigans to really focus on studying. That, combined with being thrown into the giant pool of Rutgers, being a freshman and lost and confused, I didn't do so hot my first semester. I'm retaking my biology class now, and I repeated Precalc back at Community College this summer, so the lasting impacts shouldn't be so terrible. 

My major at Rutgers has been ""Environmental Science and Economics"", because I wasn't sure if I wanted to go into a business environment or persue something more on the environmental side of things. After meeting the people in business school, seeing the business environment and knowing how corporate culture is, I know I won't be happy on the business end of things. I need to do something bigger, more creative, even if it doesn't bring in the same bucks that business would. As long as there's money to pay the bills, keep the lights on and have alittle left over for fun, I'll be alright. 

I've been learning about Geomatics the past two semesters and it really seems like a field I'd be interested in. While I'm not the biggest techie, I've always been up on computers. Geomatics seems like a good way to apply environmental science, and from what I've read, has many applications and a decent employment outlook. 

The problem is I've only scraped the tip of Geomatics. I'd like to get a master's degree, and I've been looking into Geomatics programs. Rutgers offers a ""certificate"" in Geomatics, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. I'd be more inclined to a master's program so I can go onto the doctorate level at some point and be a college professor. 

The two programs I've seen so far that sound really enticing are Arizona State (a one-year MS for Geomatics) and Cal State @ Northridge (I believe this one is a two-year). There's plenty more, from Maryland to England to New Zealand, but right now I'm in the initial stage of research. I have at least the rest of this year, and possibly an extra semester to finish up my bachelors. If I decide to go for grad school, the extra semester would actually be helpful so I can take GRE prep classes/exams. 

So,

Grad Students: How did you make your decision? What's the financial aid like? Is it worth the extra debt? Are their teaching opportunities to offset the cost? What should I look for in a grad program? 

Geomatics Professionals: What skills do I need to land a job? Is the master's a good idea? What kind of projects do you work on? Any suggestions on internships/jobs I should take while in school? (Right now I'm an intern at a real estate firm...and I loathe it. I'd never want to do this for a living)

AZ/CA Residents (Specifically Phoenix, AZ  and Los Angeles): What do you like and dislike about where you live? Are apartments easy to find? What's the social scene like? Do I need a car? If you moved, was it easy to get settled in?

http://www.mcafee.cc/Bin/sb.html

My Friend (x)

My circle of friends, have always noticed that he lied immensely, about relationships, storys that differ day to day, details, propositions, and jobs that were coming his way. (x) always said he was doing an internship involving listing movies from a website, on and off. It seemed he had a very hard time keeping friends. He would always gravitate towards interests of others, that were socially convenient at the time.

One day in high school he just disappeared for a week or so, and returned quietly. He never saw anybody, he got a girlfriend that enveloped his life for 2 or 3 promiscuous years through high school. He had an emotional breakdown at a party because someone at it had sex with his ex, years later. I believe that person was of significance too, someone who might have humiliated him.

University. He invents a girlfriend never providing evidence, and one that never comes to parties she was supposed to. He did this at the peak of my relationship with my ex. His ex from high school, who ended up drinking heavily, sleeping around, and chasing a dream in acting, visits sometimes. He had sex with her recently but claims he didn't. His father is an entrepreneur who used to be extremely rich, conveniently he can create a lot of advantageous situations with this.

Lately he gravitated towards me, 

He did things like ask for my stumbleupon account. He said he got proposed a 30k yearly internship working on the production of films in another province. Yet he had no idea what he was talking about, I knew that because that was my industry (or was). We got into a discussion about software. I could tell I cornered him with my questions, because I was trying to develop a website myself at the time. Soon, he spontaneously bought every game I was interested in. 

He went to Europe for the summer, with a close friend and an acquaintance of mine. He came back portraying mismatched stories and exaggerations.

Shortly after, the circle was talking-  him and myself went to talking, isolated from the group. He proposed the question 'what if you could get your dick wet everyday'. Quizzically, I responded- 'depends how hot she was'. I said this, because, at the time I thought my friends might've been gay, because lately I felt like I was getting hit on. The conversation progressed, and in the darkness it sounded like he was weeping slightly. Prior to this conversation, I felt like I was getting hit on a few days ago by my two other friends immensely. One who I believe is actually closeted. I did not know how to react, so I ignored it. I realized he proposed that question because he had set something in motion. 

I had an internship, I failed miserably in a month. I broke up with my ex of two years who got me the internship through her sister as soon as I started. On a side note, my ex and her family, were fucking insane. (x) caught wind of it I believe, through his mother who had connections. I planned to uphold the lie that I was still working for another month, then say it was over. 

One night, he meets up with me alone and mentions that his mother knows of someone who lost his internship, he jokes about it and mentions facebook. My account, was encumbered with embarrassing photos that have been long forgotten, I never did clean it out, but I disabled my account before I started my internship. It was reactivated without my knowing, and I always attributed it to my girlfriend, but now that I think of it- it wouldn't be unlikely that he knew my password. 

That weekend, he called me to come to a party, at 11am. It's too late, and chose not to go because of it. At this party I believe he sold out the one person who understood him, amongst the acquaintance he went to Europe with and friends.

He slandered my name, lied and exaggerated, used me as a joke and projected his insecurities on me to climb a social ladder. I know, he too speculated our friend was closeted as well. I believe he used that to turn him against me. Because that friend was extremely hostile to me the next day. He used my ex to provide a believable backstory  for his insults and lies. I've been around a few friends since, something has changed. 

A few nights later he called me to meet up. The conversation revolved around my ideologies, my idols, me. He then tried to convince me to pay for a ridiculously spontaneous trip with him, his brother, and father. He is in-directly mocking me, im fully aware yet I dont do anything about it.

He has always poisoned people against others now that I think of it. He did the same thing to a friend who was also in a relationship. What is fucked up is that I might have had the opportunity to have sex that friends ex, but I chose not too. A week later, in my drunkenness, I remember him sitting me down, and going to her profile on Facebook. He began writing a message, ""I think you should have done it"". What is also fucked up, the acquaintance he went to Europe with, was best friends with the guy whose ex he wanted me to fuck.

He is trying to push the cycle of what he went through onto others as a way of venting his pain. I dont think he will stop until he finds someone to fuck a friend's ex. Hypothetically, I'd be next in line. (x) still calls me to meet up so he can see my condition, he gets frustrated because im not giving him the reaction he wants. He thinks im still ignorant to it all, so naturally he will keep making it more and more obvious.

I realize, I have traits that he associates with his ex, so he hated to see me being successful and felt like he had to keep pace. When I slipped he saw it as an opportunity to exploit me, something he always wanted to do to his ex. His ex, who has been controlling him through an inferiority complex that has be fostering in him for quite some time.

I've never stopped whats been happening around me because I find it so fascinating to live in. No one knows anything about this, how I think. I've likely been portrayed as an idiot by him, so I have to be cautious with my next move.

I think I know what to do, but I have to know if im profiling him properly before I proceed. Any advice would be very appreciated, thank you reading this.

tl;dr very close friend finds out I got fired at an internship, tells everyone and posions them against me so he would feel better about himself.

He said companies aren't hiring, they don't need to.  People are working twice as hard to keep their current jobs because the economy sucks so why hire new people?  I'm never hearing any good news about the economy or job market getting better either.

ku69i,1,2011-09-28,I could really use your advice on my job situation.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ku69i/i_could_really_use_your_advice_on_my_job_situation/,"This is not a sob story or a ""I'm in trouble"" kind of story, I'm just in a bit of a conundrum on what to do. I could use multiple peoples input.

Some background information. I'm 20 a junior in college studying graphic design.

So I have been working as a paid intern doing graphic design for a company since January of this year. It was a great opportunity to get experience working in the field and helped me a good amount, but now I think I have out grown this place. The company is well known (not going to say what it is) but it does not have the most interesting design work (kind of old school) I pretty much have to make things worse then I really can or else it wont be approved. The office atmosphere is pretty much none existent, nobody talks (for being the creative department its pretty boring) So I really have nothing to look forward to when I come to work. I am also the youngest person here by at least 20 years.

Now I just got called for an interview for a party supply store, I am pretty much guaranteed the job (friend of mine knows the owner kinda deal) But I am fearful that after the halloween season they will cut me loose. Another problem is I will be paid less there then I am at the job I have now. Money isn't really an issue as long as I have some sort of income coming in but more money is always nice. Also with the party store the hours I can work are more flexible with my school schedule since the job I have now is 8-5 and I would be able to work on the weekends at the party store.

Also college is kicking into gear and I have A LOT of work. Junior year is the year they turn up the notch on the amount of work they want and the quality so having more flexible hours or being able to have somebody cover my shift would be nice. Plus doing design work for my job and for my school kinda burns me out after a while.

So Reddit, do I stay at the job I kind of hate for more money and security (even though I'll be quitting in December no matter what) or do I work at a fun party supply store where they might kick me out after halloween? Do I tell them in the interview that I would like to work after halloween? (is that to forward?) 

**TL;DR: Kind of hate my job now, could get a new one, not sure if pros out weigh cons. Help please.**

ktqa1,1,2011-09-27,"How to deal with having an ""unstable work history""? Advice, please!",likethetrash,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ktqa1/how_to_deal_with_having_an_unstable_work_history/,"I just got off the phone with a hiring manager for an entry-level data entry operator job I applied for. Long story short, I will probably not get the job because of an ""unstable work history."" How does one deal with having such a work history? (I never even really thought mine was unstable, especially compared to people I know.) I can't go back and change the past. Believe me, I wish I could, but I can't.

Here is my work history in a nutshell, with any information that could identify me or the companies withheld:

It starts eight years ago. Parents couldn't pay for college, nor could I get need-based financial aid (parents made too much money, but they were not very good with it), so I took out loans for college (which I was attending in a city away from home). I took a job at a local K-12 school [Job 1] while attending college so I would have money to pay the bills. Sadly, Job 1 only ran through the school year. I took a food service job during the summer months [Job 2]. I went back to Job 1 once their school year started.

The summer before my last semester of college I took a paid internship job. My internship requirement was met before my semester began, so they offered me a permanent job there [Job 3]. Worked the job and graduated college with honors (though the degree is only an associate degree). 

Right after college, I got married and moved 100 miles away from the city I was living in, so I had to quit Job 3.

In the new city I was having a hard time finding a job, so four months after moving I took a part-time job [Job 4]. I still desired more work and money, so I took a second part-time job on top of that [Job 5]. Working two part-time jobs wasn't ideal, but it helped with money.

Seven months into the part-time jobs I found a full-time job [Job 6] which paid more than the two jobs combined. I quit Job 4 and Job 5. My boss at Job 5 was really sad to see me go and told me to keep in touch.

I kept in touch. Four months later, the boss from Job 5 called me and said that they were able to create a full-time job in their (very small) company for me. It paid more than Job 6. I quit Job 6 and went back to Job 5, this time full-time. 

I stayed at Job 5 for nearly four years, even through a very rough patch where the management and structure of the company completely changed. Even after this change it was rough: Now, most people in the company were either related or part of the same church-family (I wasn't part of either family), so there was some favoritism and inequality that was especially apparent in a company with less than 20 employees. Still, I stayed and trucked on. I only quit because the company began suffering major financial problems and I was being ""asked"" to work for decreased or no pay (""asked"" in quotations because had I said no I would have been canned right off). In retrospect, I should have stayed until I was let go or I found something else, but the stress was impacting my health very negatively. 

Quick summary of jobs: 

* Jobs 1, 2, 3: All held during college.
* Jobs 4 &amp; 5: Part-time, held at the same time. Lasted 7 months.
* Job 6: First post-college full-time gig. Lasted 4 months until I was offered a full-time position at...
* Job 5 (again): Former part-time job offers me a full-time position. Stayed there for nearly four years.

Job 5 was in a very specific and uncommon market. To my knowledge, there is not another actual company in my area that does what they did; the others are all Mom-and-Pop or strictly family-run businesses. Many of the skills I gained from that job are so specific to the market I was in that they cannot transfer to other jobs, so I am looking for entry-level data entry jobs (my position at Job 5 did involved a lot of data entry). 

I've been submitting applications and resumes to many companies. I finally got a call back (at 9:00 this evening) from a company I submitted a resume to. The hiring manager I spoke with said that she would ""try to get me an interview,"" but it would be ""tough"" since my work history was ""so unstable.""

I was taken aback. I've worked very hard over the past eight years, especially in the past four years at the company I was at! Meanwhile, I have friends who have bounced around from job to job and have no trouble finding work. One in specific has worked *at least* five professional jobs over the past four years with no post-high school education, yet she has no trouble finding work and never gets told she has an unstable work history. (I asked her how she does it and she admitted to ""enhancing"" her resume for a couple of jobs and putting down a friend's mother's contact information as a previous employer, even though she never worked for her. However, I feel that I don't have the moxie to pull off such a stunt.)

Another friend has suggested that I take a ""blow-off"" job in food service until I find something better, but after this evening I am concerned that doing so will make my work history look even more unstable. 

I am very tired and am retiring for the night (this is actually what I was doing before I got a call from the hiring manager at 9:00 pm)... Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**EDIT, 2011-09-28:**

Thank you guys for the advice on how to handle this. I actually got two calls for interviews today. I just got back from one of the interviews where I was offered the job on the spot (the interviewer didn't seem to think that my work history was unstable)! I have the other interview tomorrow, so I'm waiting to see how that one pans out before I accept this offer I received today. No matter what, I will be gainfully employed next week!"
kvv12,8,2011-09-29,"Just graduated, need advice!",Geo,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kvv12/just_graduated_need_advice/,"So I just graduated from a fairly small unknown college back in december.  I've been in the process of getting security clearance for a java programming job that is taking FAR too long (since May of 2010).  I got this job because I knew someone who worked there and they put in a good word for me.  I've been trying to find a job recently to fill the gap until my clearance goes through (or if I like it there, a place that I can work instead).  

My problem is that I have ZERO work experience.  I've had two internships fall through for various reasons, and have never worked anywhere in the computer programming field.  I've only worked retail and at a hotel.  I graduated top of my class in my computer science courses, but I still feel scared about the working world.  I feel like i've only lightly touched upon multiple different programming languages and don't entirely feel too confident in any of them.  I'm a pretty quick learner though, so I'm fairly confident I can adapt to anything and learn what it is I need to do very quickly, but I don't know how to get my foot in the door.  

I'd like some suggestions as to what I need to do to get my first job in the computer programming world (what I should be searching for, who I should be talking to, etc), and I'd also like some advice regarding what to expect in the workplace.  What is an average day like?  What was YOUR first job like?  How confident were you?  If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it."
kuv8u,2,2011-09-28,lack of a computer/girl rant,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/kuv8u/lack_of_a_computergirl_rant/,"So, I probably have a gaming problem (I probably use games as an escape), but I'll go ahead and explain my situation and my frustration.

I've had a school-issued laptop for a long while, about three years. It plays games well, but not great. I had a gaming PC of my own for two of those years, but it broke down last October. I sold it for parts to my best friend (works in IT, loves working with computers) for about 300 dollars so that I could make rent one month.. I just recently had to return the laptop because i'm taking a semester off from school to get my finances in order. So, now I have no gaming rig or laptop to use.

I told my good friend that I plan to pay him back for the computer he bought off me, if we could get it running again. He told me he had spare parts we could use to test which parts failed (his bro had the same setup, but just upgraded). We were unsuccessful, and the computer remains in pieces. I need about $106 to get it running again, but I work for my dad, and I don't necessarily get a paycheck. It's basically the communist system. We cover the biggest part of the income and support the rest of the family. Oh, and I also owe my friend's dad about 60 more hours of labor for the car he sold me.

I mentioned to him that I have freelance work to get going on, of which I can't do on my mom's or dad's computers (they don't have the programs or can't run them), but he doesn't seem to want to cough up the back-pay for my computer parts. So then, I emailed a client and asked them for an advance, but I haven't heard back yet. I also owe my cousin $100 dollars in rent.

So basically, I have no hope for a computer within the next month or so. I haven't played a game in three weeks. I have a really close friend that I talk to primarily on Steam and play games with regularly. We talk about life and love and our music production and everything. I miss him dearly. 

I move back and fourth every few months between two places (home and school) which are separated by a four hour drive. This basically prevents me from meeting girls, deciding if they're right for me, working up the courage to ask them out, dealing with rejection, finding another one, building up enough trust and passion to move back home for a few months and also keeping it going, etc. Within those few months that I'm in one place, it's just impossible for me, with an introversion, to start a long-term relationship. I've tried the long distance stuff before, but I'm never satisfied enough with talk and text. Humans yield to their primal side and demand a physical side to romantic relationships!

I know that I should try to get another job, but I don't know if I would be able to handle it. I get so little sleep as it is, and I work for my dad 9-5or6 weekdays.

I need a way to tell my dad that I need this money to get my freelance jobs started again. 

I need to figure out what I need to do to be in a position where I have enough time to start a long-lasting relationship with someone. 

I need to find an architecture internship once I start school in January, and fast.

Is this the death of my gaming career, or will I still be able to keep it as at least a hobby?

Have I doomed myself into being forever alone?

Is there any advice you could give me?"

and since the summer holidays are over we have made quite some eye contact  and smiled at eachother.

She gets in the bus 1 stop before I do so I see her every morning. 
We used to get out of the bus at the same stop, and I wanted to start a conversation with her.
Though most of the time she's with a friend (sister maybe?) So I'm kinda scared I guess...

But I have internship till begin January so I can't get out at the same stop to talk to her. 
And I really don't feel like starting a convo with 2 of my friends around and in a really busy bus.

So whenever I see her being alone, or atleast when my friends arent around I should start talking to her.
But what to talk about. As I never talked with stranger girls.

kwtkv,16,2011-09-30,The Mail,kmlweather,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kwtkv/the_mail/,"***This is no ghost story - it's just one of those ones that is a real ""WTF"" moment. Read on - it's a long read***

I often make trips to the local post office for my father who runs a mail order business from our basement. Every other day consists of the same routine of sorting all of the packages into piles depending on what class of service they are mailing by, and then taking them right out of the neighborhood to the closest post office. My dad has used this post office since my parents moved here in the 80s…so all of the clerks know who we are. 

A few weeks ago our mail stopped showing up at our house. It’s normal for us to have a day or two where we only receive those dumb coupon mailers but I can’t remember another time when we did not receive mail for 3 or 4 days straight. My dad told me on the fourth day to ask about it when I made me near daily visit to the post office that day. 
I drove out to the post office with the normal volume of packages in tow and I waited in line just like I always have. They were understaffed on this day and one of the managers was working at the counter. His name is Simon and he’s a nice fellow who always asks me how school is going and he’s always very personal. When he was done ringing up the total I asked if our mail carrier had changed or maybe there was some kind of other screw up in the system. Simon went back into the back part of the post office while I waited at the counter. A few minutes later he came back with a copy of the form you have to fill out when you get mail forwarded to a new address. He told me that one of the other clerks remembered an older man coming in a few days before and filling out the form. I asked what the person looked like and then questioned why they would let such an order go through given our long history of using this post office. He said that the clerk responsible remembered the person providing proper proof of residency and claiming to be a visiting relative. Well shit…who could that be? Even weirder is that the address for the mail to be forwarded to was our next door neighbor’s house. 

Confused as hell I made the short drive back home and told my dad what Simon had told me. My dad was just as confused. We don’t’ see our neighbors that much and their driveway is much longer than all of the other driveways in the neighborhood. Most of the houses are pretty close to the street but this one sits a decent ways back into the woods – still it’s a typical suburban neighborhood except our street backs up into the local park (lots of wooded area in there). My dad had spoken to the couple in that house many times over the years but ever since a small dispute about a tree between our properties we have been out of touch. 

Not wanting to touch off a physical altercation, my dad found their phone number and called. Naturally, the line was out of service…so they had changed their number somewhere along the way. 
It was just prior to dinner at this point and my dad and I told my mom that we’d be back in a few minutes. My dad wanted to go over there to see if anybody was home. It was apparent as we walked up the long driveway that they had not been there in a few months. Still, the house was left in good condition as if they had simply taken a break from it or something. We walked up the tall concrete stairs that led from the driveway to their front door and rang the doorbell. No ring. So we knocked. After a few minutes we knocked again – still nothing. Assuming that they had gone on a long vacation we gave up for the night having had none of our questions answered. 

Coincidentally, the next day as I was pulling back into the driveway on my way back from classes I noticed our neighbor’s white SUV parked near their mailbox and the man was unlocking his mailbox (they bolt it when they go away for long periods). I parked and texted my dad inside to come outside because he was back from vacation. 

We had a nice conversation (he and his wife had gone to Costa Rica to look at property there). The topic quickly came to the subject of our missing mail. He genuinely had no idea what we were talking about (this guy is pretty nice except for that one argument we had with him). His wife was still in Costa Rica and would be arriving home in a few days. We all kind of shrugged off the whole tree incident from a while back and he invited us to come up to the house for coffee or tea. We walked up the driveway while he parked his car and accompanied him to the front door. 

He opened the door and immediately paused. There was trash everywhere inside and lots of discarded banana peels scattered about. As we walked around it became apparent that somebody had been residing in their house while they had been away. One of the windows facing the woods had been forced open (old house with old locks). From the amount of garbage present, it was clear that this person had been here for quite some time. I used to intern with the police department around here and knew that we probably shouldn’t touch anything if at all possible. The whole thing was kind of creepy…we left and called the cops. 

Since it was not an emergency call the cops took about an hour and a half to show up and take a report. They wanted to clear the rest of the house and we were told to wait outside on the driveway. About ten minutes later they came out another door of the house with a bunch of boxes. One of the boxes had ALL of our mail from those missed mail days. It had all been opened and some of the contents were clearly missing. There were also photos of our house and a few other houses on the block. No rhyme or reason to why the houses pictured were selected. The cops looked through the photos and boxes and then took them in for evidence. Meanwhile, a few other cops checked around the houses that were in the photos. 

I won’t lie to you – this isn’t a ghost story or anything but it just gives me the creeps – especially knowing that this creeper is still out there (though no sign that he has been back). The cops had identified a picture and found evidence of somebody lingering right outside the windows of the room where our main home computer is. (There are two windows in that room on the main level of the house with some bushes slightly away from the exterior wall). A few cigarette butts were also found. This guy had been creeping it up RIGHT outside the fucking window where I spend most of my time (computer room). I’m literally in that room from the time I get home until dinner and then from like 9pm until I go to sleep. 

Since it wasn’t a case of assault or any type of violent crime, the cops really can’t do anything but keep an eye out for more suspicious activity…it just makes you feel so vulnerable knowing that some dude was outside within feet of where I was sitting just watching me. He better not have been fapping or something. Ugh.

kw0v2,19,2011-09-29,Shit... I think I might've just gotten hired to work for an shady company,afuckinmoron,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kw0v2/shit_i_think_i_mightve_just_gotten_hired_to_work/,"My first day is this Monday and I quit my old part-time job for this one. I've been told that I'll be making $20k/year plus commission and that I'll be selling Verizon Business services to local businesses. It sounded like a dream job until I came across this comment on [One Day, One Job](http://www.onedayonejob.com/jobs/the-landers-group):

""These companies are all over many popular job sites. They tout event marketing, public relations opportunities, management training, and more. I worked at SV Marketing in Tampa, Florida (also known as Sloan Vinson Marketing) for one month. I never got stranded, and I never got a gone pulled on me, but I did feel scammed and like I was scamming others.

The deal with this company is ‘updating customer’s Verizon bills’. Basically, it was our job to pull 
Verizon bills from current customers (or other companies, if you’re really good) and call Verizon to 
make changes. The job is 100% commission, based on certain changes you are able to make to 
customer’s bills. A few times this may actually save the customer money, but many times it will in 
fact be more expensive. The recruiting of other employees is a large part of all these scams. The 
more people you recruit, the more money you make off their commissions. Once you are in the door 
and recruiting, they tell you all the techniques they used to get you in. To questions of ‘do you pay 
for gas’, you either avoid it, or say yes- it’s a tax write-off. Just save your receipts, including those 
for your suits, shoes, car, etc. and get it all back later!

As soon as you have enough experience and employees under you, you have the ‘opportunity’ 
to move to another location and start your very own business doing the same thing, or selling 
something very similar (including Staples.com), hence the sheer number of companies that do this.""

This basically just described what I saw when I went for my ""job shadow"" day. Holy shit, I think I just got played like a fiddle. The question is, what should I do now? Do I just not show up for my first day Monday and keep looking for work? I feel like such a fucking moron for falling for this, but I was so excited to get my first full-time job that I refused to see the red flags.


**EDIT 1** I fucked up the title. It should read ""a shady company."" Sorry about that, but I kind of wrote this while crying about my stupidity and it was hard to see straight.

**EDIT 2** For the record, I also did comment in here with my real username, not that it matters. The company is in Virginia and it's called Atlantic Coast Consulting LLC.. If any of my fellow Virginians sees them on Monster, you now know what they're about. Hope I could at least help someone else avoid wasting their time/gas on these people.

**Final Edit**
I've decided not to waste anymore time with these fuckers and to just move on. I appreciate the advice and support of my fellow Redditors and I hope I've helped a few people avoid falling prey to this shit, too. Below are a few of the red flags I noticed during this particular company's interview:

* After asking around, I found out that no one other than the managers had been working at the company for longer than a couple of months. If that's not a red flag, I dunno what is.

* No one would directly answer me when I asked what the company did. All I got was a bunch of ""you'll see""s during my interview. They also dodged questions about how many people had already been hired to the company during this hiring cycle.

* No company reimbursement for travel costs. ""It's tax deductible!"" my ass.

* The company only liked to hire young people. While that's nice and all in theory, the truth is that they probably just see us as being more vulnerable and gullible (and damn they were right), as well as more willing to sacrifice our free time for the sake of advancement.

Also, this may have worked out for the best after all. After spending all day contacting local tech firms to inquire about internships, I've gotten a response from one! Things are looking up, indeed."
