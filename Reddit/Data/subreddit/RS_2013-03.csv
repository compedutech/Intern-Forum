First post here. I have a bit of an unconventional background. I have a BS in Biology (minors in Business &amp; Chem)  and I graduated this past May with a good GPA from a Top 50 nationally ranked university and one of the best in my field for B.S. I wanted to pursue Biology research after college, but after working in a lab for a few years, I decided that really wasn't for me. After graduation, I had a pretty good internship with a start-up in the health IT space doing business development. I enjoyed what I was doing and more importantly I was very curious about the technologies we were using. I began to teach myself basic programming (already knew VBA, started Python and Java). Now, my knowledge level is pretty basic, but I'm teaching myself using online resources and find learning this stuff really exciting and enjoyable. After my internship was over in December, I am currently unemployed and looking for jobs. I know that the CS world has a lot of demand right now and is forecasted to have a great deal of demand in the future also. 

I have been specifically looking at the MS program at DePaul
My question is whether the MS in CS program at DePaul is worth it? The program seems like it's targeted towards not just CS people, but also non-CS folks. The people with non-CS backgrounds would end up adding an extra year to their program and would have to take foundation courses before they began their grad school courses. So the program ends up being 3 years instead of 2. Also, the program seems like it's really easy to get into. All I would need is a 3.0/4.0, transcript, application and fee. No rec letters or GRE scores. I checked with the admissions office and they said I had a very good chance of being accepted. One of the things I really like about this program is that it can be full-time and most of the classes are in the evenings so I could potentially work in the daytime and go to school at night. 
 
Does anyone have any experience with this program? Is it too good to be true? Or should I wait and get the foundation courses else where and apply to a more competitive program next year? I'd appreciate any feedback about this program, my next steps, or any other advice or comments you can provide. 
 
Thanks for you help! "

19h8xq,2,2013-03-01,Personal Narrative Input,ChuckleWave,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/19h8xq/personal_narrative_input/,"After reviewing several of the SOP's here, I've decided I needed to re-write my own as it was very subjective. I'm applying for an interdisciplinary master's program (MAIS), which requires the following:

A brief narrative outlining your academic interest and meeting the following criteria:

* Narrative should be approximately 650 words

* Include any current or long-range interests in research, teaching or other professional objectives.

* Please describe any publications or other evidence of scholarly endeavor you have achieved.

* List academic and professional organizations in which you are active and any fellowships, scholarships, or other honors you have received

I've removed some personal information for my own protection.

Here's what I've got:

I aspire to study geographic information systems (GIS), geology, and public policy at Reddit University using the MAIS degree plan to develop myself into an educated and experienced emergency manager. In 2010, I graduated from The University of Reddit with a bachelor’s degree in Emergency Administration and Disaster Planning. I have over 1.5 years of work experience in emergency management, in addition to skill sets gained from training exercises outside of the workplace. I excel under pressure and have a strong technical writing background. I have chosen Reddit University due to its science and technology atmosphere, the strong reputation for GIS, Dr. Awesome Sauce's impressive background and the flexibility of the MAIS program. In the short term, I look to achieve an edge in my industry while gaining experience. In the long term, I look to apply GIS and supplemental research to develop better ways for private and public industry to perform planning and analysis in disaster situations.

While at The University of Reddit, I was a member of the International Association of Emergency Managers - Student Chapter and completed certifications for nine FEMA Independent Study Courses. My area of study consisted of comprehensive emergency management involving the emergency management cycle: disaster response, recovery, preparedness, mitigation and terrorism. I learned what techniques are necessary to control, overcome and rebuild from a catastrophe.

I completed an emergency management internship at the Reddit Hospital, in which my main research concentrated on the hospital's new mass decontamination facility. I, with my mentor, put together training exercises in which we taught hospital staff how to mobilize and demobilize the facility, in addition to how to respond when needed. I have been involved in training ranging from small tabletop workshops to large full scale exercises in which stakeholders are actively involved. My current employment is the management of hazardous material releases throughout North America. In my position, it is critical to remain vigilant during stressful 'on-call' days when there is pressure for an expedited response. Following the account of a spill, I author detailed incident and corrective action reports to state and federal agencies, including the State Commission on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency. I am a trained NOAA Super Severe Weather Skywarn Storm Spotter, and regularly attend the Severe Storms Association National Storm Conference. I am also a member of the County Community Emergency Response Team.

I am interested in researching GIS combined with geology and public policy due to their applications for effective and efficient disaster management. GIS technology allows for the 'fast-track' integration of vast amounts of data to turn into actionable intelligence for first responders and stakeholders. That data can be quickly assessed, shared, collaborated and can result in a coordinated response. Supplementing GIS with a background in geology will provide a better understanding of the natural environment and its possible risks. Executing this concept with an understanding of public policy can provide for better implementation of regulations preventing the loss of life or property. The combined study of these subjects will provide strong performance in situational awareness, data management, operations support and mitigation.

I was initially drawn to Reddit University due to its flexible yet strong science and technological programs. The atmosphere provided is beneficial for my anticipated research to thrive. Upon further investigation, the fact that Reddit University has been a leader for GIS research and education in this state is significant. The GIS program's recognition of excellence by the Council of Governments and Oracle Corporation make it noteworthy. When exploring the GIS faculty, the discovery of Dr. Awesome Sauce solidified my desire to continue my education at Reddit University. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, among other things retained for privacy make him someone to be astounded of.

I look to offer Reddit University my experience, knowledge and commitment. I hope to gain more of these three traits in return. I have no doubt I would succeed in this environment and am eager to do so. I am looking to invest in my future, and I want Reddit University to be a part of it.

19h35m,9,2013-03-01,"Reddit, would this qualify me as a crazy roommate?",karhu40,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19h35m/reddit_would_this_qualify_me_as_a_crazy_roommate/,"So, there is something wrong with my car. I can drive it, but there seems To be a short somewhere and it possibly has been causing other problems. One of these symptoms has led me to think using my turn signals exacerbates the problem. I need to figure out what this is!

Unfortunately, California law says I can't do car maintenance on the street. And I wouldn't really want to do a several hour project in the direct sunlight anyway.

My apartment has a parking spot, but my roommate has had her dead car there for three months now, meaning I nor any of my other roommates can use the spot. 

The problem with her car is as simple as a dead battery, but she keeps asking people to jump it for her, clearly not understanding that batteries' lives are not infinite. She has jumped it and reparked it upwards of five times now. I have done everything short of going and buying her a new battery. I've cleaned it for her, I've borrowed a device from my father to diagnose the problem, I've jumped it with my car twice now.

Last week, my own car died (failed ignition coil) and I replaced it, and I let her know that I needed the spot that Saturday to find if there was a root problem. After putting in the cleaned battery, the thing started, where she celebrated by driving to the bank where it died again. So, clearly, she gets it jumped again only to drive it back and park in our only spot. I tell her that I need to work on my car and my next free time was Monday, so I expect her to deal with it then since she only has two classes per week and an internship with flexible hours that she can telecommute to. Not happenin. Car is still there Monday. Wednesday is my next free time. Trying to be considerate, I let her sleep in until noon. Then, I went and looked up service stations she could tow it to. By then it was too late and I had to go to work.

So, I shot her a text saying I absolutely had to work on it this Saturday morning. No response. Texted her again asking if she got it. She did. 

Meanwhile, I have put probably 400 miles on my car waiting for her to get her act together. If I come home and the car is still there, meaning it's taking the spot for when I plan to work on mine tomorrow morning, I want to just push it out onto the curb. I am tired of waiting, I am paying for the spot too and every time I drive my hour long commute, I am putting my car and my peraonal safety at risk (by sparsely using my blinkers).

My question for you folks is: Am I overreacting by pushing her car to the curb and essentially forcing her to deal with it? What should I do in this situation? "

How can I transition?",SyrioBroel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19gpl5/im_currently_a_network_engineer_however_i/,"I went through college without an internship unfortunately. 

I graduated in 2010 and landed a network engineering job in 2011 and am currently employed. I have a few cisco certs, some Citrix certs, etc.

The problem is...I don't genuinely enjoy networking. I think it's dull, it's boring. Not to mention when there's not actually a problem, I'm just not doing anything.

I took it upon myself to learn some programming. I picked up a few introductory C# books, and I've blasted through them in less than 2 weeks. I seriously love it. I wake up and can't wait to come to work to practice my C# and do the quizzes and ""Try it Out!'s"" in the book, not networking. 

I get irritated if someone calls me in for a networking problem, but I love debugging my own code. 

I know there are a lot of branches off of programming, just like there are networking. Because I don't have much networking experience (brief VB.NET in college--which I aced and enjoyed), I know that I need to start practicing code in my off-time.

So, some questions:

* After I feel like I have a pretty strong grasp on C#, I want to get a firm grasp on ASP.NET as I've seen those 6 letters in almost every online position to apply to. Should I stick with C++ afterwards, or should I move into more valuable scripting such as Python, Ruby, Perl, etc?

* Is there a collaborative article on the types of different job markets for programming, as well as critiques and nuances of each? I.E. gaming, web-development, etc?

* Is there a way for me personally to be able to figure out which brance of programming I'd like to go down?

* Is it easy to switch/transition from networking to programming? I mean, I'm young, but I'm not sure if it's practical.

Thanks! :)"

What i will do is basically spray the color of the non-transparent pixels of a picture onto the Transparents. On my previous attempt i wasnt blur the color evenly, but i got a quite nice spraying pattern which would be OK for most cases.
Though i now want to know all 
to safe a (SFML) sf::Color object with its corresponing coordinates and then be able to find any value as fast as possible when i do know the coordinates.

At first i tried unordered_set but it figured it requires a hashing function for the Key/Element sf::Color and as i never did it before i first looked for a slightly easier, simpler, solution. Well not quite simple as i found out is unordered_map with a pair&lt;int,int&gt; following with a sf::Vector2u, which basically is a pair but with all operators overloaded by the authors.
On stackoverflow i found snippets i combined to:

    template &lt;&gt;
    struct std::tr1::hash&lt;sf::Vector2u &gt; {
    public:
            size_t operator()( sf::Vector2u val ) const throw() {
    			size_t h = ( ( val.first + val.second )*( val.first + val.second ) + val.first - val.second ) / 2;//something with x   
                 return h;
            }

still says it cant find operator ==  in this case because of any ambiguity in SFML or sth like that
Nevertheless i thought you guys maybe give me a hint on either another way to solve the problem itself or this very sub problem.

19gamr,1,2013-03-01,"Advice for Senior with lots of theory knowledge, but little programming experience",csmathguy228,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19gamr/advice_for_senior_with_lots_of_theory_knowledge/,"**Background:**

Sorry if this looks obnoxious, but I bolded the important facts so you can skim this section.

I'm a **fourth year**, double majoring in **math and CS**.  I've been **focusing on math** most of my undergraduate career, and in fact only 7 of the 15 classes I took to qualify as a CS major involved programming, most of which were in my first year.  I got the CS degree mostly because I was very interested in the theory side of CS.  I've got a pretty good GPA (3.7) from a top 5 university in math, but it's pretty average in CS.  **As a result, I know a lot about algorithms, combinatorics, logic, and complexity theory, but not a whole lot of the practical aspects.**

I applied to grad school for math, but I'm having second thoughts (mainly that I think after getting a PhD, I probably won't want to continue to post-doc, and be back where I am now).  So **I'd like to apply to some software engineering jobs** (or anything else that might fit my profile, if you have a suggestion).

Now, **I don't have a whole lot of programming experience.**  I haven't done much in the way of designing code around objects, or writing code in C++ or Java since before college.  **I can hack together most algorithms in python or Haskell (cause it's basically just math), but I don't have big projects to show off**, and probably don't know python's capabilities that well anyway.

**Questions:**
I'm confused about where to go from here.  April 15th is the deadline for accepting math grad school, so I would love to have a serious job offer by then, but more realistically, I'd like to have a better idea of what I want to do before then.

1. Where should I be looking for jobs (preferably in Chicago, NY or some other city in the northeast), and **what kinds of companies** would want to hire me?

2. **How do I make my resume look better?**  I have 3 summers worth of math ""research"" (in quotes, because that really consists of learning math on the frontiers of research, rather than discovering new results).  I don't have much in the way of even class projects to talk about.

3. What can I do to **improve my employability in the short term?**  My first step is getting on github and uploading code, but is there anything more specific to this?  Should I bother refreshing my C and Java, or try to learn new languages for jobs I want?

4. Everyone I know from high school seems to be getting into CS.  Is it a field that's quickly becoming too crowded, especially for someone with less experience?  This line of thinking is what makes me think getting a PhD might hurt more than help.  Also, how do I tell the difference between good jobs that will let me move up in the future, places where I'll clearly be outclassed, and places that won't offer much advancement or help me with future jobs.

5. **Data science/Machine Learning?** I don't know a lot about this, but it's been interesting me a lot, at least when it involves HMMs and other AI algorithms.  What kind of experience or knowledge do I need, and will it be as fun as the theory I'm learning in class?

6. **How much do I actually know?** Talking to people at my school, I think I know a good bit about algorithms and data structures. I aced the class pretty easily 2 years ago, but it's been a while, and we're not exactly known for CS.  Does that matter more or less than domain knowledge, and how should I take this into account when applying for jobs?

7. **Summer Internships?** Would it be a good idea to apply to them?"
19g7l2,1,2013-03-01,Summer internship or relax and work on my side projects?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19g7l2/summer_internship_or_relax_and_work_on_my_side/,"I've spent an unreasonable amount of time in community college, switching my major at least a thousand times. However every semester I've taken 15-20 units, and over time it's burned me out pretty hard. I'm finishing up the last few physics/discrete math/CS courses and my mind is destroyed. The massive amount of stress from the previous few semesters is really taking its toll on me.

This summer I was offered a programming internship at a local startup. It's very very small and nothing impressive, but the company is reputable in the area and I know the guys working there. Very smart dudes who I'm sure have a lot to teach me. It would take up 20-30 hours of work a week, but unfortunately it is unpaid. 

On the other hand, I was thinking of just relaxing and refreshing my mind over the summer before going to a real university. This is probably the only summer when I won't be taking classes, so I could finally spend time with my friends and family. Of course I would do some programming for myself, work on side projects from the convenience of my house.

So I'm not sure what to do. Take up a position that will take up ~30 hours of unpaid work per week, or take it easy and work on my own side projects?"

I did abysmal on the first test (47, which was the cutoff for getting a U for the progress reports, though strangely I had an S).  The next test is on Monday, which unfortunately is on the other side of the deadline.  While I've been studying and I feel confident this time around, it's basically a gamble at this point.  If I drop the class, no worrying about how I have to do on Monday, but possibly delay graduating by a semester (which sucks when you're on loans like me), or stay in the class, and risk screwing up on the test and killing my GPA and my chances at scholarships, internships, and GT-Lorraine.

I know it is completely my choice either way, but what do you think would be the best move?  I'm currently taking 17 hours (PHYS 2212, ECE 2020, ECE 2026, MATH 2403, and ENGL 1101), and have 23 credit hours counting last semester and AP exams."

I had one internship last summer at IEEE, where I basically worked as a glorified tech position.  

I won't get into how I got into my situation now, as it isn't really important, but I have no passion for the field of Computer Engineering. I know it's a bit late to get into grad school right away, but I would like to get the process underway as soon as possible. I am going to look into taking the GRE as soon as possible, and look into different programs that are available at schools around the country. 

I am making this thread in hopes of getting any kind of advice on my chances of getting into a program that is different than my major, and on the process involved. I don't know why but I never even considered that it was a possibility until my friends brought it up, and they mentioned that having a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, as well as with my good GPA, would be appealing to graduate schools. How true is this? I am very interested in studying either chemistry. biology or physics, however I have only taken Chem 1 &amp; 2 and Physics 1 &amp; 2 during college. Would I have to take summer classes or stay extra years here at Rutgers to take more classes?

I will be looking into a lot on my own as well but any feedback would appreciated, thank you!"

It's too late to change majors so I'm finishing my degree regardless and am going to get on with my life.

Anyway I need an internship for my junior year summer and I was looking for an internship position in my hometown. I was looking around at WebDev firms in the area and none of them had official job postings or a place to submit a resume, so I decided to just email them directly thinking nothing would become of it. Well three of them emailed me back the day of and one even called me. However two of three asked for my resume and ""Portfolio"" one offered a unpaid internship.  

So here's my dilemma, I don't have a website up that I completely hand coded myself I've just recently (the past 2 months) been spending every waking minute of extra time reading CSS and HTML tutorials, guides, and code snippets (I find these most helpful). I'm computer literate to a core and know the hardware and everything but I know software is what I want to do. Today I almost missed two classes because I forgot time was passing as I was working on my website. But when they emailed my asking for a ""portfolio"" I didn't know what to tell them. I don't have a website that I built ground up. I have a wordpress site up and some hosting and whatnot but everyone knows that's not real coding, unless you custom build a theme. I'm going to get back to them tomorrow but I'm a little embarrassed of my skills. I'm no master designer but sure I could do HTML mockup and position things in CSS but making it look decent in a cohesive manner wont be happening on the first day. Idk what to really tell them should I be completely honest and tell them I'm pretty beginner or should I try to put out a site real quick and maybe get back to them in a week. What would an intern or entry level developer be doing exactly? I don't wanna get hired and them have me right code and take it and delete the whole thing and start over therefore being a burden on the firm. Any advice would be helpful thanks. 

TL;DR: What does a entry level dev job entail? How much do you need to be able to produce to not be a burden on the firm.

While these may not give you the exact experience they're looking for, they may get you in the door.  I figured I'd share how I personally gained experience, despite never landing an internship. 

**Student Organizations**

Join a professional student organization and dedicate yourself to it to gain leadership experience.  While becoming a member will help, the officer positions are what you should truly be shooting for.  Speak with the advisor for the organization and get in touch with the officers to find out how you can get involved.  Most universities have at least one of the following that you should join:

 * Finance Association

 * Investment Club

 * If your school doesn't have one, then start one! Schedule a meeting with the Head of your Finance Department and work with them.

**Competitions**


Join competitions related to your major that will give you experience in the field you want to go into.

* [Chartered Financial Analyst Challenge](http://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/challenge/involved/Pages/get_involved_students.aspx)

* [Financial Planning Challenge](http://www.fpanet.org/professionals/EventsConferences/FinancialPlanningChallenge/)

This may seem obvious or redundant to you, but I've been shocked at how many students are unaware of these options.  Despite being from a non-target school, and what some may consider to be a party school, I've been able to get interviews off my leadership and competition experience alone.  This has been blatantly stated to me during interviews, so don't count yourself out!  "

So I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I'm in my last year at university, and I am part of a program that requires me to apply to lab research internships over the summer. I've completely dropped the ball. 

Out of the dozen or so I hoped to apply to, I've applied to ~3. The deadline for the last of them is tomorrow, and I still haven't finished. I have been ridiculously depressed since this winter, and one result of that has been a lot of procrastination and anxiety regarding these applications. I can't even begin to explain to the program director why, in the 3+ months I would have had to do this, I couldn't just couldn't manage. It's so stressful, and it's been eating away at me since mid-January. 

If I don't succeed, which seems likely, I think that I'll be kicked out of the program. For one, it would be humiliating. For two, I was really counting on using this to help me get into graduate programs. Applying for those promises to be even more traumatizing, and if this experience is any indication, it won't go well. Especially once I've totally eroded my support group and lost valuable letters of recommendation. My back-up plan when all else fails is to get into debt by applying to less competitive masters programs before pursuing a PhD. Not sure how I feel about that right now. 

So what do I need advice for? I'm not sure. This whole situation is just a mess, and I feel like I'm destroying my career before it even begins. 

tl;dr: Screwing over my chances at graduate school. At a loss.

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts.

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today.

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school.

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age.

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts.

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board.

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board.

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room.           

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. 
How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother.

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on.

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food.

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs.

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over.

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother.

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal.

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.

Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”
Of course, I said yes.
“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”
I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.
“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.
“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.
“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”

I will admit to having cried at this display.

“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.

But, of course, he continues.
“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

I do well for myself.  Music Therapy major; all around good student.

My mom and I have a very good relationship; but we differ about a couple crucial things:

-1. She doesn't want me driving any cars ever even though I have a taxi-drivers license.  I don't understand either but she thinks I'm gonna wreck every car.

And

-2. She thinks I should continue living on-campus my junior year and paying greater-than $4,000/SEMESTER to live in the same room as somebody else.  That and the $1,800/SEMESTER I pay for food; it's definitely cheaper to live off campus, right?

How do I prove to her that a year in an apartment or room-for-rent inside of a big house; and food would still cost less than that ridiculous amount I pay now?  And that if we *did* get me an apartment; I'd be able to take the extra money (or some of it, at least) and put it aside for my Music Therapy internship (with which I want to travel)?

Is there any hope for me that I won't have to live for 3.5 months (mid-may to September) back in my parent's house with my older siblings who I can't really deal with, and my two nephews who are loud and will stop me from being able to focus on anything?"

When I contacted the admissions counselor to ask for help on what to do she said the only way I could get into UT Austin at this point was to do an appeal process, even though my chances are very slim.

Normally I wouldn't mind doing the CAP program, however I am currently an intern down at NASA's JSC center, and there is a program that is the main pipeline to getting hired where you apply during your second semester, and having UT Austin on my resume would look much better then UTSA.

19k7mp,2,2013-03-02,Need help deciding between jobs,medicalixx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19k7mp/need_help_deciding_between_jobs/,"Just so you all have an understanding of my background, I am a computer science student who is graduating from college this spring. I have always wanted to work as a web developer of some sort. I even have a current internship that allows me to work as a web developer as well as work with amazing people.

However, I have a dilema. Recently, I was offered two jobs for when I graduate school. Both jobs have pro's and con's, but I am having a hard time choosing. Here is a little information on each job:

Job 1 - My current internship has offered me a position in which I would be brought on full-time. I would be able to continue to work as a web developer, as well as have the freedom to work on projects that I choose (assuming that they are relevant and useful for the business) and would have the opportunity to learn a much broader range of knowledge. I also know the people I will be working with, because I have worked with them for a year now... So I kind of know what to expect with this job. I also want to throw it out there that I absolutely love my current internship. Overall, this job is offering me responsibilities that are beyond most entry level jobs because I would have the chance to offer vision and insight to this company to change it for the better (it's a relatively small company).

Job 2 - I was offered the opportunity to work as a software engineer consultant for a well known corporate consulting firm. This firm is very well regarded on an international level, and I truly believe that I will have no problem boosting my career if I work here. Also, I would be sent through their own few month long training program, so I would learn their ways of doing things. I believe I would also be able to gain a better professional network by working in this company because I would be surrounded by different companies multiple times in a year. Also, I would have the opportunity for up to 100% travel with this job and gaining frequent flyer miles, rental car points, and hotel points would be very useful (and cool) in the long run as well.

As a comparison between salary/benefits, Job 2 has a more impressive offer.

Overall, I am torn between a company that can offer me more in salary and reputation but could lack on giving me ""fun"" projects, or a job that will offer me freedom and broader sense of responsibilities as well as a great work atmosphere that will never get boring to me.

What should I do?

tl;dr: Should I go with a job that offers me more money and has a great international reputation, or a job that will allow me to have a greater personal development?"

I applied for an internship with a local company for a programming internship, no phone interview, they just asked me to come in for a test.

I should have asked for a later date because I hadn't done any C++ for awhile(what they wanted), but hey it can't be that bad right? It's just for an internship

So I show up 10 minutes early, get asked to wait in the lobby. I'm like ok, patience, I'll just read all the info about the company in here which is probably what they want me to do. (I had already researched them online and been on their website.) Get told they are still setting things up after I read everything. Wait 45 minutes sitting in the lobby, finally they bring me to the back, get handed a sheet with the test on it and told to go ahead and get started. They were not specific what the rules or objectives were. I mean I knew what the objective of the test was, but I didn't know if I could use C++ reference sites or what. I'm kind of shy so I asked an hour or so into the interview after I got really stuck.  

5 hours or so later, I end and they do a code review of my program(I had issues compiling, syntax errors, etc.). But they told me I was the only person to try and solve the problem using classes. They gave me a 5 minute interview after that. Then send me on my way saying they will contact me later. (They called later saying they couldn't find a place for me)

I felt like they were not even interested in an intern(2 of the 3 people anyway) or just weren't interested in me. I also felt like they were a bit rude.

Is this on par with what most internship interviews will be like? 

EDIT: This was for an unpaid internship"
19n0mu,5,2013-03-04,"Got turned down for software dev internship, applied for customer rep (full time) position and got interview.  Interviewee asked if I wanted to go into development, trick question?",trickquestions,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/19n0mu/got_turned_down_for_software_dev_internship/,"Hey,

So a few days ago, I just had a phone interview for a customer rep position and it went great.  I'll probably get called in for a second in-person interview.  However, I can't help but feel a bit of regret while answering questions in the interview:

I first applied for a software Internship at said company and while checking the status of it, it read: ""Does not meet qualifications"".  So I applied for another position to get my foot in the door.  

During the interview, they noticed that I was a C.S. major, and asked if I would like to transfer to a development position because they had internships available.  Is this a trick question?  Or should I have answered honestly?

I can't help but feel it was a trap because I was denied initially.  But ultimately, I do what the development position.  I have no work experience in the software field, no internships, and have already graduated.  Should I have answered honestly and said I want to apply for the internship?


Should I just bite the bullet and take the Customer rep job and work my way into development, or be straight with them now and say I want to be a developer.

Thanks!"

Please help.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/19mpfp/its_difficult_to_say_how_i_feel_in_words_but_ill/,"I am 19 years old (male) and a second-year in college. It is 4 in the morning right now. I wish I was dead.

Every day I wake up with a different feeling. It used to be happy some days, sad some days, but whatever it was, it was an extreme. Now all my days start of extremely bad. I wish I was dead.

My worries stem from many sources. I have no friends. I have never had a girl interested in me. The major and minor programs I've been interested in I either don't qualify for or have been shut down. I have a 3.2 gpa. I wish I was dead.

I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know what I am. I feel like if someone could give me a label I could at least try to fix myself. But I don't think I could go to a therapist. I don't know what my parents would think. What my brother would think. I wish I was dead.

I was bullied a lot. From middle school until the end of high school. Part of me likes to think that none of it mattered to my growing up. But part of me knows that it did. I lost all my confidence. Even now, as leader of several prestigious organizations at my university, I have no confidence. I used to have social skills, but my anxiety about my lack of confidence took those away. Now if I say a word to anyone outside of my roommates it comes as a surprise to me. I wish I was dead.

I have no idea where I am going in life. I feel like it is nowhere. While all the people I'm around are becoming engineers, mathematicians, and businessmen, getting jobs, no company responds to my internship applications. So far I've contacted 15 and nobody responds. I've applied for an undergraduate business program at my school (for third and fourth years), and they take 66% of the applicants. But I still have doubts that I'll get in. I wish I was dead.

I don't feel like committing suicide, but I feel like if I don't get into the business school I will feel like committing suicide. Either way, I wish I was dead.

I'm a disappointment to myself. I wish I was dead.

I wish I was dead. I wish I was dead. I wish I was dead.
I wish I was dead. I wish I was dead.
I wish I was dead.
I wish.

The question is, as an engineer who DOES enjoy designing things and problem solving, 

should I just muscle through my classes and finish it? 
What do entry level engineers / internship work consist of?
What else is there other than cars / planes / military weapons?

[Are you a vegetarian or just make sure your food comes from places like free range farms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyiai?context=5)|I think that there are less cruel methods of getting meat. But in the end I feel the absolute best action we can take for the animals sake is to go vegetarian. I also want to add that even when a package says free range or cage free mutilated without painkillers. Piglets are castrated, have their teeth ripped out with pliers, etc.)
 |As far as with Walmart, all we are asking them to do is stop confining pregnant pigs in crates so small they can't even turn around.
[*I also want to add that even when a package says free range or cage free mutilated without painkillers.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyt43?context=5)|""...or cage free the animals are usually still mutilated..""
[Have any companies changed their practices specifically because of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyihm?context=5)|The Walmart pork supplier that we investigated was also linked to Costco and Kmart. The night before we were set to release the investigation Costco and Kmart both came out and commited to phasing out gestation crates. We were also recently successful at getting Kraft Foods to do away with tail docking, which is the practice of slicing off a calf's tail without painkillers.
[Are there any companies who you feel are especially humane in their treatment of animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyihm?context=5)|I think there are companies that are making strides in the right direction, but none that I would promote as being humane. I think the only way to be 100% humane is to go simply stop eating animals. With that said, when it comes to the issue of gestation crates Costco, Kmart, Kroger, Safeway, Mcdonalds, Burger King, Wendy's and a pretty long list of others have committed to doing away with them. With that said, all that means is the pigs will be given enough space to turn around, lie down, and engage in some natural behaviors. Far from ideal. But still a big step in the right direction.
[How do you get from place to place and why are you dressed so fancy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyiti?context=5)|We have a little Toyota Corolla that we drive around the country. It's packed to the brim. I also want to add that we almost never stay at motels. We have done 92 stops with this campaign and have probably stayed at a motel 4 times. We stay with local volunteers and people I have met over the last couple years on my travels. Every now and then we use the website www.couchsurfing.org.
 |We dress up because people take you more seriously when you are dressed up. And since we feel this is a serious issue I wear a suit and tie everyday.
[What was it like being undercover at the pork supplier? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|I have never gone undercover. One of our former investigators did one of these. It can be found here. [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147bjg/i_was_an_undercover_investigator_documenting/)
[How did you manage to get your video and evidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|Our investigators take a job at these facilities and go to work everyday wired with a pinhole sized hidden camera and audio equipment. They basically just document what they see.
[What was Walmart's reaction to the release of your findings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|Walmart is dragging it's feet. They have made no commitment to phasing out gestation crates even though almost every other major food provider has already done so.
[What other undercover investigations have you been a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|Our organization has done over 20. You can learn more at www.mercyforanimals.org .
[Has Wal-Mart tried to stop you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyikh?context=5)|All of our protests are set up on a public sidewalk, which means they are completely legal. Every now and then the management will come out and talk to us. And it's pretty awesome because they are almost always sympathetic to the cause!
[Has anyone ever bothered you while protesting, such as physical or verbal assault? If so, was it from the buisness you were protesting or people passing by?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyozt?context=5)|The response from the public to our protests is overwhelmingly positive. We get a lot of honks of support, thumbs up, waves, etc. Every now and then we get an ""I love bacon,"" or a middle finger. I actually think it's kind of funny.
[Do you think the ag-gag laws that are currently being debated and passed will impact your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyl6w?context=5)|The main thing we are worried about them impacting is our undercover investigations. Without undercover investigations there are no effective watchdogs protecting animals on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. And we think that lawmakers should be working to prevent and prosecute cruelty to animals, rather than making it harder to expose.
[Well done, factory farming is possible the worst mass-scale animal abuse in the 21st century. Do you think people still shop and buy meat from Walmart because of ignorance or because they know about it but don't care?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyqwp?context=5)|I think public knowledge about factory farming is growing which is why we are seeing lots of people going vegetarian, cutting back on meat consumption, and also seeing laws passed in some states to get rid of some of the worst factory farming abuses. But I think there are still a lot of people that really don't know. The meat industry does a pretty good job of hiding their animal abuse from the public.
 |A good video to show friends who don't know about factory farming is www.meatvideo.com .
[Blunt question but how do you grow to care so much about animals we are going to kill and eat anyway? Not condoning the gestation crates, just curious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypre?context=5)|Farmed animals experience pain and suffering just like dogs and cats. I think the best thing we can do for the animals is go vegetarian. But in the meantime we can all agree that these animals deserve to at least be able to turn around. And since most people are opposed to animal abuse, I think most people are on our side with this issue.
[What does this do to prices? I see lots of people protest things tags they don't like and assume that the buying public should absorb slightly higher prices to cover the change. Most of the actual improvements that seem to become widespread enough to be meaningful involve someone working with the industries to make sure that the changes are price neutral so that they're not just adopted by a limited crowd willing to pay for it. Any success on this front?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypmb?context=5)|Iowa State University conducted a two-and-a-half year long economic analysis of the issue and found that that a group housing solution resulted in a weaned pig cost that was 11 percent less than the cost of a weaned pig from the individual stall confinement system.
 |But I really think we need to change the way we view animals. Animals are living beings with needs and wants of their own. If we are really opposed to animal abuse I don't think we should be looking at their welfare in terms of cost.
[What do you vision for the future of the food industry, especially the fast food one. Do you see these big corporations exposed and forced to change or will things continue to get worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oym4h?context=5)|Most people are horrified when they learn about the tiny cages farmed animals live in, the mutilations they endure, and the brutal slaughter they are subjected to. When they learn this they don't want to support it. And a lot of corporations are realizing this, which is why many are beginning to offer more vegetarian options.
 |I do think things will get better. We just have to work smart and hard.
[What made you want to help the animals in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyrff?context=5)|I grew up with a dog. She was my first connection with animals. And I saw in her first hand that she had her own personality. She experienced emotions. And she felt pain. When I got older I started questioning what the difference was between a dog and pig. I got a leaflet from Vegan Outreach a few times. And then came across a video similar to the one at www.meatvideo.com. After that I decided to go vegetarian and advocate on behalf of farmed animals.
[Of all your encounters with individuals and the media, which stands out in your mind as the most successful? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oympy?context=5)|Both encounters were on different campaigns. 
 |I was leafleting at the university in Orlando, FL when a girl took a leaflet from my friend Vic, read it for a few minutes, then threw out the bacon and egg sandwich she was eating. She talked to us for a while and said she was going vegetarian.
 |I was on the Farm to Fridge Tour a couple years ago. You can read more about it at www.farmtofridgetour.com. The local FOX affiliate in Fort Myers, FL did a pre-story on our demonstration there. They said it got more viewer responses than any other Sunday night story in the history of the station. So they came out again the next day, did a live shot earlier in the day, and then did another story at night. All 3 stories were amazing!
[How do you think your strategies differ from those of previous activists who have had little apreciable effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyl82?context=5)|One thing we do at MFA that I think is really important is maintain a professional image. People take us more seriously because of it.
[How do the people working at a location usually try to handle the situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyonv?context=5)|They usually don't even come out and talk to us. Every now and then they will. But after speaking with us for a couple minutes they actually end up being sympathetic. A lot of them are shocked Walmart is still using gestation crates after so many of their competitors have committed to doing away with them.
[Do you honestly think your campaign is going to make a difference? If so, how? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyp7z?context=5)|This campaign has been so successful with garnering mainstream media attention all over the country and getting public support that I think it's only a matter of time. The longer Walmart waits on this issue, the worse they look.
[Often times, I see organizations point out faults in a system, but come up with no solutions to the problem. What are some of your solutions to better animals' living conditions, while also producing at the same large scale farming that needs to be done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oysj3?context=5)|Smithfield, one of the nations largest pork producers has already moved toward alternative housing with much success. We feel pregnant pigs deserve to at least be able to turn around. This is something a number of systems support, which would include group housing, outdoor hutches, or even just larger individual pens.
[Are you familiar with the documentary ""Food Inc.""?  I have changed the way I eat because of that, what's your take on that movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oywkb?context=5)|That's a really good documentary. And I'm glad it's become so mainstream. I have met so many people all over the country who have watched it. I do also think it's pretty tame and doesn't show just how bad the animals are treated on factory farms. If you ever have the time you should check out Mercy For Animals 12-minute documentary called Farm to Fridge. You can watch it at www.meatvideo.com .
[What can I do to help raise awareness to this issue? I am fresh out of giant inflatable pigs last I checked, but I think this widely-accepted abuse needs more attention.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oysw9?context=5)|Thanks for wanting to help out.

[As a bacon lover. What can I do to ensure that I am eating cruelty free bacon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oysup?context=5)|Good question. I think the only way to be cruelty free is to not eat bacon. With that said, there are less cruel ways of getting bacon. Really the only way to know though, is to actually go to the farm and see for yourself.
[What is your opinion on PETA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz01k?context=5)|Mercy For Animals is a completely separate organization. We see eye to eye with them on a lot of things but their tactics are sometimes different than the way we go about things. We try to maintain a professional image as well.
[Who have you investigated with positive results? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypvk?context=5)|All of our investigations are done completely at random. But every time our investigators come out of these facilities they have footage of horrific cruelty. There is almost always sadistic abuse. But the real horrific cruelties are the standard practices. Practices such as confining animals to cages where they can barely move, mutilating them without painkillers, etc. are considered standard practice within the industry. To learn more check out www.meatvideo.com.
[I started watching meatvideo.com and I wonder how ubiquitous these practices are. Do you have any idea or have you simply been made aware of some farms?  Edit: I found this informational site: Link to www.depts.ttu.edu.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p1938?context=5)|Since isn't 1 federal law in existence that protects farmed animals during their lives the abuses documented at www.meatvideo.com run rampant in facilities nationwide. Most of the abuses shown, such as confining the animals to tiny cages where they can barely move, castrating them or slicing off their tails without painkillers, and slitting their throats (many times while fully conscious) at the slaughterhouse are considered standard practice within the industry. These abuses aren't just a few factory farms failing to meat industry standard. The abuses are industry standard.
[Who's paying you rent? It seems protesting is your full time job now, which is admirable, but not very profitable.  How are you getting by?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0ssh?context=5)|I no longer have an apartment. I'll be subletting from someone anytime there is a break between tours.
[What are some of the best alternatives to meet the demand for this popular product (meat in general, pork in specific\)? What are our choices for ethically maintained animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oywhf?context=5)|I don't believe there is a way to ethically kill and eat animals. There are definitely less cruel methods. But that means there are just differing degrees of cruelty. The only completely ethical choice is to leave animal off our plates. There are lots of meat alternatives from companies like Boca, Morningstar Farms, Gardein, etc. I would suggest trying numerous products to find the ones that you like.
[ of all, let me say that I love that you are doing this.  Any victory in the husbandry practices of our country is a huge one!!  That being said, how do you actually film these videos?  In other words, you seem like an animal lover and I just don't know if I could watch what is going on on these farms, etc.  How do you ""keep your wits about you"" when taping a video and stop from vomiting, cringing, etc??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p1hlg?context=5)|I have never personally done any of the investigations. Our investigators take a job at the facility and just go in wired with a pin hole sized hidden camera and audio equipment. Then they just document what they witness. After every investigation the investigator comes out of the facility with images of horrific cruelty.
[Why should I stop eating meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyu2k?context=5)|Www.meatvideo.com.
[What are your thoughts on horse meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oynna?context=5)|I think all animals feel pain and suffering and deserve the same respect. So the same reason I won't eat a dog, I also won't eat a chicken or a horse.
[What do you hope happens from your protesting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyox1?context=5)|We're just calling on Walmart to follow the lead of Costco, Kroger, Safeway, and a ton of others and commit to phasing out crates that prevent pregnant pigs from even turning around.
[How do you know if you are buying meat from a source that treats its animals well? I have no intentions of becoming a vegetarian, I love meat too much, but I don't want to support of company that is okay with animal cruelty either. What should I know when buying meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyrce?context=5)|Thanks. I was asked a similar question earlier and this was my response: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz20l)
[What do you think of synthetic meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz2ot?context=5)|Are you talking about in vitro meat? I am in full support of it because there would be no suffering involved in making it.
[Do you get an income doing what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyrir?context=5)|Yes. I'm not raking in the big bucks though. I do this work because I'm passionate about reducing the amount of suffering in the world.
[Piggybacking off that question, how did you start doing what you do for a living? Was it a transition from intern / volunteer to paid employee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p13os?context=5)|I did a lot of volunteering for various organizations. ie. Vegan Outreach, the Humane League, HSUS, etc. I eventually got offered a job at Vegan Outreach. Through doing all this work I met people who worked for Mercy For Animals. When they thought of the first idea for a tour they asked me if I was interested. And I've been with MFA since then.
 |FYI The first campaign I went on can be found here: www.farmtofridgetour.com .
[What have been some of you favorite places to eat while on the road? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8ozkk6?context=5)|We hit up a lot of really good vegan and vegetarian restaurants. Green in Phoenix, Spiral Diner in Dallas, Chicago Diner in Chicago, Govinda's in Philadelphia. There are so many good places to eat all over the country. We also go to Chipotle quite a bit. We try not to make a habit of going to Taco Bell, but sometimes we are just in a hurry on our drive to the next city. You can veganize anything at Taco Bell by replacing the meat with beans and saying fresco-style. Fresco means no dairy.
[If it pops, will you just pack up and go home? Or do you have like closets of these things. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0q2f?context=5)|Since it is constantly being pumped with air by a blower a little hole probably wouldn't even do anything. I bet there are probably little holes in it right now that we don't even notice. If the hole is a decent size we would have to repair it.
[Does being an animal rights advocate and vegan/vegetarian ever make you feel alienated?  And if so, does it sometimes get to you and how do you deal with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p4426?context=5)|It used to. And I think it had a lot to do with how abrasive I was. And I think it's understandable when others are abrasive regarding these issues. The suffering is so immense and it can be crazy to see so many people participating in it. But being this way is not helpful to animals as it just pushes people away.
 |I try to not be judgmental anymore. And I try to be very encouraging of small steps others take toward veganism. I have seen more people close to me go vegetarian since becoming this way. My entire family, and many in my extended family have actually gone vegan.
[Who is your favorite volunteer EVER?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oykg4?context=5)|Haha I love you Chris! I want to come back to Orlando. It's snowing in Kentucky.
[Would you rather fight a 10 ft. tall inflatable pig or some Reddit AMA trope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oym6r?context=5)|I tackle and body slam the inflatable pig everyday in order to deflate it when we shut down the event.
[What's your favorite kind of animal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyles?context=5)|I'm pretty fascinated by monkeys.
[Why do you target wal mart instead of the meat suppliers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oywku?context=5)|Since Walmart has such enormous purchasing power, if they end the sale of crated pork, their suppliers will all be forced to change.
[Have you ever been harassed due to your views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyr0k?context=5)|After having over 100k one-on-one interactions when I leafleted for Vegan Outreach I've gotten pretty good at dealing with people. If someone comes at me very antagonistic, within 2 or 3 minutes we are usually shaking hands, laughing, and becoming friends.
[Have you been to the Sioux Falls South Dakota location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8ozsdt?context=5)|Unfortunately no. We tried to fit it into part-1 of this tour. But we had to decide to either go through ND or SD. We ended up going through ND. Hopefully we can make it through on a different campaign in the future.
[I have a question and I don't mean to be rude or offensive in any way, it's simple curiosity: If animals were euthanized humanely, treated properly and weren't subject to any form of abuse during the course of their lives up until they're turned into food for humans, would that be better? From reading some of the other comments, I'm getting that you're on a vegan/vegetarian diet. If animals weren't killed inhumanely would you still consume them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p54vo?context=5)|That would not be anywhere near as bad as the way it is typically done today. But since there is no need to consume animals I would still not do it.
[Any other retailers we should be wary of when buying meat products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyn8r?context=5)|The investigation into the Walmart supplier did find pretty awful stuff, but the reality is that the practices done there are pretty common in the pork industry, e.g. ~80% of pig farms use gestation crates (extreme confinement), it's completely legal to slam piglets to death, castrate w/o painkillers, clip teeth, and so on. So the easiest way to ensure you aren't supporting this horrific animal abuse is to simply not eat meat.
[It seems to me like you have issues with the supplier, not Walmart itself. Is this true? Why not go after the source? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oznme?context=5)|Thanks. I answered a similar question here: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0lxx)
[How do you feel about your proposal rising prices on pork, possibly pushing it out of the diets of lots of people in America who are not food-secure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p059v?context=5)|Thanks.

 |But to add to it, there are lots of delicious plant-based foods that are inexpensive like beans, pasta, rice, etc.
[What are some of the hilarious shenanigans you've endured while transporting a 10ft-tall inflatable pig around the country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0pam?context=5)|When it deflates it gets pretty small. On top of the inflatable we also a have a generator and a blower that blows air into the inflatable. I travel with one other person and we also have our clothes and whatnot. The car is completely packed full.
[Yah we saw you in Nashville last week, right?  Can't be too many fellers going around with a giant pig.  Thanks for fighting for the wee critters!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p06yr?context=5)|That's awesome! Did you drive by? Or see us on the news? We got a lot of media attention that day.
[What's your favorite snack on the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0jif?context=5)|I try to eat relatively healthy. Sometimes I buy a little bag of cashews at the gas station. I also like clif bars, but try not to eat those too often.
[Are you against eating meat/hunting animals as a whole? Or are you just against the mis-treatment of animals in mass production?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p6gpv?context=5)|I think that hunting is nowhere near as bad as factory farming. There is far less cruelty involved. I have met many hunters over the years, especially when I used to do a lot of pro-veg leafleting, and even most of them are opposed to factory farming. But I think that since eating meat is not necessary for us to survive I still wouldn't endorse hunting.
[Why do you care? Are you a champion for any others causes or perceived injustices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyl8q?context=5)|I have helped organize various peace, gay rights, and environmental events and demonstrations. Since the number of farmed animals suffering on factory farms is so huge, and the suffering so horrific, I see advocating on their behalf as the way for me to have the biggest bang for time and money spent. Since the average meat eater eats between 50 and 100 animals per year. If someone goes vegetarian from a result of my activism that means 50-100 animals spared a life of suffering every year for the rest of that person's life.
[Have you attempted to speak to the politicians in office in the state where these Wal-Mart facilities are located? Maybe we could get those states to ban those cages, and do something about making them use painkillers for any amputation at any stage of the pigs lives.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypo6?context=5)|Gestation crates have actually been banned in 9 US States. Most of them are still in the phase out period. We definitely support all laws to protect animals from abuse on factory farms. But Mercy For Animals does not do any lobbying.

Adopting a humane vegetarian diet is the best thing we can do to prevent these abuses. To learn more check out www.chooseveg.com.

[I can only wonder what kind of unseen effects on the meat arises from such horrible conditions.

I am huge fan of Food Inc. It has really raised awareness among a lot of people. Have you watched any of our investigations yet? Our latest investigation at a Walmart pork supplier can be found at www.walmartcruelty.com. That video is just 3-minutes long. You can also see our 12-minute documentary Farm to Fridge at www.meatvideo.com. Farm to Fridge shows how animals are treated on factory farms and slaughterhouses.
[You're so handsome...  I love the work you're doing, I realized not everyone will switch to a vegetarian diet but it's the small steps that help.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p2qup?context=5)|Ha. Thanks. And I agree about your second point. Research backs that up as well. It is known as the foot in the door technique. When people make a small step in the right direction they become much more likely to make a larger step in the long run.
[I will NEVER spend a penny at Walmart. People do not realize the longterm destruction this company is doing to the US and Canadian economy.

I would like to know what any of you people in the field think about the following:
Is it worth my time to join Tau Beta Pi, apparently the nation's largest engineering honors fraternity / club.
They say that I am in the top 1/8th of my class and that it looks really good for a resume / internship, but I am a bit skeptical. they want 75$. I have a really good GPA (3.9) but who know's how long that will last as I am only in my sophomore year.

I've heard back from some places, including some very big names, but not nearly as many as I'd like. The main problem with my resume is lack of a true internship, I'm trying to make it represent my skill set the best it possibly can to get past the HR filters.

I usually come across very strong in an interview. I'm personable and have advanced knowledge of data structures, algorithms and other common interview areas. Frankly, I think I have potential to be a really great developer. It really burns me to keep getting rejection emails for jobs that I seem to fit the bill for, and honestly know that the employer is missing out by not looking at me.

For instance, one place sent me a programming challenge, I got the answer and with right Big-O sort of algorithm, there micro-optimizations that could be made, which I found out about only after I researched the problem(after completing it), but for never seeing it before my solution was very well thought out and showed a good use of data structures. I never heard back for some unknown reason. 

Another place sent a set of interview questions on one of those job quiz sites saying ""we just want to know about your thought process"" and proceeded to ask factual questions about java,sql, and hadoop- I don't even claim to know Hadoop and they said it was for an entry level position,wtf? I mean I don't want to work for a place that thinks asking ""how do you write the syntax of this sql query?"" is a valid or interesting measure of candidate anyway.

I may be artificially limiting myself, because I don't apply to any front-end web jobs that seem to be so prevalent right now. But I have no fucking interest in Javascript/Jquery/css/UI/UX and all that, its simple boring work to me and plenty of people can without a CS degree can do it.

How can I convince real technology companies that I'm top notch? I've done interesting projects that push boundaries in a real algorithmic sense, may be publishing a paper on one. I've gotten a high GPA, I have a very strong grasp on the entire body of knowledge that goes into a CS degree. I know I sound arrogant but I really think I should be doing better than fighting over Java jobs to make a web server talk to a database with people who never had an original thought it their life.

Basically, I think I'm pretty damn good when it comes to CS, how can I make my resume portay that and get to the point where I can be evaluated by people who will see how good I am?"

(long)",panderr,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/19sc5i/stunted_adult_in_the_weeds_where_to_start_picking/,"I read the board a bit, and I see that most of you are students, and I realize that this might not be the best place for the questions I'm asking, but I do know administrators, and admissions officers do hang around here sometimes. If this forum isn't the best place to get the answers, I'm looking for, can you point me towards where I should be looking?  

So, Here goes. 
I'm an adult and need education. I have had some issues in my life and am pretty much stunted (ie all of this should have been taken care of when I was in high school, not 12 years later).
I have a terrible high school transcript, there's no way I'm getting into a decent school (small public HS with ~40 people in each grade, no specialized classes or major, high absence and low gpa unless weighted and then its average).
One reason my transcript is so bad is health issues (still dealing with them). I do qualify for disability services, but that's besides the point (that fact will not get me into a school or help me pay for it). That said I'm not dumb. I've always been told by my teachers, doctors, bosses, people I meet at parties etc. that I'm really smart, and everyone I meet is surprised I'm formally uneducated. This is in part because I value knowledge and information (I read a lot).


What I want to get out of the time at college is a decent paying job with benefits (having comprehensive insurance is a HUGE deal to me because of my health issues) and be comfortable financially. Until now I've made enough to get by, but i'm nowhere near financially secure: I need skills and and education to change that. I also want to keep the costs low (I'm OK with spending some money but I do not want to be $60K in debt after, unless it will be very likely that I will be able to pay that off relatively fast). The school's reputation is also important to me as I wish to live abroad for a period of time.

I know community college is probably the way to start to make up for the transcript, but isn't it better to go to a 4 year school straight away because of the opportunities available (internships, research, connections, etc. to put on the CV)? If not, what (besides work) can I do to make the application to a 4year school stand out so I end up with school with even better connections and opportunities (internships and above, plus job placement, alumni network), and ultimately, a better job? 


My dream jobs are probably ridiculous, as many people want them, they are highly competitive and for most people, pay poorly: buyer for a store (aka merchandising, I've spoken a bit to a retired buyer for a national department store and this seems like a great job IF i can get in, which is very hard),editor for a women's magazine, interior designer, traveling food writer/critic (I know a lot about the subjects but there are no concrete examples to show someone, and it is at an amateur level). These interests point to a humanities major/liberal arts degree but this is the one of the worst majors for employ-ability (when you are not counting internships, experience, etc.). I am fluent at a native/professional/university level in two languages, conversant in another, and can read but not understand spoken/write two others (same language family as my non English native language, its not that much of an accomplishment, just chance).
My math skills are atrocious, but I also credit this to missing so much school (I had to learn a lot of it via non specialized tutor, in condensed time to pass the school years on time), forget about physics (never had a class). My study skills are probably a joke at this point (so long out of school, and my old habits weren't good), but those can be learned.

Given my unconventional needs and background, how do I choose a course of study/major and subsequently, the school?


FWIW, i've always lived in commuting distance to NYC and recently moved to the city to be with my significant other (I am not a full resident so I can not take advantage of CUNY/SUNY programs that exist). I would consider moving anywhere for school though.

Should I just remove the fact that I worked there from my resume and host all of my work on github? Any suggestions?"
19rvuj,3,2013-03-06,[Internship] Management Information Student BBA seeking summer internship in gaming or tech industry,mrgibons,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/19rvuj/internship_management_information_student_bba/,"&gt;A lot of kids growing up in my generation wanted to make video games, but very few stuck with it. Most push it aside as a pipe dream or a waste of time, I did not. I have me making games since I was 12 years; furthermore I have been selling my games since I was 14. I would burn a bunch of my games on to disks and sell them at school to combat teachers blocking game websites, a feat which landed me in trouble a few times I might add. Eventually, when I reached the high school level I had acquired friends with a similar interest and skill in game creation. This led me to start a little publishing group that we called “UberStudios”. Together we would create games and I would sell them, this lasted my entire freshmen year. At this point flash games were the most popular since they had the easy and mobility of the internet behind them. The group was disbanded, though only professionally we will remained friends, and I started a series of web site portals that would link students to the best and most popular games on the web at the time. My love of games allowed a rural Wisconsin community to experience the thrills of the industry, a thrill I have kept with me since. 
I started my college education at Western Technical College where I studied programming. I enjoy programming, I love the logic and mindset that follows programming. I feel that having a background in programming enhances problem solving. At the end of my second year of college while working on a group project, I found one of my old games. It was a titled called “Kyle’s Adventure”, a game that followed our friend Kyle as he crash landed on an island full of living evil vending machines. The concept was bizarre, but I was able to convince my partners in the project that we should recreate it for the XBOX for our assignment. This rekindled my love of leading a group, while I love programming I feel my strong vision and charisma better suits me for producing. I took a semester off and then transferred to Viterbo University in pursuit of my Bachelors in Management Information Systems (B.B.A). I feel that for the area I’m in, that this degree focus will help me get to where I want to be in the industry. I am currently set to graduate from Viterbo in 2014 at which point I will continue on to the SMU Guildhall in pursuit of my Masters in Interactive Technology with a focus on Production.
I really prize myself in taking projects from concept to reality. I have a passion for games, the game industry, and I love to better myself.  I have found that there are very few internships that deal with publishing or producing and if given an opportunity I would not waste a second of it. 

Thanks you for your consideration.

I am currently looking for a summer internship and need some help preparing for interviews. I have access to the popular tech-interview books/questions etc. I gave a few interviews(one with Google and one with Amazon, and I gave another one with Microsoft last year), but got rejects from all of them. And since these companies give no feedback, I have no idea what I am doing wrong. I am not saying I am acing all the interviews, but my Amazon interview went pretty well,but still I got a reject. So I am feeling that I am definitely doing something wrong, but I do not know exactly what. So I am not sure what to work on. I was wondering if there are any technical interviewers in here who are willing to volunteer and take a mock phone interview with me. I just want them to be very critical and point out my mistakes so that I can work on them. If anyone is willing to volunteer 30 mins-1 hr of their time to help me out on this, I will be very grateful. You can keep your identity secret. Just call me and take a mock interview and give me some feedback. Someone who actually interviews people in these big companies would be ideal!

Essentially all they really want from me is to help them move their WordPress site to a new server and some minor coding ect.

Now their current host is a nightmare. Its a foreign host reseller with only one U.S. ""office"" that no one ever seems to hear from. No back-end access, no cpanel of any kind and apparently the journal had to fight just for FTP access. I got into an email argument with their support over getting a copy of the database because they block all scripts and plugins that attempt to get that information.

I finally got the database from them, and today I come in to download the actual files themselves so I can create a development server to implement new code or changes without having to do them live on their slow site. When suddenly every file transfer starts to fail. I realized soon after not only could I not access our own website but I could no longer access the website of the host either. I checked and it was only down for us, using a proxy I was able to confirm that they put an IP block on us, preventing us from reaching our own content.

I email and call and I get nothing in return, just silence. Anyone have any practical advice for me?"

I often have to parse/ edit text files where the formatting is SUPER important-- eliminating a space or numbering rows incorrectly will render the file unreadable by the programs that use them. 

That's not an issue when I only need to do one or two (I just cheat and do it by hand :P) but lately I've been given tasks where I needed to automate the editing because I had to do 200 or 300 files. When it's a matter of just deleting lines, that's not an issue-- I can just grep -v the unwanted lines in the shell. When I have to edit the lines, however, that gets tricky, and that's when I have to use C++, which can get cumbersome.

I really should learn how to write bash shell scripts, and I've been looking into Python. But any other tips would be forever appreciated. :)

This is a snippet of a file I've been editing. My most recent task involved removing every line with an H and re-numbering the columns (most of these are MUCH longer). I needed to preserve the first four lines exactly as is, however, and I don't want to re-write the files, but save them as new (similarly named) files. Awk and grep are sufficient for most of this, but I haven't figured out how to do the re-numbering, and for some reason the space in the first row of every line gets deleted."

I desperately sent out some e-mails last week to some startups in the Bay Area after stumbling on the HackerNews thread [here]( http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5304169), expressing my interest in getting my first software engineering internship (I'm a 3rd year computer engineer). 

Chances like this for me are rare since I'm not in my school's co-op program; where I live (Vancouver) has less jobs available for SE. 

I really want to make a good impression but what I foresee happening, or am nervous about anyway, is that they'll mention a bunch of technologies I've never touched and I'll be at a loss of words as to how I can potentially contribute. Like MongoDB or Django or HTML5. I've only done some very newbie/minor Android development (a calculator), an Arduino side project, and my regular school projects (C, C++).

How should I approach this? Any startup engineers here by coincedence that might want to give insights as to what you would look for from a work-inexperienced potential intern?"

I'm currently a third year MechE student considering staying a fifth year for a CS degree. I am interested in robotics and control systems, and while I have learned a lot of programming on my own, I think the CS degree will help me have a more formal background. Also, I am hoping to start working on a research project in the fall that I will be able to work on for at least a year before applying to grad school. I've saved up so I wouldn't have to work, meaning I could put more hours into research/projects/clubs.
 
While I have worked on research projects previously, they have all been in the very early stages so I haven't had a chance to publish/present at a conference. I took this semester for an internship (Big name plus my mentor expects me to publish a paper by the end), so I am no longer working on those two projects. Would staying an extra year for a second major + more research experience be a significant benefit in grad school applications? One big benefit of staying the extra year would be refining my research interests because there are currently a few areas I am interested in and I do not think I will know for sure by the time I apply for schools if I am finishing next year.
 
For some more background, I am currently at a Big State U ranked around 50th for engineering in US depending where you look for the two programs I am interested. I expect to maintain a 3.9+ GPA either way, and from the practice GREs I think I will be able to get high 90 percentile on quant, low 90 on verbal. My only real concern is that the lack of a long term research project will prevent me from getting in top ranked schools like CMU.
 
While I can't imagine it would hurt my application, paying for another year of school (no scholarship past four years) and starting to work a year later has a big financial impact so I just want to make sure the decision makes sense.
 
Thanks for any suggestions!"
19zodx,1,2013-03-09,Thinking about quitting my job but it could be a bad idea. What do you think?,DividedBy_Zero,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19zodx/thinking_about_quitting_my_job_but_it_could_be_a/,"Background:
I started working in retail in 2006, and the job paid my way through college as a Graphic Design major, but things haven't panned out very well since graduating in 2010, and I've found myself investing in a career that just wasn't working out. After about a year of stale internships, non-paying clientele, and interviews that went nowhere, I gave it up altogether, and in 2011, I began pursuing my masters in Computer Science, and now I'm about 1.5 years away from finishing the program.

The entire time, I've kept my job as a cashier because it was a really good yield for a part-time gig: $10.20/hr, plus prescription, vacation time, sick pay, time-and-a-half on Sundays, and somewhat decent health coverage. The place is also right in my neighborhood, so I have $0 commuting cost. I can't imagine getting such a great yield anywhere else.

But things have changed in recent times; the health plan has been downgraded to MagnaCare, and from what I've been reading online, it's absolute garbage and is frowned upon in healthcare circles. We also recently got a newly-appointed supervisor who is the ultimate douche of a human being (the kind that wears sunglasses indoors and is never seen without them on).

I've tolerated the pangs of retail for a long time now (dumb or mentally ill customers, incompetent co-workers), and I know that there are lots of people out there who wish they had my job, but now that my healthcare is a joke, and that there's an ego-stroking douchebag for a higher-up, I feel that I've reached my threshold and am ready to call it quits.

My problem, however, is that I have no suitable backups for employment. Most places don't seem to want a still-in-school programmer with zero experience, and it seems like a bad idea to give up both a health insurance plan and an income. Since I'm still living at home with my parents, my greatest money sink would be tuition. This job, combined with the savings I've got, will be just enough to get me through school with $0 debt on my back.

What would you do? Would you just try to endure for another year?"
19zjrb,8,2013-03-09,Where to start with internships?,rubberducking,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19zjrb/where_to_start_with_internships/,"So this fall I'm going to school to major in Computer Science. I want to get into the web development industry and I just landed my actual customers which is great because I'm now learning to deal with clients.

I read an post about how important interning while in college can be. I'm going to bust my ass to get the best GPA and study as hard as I can.

My question is where do you go to find internships? I know its way late to look for one this coming summer, but I want to be prepared as best I can. So here are the questions I have off the top of my head, and feel free to chime in any advice you have.

* Where do I look for internships? Do I google web development companies in kansas city area or do most people actually relocate for internships?
* Will they have it public that they're looking for interns or do I just email them with a resume asking if they're offering internships? I'm working on a portfolio site, is this something I should send a link to? What about my GitHub account (in process of uploading my code, I've only been using Git locally so far).
* I know their are paid and unpaid internships, but from what I hear if it's free don't even give it a second glance. Is this the actual mentality of most? 
* If I should only be looking for paid internship, what's the general ballpark for starting wage?

I live in the Kansas City area and will be attending UMKC if it matters.

EDIT: Also, if you have any resources on creating a ""professional"" resume or literally anything helpful I'm always looking for me to read."
19z8n8,1,2013-03-09,Missed Calls,MVoltaire,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19z8n8/missed_calls/,"I heard this one from a friend of a friend (Facebook, naturally) so I was dubious until he showed me the email he'd received. You can make up your own minds.

My friend – let’s call him Bill – works for a newspaper in his town, doing reviews. He was given an assignment one year to go into the supposedly haunted houses in the area, some in his home town and at least two in B_________, ME. This guy doesn't scare easily, by the way. He once wrote off to Gacy, and got a long letter back as a reply (also seen as a photo via Facebook). 

The last house on the list was the G_______ house, and it had been condemned by B _____’s town council that week, so he sort-of had permission from the newspaper to go in there and do some research – local flavour, say how creepy it was and then take a photo or two. He took two of the exterior, and went in through the front doors. It helps if you know the layout –  a two-storey wooden house with a large picture window out front. He walked all around the ground floor, and didn't feel anything at the time. No chills, no spooky sounds, nothing. He even tried out calling some names (associated with the property’s hauntings) but there was nothing. The inside of the house was all still pretty well as they’d left it back in the 1990’s, but all the furniture was gone. The G______ house hauntings had apparently been going on from 1970- intermittently, so there was sure to be something to write about, even if it was only a historical piece. 

Bill told me that he’d gone from room to room on the bottom floor, doing the same thing, calling out to see if there was any ‘supernatural response’ – I think he was checking for rats, too. The staircase still seemed sound, so he managed to get halfway upstairs before he say what he described to me as a ‘white, flowing thing’. It was not a curtain, or wall-hanging, or any fabric that could have been loose in the wind. There wasn't a curtain or blind left hanging up there, or even peeling wallpaper. There wasn't even a draft which could have blown something into his line of sight.

Bill made it up to the top of the staircase, but he didn’t manage to reach any of the rooms. He couldn't see anything white or flapping (I even asked him if it could have been an animal or maybe a grocery bag or similar). The lights were out, but this was in the middle of the day, just coming up to April. Something stopped him from moving off the landing into the top rooms of the house – every time he made to step further into the corridor, he became nauseous. Sick to the point of vomiting. He stepped over the top stair, and immediately vomited, but didn’t lose his balance. 

He says he doesn’t know what made him want to run down the stairs straight after. He was still shaky, but he didn’t vomit again once he was out of the house. 

Bill isn’t a smartphone addict, so he wasn’t surprised when he saw that he had four missed calls, all leaving messages. What he was surprised about was that they were all timed from the moment – roughly – that he stepped onto the staircase. One at 1:43, another at 1:45, and then two more at 1:47. 

1:43 call was something Bill thought was a wrong number. It sounded like a young guy who was drunk. “Bitch, don’t you fucking threaten me…fucking dosed me with something real good...”

The second call, at 1:45 was “just sound at first – like someone breathing heavily, choking, and then a girl’s voice crying”. Bill has friends who’ve been known to pull pranks on him, and some of these did know he was off to see the G______ house that day, so he wasn’t that creeped by it. It was the two final calls that did it.

The first call at 1:47 was “kinda echoing, like it was made in a large space with a high ceiling”. Some thumping sounds, like someone coming up or down steps, on floorboards. There was some static, but the next part was where he lost it completely. He clearly heard, above the static, his own voice asking ‘if the spirits knew if there was anybody there’. There was a female voice, just after it.
“There is. Keep away, he’s toxic.”

The final call was not the same voice. It was just a growl, more like an old man instead of the young girl’s voice. There were just two words. “Get out.”

Bill did turn in his column that week without saying what had happened with the phone calls in full. There were a flood of letters afterwards, though. It turned out that the paper’s researcher interns had got it wrong. The G________ house was further down, 117 rather than 107 T______ St. Local ghost hunters were making fun of it on the paper’s website. Bill deleted the answerphone messages, as he thought it was more than likely it was his friends pranking him. The sickness he never did explain.

It took another week before someone actually wrote an email to Bill from F_______ , ME. His daughter had lived in 107 T_______ St, in 1989. Sick of living with her junkie husband, she had cut his heroin with rat poison.  Instead of calling an ambulance, she had been paralysed with fear as he died in front of her, cursing, vomiting. Finally, she was able to get up enough courage to crawl from the upper rooms towards the staircase, but she tripped and fell. The fall took her down the stairs, and left her with a neck injury and some mild brain damage. Her father had visited her in hospital, and then in jail until she was sentenced. She was now at Charleston, but it was unlikely that she would ever return to B__________.

[Do you remember a certain person or reading that stood out to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlt8x?context=5)|Ooph, that's a tough question. There are certainly a lot of people that come to mind. I think the main person, that just blew my mind, was a woman who would use the SMS service and would ask -
 |&gt;Does [Steve] love me? Does he want to be with me? Will we be together?
 |She sent her first text at 07:00 when she woke up and would send it every 20 minutes until 23:00 when she went to sleep. At first, because everything has to be positive, a lot of the replies went like this - 
 |&gt;I feel a love of love and energy around you and [Steve], it is only a matter of time before this energy blah blah.
 |And that's all she ever said. She never replied in a conversation, she'd just send that.
 |At $7 per SMS, it was a lot, for months.
 |Then, one day the message changed. She sent the following - 
 |&gt;Why does nobody at [place of work] talk to me? Were they laughing at me before?
 |That a fairly big moment, at the time, because she had become well known in the company, given we had to come up with a unique response every time; we hated getting her text messages and would bounce her around from person to person just to give ourselves a break.
 |It turns out, over a period of months, that she's never even spoken to [Steve], he's just a guy that works in her office and that in her office, she isn't liked. Nobody spoke to her, they'd laugh at her and make fun of her because she owned a lot of cats. It was horrible.
 |After this came to light, there was a heavy change from the lovey-dovey stuff, to a more progressive - 
 |&gt;I feel that there are other things in your life that you should focus on blah blah.
 |I always wonder what happened to her.
[For some reason reading this story really broke my heart. I guess I just can't fathom how lonely she must have felt :( I hope she is okay.  Edit: autocorrect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rwuls?context=5)|Unfortunately, a lonely person is a charlatans gold mine. She must have spent thousands over a period of months.
[Oh gosh this made me incredibly sad...  It's bad enough that she's a lonely cat lady, and her office mates are mean to her...  But the fact that she paid so much of her hard earned money and looked towards your ""fake"" psychic company as a means for an answer from her sad life just kills me :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rzaqn?context=5)|I understand, I hated her for it. I wanted to grab her and shake her, but obviously couldn't. 
[This is absolutely true. Here in México there are many advertisings like.  $uccesful but alon€?  1234 5678.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8s6j60?context=5)|That's shocking, that's not even subtle.
[So your saying those books I...er my friend bought on how to kill someone with your mind are a fraud?  Oh well then can you recommend what ordinary office equipment would be best for cracking a human skull? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rn8oo?context=5)|Use the book. It's the best use you'll get out of it.
[Would you/ Have you considered fighting the good fight in helping the JREF expose other frauds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rmc6l?context=5)|That's an interesting question. In what way would I be able to help them? Other than confirm what they already know, I don't know if they'd be able to put me to any use or I'd be able to give them anything. It's hardly ground-breaking stuff and I wasn't famous enough for it to be earth shattering.
 |The BBC contacted me after my last AMA and asked me to do an interview as part of an exposé, I was going to, but unfortunately, life got in the way and I ended up forgetting and nothing came of it. 
[*In what way would I be able to help them?*  Public demonstrations, followed by explanations of how you did it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8s7bzv?context=5)|Although I understand, given current and previous circumstances, I wouldn't be able to appear in public and everything I do would need to be at least semi-anonymous, such as this. Rallies, TV shows and the like aren't suitable to my circumstances.
[The best part is that that sort of ironic redemption would make your life read like the backstory of a character in a novel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8so0x9?context=5)|Want to be the ghostwriter?
[Did anyone ever question you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlzfk?context=5)|Question the psychics? Yeah, quite a lot. Some people would do it for the sake of taking the piss when they were bored, some people would want 'proof' before they would take you seriously.
[Did you ever tell any of your clients the truth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlzfk?context=5)|Don't hate me for this, but the latter was rarely a problem. Truth be told, I was good at it. People who are 'testing' you believe in it, so you're not trying to convince somebody that doesn't believe. Believers who are 'skeptical' are just as vulnerable to being exploited, because that belief is there and as long as you know what you're doing, it's no an obstacle.  I'd estimate that 8/10 people who wanted proof, would be satisfied with the 'test' questions.
 |Some of them knew. Most people, I found, just wanted somebody to talk to and vent. Most of what I said was just straight forward advice, rarely did I reply in a 'spiritual' manner. One women knew me by [real] name and knew my hours of work, she'd ask for me specifically and just sit texting me for hours about non-psychic things.
 |People turn to the spiritual and all religion when they're unsure and feel like they need an answer or some guidance; from my experience, an objective take on their situation was often good enough, it didn't need to be spiritual.
[Did you stay in contact with the lady that knew you by name after you left?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrsd1?context=5)|Me and a coworker from there that I stayed in touch with Facebook'd her and sent her a message. She replied a nice message, because we had quit several months earlier; but that was that really. I didn't want to start a personal relationship. It was really just to explain what happened and why everybody just went away; the company went bust after we left, but she wasn't to know that.
[Can I have a fake psychic reading?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrw19?context=5)|[Right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8roa2q). I wrote it before you even showed up. Don't worry about the other comments, you can skip them.
 |Specific stuff for you -
 |You're caring and you want to look after something that you call your own (maybe a child), but you don't want it because you don't have enough trust in yourself that you'll be able to care for it properly. You have bigger hurdles to overcome before you'll be properly confident in yourself to make such a commitment.
 |In that respect though, you know your own weaknesses and what's 'going wrong' and you're actively working to change that; it takes a big person to know when to need help and support. Your fiancee has been amazingly supportive, even though you've taken a lot of things out on her, she's tolerated it and she's helped you through it. Saying that, she can be just as awkward as you are; you both know it.
 |You should probably work on your diet; but don't worry, because I'm a hypocrit for saying it. You have an almost pretentious preference to the original book, rather than the film version, regardless of how the good the film actually was. You have no idea what you want to do with your life, so you take great interest in learning about other peoples and their journeys, because you're trying to figure out your own route to somewhere.
 |You've just not yet realised, that there is no route. Nobody has a path, shit just happens and people adjust; so perhaps too much of your energy is being spent on worry about where you are in comparison to other people, instead of looking back on the personal development and strides you've made in overcoming your own issues that are superb; you don't appreciate how much you've grown as a person and you need to.
 |**Edit: 08/03/2013**- Sorry guys, I really can't give everybody a psychic reading, because they just take too long. However, if you [you donate some money](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/support-us.html)  ($5 will do it) to JREF (of which I am not associated), then I'm sure I'll spend some time coming up with something for you.
[Damnit! I fit into that cookie cutter answer hahaha!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rscxh?context=5)|Don't worry, I did a specific one for you.
[What was the craziest experience that you've had as a ""psychic""? Did you follow a particular script?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rm9hf?context=5)|There was no script or pre-written messages, everything was ad-hoc; it has to be. Obviously, there are lots of vague statements that would come up over and over, because people generally ask the same questions.
 |Crazy experience? When a world-renowned psychic came into the office in order to pick up some scripts he had ordered (these are generalised profiles that they will memorise and recall on command during a group reading). 99% of anybody 'famous' knows it's bullshit. The other 1% have mental health problems and they believe they are.
[I want that to be Derek Acorah.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8ryftk?context=5)|Derek is a prick. 
[Can I quote you on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8s3zsw?context=5)|No.
[Have you ever watched the mentalist? and if so is your reason for leaving the psychic thing behind similar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlddi?context=5)|Honestly? It sounds ridiculous but I swear it's true. The company was 'invested' by a group of rich folk, who wanted to experiment selling their products using NLP to the vulnerable people using the services; that was around the time I realised I seriously needed to jack it in. One day, my boss started shouting at me and I just walked out.
[Holy shit! What products did you recommend to people??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rvk8i?context=5)|None. None at all. The products were nothing outstanding or noteworthy, mostly books and related merch.
[Do you ever feel guilty about being a fraud?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrefp?context=5)|I think that's a fair question.
 |Overall? Yes. I'm not proud of having done it, I don't like to share that part of my employment with co-workers or friends, because it demonstrates a side to me that really only existed because of necessity; it doesn't represent who I am as a human being or as a person. People will instantly judge me because of it, without consideration to other parts of my life or my current work, where I'd say I generally make a positive impact in the world.
 |Specifically, I said in an earlier reply; as much as I hated doing it, I wouldn't change the fact that I've done, simply because I did learn so much in the time I spent; not the fraud part, but cold reading, awareness, maturity, etc.  I think I'm also pretty resentful that such a thing exists in our society, but sadness too, because I also know there's not much that can be done about it; there will always be some form of exploitation, illegal or not.
[Thanks for answering. I can understand necessity creating this opportunity for you.  Another question: Do you feel that there are any form of psychic abilities which are valid or real?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrt29?context=5)|Absolutely not. I just wrote a reply that might express it in more detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rryb0?context=3). Either people are consciously aware that they are exploiting other people or they have serious mental issues that need to be addressed with a mental health professional. 
[I feel most ""psychics"" who work for big companies are Cold Readers](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rro6r?context=5)|I worked for a company that had about 15 employees, including accountant, IT, HR and the actual psychics. They accounted for about 80% of the non-TV advertising in the UK and about 10% of America. People would contact different adverts with the same questions, looking for different responses and it would go through to the same variation of six or so people.  There are no mega-corporations in the game, but it is a game.
[However myself and relatives have had enough uncanny experiences that I still do feel there is an aspect to life that is beyond convential explanation all the time](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rro6r?context=5)|This is your belief and it's great that you have something. I think it's just teetering to the right direction; because you're obviously skeptical of ""some"", but have yet to look into it enough to just give you that push over the edge into realising that there really is no such thing. The idea that ""Some are fake, but some are real"" is enthralling. Everything that you have experienced is explainable in such a way that it is dull.
 |Just briefly, let's say that a 1 - 1,000,000 thing happens. One in one million chance. We're thinking ""shit! That's amazing! It's a miracle!"", yet the reality is, that's underestimating the number of things that could happen and have happened at any one time in history. On your fingernail, there are billions of individual cells. One molecule, just one out of billions, just so happened to be in that place at that specific time; it could have been in 100,000,000,000,000 other places every second that has ever happened in the last 100,000,000,000,000 years in at least 100,000,000,000 dimensions of reality.
 |When you think about it - think about what the ultimate chance of that one molecule ending up on your fingernail is - too many zeros to type - but still, it did. That's exactly where it ended up. When you step back and you think about it, having a one-in-a-million chance is chump change. Yes, these numbers are beyond our tiny minds comprehension; and still, ""uncanny experiences"", no matter how unlikely, have already been eclipsed billions and trillions times over simply by the shape of your fingernail. Infinitesimal odds take place all around and inside you, all of the time and guessing a name, age, anything like that; in comparison, is not impressive at all.
[Did that experience help you to date girls ? Do you use your knowledges in this domain nowadays ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8ru4jt?context=5)|Erm, for me personally? No. There's a lot of psychic-poon to be had, people would throw themselves at you in the hope of getting closer to you; which isn't really my thing and I thought was pretty despicable. These days, it's too manipulative to use when flirting/dating. I think there's a fine line and it's a very, very creepy one to cross.
[If you had eleven fingers, how would you use your eleventh finger to your advantage??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rqip0?context=5)|My typing speed would increase by about 10%! 
[I don't blame you for giving the job a go, but, having seen all this first hand, do you think it should be illegal to charge money for so called 'psychic' services? I know I do. I equate it to false advertisement and con artistry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rq885?context=5)|Absolutely. I would make all forms of quackery illegal where money is exchanged; unless there is actual, scientific evidence that it is more effective than a placebo or such thing actually exists. No more holistic medicine. No more Chinese herbs. Parent's who don't get their child vaccinated are investigated by Child Protection for endangerment. I would create channels for people to 'report' cons and using the fines imposed to fund counseling for anti-cult organisations.
 |If somebody believes in it and they go to a spiritualist church, where no donations or money charged, then that's their right as human beings in a free world. However, I would not allow for money to be exchanged, as that is the cause of the manipulation in the first place. People can exercise their beliefs, but would (hopefully) remove the financial attraction of doing so; protecting the vulnerable, which is what any 'psychic' ultimately does.
[Thats kinda stepping on people's rights.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rult0?context=5)|I'm not saying that I'd be a great dictator.
[I believe asprin was originally derived from willows bark](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rult0?context=5)|Very much so - but we're at least at point in science and technological advancement where we know that they're functional and have an effect. As long as it stands up against a placebo, that's all good in my book. If people want placebos, they can have as many as they like; it's about the money that gets exploited from other peoples vulnerability that annoys me.
[Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rnfgh?context=5)|[Shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rmwok?context=3)
[Did anybody actually call you out on bullshitting. Like let you go on about how their dead uncle misses them and then tell you there is no dead uncle or something like that? How did you handle it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8roh30?context=5)|As much as you'd expect that to happen, it rarely would. As long as you do it right, you're never wrong. Unless you're at least 95% certain about something, you'd never make an outlandish statement - everything else is fairly generic stuff. There are two types of people who are catching you out -
[Did you ever accidentally upset somebody with one of your ""readings""? Like make someone really angry or confrontational?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8roh30?context=5)|People who don't believe in it - didn't come across these very often, because very few people would waste $7 on something like that.
 |People who were testing to see if you were 'real' before asking their actual question - because they already believe, they still 'go for' the regular cold reading, vague and general stuff.
 |Occasionally, you'd get people asking for very specific stuff to test you out and if you know that's what they're trying to do, I used to call them out on it - ""Look, I know you don't care about what you're asking, you're trying to establish if I'm 'real'. Why don't you just tell me what's on your mind?""
 |A lot of the time, yeah. Often, people give you the whole story and background to what's going on and I was very straight forward; I was basically just blatantly giving them advice with no mention of spirits or shit. So when somebody would say ""My husband left me and ran away with his assistant, will he realise his mistake and come back to me?"", I couldn't lie to them more and say ""Hey, everything's going to be okay because he loves you"", so I'd say ""No, no he's not and that's a good thing, because he's a dick and he isn't worth your time. Suffer and cry for a while, get it all out, get drunk with your friends and punch walls, but then it's time heal and move on with your life"".
 |Some people take it very well because that's what people in that situation need to do, others freak out because that's not what they want to hear. I was a tough-love psychic.
[Have you ever seen Sacha Baren Cohen's Da Ali G Show. Specifically where he visits a psychic that gives him a reading on his character. I think that's when I stopped believing all together , I was 14ish at the time.  Edit: sorry I did intend to ask a question... I guess I'll ask, did you find it accurate/entertaining if you've seen it?

Thank you for the link, I haven't seen it in years.
[From what my Mom tells me](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rn21g?context=5)|This is the first flag. People fill in their own blanks.

Everybody knows somebody who has been through that, it's easy to turn around if the person hasn't been through it themselves (""Oh, it must be somebody close to you.."")
[Having two kids, a boy and a girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rn21g?context=5)|Hmm, possibly a shot in the dark (""Two girls? Is one a bit of a tomboy?"") or picked up from somewhere else, that your mother mentioned in response to an earlier question; or even that she was referred by a friend and the friend has inadvertently passed that information on.
 |Making a statement about the distant future, people would forget about that. Also, it's likely that somebody who believes in spirituality would push their children towards that field and make it come true. The psychic said that she'll be in the medical field, so the parent encourages science subjects. Bonus, it's a statistical win, because ""medical"" is a very broad term. She could have been a receptionist in a clinic and it would have been 'accurate'. Also, who doesn't interact with computers? That's not huge.

 |I would say there is a producer or a researcher, who does a pre-interview (i.e., ""who do you want to contact, etc.?""). The research then shares this information with the crew, including the staff / assistant of the Medium, who in turn feeds it back. The producer may even casually leave the pre-interview notes unattended for denability.
 |It is not unheard of for Mediums to bug the lobby or lounge of their performance and have researchers listen out for conversation for beforehand, whilst using plants to walk around and encourage people to open up underneath the microphone.

I just gave him a Google and I don't think I recognise him. Cold Reading, once you get used to it, is so amazingly simple; the risk though is that you end up doing it without realising it, so you no longer need to think ""He looks scruffy, so he's probably not very professional"", you train yourself to do it on instinct. When that happens, the big risk is that you end up believing that you're actually psychic.

19yr8v,37,2013-03-09,Am I too old for internships?,AtheistKharm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19yr8v/am_i_too_old_for_internships/,"I'm a 30 year old adult trying to get my life back on track by going back to school. I'll spare you all the details on why I had my head up my ass for so long. The bottom line is I'm determined to get BS in Computer Science and make a career out of software development/engineering. I need some advice, but first some background:

I have a wife, two kids, mortgage, a full-time job, and go to school full-time. On top of all that, the wife is also going back to school, but while working part-time. We are still in the process of figuring out if this is even feasible. We both want to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, but it's not easy to say the least.

I'm currently going to TCCD (in the DFW area in Texas) and doing their Associates of Arts transfer degree. I have only finished 22 credit hours (7 classes) so far and currently taking 14 hours (4 classes). I currently have a 4.0 GPA and I'm trying really hard to keep it that way, but science classes such as General Biology for Science Majors make it challenging. Due to my situation, I'm not able just transfer to any college I want to. I have been planning on transferring to UNT which is closer to where I live but further from where I work than say UTA, for example. I have been following the UNT 2012-13 computer science transfer guide (found here: http://essc.unt.edu/registrar/articulation/ direct link here: http://essc.unt.edu/registrar/articulation/TransferGuides/2012-13/Engin/CENG%20Computer%20Science%20(BS)%202012-13.pdf). 

Right now I have the luxury to pick and choose what days and times I want classes to be on that meshes really nice with work. However once I transfer, scheduling classes at University–as far as I can tell–will not be as convenient. I have talked to my boss about this and he is willing to manipulate and/or reduce hours to help me out (which is great). 

One question would be, should I consider prestige of UNT vs UTA or should I go with whatever is more practical? They seem about the same to me.

Internships have been on my mind a lot lately because of how important people say they are to finding a job. The thing is, I'm a laptop technician working in a production environment, and I have an embarrassing amount of experience doing just that (about 10 years in this dead end field). In addition, I have been working for my current company over 5 years now (yay more vacation); so I rather not have to quit just to pursue internship experience. However, I'm definitely willing to do it if it's worth it. I should note though, I have done some technical writing for this company and it looks like there is going to be more opportunities to get more experience doing just that. Seems like there are plenty of little programming/scripting projects I can do on the side (that I dreamed up) to help the company out. I don't really know how good that would look on a resume because in the end it is very unlikely my job title or main duty is going to change.

I am aware of how important it is to get involved in an open source project on github or wherever. And this is another main thing I worry about all the time is not having enough time to really do stuff on the side. For example, I would like nothing more than to spend the next week during spring break doing coding. In fact I will be spending a decent about of time working ahead in my C++ class to get that out-of-the-way, but a great deal of my time is going to be spent studying for this madman Biology Lab exam I have the week after spring break.

Any kind of general advice that you guys have is greatly appreciated.

19ylzz,1,2013-03-09,What internships can I actually do as a second year CE student?,Dartht33bagger,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/19ylzz/what_internships_can_i_actually_do_as_a_second/,"Hey /r/ECE, I've got a question for you guys.  I'm a computer engineering major that is nearing the end of my second year of college.  Up until a few days ago, I had planned to sign up for a program called MECOP, which would have placed me in two six-month internships within my next year years.  Being in the program would have extended my degree to five years, but that was fine.  However, after talking to my adviser, this isn't an option for me anymore.  For some reason, the computer engineering students in the program need to take a 300 level class during spring term of their sophomore year to be able to participate in the program.  This is because the class (ECE 351) is only offered during spring term, and both internships are during spring term of junior and senior year.  Taking this class would push my credit count up to 18 for spring term,  and I don't think I could pull it off with good grades.  This, along with other conflicts with scholarships that I have and classes that are only offered this term that I need to move on, make it so that MECOP isn't an option for me anymore.

So my adviser said that I could find internships on my own, and that MECOP wasn't for everyone.  The only problem is, I have no idea what I'm looking for as far as internships go.  I was just looking at internships on the Intel website (I live in Oregon and want to work there someday), and I have no idea what I could even apply for.  Nothing that I've learned in my first two years of classes seems applicable to these internships.  

So what is something that I could actually do this summer as far as an internship goes?  Or do I need to go through my junior level classes first and try again next summer?  I really would like to get into an internship this summer so I can get some experience and also avoid having to work at Fedex Ground again."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[$30 million doesn't even buy a rocket to get to the moon (even Falcon 9 is $50m\). Obviously entrants will have to have other funding or income to compete. Why was $30 million chosen? Was a larger number considered, but rejected due to funding constraints? Or was it to encourage outside business models?  Thank you very much in advance! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rixwq?context=5)|One of the main goals of the Google Lunar X PRIZE is to establish a sustainable lunar economy. Putting the prize purse too high can lead to unsustainable designs. The $20 million grand prize we felt was a good number to spark interest in creating a new industry and to promote a sustainable business. When this is all done, I think you will be surprised and how little the overall mission costs are for the Google Lunar X PRIZE compared to traditional lunar missions. 
[ off, I think this is a very cool competition. Are there any updates about protecting the historically significant sites up there while letting people see them again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rio1o?context=5)|Ah, good question. The GLXP competition has engaged with NASA and our teams about the Apollo and Lunar Heritage sites on the moon. We are taking the proper steps to ensure that these sites are protected and maintained for scientific analysis. Although some of our prizes focus around documenting these sites, guidelines (such as distance requirements) have been set to ensure their conservation.
[It would be cool if there were Moon rovers that we could follow on Live tv. It seems odd that we have a Mars rover we can tune into but not a Moon rover. Live HD Moon Stream, I'd watch it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rwss8?context=5)|That was one of our original visions.
[Just heard about Lunar X Price for the first time. As it is already 2013 and time is running short can we expect a race or exciting news in the coming months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8riz0u?context=5)|The next few months will be very exciting indeed. At the end of March we will be hosting our yearly international team summit, where all the teams fly in and discuss that status of the GLXP and meet and greet with each other. Big news is generally revealed at these conferences as well as mergers announced. The deadlines to get serious about launches are rapidly approaching and teams will need to buckle down more than ever now so it would be safe to say it will be an interesting year.
[Also what about China, do you think it is possible to beat them with a rover to the moon, or will they launch first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8riz0u?context=5)|Of the teams competing in the GLXP, the earliest launch date has been slated for 2014 so China is scheduled to beat our teams this year, but they are still a government agency, as opposed to our private teams.
[How many teams are seriously pursuing the prize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rj52s?context=5)|Originally there were 33 teams, but after mergers, acquisitions and withdrawals, there are currently 23 active teams.
[Might I ask the purpose behind Google sponsoring this expedition? Is it simply to help spur the advancement of science? Does you guys expect any return from it? Either way I think it's fantastically cool and I can't wait to see how it goes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rjrr9?context=5)|We think space is great (everyone at GLXP, including our CEO Peter Diamandis and president Robert Weiss are humungous space fans) but it really requires a strong kick to get it rolling. It' s expensive and difficult and unless there is someone with a lot of money and desire, like our heroes at SpaceX, there is not much incentive for smaller groups to attempt this task. The GLXP offers that platform. It's a chance for businesses to arise under a very public contest which can attract investors and offer the potential for an entire industry to spawn at a much more accelerated rate. Maybe one team doesnt have the resources to complete a rover, but they built an amazing lander. They now have many other companies and teams across the globe who are aware of this and, through commerce and partnerships, an new economy and market is born with the mission of commercializing space.

Assuming it somehow it DID happen, someone won't be getting any cookies and and ice cream, that's for sure.
[People love space and rockets, but have really short attention spans.  Is it difficult for you to get (and keep\) eyes on what you are doing and the teams that are involved?  Also, what is the coolest video of something (blowing up?\) one of the teams has done so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rk57y?context=5)|Yeah, keeping people is difficult because no one is launching yet. The real hardcore audience is tech enthusiasts who find all the technical and hardware related updates interesting. Once the teams start launching I think things will get very publicly enticing. It's also tough when you have such amazing things happening around you like a Mars Landing and commercial birthing with the ISS but those same events bring attention to space overall.

[Hello, I'm currently a mechanical engineering senior hoping to end up in the aerospace industry very soon so I've got a close eye on the aerospace world.  Do you think there any challenges today's people are facing that didn't exist back in the 60s? If so, what are they?  Technology doesn't seem to be the primary limiting factor keeping people from space exploration these days so what do you think it is? Political will? Money? Lack of public interest?  What do you think it would take to get the public excited about space again like they were in the 60s? Are you hoping to accomplish this with your prize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rlqv6?context=5)|Technology is advanced, thats true, but making that technology affordable if definitely one set back. Another along those same lines would be making a case for the development of that technology. Why would I, as an investor spend a small fortune on developing tech to go to the moon unless I either have an intense desire for science, or, I plan on making a profit off of it? it's not an easy answer either but answers do exist and are being promoted solidly in the aerospace world with small steps at a time. The public interest fits in when there is actually stuff happening. Space works on very LONG timelines and its not everyones cup of tea to watch avionics boards being tested. When teams start launching I believe it will make a splash but until then, the challenge is coming up with compelling stories that people, not already involved with these technical fields, can relate too. They do exist though and our teams have amazing stories but struggle in broadcasting them because... well... they are doing rocket science. Hard to do both and maintain a job, but we work very hard to put as much news out there as we can.
[See, why couldn't someone like Discovery turn this competition into a reality show of sorts? It would be an interesting competition and could increase public awareness as it goes. I know reality tv isn't everyone's cup of tea, but dammit if they can make bike building competitions interesting for the mass public, why not space travel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rt6be?context=5)|Who says they aren't? ;)
[This might sound like a stupid question, but Why?

There are a number of reasons why people think we should go. Financially there are cases to be made in mining the moon. If we can standardize this then we can move on to mining asteroids more easily and that would yield major profit. There is also the case of exploration. You don't know what can come of it until you attempt it. New tech emerges simply from the fact that people are building new tech to try their hand and something that has never been done. Streamlining current technology and new forms of communication are only the surface. So many unknown inventions and discoveries are born from these sorts of expeditions and the development rapidly increases the rate at which we discover and vice versa. Industry is another popular model that coincides with money making. Yes, individuals will become wealthy but many people will have to be employed to complete these tasks and I believe the moon is the perfect ""next step"" for this kind of expansion of industry.
[If teams are not ready to launch is there any possibility to extend the competition beyond 2015?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rjkiw?context=5)|No. The prize will end at midnight, Dec. 31st. 2015.

 |•	“We believe that this kind of contest, and setting an ambitious goal like going to the Moon, is a really good way to improve the state of humanity in the world—and that‘s why we care about this. It’s also going to be a great competition and a lot of fun.  … Science has a serious marketing problem. I think this is the best antidote I’ve seen for that:  this event and this PRIZE. … I hope that a small, very ambitious team of people will allow us all virtually to go back to the Moon very soon.  I could not be more excited about that.”  Larry Page.
 |•	“We’re proud to sponsor the Google Lunar X PRIZE. … Google is sponsoring this PRIZE because it is really different than any other kind of corporate sponsorship that I’ve seen. It’s really going to accomplish something very, very impressive. …  We hope to have helped make private space flight more viable. Efforts like this will stimulate a passion for space-related research and education in a new generation of potential innovators.” Sergey Brin.
 |•	“One of the things that really exited me about this project is how it can help with education. I mean, space really fascinates college students, and I think this will inspire a lot of interest in space, in the physics that surrounds it, the math, and the history of the space programs.  I think all the interest and attention on this prize is going to be very beneficial to the education of our children. We’re hopeful that our sponsorship of the Lunar X PRIZE will help spark a new generation’s interest in the fields of math, science, and computer science, which should ultimately prove quite beneficial to both the international workforce in general and Google in particular. ” Sergey Brin.

[Where do you see space travel in the next ten to twenty years?

It won't be people at first but rather robots. Imagine, we take a 3d printer up to the moon, beam up designs, and through the use of robots, we start building a base of some sort. I think that in the next 10 to 20 years this is completely feasible but to say we would be commuting would be too much of a commitment. I do think that man will be in space more often to repair and build those bases or devices but it will be in small amounts and on specific missions. I do however believe that with the advent of companies like Virgin Galactic, people will be flying to low earth orbit much more frequently, both for science and recreation.

Don't do something because you think it is the only way to get in. The Space sector needs so many different skills that whatever you pick you can probably find a way to use it in the Industry. On the Google Lunar X PRIZE team we not only have technical experts, but also experts in media, education, marketing, and other areas.

There are currently no passport stamps for the moon. If you mean how do you get permits to launch, then you do that by contracting a launch provider, like Spacex. This contest does not require you to launch yourself. That would make it impractical and extremely unlikely.
[What is your definition of landing a robot?

[What do you think the next (or first, I suppose, depending on how you look at it\) major activity of the private-sector space industry will be?

I say this because companies like Virgin Galactic and X-COR Aerospace are already finalizing their fleets and tickets are being sold on backorder. With that said, I think that asteroid mining is still relatively close, in terms of space timelines, as a viable business model but it is still in its infancy. The ideas are there but the practice isn't. The funding is still something that needs to be worked on a bit but I believe as technology increases, and commercial agencies succeed more and more that the likelihood of these businesses launching (no pun... hell, pun intended) in our lifetime is a very real thing.

So I kind of screwed up this whole ""getting an internship"" thing.  I am currently a sophomore electrical engineering student and I have been looking for a summer internship for a while now.  My problem has been that I have wanted to live at home this summer since I am always away at school and don't see my family too often, so this has limited me to companies that are in driving distance of my house.

Well, that didn't work well as I still haven't landed an internship so I have become more liberal in applying for jobs that are further away.  I recently applied to one last company that is close by and I actually really think I would be a great fit for this job.  Based on the job description that they gave, I think I would love the work that I would be doing.  I also think I am uniquely qualified in some ways, but I also have some shortcoming in other ways (ie. I do not have as much knowledge as they would like, but I am motivated to do whatever it takes to learn the material.)

Ok, I'm kind of ranting but back to the title question.  This company is very small; in fact, they are a startup with less than 5 employees.  I applied to them about a week and a half ago with my resume and a cover letter that I wrote according to standard format, but I tried to express how passionate about the position I was.  So basically my question is, is there a way I can further show them that I am the right person for the position?  I have not heard back from them since I applied, but I was thinking I could maybe write to them again to further express my interest?  I don't know if this is a good idea or a bad idea.  They are a startup so they obviously want an intern that will be able to contribute immediately (even more so than big companies that can kind of train their interns) and I want to show them how motivated I am to be able to contribute to the company. 

Thanks for any help!"

1a3h0m,1,2013-03-11,What school to transfer to? Canadian Student with internship experience this summer.,LiNZero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1a3h0m/what_school_to_transfer_to_canadian_student_with/,"I am a Canadian student that attends a satellite campus of University of Toronto. I am quite unhappy with attending school at my current campus because of multiple reasons such as poor student life at the school(no eatery is open past 9 on campus -_-) a faculty that is rarely present in school(they only come to teach and then they run back to the main campus). I plan on transferring campuses after my year long internship.

Currently I am considering the following schools:

* University of Western Ontario
* University of Toronto
* University of Waterloo
* University of British Columbia

One of the biggest reasons I want to transfer is so I can experience living away from home during my university years(party moderately!) because I've been commuter. I know that Western is one of the bigger party schools in Ontario but I am unsure of their Computer Science faculty. Wondering if anyone has any say with regard to Western?

I know that work experience will be important so many will recommend Waterloo. However, I am a 2nd year student so I am unlikely to get into Waterloo's co-op program. I will be working for over a year at a major international company as a software developer starting in May. I am sure that this experience will give me the experience to be successful in the job search upon graduation. I will also be looking for another internship of course between 3rd and 4th year.

I guess my main concern is that, suppose I choose to go to University of Western Ontario, will I have still be as successful as a CS graduate from Waterloo, Toronto, or UBC? Will I still have a good shot going into graduate school? Waterloo and Toronto are the best of the best in CS in Canada, I know recommendations from these faculties will be regarded better in comparison to Western. Will Western sink my battleship?

**TLDR: Transfer to University of Western Ontario, Waterloo, Toronto, UBC? Which one? I will have over a year of internship experience before transfer.**

Thanks for reading and any comments/recommendations/advice!"

Basically, I was in charge of the yearly refresh project. We deployed about 50 desktops and ran into only a few issues. About a week after the last deployment, I get a call from one of the faculty members,    


*""Hello, this is p0rt at the helpdesk, what can I do for you today?""*  
**""Hey, I don't know what you guys did, but my computer doesn't recognize who I am anymore.""**    
*""Is there a particular program or website that isn't loading?""*  
**""Look, just come over here and teach this thing that it's me sitting at it.""**

I walk across campus to this user's office and they are extremely frustrated with me. I can't even get a word in.    
**You guys need to figure your stuff out and get us working machines**  
I finally get her to replicate the problem and she goes to *schoolname*.gmail.com and it prompts a credential screen. Then it finally hits me, *I should have known from the beginning what was going on.*

*""Do you know your password?""*  

**""No, and I've never had to either. My old computer always knew it was me sitting here and just logged in for me. This one doesn't know it's me. Fix it.""**  

I try to explain that is not how things work. But she was DEAD SET that it was. The facebook login page coupled with her ebay login page only reinforced her strange thinking. 

**""See, these sites don't work either. It just doesn't know it's me. That's the problem.""**

I finally reason with her to try and remember her password and she types something in for her email and it throws the wrong password exception. Then she throws out this little gem after she initially insisted she didn't remember her password.  

**""I know that is my password, that's not the problem. It thinks i'm someone else and isn't letting me in. Why in the world would someone put this kind of security on a school email.""**    

I told her that I will go and talk to our IT staff and get back to her later in the day. I ended up resetting her email password and had my supervisor deal with her. Anti-climactic ending, I know.
  
TL;DR: User thought cached credentials were actually computers that were sentient and could distinguish who sat in front of them.

I just feel like I can write this here if anywhere at all. The actual needing of advice is at the bottom. Also, now that I read it back - sorry for the shitty poorly structured writing.
-------------------------------------------------------

I am tired of feeling like I am always doing the wrong thing. I am always in the wrong place at the wrong time wanting the wrong stuff. It is always my fault, and I can't exactly argue against that. I have never intended on doing any wrong, but I always find myself not doing what other people want, and feeling terribly guilty about it. It could be that I have a naturally guilty conscious, or it could be that my entire life I've been shot down for doing everything that isn't what people have expected of me. I spend hours and days working on things I love (Software. There are probably a lot of other software guys here, too), learning endlessly, only to find out that none of it really matters to anyone but me. I caught on relatively quickly when people started insinuating that my poor grades and lack of dedication to academics are exactly what's wrong with me. I can't really blame them, either. It's how things are nowadays. The worst part about it hasn't been the work itself. School has always been easy for me, and I've always known how to fix it. I just never did. I hate(d) everything about school and just don't want to ""fix"" that.



I never really took anyone's advice. I kept not doing things, and doing other things. I came to accept titles. Lazy, potentially retarded, disconnected from the world, a failure.

I'm in college now. A local community college. It's not terrible, really. A lot of people from other, actually pretty nice colleges have been dropping out and going here instead. I still don't feel it, though. I can see how other people would be excited, but I just feel like it's not for me. I still go to class every day and try to endure it.

I absolutely feel like it's not for me at all. 

On the bright side



Senior year I started a company, which in my mind is going ok. Not much results, but I see what it could be.

In the early Winter a Rutgers U senior and a friend gave me 4% of their company to write a backend for them. That's getting somewhere... slowly.

I recently got an internship in a company that happens to be run by one of my ""childhood"" (more of late-teenhood) idols, which I personally consider fucking amazing. On top of doing what I love for someone I look up to, the pay is pretty damned awesome.

 For some reason I am still horribly out of place. Not at the company or anything. I just feel like all of the other things in my life are drawing away from the good. I can barely 
 
 
Every bone in my body wants to drop out, and be what I can be. I *know* I can continue to get footing in the industry and I have faith in myself to run an extremely succesful company; But something is holding me back. I have no idea what to do, and desparately need advice. I am finding it more and more difficult every day to get my school work done, because I am stuck between the massive pull of potential success, and peoples' expectations. I know I will inevitably let people down when it comes to school, but I just can't come to embrace it. Someone help?"

1a25i8,2,2013-03-10,"I am a recent graduate, and have gotten several part time and two full time jobs by applying online. Here is my experience.",IGetJobs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1a25i8/i_am_a_recent_graduate_and_have_gotten_several/,"**1. Best Buy**

The trick with them (and a lot of positions) is passing the personality test. Realize that the personality test is way out of touch with reality and there is no need to second guess yourself. Answer the ""obvious"" correct one and try to not answer many questions ""in the middle."" For example:

Question: Do you like being in a crowd?

(a) Yes

(b) Sometimes

(c) No

The answer (unfortunately) is yes. You want to show yourself as being extroverted, etc. etc. It doesn't matter if the position is client facing or not, you need to be able to ""work in a team"" and somehow these personality tests reveal that /s. 

In addition, the ""sometimes"" answers are bad. At Best Buy at least (and probably other places as well), your whole application actually gets locked out if you do not score high enough. Your experience could be killer and you could have been a manager at Circuit City for 5 years, but if you don't pass that personality test, you're out. 

[http://www.ehow.com/how_4446746_pass-preemployment-personality-test.html](Here is an article on passing these tests.)

**2. Internship 1, 2, &amp; 3**

I applied (and got) three internships through my school job board. **I am not a technical major**, however the two paid ones were technical based (database management and technical writing). Two of them were paid, one of them was not but I got awesome experience (better than the two paid ones) and class credit. I thoroughly believe that school job boards are the way to go for internships as the employer has already got your school in mind when looking at applications.

In addition, one of the internships offered me a full time position upon graduation but I already had one lined up, read below.

**3. First Full Time Position**

I actually started out this position as part time while in college. I also doubled up, and took one of the other internships above while working at this place. It was my last semester and I only had classes two days a week, so it was easy to work 15 hrs/week at each place.

Anyways, this position was a posting on Craigslist regarding a product I LOVED (technical based) and it paid better than any other part time positions I'd had thus far. I applied, boosting my resume with a ""portfolio"" of projects I had done with the product throughout the years. I got the job during the summer, and went full time after graduating in December until...

**4. Second Full Time Position**

I just sent in the signed offer letter for my first ""career"" position. My previous role was at a company I loved with people I really liked working with, but in a field that I am not passionate about. The company was growing, but slowly. They have been very supportive about my progress and are still supportive in the wake of me leaving.

The company I just signed on with will be giving me training in advanced programs and in a field that I am very excited about being in.

This company had me do an online test. It was *hard*. Lots of pattern recognition, math problems (I have a funny form of number dyslexia so this was scary as mess for me since it was timed, as much as I otherwise like math), and a personality test at the end. I passed it, got two phone interviews and an in person interview... then had to take the test again. *shudder* My new manager told me that about 8% of the people pass the test. Whether this is due to laziness or not, I do not know.

What was interesting about this position however is that I really wasn't qualified for it. It is for making eLearning courses and I have had minimal experience in many of the programs they use, but they asked me for examples of any graphic work I did have and I sent it all in. In addition, I downloaded a trial version of Captivate and make a quick eLearning course in it to give to them as well. I've put a lot of effort into getting this position, and I'm happy that it panned out. 

That being said, all of the other positions I applied for that I was actually somewhat qualified for never contacted me. *shrug*

**So there it is**...

Some background on me:

* White, female
* ~3.3 GPA
* Humanities degree at a state college
* Technically oriented (but again, a degree that doesn't show it)
* Founded a club (unrelated to my major or career), president of ambassador program freshman year at a community college
* Studied abroad (related to my major, unrelated to career)
* Active LinkedIn profile (not sure if this ever helped)
* Held a total of 9 paid part-time jobs/internships while in college and one 1 unpaid internship, often two at a time
* Total jobs gotten by networking: 3 (part time), total jobs gotten online: 6 (+ unpaid internship)
* I deal with anxiety and depression issues, and some atypical migraines. I'm outgoing in the sense that I have no trouble with public speaking or approaching people, but I'm mostly antisocial and don't go out very much.

I apologize for the wall of text, and I am in NO way suggesting to drop the networking route. This has worked for me so far, and I am a huge advocate for job networking. If I can be more specific about anything or if you have any questions, please let me know."

Now, I've been building and fixing computers for years, love to keep up on technology, and my dream job is in consumer electronics/product design, so Apple would be awesome. 

The problem is, I have already accepted a solid job offer in Dallas, which I think I would enjoy too, but it's not quite the industry I am really passionate about. I hate to turn down a solid job offer when I don't even have another one yet (and may not find out for a month or two), but if I were to get a job with Apple, my SO and I would love to move there. SF is closer to her family, has nicer weather, has better outdoor activities, etc. (while also being stupidly expensive)

My SO has a verbal offer in the south Bay, which she would enjoy, but probably not quite as much as if she were teaching (she is finishing her PhD). We plan to have kids in about 2 years, at which point she will either work part time or not at all to raise the kids, so we aren't as worried about her career prospects. I also feel terrible about backing out of an offer but will do it if it's best for us.

**tldr**
I really want to work at Apple but haven't even had an interview yet, while I have already accepted an offer in Dallas. How can I address this situation?"

I'm going to study my ass off and do as well as I can but I need to come to terms with the possibility of a C.
 
A little more backstory: I go to the University of Texas, where the CS program is pretty competitive. I dedicate most of my time to my own projects rather than schoolwork (developing a pretty big android app right now and worked an internship at a local company last summer, with another summer gig set up for this one), right now I have a B+ average in my CS classes."

1a5ttu,10,2013-03-12,.Net Developer with 4 yr experience. Looking for technical jobs. Scared of interview questions.

I decided that I already had the job, so I could finish school at my own pace...bad decision on my part. I got promoted twice in this job and am currently as ""senior"" guy in the team who mentors new hires, acts as Problem management lead, basically gets the job done (hands-on/practical experience).

Anyways, now I've been at this company for over 4 years and its time for me to move on. I like my job but the problem is that I'm not learning anything new, its the same corporate bullshit everyday (cookie cutter approach for all applications). 

I have applied to a few job openings at Amazon and some other places as a Software Engineer (or Developer) as I'm hoping to get back in the game (technically) but I feel so out of place when it comes to all the questions that these companies are asking these days. I have the practical experience but I've been out of touch with basic algorithms, I feel so scared (I really do). I have no idea on how to create a maze algorithm (just an example)...I know I've been out of touch with the basic fundamentals, so I'm applying for entry level positions and not intermediate (I'm willing to start from scratch). 

I'm planning to go through all my old OOP books, review basic data structures/sorts etc...but its still so damn scary. Has anyone else been in my shoes? Any tips? Is this normal? I've been using only C# in the past few years, what language do you guys recommend that's considered acceptable during interviews...C++, Java?
I don't mind starting from scratch, I just need a way to get inside a real ""tech"" company, not sure where I stand."
1a5p50,1,2013-03-12,My dilemma: go to medical school or run a company...[x-post from r/offmychest],throwaway_dilemma,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1a5p50/my_dilemma_go_to_medical_school_or_run_a/,"I have a dilemma that I am facing and I am confused on what I want to do; should I go to medical school or should I run a company that has potential to make a lot of money. 

I am a married 26 year old male with no kids at the moment.

I have been going to school for quite some time to finish my bachelors degree (in which I will be done this Fall 2013) and right now I am at the point of going to take my MCATs so that I can apply for medical school this coming June 2013. There is a high probability that I will be able to get into medical school here in the states and I'm not ""too"" worried about being rejected. 

Here is where the ""issue"" comes in, I have been offered to work with my brother and to help run his electrical company. We do both commercial and residential buildings with occasional renovation work for quick cash and as of right now we have a total bid amount of $16 million with more contracts in the works. 

My brother is well aware of my work ethics and he wants someone who is like-minded like him so that he can amplify the business and make more money. The idea is that the more money that can be brought in, the more money we both can make rather than him handling everything himself. Basically he's the CEO, CFO, and COO and he needs help to distribute the load and reduce the bottleneck effect as he's having a hard time being in two places at once. And this is where I come in.

He is also aware that I am trying to go to medical school and he's trying to essentially ""buy me out"" of medical school and work with him to run the company and make a lot of money.

I am torn on what I want to do, I've invested a lot of time and energy to pursue a career in medicine and I truly do enjoy it because everything in biology makes sense. I also enjoy what I am learning out in the construction field and one misconception that I would like to correct is that it's not just a bunch of guys swinging hammers. To be able to run a job site, you have to know how to handle the people who work for you and to be able to get what you want out of them so that it's a win-win situation. And in order to do that, you have to be able to think on your feet and understand the limitations of people on what they can and cannot do. There are a lot of mind games that you have to play to achieve your ending goal and I enjoy being able to do that.

I also have 4 years experience in working in a genetic research facility for a muscle wasting disease and the level of work that I was doing (without having an degree of any kind) was that of a Ph.D. It was basically an internship that lead to an employment opportunity later on. I was working on a Ph.D. level without being paid as one and that was fine for me because the experience that I've gotten could not have been gotten anywhere else, especially for an undergraduate student. On a side note, I am also a published author in various medical journals and one of those publications, I am a ""second author"" (this is a very big deal in the medical field). And because of this this experience that I've gotten, I am not worried about being able to get into medical school.

Basically to answer a question that may potentially come up, I enjoy both medical field and the construction field. They both offer me mental stimulation and perspective on people and how to troubleshoot when things don't work out the way you plan (construction field and laboratory work).

I will be able to make money both ways, but I don't know which one I should take, there are both pros and cons to each and I need help from people who are not biased towards me and to offer me insight or personal experience. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I will do the best I can to answer questions that you may ask or to expand on details where appropriate.

1a4ffh,3,2013-03-11,Is an internship at a global tech company significantly better than a small business one that would teach me more?,rideswithbikes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1a4ffh/is_an_internship_at_a_global_tech_company/,"So I have 2 offers for a programming internship this summer. (I'm attending a university). One is a technology company with offices worldwide, lets call it A, while the other, B, is a small car dealer business where I currently work. I am the only programmer at company B, and we built our own custom CRM and now it's expanding into all facets of the business. It will eventually track everything done in the company (and it's moving fast) to greatly increase business intelligence.

I did an internship at company A last summer and I learned a lot about working in small teams to complete projects, as well as some of a few programming languages.

However, while working at company B during the past 4 months, I've gained a lot more hands-on experience in a lot of different areas of programming than I did while at company A. If I stayed at company A for the summer, I would be rebuilding the CRM on a framework and gain a lot of experience with that (it's grown far larger than first anticipated and it's getting messy)

Also, at company B, I'll be making at least $3 more per hour (working full-time at both companies)

1a4fdz,2,2013-03-11,I am a failure.......,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1a4fdz/i_am_a_failure/,"I do not know where to start, but i'll try....

I never wanted much from life.  I never wanted all the money or power in the world.  I wanted the dream of a career, wife, kids and house white picket fence.   The only thing I got was a loving wife.....

I took alot of bad advice from high school faculty and college career faculty.  In high school, I was told just to pass, while working full-time at a grocery store.  That was enough.  Things will be good.

I joined the Army in 1994 after high school.  I tried my darnedest to do well in the Army, but I wanted to move on, go to college and pursue my dream.  I got out in 1998 after my four years were up.   I then worked and started going to school while I worked.  I got my two year degree in 2002, and despite the little slump, things were on the up-and-up.

I continued to work my ass off while taken part-time course and sometimes full-time courses.  I did not work for one year and that was to take more than a full load.  The career counselor at my alma matar openly expressed that he did not like me.  I never knew why.  He always acted like I killed his dog or something.  He actually refused to help me find an internship, saying that my previous experiences were good enough.  I finally graduated college with business and marketing degree with no internship.

This was December 2007.  Yea, you can see where this is going now.

I took a job three months after that out-of-state.  I tried to help engineers find jobs in their fields.  The company I worked for all-but-folded when Lehman collapsed.  They went from 70 employees to five.  I lost my career, at no fault of my own.  I had to move with my girlfriend from college but I lost it all.  Thus, I had to take a $7.25 job at a fast food restaurant because I had bills to pay.  Then two years later, I got a job with a software company as tech support and hat is what started me going in the accounting field.  People were screaming for accountants two years ago, but not now.  I miss all the good parties.

I have only one class until I qualify to take the CPA exams, but I cannot get a job to save my life.  I would even take a job at a firm making $7.25 just to start my career in accounting, and still no one wants me.  If the job required me to work 70 hours a week, I would still take it in a heartbeat and love every moment of it.  I have been told though that the reason why I am unemployable is because i will leave when the next best thing comes along.

I got my second revocation of a job offer today.  I am so angry and depressed right now I don't know if I will make it.  I am 37 years old, two, close to three degrees, great work history, never done drugs in my life, no criminal record and no career.

I DID EVERYTHING I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, AND I STILL LOSE!!!!

WHAT DID I DO SO WRONG?  HAVE I BEEN TRANSPORTED TO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS BACKWARDS?!?!?!  THIS CANNOT BE RIGHT!!  

Was I a serial killer in a past life?

I DIDN'T WANT A HANDOUT.  I WANT TO WORK!!!  I WANT A REWARDING CAREER AND I CANNOT CATCH ONE FUCKING BREAK!  YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I AM UPSET ALL THE TIME?   BECAUSE NOT ONE PROFESSIONAL GAVE ME A FUCKING CHANCE!!!

I am tired.  I have been rejected so many times, that I am slipping away.

Someone.  Please.

My parents don't know about my grades, and think I'm doing well.  They are somehow brainwashed into thinking that becoming a doctor is the only way to be successful in life.  I'd rather become a computer science or business economics major, but it is too late to change.

My brother is successful.  He has a high GPA and scored 170+ on his LSAT.  He already has multiple job offers as a paid intern in several law firms.

I'm just a failure, who screws up everything.  My parents invested tens of thousands of dollars to put me into this university for me to become a doctor.  I'm on the verge of failing, and knowing my parents, I'll probably be disowned.  If I continue, I have no hope of getting into medical school and will just cost them more tens of thousands of dollars.

I've been having suicide thoughts almost every day.  It has seeped into my dreams (the ones I remember).  My dreams usually have me jumping off a tall building.  The last one, I actually hit the ground and faded away into nothingness.  

The dream of me dying actually made me not want to commit suicide.  As I lay there fading away, I panicked and realized I didn't actually want to die.

But I don't feel like doing anything nowadays.  I sleep in my dorm a lot, and I don't go out to see my friends anymore.  I try to study, I really do, but I can't seem to focus at all.  My doing nothing makes me feel guilty that my parents are spending so much money.

I enjoy learning though.  If I could redo my life, I would study in depth about psychology and computer science.  Maybe take engineering courses.  I feel like it is too late.  I can't do anything to change my screwed up college career.  I wish I could just quit everything.  "

I've never had an internship the previous summers and I was ok with that so I could catch up on some classes but this summer I was really hoping to land one. It could be because my GPA is a little low from the first 2 years but that is why I took on interesting projects, building a massive power system and a BMED/EE senior project, to set myself apart a little bit. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable on what I know so far and am very interested in DSP and even taking several graduate courses next semester as well. I've also had many interviews, for internships and full time positions and all of them go the same way. So I just am not sure what's going on/what to do.

Previous work experience consists of summer internships with the NYC Department of Transportation and a historical house in Flushing called the Voelker Orth Museum. My current job is part-time work at a CVS Pharmacy as a pharmacy tech. 

In addition to what work experience I have I have a variety of skills to offer. I am able to communicate in Mandarin Chinese. I am fairly knowledgeable about computers. I am friendly and able to manage interpersonal conflicts. I am also well versed in the art of customer service. I also used to be pretty good at starcraft and a handful of other games, so there's that.

I'm currently looking to expand my work experience to find something I truly enjoy and find interesting. I am willing to take nearly any position with any relation to operations. I am also searching for work that could give me experience in Human Resource or management and trainee positions in either case. I am very willing to learn new skills and can adapt quickly.

For my resume, more information about myself or just for a chat, just PM me and I'd be delighted to send you an e-mail or just have a good old fashion reddit PM chat.

1aarrm,6,2013-03-14,REU VS Internship ,dragbreligion,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1aarrm/reu_vs_internship/,"Hey all,

I'm a second year math and physics major.

Going into college my dream job was to end up as a professor doing research in math. Recently I've come to the conclusion that I may not actually be heading in that direction. Its not that I don't love math, but I'm not sure if I'm bright or talented enough to pursue it on that level. So I'm really not sure what I want to do once I graduate(Job vs Grad School)

Anyways I've recently been offered an internship position, the position is being an analyst for a government contractor. The work itself seems interesting, but I have some slight moral quarrels with it.(government contractors targeting ""bad guys"", I'm all for national security but...)

I've also applied to a bunch of REU's. So far I have been rejected from all. So I've let them know I only have a week to decide what I'm to do this summer. 

My ""Stats""  are:
3.71 GPA
3.9 in major
Not too much in the way of prior research experience, I just started working in a lab this semester. 
Some Programming and lots of LaTex experience.
For what its worth I thought I wrote good essays.
I'd imagine good recommendations. 

I know I'm not headed for ""ivy"" school, but I thought that I would get into to some less known schools- so far this is not the case. 

So my question is how much more beneficial would an REU be to an internship? My feeling tells be an REU would be way better because I'd image grad schools don't care about internships and If I decide to get a job and REU would still look pretty good on my CV. 


My lack of success with these REUs is really making me question my potential as an academic, is this a reasonable reaction or is this not an accurate indicator of research potential ?

Thanks and Sorry for the long windedness of this post.

Long story short, I have a BS in Bio, and recently completed an AS in computer science. I am no longer looking for a bio (R&amp;D/pharma) position.  I was offered a position as a software engineering consultant, but because I had no client matchups after 2 months, I am now SOL. AKA, I have no job (and never started job as a consultant).

When you look at my resume, it's kind of all over the place. I've done a bit of computer networking/network admin as an 'intern' and some system level testing (system test engineer).  While at my previous positions, I've ended up coding on a script level: creating VB macros for Excel, using Javascript to do a web request system (back in the day).... I'd like to be harnessing my desire to actually create programs that will help people get their job done, since that seems to be what I've naturally been inclined to do at previous positions.

Sadly, I run into the issue of: Not enough programming experience.  Needs don't match the customer.

Soft skills I've got down, since I've been working for 10+ years. Multiple awards for customer satisfaction/delivery of results and all that fun stuff.

Programmatically, my Java is college-level (incl data algorithms and structures). I just recently learned Ruby on Rails thru codecademy. I've dabbled in iOS (3.2)... So as you can see, I've got a lot of experience at super entry-level programming in a lot of different languages.

So here are my problems:
1- Do I get a entry level position in any programming field? 
2- How do I leverage my work experience as a professional?
  2a - How do I find a position that is more than just entry-level AND uses my experience?
3- How do I re-tailor my CS resume to make it more focused, instead of ""lots of experience but kinda not going forward"" ?

Thanks for any advice, in advance!"

I am a new hire, after an internship, and I got assigned one of these once-a-week locations from one of our more senior techs, who had more on his plate than it was reasonable for anyone to handle.  He also did NOT like the location, and I didn't have any bad experiences there, so it was an easy transition.

So on Monday (three days ago), we find out that because of a different project I am working on, he'll be covering that location this week.  I mention one of the tickets to him about a user's computer not working, and he tells me that he has had problems with this user being unpleasant in the past.  I hadn't had any bad experiences with the user, as I told the tech, and all was well.

Come today......

I look through the tickets that the tech had closed yesterday, and come across aforementioned user's ticket.  The problem?  And I quote: ""[User] reported having trouble with laptop on Friday and needed it over the weekend. He took the laptop to an computer repair shop that reimaged it removing all [company] software and disjoining it from the domain. Laptop needed to be reimaged.""

Needless to say, I was flabbergasted.  Apparently, our free company tech support isn't worth waiting the weekend for.  Even if he needed to use it, he might have been able to get a loaner laptop for the weekend.  I can see why the tech did not like this particular user....

TL;DR: User brings company computer to third party repair shop, who reimages it, then complains it isn't working."

This is my (M/28) first post ever on reddit. Have been lurking for a month or so. I'll use a throwable account, because telling about involuntary loss of job is awkward.

So I am this legal clerk working in a local government. It's by far not the most satisfying job I've ever had. Actually I took the job, because I was looking for a career change and I figured, that if I take a job beneath me, then I will have time to pursue my degree in computer science. 

Well, I had no idea, how much beneath my current job would be. I was used to working hard to present strong legal argumentation and then fight for our position to prevail. However, at my current employer, we try to figure out, how to avoid getting in legal disputes. We don't believe in our own ability, so we try not to allow situations arise, where our ability would be measured.

We make pretty bad mistakes too. Ethical on professional. As a government organization we screw over the citizen if we believe, that s/he won't know how to enforce his/her rights. We usually won't be able to hold another party liable before us, because our people generally don't understand our legal position. 

So after many meetings I am asked to give my opinion on the issue. I look at the paperworks and say: ""Duh, it's expired, so we can't claim anything."" But there are many other simple questions which they discuss week in and week out.

At first, I was quite busy, because our organization cannot *cough* afford to pay for our training. So figure out at work place. However, Once I figured the important stuff out, I suddenly didn't have much work at all. I was so bored at work. I could do some CS stuff, but the environment doesn't allow me to concentrate and also makes me feel quilty. 

About a month ago I read about free training on taxes. Wrote to my boss, that I'd like to go. 3 days over a month. Allowed. Then I began to take classes at school to become a student tutor. For 10 weeks, I needed to leave 1 hour before end of work. Allowed. This week I had a fever. Wrote to my boss and said, that I will stay home for a couple of days to get my health back. As per our internal regulation, we are allowed to take 3 personal days with no explanation. No response to that. 

Then today I went to him with an application to get a paid studyleave. According to legislation, we get 20 days per year. Last year I used it all. This year I have used 12 days and applied for 5 more. Intend to pursue CS internship in the summer, so I don't mind using all of my days before this summer. My boss says, that we'll talk about it later. Wierd.

Anyway, a bit later I overheard him talking to his boss about letting my go by lay-off. 

I'll be in a class object-oriented programming for a few hours now. After that if there are any comments or questions, I will answer them. Or perhaps I'll have a drink and do the answering later.

Should this be in the AMA-forum? I'm a bit too shy to it over there.

My GPA is a 3.2 and I have taken classes in mathematical statistics, upper level calculus, advanced economics, and applied financial valuation. I've held an internship with my college's hospital and worked two tiers below the dean who is now the CEO of a top 20 world hospital. I have also worked 15-20 hours a week during the school year since I started my sophomore year.

I taught myself how to program a few years ago and have since built numerous models and programs that take financial data, analyze it, and output stocks that meet specific trend requirements. I've also built programs that survey major online retailers for up-to-date pricing and sales information. Finance is my life. I always know where the market is heading and I always know the latest macro events, there isn't a day that goes by that I go uninformed.

Problem: I'm competing with people from NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Yale, UCLA, Stanford, etc, etc, etc. I was able to get the interview through leveraging my network and for some reason the company decided to call me. I don't know if this is out of obligation to my contact or if they are genuinely curious in my abilities. Regardless, it has me scared shitless because I don't come from a brand name university with an immaculate GPA. Especially when the minimum requirement is a 3.5

I don't really know what I'm asking and this may just be a rantish vent, but does anyone have advice? Experiences? Anectdotes? The company is cool as shit and I don't want to get turned down because I'm ""not up to standards."" Anything is appreciated and thanks for reading."

i dont normally procrastinate, (i really don't) but when it comes to ""coding"" i do a lot.. 
yes i do understand it and all that, and once i do start  up i absolutely love it. its really fun. (doing Ruby)but then i get caught up with other stuff and i just cant get back into the ""groove"" 
its quite annoying. 

so i was just asking if you guys have any procrastination tips. 

P.S. I do have goals. My dad has a friend that is a programmer and once i get some projects uploaded i might be able to get an internship; pretty exciting. im still getting the hang of it.

I want to end it all so badly. I can buy a cheap gun and be done. I made my friend a promise that I would get help, but I regret making that promise. I've regretted it from the moment the words left my lips. I feel so alone and I want to die. I cut myself to keep myself calm. I carry scissors with me to keep myself calm. I want to die so badly.

I have to be perfect or else everyone will see me as a disappointment. I already feel like everyone hates me and making a mistake will only make things worse. I want to relax, but I don't know how.

I have had zero luck finding a job in the above entry level bracket. I just got an offer for sub-40k employment that I would typically expect a green student to get with no experience. 

I have friends that are turning to barista/clerk positions that graduated right with me. They applied to these same positions I did, but the recruiters seems to be leaning towards people that have work experience now far in excess of the position they are moving into. I have seen this with some other of us older returning students finding work.

We all expected college to boom our options and take us to the mid 50's at least. This is not the case. If you can graduate and get employed making mid 30's to low 40's with a chance to move up then you are smitten. 


BTW, I believe this is due in part to unpaid interns taking jobs away that traditionally would pay WELL. Corporations and government KNOW that they can do it and they take advantage.

I had an offer with local government here that would have been paid to the tune of 45k the year prior, but instead of offering me money they wanted a 6 month intern. 

Between shit like that and recruiters us job seekers need to stick together.

Ask me anything.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1aesn1/moved_to_a_new_country_leaving_everything_behind/,"Dropping everything for love. That is what I did. I used to have everything a young woman would dream of, awesome job, a car, a house, supportive family and amazing friends. Distance relationships don't work for me, so after 6 months of suffering, being far away from the guy I love, I decided not to break my heart anymore and move to Sweden. If only I knew what I was getting into! No, I don't say that I regret it, not at all. But it has been toughest 2 years of my life (even-though I studied at the university for so many years and worked 8 hours a day at the same time). First I was satisfied with my decision, then I started feeling isolated, no friends, no family, don't know the language, can't communicate. The only person I met was my boyfriend. Long and dark winters did not help me assimilate, bringing me depression after depression. Finding job seemed impossible in my professional area, because everyone seemed to need someone who speaks Swedish. So, I went to language courses (which are thankfully free), brought my language level to strong intermediate in almost 2 years. After so much effort to learn a new language, their excuse is that I do not have work experience in Sweden, that is why I need to go on internship, without no pay, to begin somewhere. Which is also very hard to find, since I'd like to work for a company where I could learn something new too, for this not to be complete waste of time, when I could be spamming companies with my CV.
With two bachelor diplomas, one Masters diploma, fluent knowledge of 4 languages + intermediate Swedish and about 6 years of work experience, here I am, unemployed and struggling to assimilate, to be accepted and to find a job. It is hard to find a job, even if your standards are lowered as much as possible and you have so much you reached in your life (for example, my life spent at universities).
Pressure is really big sometimes and these two last years were full of disappointments. But I do believe that I will find that job where I will be able to show what I know and that I can be a valuable member of a team.
I guess I am hopeless romantic, in love and in my dreams for the better future. 
You can ask me anything about my experiences of moving to a new country, without anything but some savings and loving support of those who wish me luck."

He said he would send me a code test to take, so I could show them some of my work.  

I received the code test and its far more advanced than anything I've ever done and I've been out of practice with Objective-C for a year now.

I switched to math with a CS minor last year from a social science major, so I've been working my butt off trying to catch up.

Right now I have already taken Computer Science I (intro Java course), one discrete math for CS course, and I'm currently in Computer Science II (Java with intro to data structures). My planned CS courses for the next two semesters include: Computer Science III (software engineering), Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Artificial Intelligence, Analysis of Algorithms and more if my schedule allows it.

My main question is what can I do this summer to add to my knowledge and employability as a programmer? I am planning on working through CLRS and learning Haskell because I want to learn a functional programming language. I really would like to work on a concrete project in Java that can be added to my resume, but I'm not sure what a good option would be. I'm not particularly interested in one thing or another. For example, I have friends who already have good ideas for apps or games they would like to build; I don't have any good ideas for anything concrete like that. **Does anyone have any suggestions on a project that would be relevant to my strong math background?** I have done lots of little card games and small assignments like that, but I really want to find a bigger project I can work on that will be challenging. If my math interests are relevant, I really like combinatorics, linear algebra and real analysis.

As for my careers goals, I would like to work at the NSA or at least get an internship there, but I don't know how plausible that is since it seems like they only want the best of the best. I have heard that having a strong math background is good for programming careers in the financial industry but I haven't really looked into that at all. 

Thank you for any advice. "

This semester I'm taking a java programming and web design course, just the beginning steps towards a degree in computer science that I will finish in approx. two years. In a previous life I worked as a molecular biologist and as an EHR training specialist for a hospital network, but I realized that cs definitely has more job opportunities than bio-research and potentially better salary after I get some work experience.

I should probably add that I'm female and I didn't want the title of my post to come across as sexist...but I'm really curious to meet other women programmers/developers/analysts and learn what it's really like from their perspective. My java class of 30 has a total of 5 women and I'm not sure they are all majors. It's been difficult to find specific examples online and I'd like to know what I'm getting into.

I'm certainly grateful for any male advice as well, so please comment.

I know from my experience in biology that companies prefer entry level employees who have gone beyond the classroom and engaged in research or internships. Is this also the case for computer science? 

I understand that I will need to create a portfolio of programming projects that I can show to potential employers. How do I determine what languages to use and what types of projects will be of most value?

Okay, that's all for now, I'm new to Reddit and this is the fourth time I've tried to post these questions...only to get stuck on the front page reading links and articles for hours until I forgot why I was here in the first place :) Thanks!

I am in the top 1% of my graduating class, and have a very solid resume of engineering-related internships and co-ops. I need help responding to potential job offers.

I have had three interviews for jobs--two for internships, and one for a full-time position. **I was offered both internships, and am waiting to hear back regarding the full-time offer (should know by the end of this week).** I have summarized these positions below:

Internship A is in another state, in an undesirable city, with unknown pay, doing projects that are of little interest to me. I will most likely decline the offer from Company A.

Internship B is with a company that is very prestigious, doing projects that would be very fun and desirable. The internship is for an unknown time (""as long as I want""), with a possibility that I will be hired full-time after 3 to 6 months. The company is very ""volatile""--they are known for hiring and letting people go.

Full-time job C is with a lesser known company that has great job stability (they haven't laid off any employees in over 10 years). The projects are related to my past work experience, but not all that interesting to me. Company C will get back to me later this week to let me know if I have been offered a job.

What should I say to Company B in the mean time? Should I ask them what the expected salary/benefits will be? Should I let them know I'm waiting for a full-time position, and that I need a few days before I make a decision? If I get an offer at Company C, should I take it? 

**tl;dr-I have an internship offer from a great (but volatile) company. I'm waiting to hear back about a potential full-time offer with another (more stable) company. How do I proceed?**

However, i applied for a few jobs at some notable companies. I passed the technical interviews and they seemed wary about hiring me still. One said they would like to see my skills by making a twitter app.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I know how to code certain problems, but I haven't coded real world applications yet. I understand this is why they are giving me the task. Is there  a way to approach this and learn API, specifically Twitter's API, and make something by Sunday?

Any advice or routes to go by?

Thanks for the help in advance. I really need an internship this summer to start my career, especially one which pays when things haven't been going so financially well for me."

",newCount4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ahzak/several_questions_seeking_advice_from_more/,"Hello /cscareerquestions, I am looking for some advice on what I should do.

A bit about me:
23 years old, work ~30 hours/ week and am full time CS student ending his junior year. I am at the same University I dropped out of several years prior, and as such my GPA is &lt;3.0. My CS GPA is 4.0 (this is post all the 'core' classes; data struc/algorithms/disc math/comp arch/OS/etc.

In short, I have been busting ass for the past 2 years and am extremely capable when it comes to the 'relatively' basic brain-teasers/algorithm/OO questions that many tech interviews for new grads/interns are comprised of. 

I have applied to all of the big companies (M$/Amazon, etc.) and was not given a single interview. I am fairly certain this is because of my &lt;3.0 cumulative GPA, and I did miss one of the deadlines (I am kicking myself, I know). The technical interviews I have had with smaller companies for internships I have destroyed, and several times I noticed the questions from projecteuler/hackerrank/etc. that I have completed earlier. The problem is all of the internship offers were for &lt;=20$/hour, and these offers are frankly not what I am looking for (It would be both barely sustainable for me and I feel that I would be starting my career on the wrong foot...frankly I feel that these internships are for people below my 'skill'/dedication level). 

I have completed several of the interviewstreet questions (for both Amazon and FB....not sure if this actually works or not however; does anyone know?)

I am simply looking for advice on what to do going forward. I have no major projects to my name; however I have completed a substantial amount of online problems (on the sites I mentioned previously).

I feel like a 65 year old man. My life is literally nothing but school/schoolwork/work (basically menial labor)/doing some CS problems on my own/sleep. It has been this way for far too long and I want to believe that my work will pay off but I am unsure of how to get where I want to be. I am confident if I were to be given an interview with one of the large companies I would stand a good chance of getting in.

My first goal is to simply get an interview from M$/Amazon/etc., my end goal is of course to land a position there.

/cscareerquestions; any advice on what should I do to get there would be GREATLY appreciated, as I feel lost for the first time since my return to school."
1ahsgn,5,2013-03-17,Atypical cover letter advice,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ahsgn/atypical_cover_letter_advice/,"I'm a graduating Computer Engineering student and my current internship employers offered to forward my resume to some people who have contacts with companies in Austin, TX, the city I'm looking to gain my first full time position in.  They also asked for a cover letter to go along with my resume but since this is not with a specific position in mind I'm not quite certain how I should approach writing it. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions regarding the possible content that should be included. Some ideas I've come up with so far are:

•	Highlight distinct traits such as working throughout college career

•	Delve into project experiences

•	Avoid being too specific and disqualifying yourself from many positions - let your projects speak for your skill set

•	Attack from the other side and describe what you like to do and what gets you excited about your field and the experiences you've had - employers may see you fit positions which you weren't aware of

Not so much the content - I've had a few internships and liked what I've been given the chance to do, but rather worrying if the area itself is on the decline, and is something that will still be in demand in the future.

I really only ask as I have the flexibility of a recent grad to switch career directions. I've got the skill set and internship experience to apply for development positions, but admittedly, I enjoy code work slightly less than working with networks. I've thought about leaning to the devops/syadmin side of things, and that doesn't seem like a bad alternative either.

I've got a job lined up after I graduate, working as a Sysadmin/Network admin comobo in an SMB. I'm just wondering if I should turn back now, or if I should forge ahead, and get the requisite experience and certifications to really get in deep into networking. "

The interview was on campus, and I was one of about 10 candidates. The interview went well I thought, especially considering that the work I did in my previous internship was very much related to this one and the interviewer and I were able to talk more as equals about a lot of the questions. 

Anyways, I was told they'd be in contact with candidates for a 2nd  interview within 1.5 to 2 weeks. Given that I had read a lot on glassdoor about this particular company's HR being excessively slow, I chalked that up to probably 3 weeks. My interview was on Feb 21, I sent a thank you that same day over email with no reply. On March 11th I sent a brief email simply asking for an update on the position and to see if they needed any additional info from me. No reply. By now i'm wondering what's up, especially since I thought the interview went well. Should I just drop it at this point? I found their office phone # online and was considering contacting them that way, but it seems a little over the top. Even if I didn't get selected for the position, I'd be interested to get some feedback and hear why/what went wrong in the interview. Any tips? Thanks!"

[When Conan bursts into your office to film a segment, are you aware that he is coming or does he really just suddenly show up in your office with a cameraman?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ajju2/i_am_jordan_schlansky_associate_producer_of_conan/c8xze6u?context=5)|I can assure you I had no idea he was coming when we shot that remote last week. I was innocently typing out an email when a 6'4"" man and two bright lights burst into my office. -JS.
[As a Late Night intern years ago, I was helping you set up a stereo in Conan's office. You asked me what my career plans were, and I said I wanted to be a TV producer.  You then said something like, ""well this is what a producer does. Get used to it.""  It was kind of depressing. Were you purposely trying to kill my hopes and dreams?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ajju2/i_am_jordan_schlansky_associate_producer_of_conan/c8y0783?context=5)|No but it was best to be honest with you up front! -JS.

I appreciate whatever advice you can give me. I'm a second-year biology student a highly ranked public university. I came in with honors and from top percent of my high school class and I'm generally described as a bright guy. Lately my grades have been slipping, leading me to a 3.25 gpa, but this quarter I'm looking at pretty much all Cs and Ds. There's one class I need to pass in order to even get my biology degree (it's a lower-div requirement, and if I get below a C then I have to choose a different major), and right now my grade is a 24%. The average is about a 60%. If I get 100% on the final then my raw score will only be a 64. Basically, without a serious curve I'm at risk of not even getting a biology degree. I'm below the average in all my other classes and I dropped oChem last month because I failed the first test. I just got fired from my research internship because I didn't put enough effort into it, and I got rejected from a returning student leadership position just because I missed my interview appointment. I like science and learning, and I'm captivated by the idea of going into research but I don't know if I'm just lying to myself. I put off my work until the last minute, sometimes really screwing myself over because I'm rushing into class late with unfinished assignments. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and whenever I ask myself I shrug and procrastinate. If I'm not half-assing a project or studying, then I'm mentally or literally masturbating. I find myself lurking on Reddit more than ever, and some weeks I go with barely any sleep and I let my room become a mess. I don't think I'm depressed so much as apathetic, but it's really stressing me out and I hate myself for not being the person I want to be! And I hate myself for not even having a real idea of who I want to be! I'm scared of confronting this hole that I've dug myself, and I've started to lie to my girlfriend and my parents about my grades. I'm starting to feel sick thinking about the mess I'm in and I could really use some advice, Reddit. Why am I doing this to myself? I want to stop being so apathetic, but thinking about my other actions as of late, I think the only thing I ever really want is approval. I'm sad and angry and I want help!"
1akmrg,2,2013-03-18,"Offered two jobs, stuck in the middle",magbar,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1akmrg/offered_two_jobs_stuck_in_the_middle/,"I have recently found myself in a predicament I never saw coming. At a pivotal moment in my undergrad I have been offered two different position and need to decide by Friday which one to take, and I am nearly making myself sick over it. Redditors with your endless wisdom help a girl out!

Some quick background, I am a 21 female CSE major at a large university, both of these positions are internships.

Job 1: In the city where I attend school, and of course where all my friends are. The position begins April 1 and I have technically already accepted it (before I found out I was offered the other one). Anyways this position is appealing because I could stay here and I would be working on the accessibility of the software this company develops, definitely something I am interested in experiencing. The office is very traditional and they seem to be very eager to have me seeing as they offered me the job the day after my interview. I could definitely see myself enjoying my time here. 

Job 2: In the city I was raised (would be living with my parents, not ideal but not awful). This company does exactly the kind of software I hope to work on after graduation. I am hesitant because 1) I would miss my friends (I know I have some serious FOMO going on) and 2) I am fairly certain I was only hired because they have ZERO female employees in the engineering department. In fact the entire company only has females in the HR dept and reception, not exactly exciting for me. Also this office operates a little less traditionally (by which I mean scooters and nerf guns) which from my perspective isn't a great work environment but I realize that's a lame excuse. 

Reddit I just don't know what to do! Job #1 in the #2 location or job #2 in the #1 location. I realize I am young and have a whole career ahead of me but this could be a very pivotal moment for me and I am paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong decision.

Do any of you think you made a wrong decision based on location? Mind you the cities are two hours apart so its not like I couldn't go back and forth on the weekends. I am just so torn!"
1akl28,4,2013-03-18,Salary Expectations?,dogdiarrhea,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1akl28/salary_expectations/,"I just saw a job pop up that seemed to be tailor made for my current experience. I'm about to graduate university but did about 2 years of worth of internships at an on campus information systems department on campus. I'm curious what I should put for salary expectations, I'm guessing the strategy would be not to put off the employer. 

The job title is: Infrastructure Analyst I

The responsibilities are:

&gt;Assist in the implementation of varying technologies with respect to new and continuing infrastructure projects.

&gt;Perform on-site or remote diagnosing of hardware related and software problems using highly integrated diagnostic tools and techniques with elevated privileges.

&gt;Maintain up to date structured diagrams for the specification of databases, communication systems, servers, storage area networks or any other infrastructure service.

&gt;Make recommendations on new maintenance procedures, services, protocols and security practices.

&gt;Manage and implement best practices for maintenance and operation procedures for the support of databases, applications, hardware systems, operating systems and network systems.

&gt;Create documentation at the onset of an infrastructure initiative and maintain such documentation through the project lifecycle in preparation for operational handoff.

&gt;Assist managing and implementing the IS architecture plan, ensuring the IS infrastructure meets existing and future requirements.

&gt;Assist in the maintenance of policies and procedures for IS administration to ensure consistency and adherence to standards.

&gt;Maintain a high level of communication and rapport with the Manager of Infrastructure Delivery.

&gt;Participate and assist in the weekly/monthly meetings to communicate progress on projects and objectives.

&gt;Work effectively with management, support staff, and clients/partners to enhance professionalism, productivity and team achievement.

Edit: I was thinking the most likely ranges I should put to be 40-50k or 50-60k."

I haven't apply for any universities, colleges or internships and now, it looks like I'll spend next year working at my part time McDonald's job, which to be honest, is probably the most degrading thing I have ever had to do in my life.

Ever since I can remember, I was always certain that I was somehow I was going to get a job where I could work with computers. Using computers and programming are the only things that I believed I'm good at.

Every person I have spoken to about my future has given me some vague overview about what courses I should apply for and what I should and shouldn't do but all this information, with slight adjustments could easily be applied to any career out there.

So, I'm here looking for somebody who could give me some advise on becoming a programmer or give me a better insight into the computing industry, which courses I should look into, what experience I should get, what is the competition out there like (I live in the UK, what is it like here?) or if it's even worth trying.

I have the option of getting my university to help place me in an internship for September or graduating in September. My university will help place me as long as I have 1 CS course left undone. Over this summer I could take that 1 CS course and graduate, or I could leave it out and get aid in finding an internship. However coming back to school for the sake of 1 course seems annoying, and ideally I want to move away to work so I'd have to deal with transfer credits.

 I am hoping to work in Winnipeg, Canada since I have friends there. I am concerned that if I enter the work force with no work experience I will not be able to get a job. The highlights of my resume will be:

* BSc Hons Applied Mathematics &amp; Physics, BA Computer Science (worked on all 3 majors concurrently across 5 years)

* 2 years running the undergraduate Mathematics Society (shows leadership and social skills)

* I have won a few scholarships over my university career

* Was awarded summer research position in mathematics

* Knows Java, C#, C++, SQL, and a bit of javascript. 

* I'll have 2 good letters of reference. One from a CS prof, one from a math prof

1angun,5,2013-03-20,Negotiating starting salary as a fresh CS PhD... what leverage do I have?,snapmaster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1angun/negotiating_starting_salary_as_a_fresh_cs_phd/,"I recently finished a PhD from a very prestigious CS program.  I have zero work experience, but my research was fairly specialized and relevant to a company that recently extended me an offer.  The company basically only hires PhDs.

Looking at glassdoor.com and talking to a friend that works there, it's clear they are lowballing me by at least 10% (offer is barely over 100 for a silicon valley location).  I've read on here that new BS/MS grads have zero leverage.  Does that also apply to PhD students?

If that is true, can I gain more leverage by getting a competing offer?  I believe one is on the way, but I am not sure how much more they will offer me.  Unfortunately the first company is pushing me hard to respond while I buy time to get a second offer.  Bonus question- how long can I put them off?  They initially only gave me like 3 days!

EDIT - I've completed the negotiation process and got a job.  Here's what happened:

1. I got a competing offer.
2. I put off both places for just under 2 weeks.  They will pressure you, but they will wait if they want you.  The way you do this is by asking lots of questions and asking to talk to people in their organization.  This takes time, and they will respect you taking time to get more information.  They will not be happy if you take time just for the hell of it.
3. Having a highly ranked PhD was helpful, but didn't really get me leverage until I got the second offer.  Once I got the second offer, it was clear that both places were gunning for me hard.  I do believe that the weight of the PhD helped, but only once the second offer showed up.
4. The competing offer is truly how you get leverage.  Just send it to the first place, they will match or beat it.  Send the next offer to the second place, they will match or beat.  Then go back to the first.  That's all it took to go from just over 100 to almost 120.  During the process, be very cordial about everything, and express surprise at new offers; say that your goal is simply to get equivalent offers on the table.  Continually express how excited you are to join.  HR people know that competitors will try to counter- do not be shy about going back and forth.  Don't do it more than twice though.

NO ONE GAVE TWO SHITS that I didn't do an internship.  If you don't understand why, you don't understand the CS PhD process.

Internship A is at ARM (in California). I live several states (read: about 1000 mi and several mountain ranges) away, and would have to move for the summer. I was completely fine with that, until I got offered Internship B.

Company B is located about 45 minutes from my house, and is a small collective of two electrical engineers, a couple of computer science people, and a mech-eng who can code. They basically work on commission and farm all the profits out to the employees. Their offer pays about $3 less per hour , but I wouldn't have to move, wouldn't have to sublet my apartment/do a more expensive month-to-month in CA. I'd be doing everything from FPGA design work to debugging an iphone app in Objective-C at company B, while at ARM I'd be working on a specific project that's already been at least vaguely outlined to me.

In both cases I would learn a lot of cool stuff and get a lot of experience. Both companies seem like they've got a good work atmosphere, both seem excited to have me. I signed and returned the offer letter for company B because I hadn't gotten a final offer letter from ARM  and was getting worried, and then literally that same day they came back with a formal offer.

I am divided between the big name for what actually would be less money, given the cost of living in Cali compared to where I live, cost of moving, etc, and going with the total unknown who does awesome stuff for anybody who wants to hire them, for several thousand dollars more over the course of the summer. 

tl;dr got offered two internships, one with a tech giant, one with a local collective of contract engineers. which to take? I need advice!"

Most recently, there really has not been much for us two interns to work on, so we spend most of our days trying to keep ourselves busy. Our supervisors do not communicate a whole lot with us anymore, and we feel as though we have been put by the wayside. Unique situation about our plant is that it is in the process of being moved to a different plant, which I attribute to most of these problems. I understand that we are after all interns, but I was really hoping to have accomplished something that I could put on my resume to really impress employers and get into grad school. This is not my first internship, and at my previous internship I felt as though I was able to accomplish more, but I also had more freedom to act there. I am very grateful to have an opportunity for an internship, because I know many students do not. At the same time though, that makes me want to make sure that I do not waste this opportunity. Has anyone else had these sorts of problem while working their internship, or am I just expecting too much?

And now for the whine...

I'm a one man IT band for a SMB manufacturing company, and I'll admit it, most of the time I'm slacking off and procrastinating on just about everything. I'll take responsibility for that. That being said, despite having a decent education and modest chops, due to the culture of the company (technophobic) and various other factors, I constantly feel as though nothing I do matters. I mean, I just don't feel appreciated, and it seems like I'm continually being stuck with coworker's busy work, meaning that if they find it even slightly challenging, and can make anything near a half baked case for it being something I should do, or ""help"" (meaning I'll have to do it myself) with, I get stuck with it. 

I want out, but it just seems like there's nothing out there that would be a good opportunity for me. I want to use my MS in InfoSec, but the majority of what I do currently isn't what I'd call direct experience towards a security related job, even though I'm responsible for everything technology related for a $14M company. And we all know that the ""entry level"" is a bygone idea.

Currently, I'm just trying to keep my head above water, study for certs (CCNA first, then Sec+, maybe CISA or I'll just bite the bullet and CISSP and be an associate until I can get the rest of the experience) and keep looking for jobs.

I know I'm capable of so much more, but every time in the past that I've put together a project or proposal to improve the company, even when it's been requested, it has been marginalized, backburnered, and eventually forgotten about, despite the countless hours that went into research, planning, and vendor negotiations (who will then be bugging me for weeks about when to expect a decision). I'm just not sure how much more of this lack of professionalism, or basic competency I can reasonably tolerate.

And then there's the pay. I make what I did when I started 3 years ago (gross)  straight out of college, and deductions for benefits have gone up (lowering take home pay). Even then, I started making less than the bottom 10% for entry level in my area (which is already below national and regional averages). It's disheartening. Especially with 9+ years of education, and 6 years of previous internships (thanks to the market crash of 2007.)

Anyway, any words of encouragement or abuse to motivate me?

TL;DR I'm responsible for my future, any words of encouragement or abuse for motivation?

All self taught through learncpp.com and online references in my free time.
So far i did a few Problem Set Volumes on UVA online judge, my own Player vs Player( One pc in Console ) Chess
and a program manipulating a picture with SFML.

I know about the Basic Data Structures and Sorts on different kinds of containers am on a basic level familiar with the STL containers ( different uses of them but e.g. no knowledge about hashing, the list goes on).

Now in my intern for modeling I can have abit more free time/head as when i went to school, so i can also program for myself.

Earlier I already had a look at certain beginner courses for programming but they tend to talk about what a loop is and how to write a very basic program.

I am currently glancing over the lists on Coursera and Udacity to find an appropiate Course to get me deeper into Programming.

Now I would like to know if you guys can suggest a course wich I could take on. I would prefere a course using C++ but would also go for Web Development(Design or Programming) or C#.

The course should be inspiring not giving the basics of something and tell me how fun it is to add 5+5, yeah at my beginning it was fun but now i want to draw bigger and more detailed pictures. I think there are guys who know what i mean with that.

What do I want to do with it later? I want to Program. Freelancing for Web or C++ applications/Design and maybe later gather a few people to create something together.

1as79g,5,2013-03-22,Computer Information Science?,ghdana,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1as79g/computer_information_science/,"So, being in the beginning of my Senior year of high school, I wanted to go to a cheap school, within an hour from my home, the same school as my girlfriend (she still is), and do ""something"" with computers. So I went to the one that was the cheapest and closest. 

I obviously didn't do my research, as the school is not ABET certified, and the degree is Computer Information Science, where you have the choice of being either Information Systems concentration or Computer Science concentration. When I Google ""Computer Information Science"" not many schools come up, and most links bring you to something Information Systems related. 


I am in the Computer Science concentration, and the only real difference is that we have classes like OS, Analysis of Algorithms, and Programming Languages; meanwhile IS has business classes, but most of the same. 


This has not yet presented me with any problems, although it can be confusing filling out forms with no ""Computer Information Science"" choice. However, many people on this subreddit are very quick to shout that a CIS or MIS degree is worthless. 

I have an internship set up for this summer at a top Fortune 50 company, in the same position, developing, with CS majors (some from schools like MIT), and not with Information Systems students. 

Basically, what I am wondering is if you guys ever see anyone else that you work with that has a ""Computer Information Science"" degree, and what type of jobs do they have? Is there anything I need to worry about, other than being at a small state school with no brand recognition?

I'm a CS student in my last year, and already had a 3 year apprenticeship in programming. I did an internship at a small software company in VB.net and another one at a chip manufacturer in China (ERP System). 
In China I did some management work and I thought it was really fun and interesting, but my mentor there adviced me to study computer engineering for my last year (embedded softare, microcontrollers, assembler etc.) to get some knowledge on the engineering side, then do my masters in some economic related major to understand the ""economic side"". He said I would then be well prepared for a consulting or later a management job. 

But since this is only one source, I wanted to know what other people think of this theory. I already specialized in computer engineering and it appears a little ""raw"" to me, none of the nice IDEs I'm used to like visual studio, no code-completion etc. it feels a little bit cold to me. I'm a bit of a motivational/charismatic person according to my mentor and he thought management would fit me very well.

What do you guys think of all this?"

I have 2 options for my summer/fall Co-op this year. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, a co-op is where you intern at a company for half the year, then attend school for the other half until you finish with a degree

The first company is pretty local to my school, ~30 min commute using public transit. The job itself is mostly hardware oriented, designing and testing embedded systems stuff. Writing code in C, and using some linux distros. 

The second company is in California (I go to school on the east coast). It's mainly concerned with writing software for a project they're working on. They mainly use Python (I've never written python, but I'm willing to learn) and some C++. 

They pay essentially the same, and rent in each city is about the same. The only additional cost is travel, which the company would help with.

I've always been more of a software person (hence the CE major, not EE), and Python is a language that I definitely should learn at some point which makes me lean towards the second position. This is basically my ""dream"" job.

Here's the kicker. I received a formal offer from the first company, and have until Monday to respond. The second company sent offers to two people, one of which rejected it, and I'm next in line to be awarded an offer. I should hopefully hear from them sometime Monday, but no guarantees.

If they don't respond during the day Monday, do I risk losing the first job to get the better one?

TL;DR Got offered one hardware job, and should receive an offer from my ""dream"" job the same day I have to respond to my first offer. Do I risk losing a good offer to get a great one?

Edit: Just got the offer from the second company. Higher pay (25 vs. 18), round trip airfare, and a housing stipend.

Previous to entering college I had done little to no programming, partly because I had no idea what I wanted to major in until senior year, and partly because my high school did not offer any Computer Science/Programming related courses. So far I have really enjoyed programming (my school starts students off in Java, so that is what I have exclusively used so far), I have taken ""Introduction to Programming"" which was as the title describes, I am currently nearly finished with ""Data Structures"" and CS specific ""Logic, Sets, and Functions"". I estimate my GPA will be ~3.7 after this semester is over with, which I feel is decent because my school has a pretty rigorous CS department (In the top 15 in the US supposedly). As of right now I am considered an ""entry level"" CS student, which restricts me on the classes I can take, but after the completion of this semester I will be promoted. This will allow me to take more specific Programming ""electives"" in the area that I am interested in. I'm currently in the second round of the interviewing process for an SE technical internship at eBay, which might help me answer some of my question below.


**Question:** How should I go about finding what areas I am interested in? As of right now, nearly all avenues sound interesting to me (SE, data mining, data analysis, OS, crypto..etc). I have done some research on a few topics but I feel that I could wind up disliking it once I get into the thick of it. 

What specific avenues of specialization are ""hot"" right now? While I do want to do something I truly enjoy, I also want to be able to comfortably support myself and my future family, which would require getting a good job. 
--Or the opposite of the question above, What areas are not so ""hot"" right now?



Of all the specializations I feel that I am most interested in **Security/Crypto.** Is there/will there continue to be a large demand for this type of work, and is it plausible to graduate with a BS and receive a job doing such work?
Although I am interested in Crypto, I do understand that it is heavily math and logic based, which I feel I am not that ""great"" in. (The only class I'm not going to make an A in will be my Logic and 2nd sequence of Calculus).

So, here are my concerns, of which everyone can feel free to tell me to run like hell, or dig in.

-	Their entire security apparatus consists of a password on their (1) wireless router.
-	Short of them buying me a monitor, I’m using my own laptop, with my own copy of Adobe CS6. They are open to supplying me my own hardware and software, but that process has been slow.
-	I was tasked with making a marketing site, and when I couldn’t get it done within a couple hours, my boss panicked and started making his own on GoDaddy, which I had to completely re-do, and because GoDaddy’s web designer is a giant clusterfuck.
-	They want to make some sort of database to handle customer calls, but again, there is neither a support team nor guidance on what I would use to craft such a database.
-	I am communicating how difficult it is to make a site from scratch, within the span of a couple hours, but they need things done so fast it collapses back to shitting out a domain on GoDaddy’s WYSIWYG.
-	Its all a big mess, but I look at it as a challenge, sort of the wild west at a company that has a need for someone with a passion for technology. 
-	It’s a growing company , selling a great product, with a possible salary position at the end of my 3 month paid internship period, which is why I have a slightly positive outlook on the whole experience.
Any advice is welcome!

What would be better for a career in user experience at large companies (dream job is at google as director of android user experience some day) going into industry right away after undergrad, and perhaps getting a masters a few years down the line? Or is it better to get the masters right away and then apply for different jobs?

As far as career details go here are some for me:

I'm currently majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I attend Stony Brook University and I'm enrolled in the Computer Science Honors program there.

I've interned at a small (~30 people) doing mostly database/report generation/very little front end web dev for them.

I'm currently interning part time at CA technologies doing User Experience and Design work for them during the Spring semester and I will continue doing this for them after the summer in the Fall Semester.

I will be interning at Amazon this summer as an SDE intern in the Kindle Content and Experience branch.

I interned with a medium sized company for a year and a half doing various things, including System administration, network administration and security. After I graduated they decided not to hire me permanently as I was told they would, and I am now a temp working as a sort-of Sysadmin and making less than the entry level Help Desk workers. I've been told this will eventually lead to permanent position, but of course, that's also what they told me about my internship. 

Unhappy with my situation I've been applying for other Sys admin and Network Admin positions, but there aren't a lot of entry level positions available and i think I am probably not getting responses because I don't have enough experience. Today I received a call from the local library I applied to for a network admin position. They said the position was filled but asked me to interview for a PC Support position. I accepted the interview, but I'm not thrilled about the position. I'd be making about what I'm making now with benefits (plus!) But I would have to support public library patrons. (huge minus)

I know there's room for growth into a sysadmin position from a PC Support position, but honestly I feel like I'm rather overqualified. I have a degree and the things I did as an intern were much more advanced than PC repair. Not to mention the wages for these positions make it difficult for me to put a dent in my student loan debt. So my question is, should I...
1. Continue applying for Sysadmin / Network Admin jobs that require experience
2. Apply for PC Support positions which require no experience or degree with terrible pay and try to move up
3. Stay in my pseudo-sysadmin job that pays terrible just to get more experience

If it makes any difference, my ""dream"" is to be more of a Network Engineer rather than Systems, but I have to get started somewhere."

1aze42,2,2013-03-25,I am considering dropping out of grad school,jchazu,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1aze42/i_am_considering_dropping_out_of_grad_school/,"I am nearing the end of my second year in my Master's program in Counseling, and it's about time for me to commit to taking on an internship for the next two years so I can complete my degree. It is seriously making me second-guess my career choice.

Right now I work full-time as a manager at a bookstore, and I do like my job for the most part. I'm also taking night classes twice a week, which in itself makes me lose hours at work, tightening my financial situation. After taking on the internship, I'll have to either take another 8-hour pay cut per week, or intern on a day I don't have work, effectively leaving me with one day off per week. It's already considerably difficult for me to have the energy for a social life as it is, and while I'm not at all a go-out-all-the-time type of person, I'm worried about spending the next two years in a state of exhaustion. Part of me knows that it'll only be for two years, and then I can go on and actually be a counselor full-time, but at the moment I'm very resistant.

There are a lot of things I like about my program/career choice: I find the material interesting, and I do believe that I would be a pretty good counselor, but...I just don't know if it's right for me. I deal with intermittent depression (which I'm seeing a therapist for), and some days in makes it difficult to tend to my own life, so I don't know that I want to deal with clients with their own problems throughout the day, every day. Counseling is a high-burnout career, and I'm not sure that I could give my clients the attention they need while still satisfying my own needs.

I do love psychology; I can't deny that at all. But what I love about it is the theorizing and the attempts to figure out why we do what we do, not necessarily the application of different theories. I tend to analyze and process things on a very high level (I dual majored in Philosophy as well as Psych, if that says anything about me), but honestly I get more jollies from ""figuring out"" a client's problem than actually seeing them solve it for themselves.

But if I do drop out of grad school...then I'm just a guy who works in retail, and that scares me.

I am fascinated by high-availability and Big Data, so I am looking for an internship somewhere where I can get a glimpse of what analytics on high-volume datasets really means.

I strive for mathematical beauty in programming but I still get work done.

I am fluent in English and I speak intermediate French (around level B2)

I am from EU, so I am looking for an internship somewhere in the EU (preferably) from August - October. 

Please send me a PM for references.

I felt extremely grateful, and still grateful to this day, but now it feels like my life has gone stagnant. I'm still part time and struggling to pay bills. The IT guy  hasn't set up my computer (I work from my own personal laptop) and my company email. This makes me feel disposable and unappreciated at the company. Something tells me that I should play a little politics to try and get what I want from the IT guy, but it sucks that I have to do something like that for him to do his job.

1b29pd,0,2013-03-26,Switching co-op (internship) positions: bad idea?  ,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1b29pd/switching_coop_internship_positions_bad_idea/,"Hey r/engineering, 

I'm a mechanical engineering student currently doing my first co-op rotation with a chemical company, and so far it's been a fantastic learning experience.  My managers are great, and I work really hard to make sure that they (along with the company as a whole) are 100% satisfied with my results.  

However, despite the positive experience I've had with the company, I've come to realize that the chemical industry isn't really where my interests lie as a prospective mechanical engineer.  My interests lie in the dynamic systems aspects of ME (controls, mechatronics, etc) rather than the thermo-fluid aspects of ME.  

The co-op office at my college expects me to stay all three rotations with this chemical company, but I know that I'll be miserable if I'm forced to stay with this company for two more rotations, since I'm not exposed to the fields of ME that I'm truly interested in.  Additionally, if I *do* stay with the chemical company for the rest of my co-op rotations, I'll have an easier time finding a job with other chemical companies and a harder time finding a job related to dynamic systems, mechatronics, controls, vibrations, etc (which truly appeal to me).  

So my question is this:  should I quit my current co-op position after completing my rotation with the chemical company, and then apply for a position that I'm more interested in for my next rotation?  Or should I just tough it out and work with the chemical company for two more rotations?  These days, I feel that *any* college student who gets *any* internship is extremely lucky.  Is it a bad idea for me to just throw that away?  Am I acting spoiled/entitled by wanting a co-op position more aligned with my ME interests?  

An important note:  I can't apply for a new co-op position unless I resign from my current position.  I don't want to be a douche and apply for a different co-op position while I'm in the middle of one already.  However, if I wait too long, there's a chance that I won't find a new co-op at all by the Fall (when my second rotation would begin), which means I'd be in a bit of trouble.

I do everything; front end, back end, technical support, training, customer relations. Everything. My duties are, basically, the same as they were when I was an intern, and are the same as my peers in almost every aspect. It's a pretty relaxed environment, jeans and t-shirt kind of place. I really like it. But there is zero room for growth. Hypothetically, if I were still here in 10 years I'd be doing exactly what I'm doing now. Half of the employees still use a dead language I've never heard of until I started here.


I just applied to a company I already interviewed with months ago, and I was certain I was going to get the job until at the last minute they couldn't afford someone new at the time. This is a Tier II internal help desk role. It's quite the jump backwards on the proverbial corporate ladder, and a lot less responsibility (though frankly that's okay with me).

I'm pretty underpaid where I am now, so I'd imagine this new job will probably pay the same, and have room for actual advancement in the future. Do you guys think it would be wise to do it, or stay where I am now and get more experience as a full on developer, even though it's not great experience because I don't have a mentor or anything?"
1b1hn6,24,2013-03-26,Campfire Stories: Brian,tridentposeidon,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1b1hn6/campfire_stories_brian/,"So here I am, near the tail end of my national park road-trip across the states, in what is arguably the most beautiful park of them all, Yellowstone. I just recently graduated out of the University of Pennsylvania with a major in biochemistry, and I had landed an extremely well-paying job, but I wasn't due for six more months. How do I spend my time? I am kind of a loner, and besides, the few friends I have are spread far and few across the country busy finding and securing jobs for themselves.  So after some planning, I found myself starting the road-trip with a beat-up Mazda Protégé and a thousand dollars of cash.

4 months later, here I am, in Yellowstone with no friends or family, just a backpack and boots. I call it a day when I see that the sun is halfway to the horizon, and I head back to my camp spot. Sure, I could try to climb this ledge for a little longer, but the nighttime bear killing stories just give me the creeps. I sit down next to my tent and take a bite out of my Granola bar, staring contently at the vast milky swathes of stars that stretch across my entire vision. Suddenly, I hear some yelling in my direction, ""Hey man with the bar! Yea you, wanna join us for some dinner?"" I squint in the direction where the voice came from and see a group of about a dozen people beckoning me over. Sighing, I get up and trudge over. This better be worth it. 

It is quite a diverse group, with people of all ages and colors. One of the people must have seen my confused expression so he explained, ""Haha naw, we are not all together, me and my wife Jenny over here just called everyone in this area together for some good old campfire fun. The name is Brian. What's your name?"" ""Kent, I replied, sitting down on one of the chairs that Brian pulled over. We ate and made small talk a little, and I got to know the group very well in just 20 minutes. 

There was Brian and Jennifer, high school sweethearts from Texas who met each other when Brian recently took up a job in a dentist's office. They soon married after that, and they decided to take a trip to Yellowstone to ""witness the outdoors"". There was Cooper, a National Geographic wildlife photographer intern, who well, came here to photograph animals. Andrew and his best bud Ethan were recent graduates from Cambridge who like me, came here to kill time. August was a veteran camper, who now at the ripe age of 66 had claimed to climbing Mt. Everest just last year. Yeah right, that geezer is just pulling our strings.  Then there was the group of five; Naomi, Tyler, Russel, Kevin, and Sunny, all neighborhood friends from Frisco who needed some adventure and outdoors in their life. Then there is Chris, a heavy built black guy who plays football for his college. He lives just an hour's drive from Yellowstone, and yet this is the first time he has ever visited. Last and most definitely least, was me. 

""So let's get cracking then, shall we!"" exclaimed Brian, with a cheesy smile plastered across his face. ""It's story time! Rules are simple; the story has to be real, it doesn't have to be your story, maybe something a friend or family member once told you. Oh, but one thing is for sure; it has to be scary. So who's first?"" Brian said, scanning the group. How bout the new kid? He said smiling, looking at me. ""Um, sorry, I am a good story creator but I am a lousy story teller. Pass"", I said awkwardly. ""Well then, I will go first”, Brian replied. “Story is short, but good”. “Short and sweet?!” muttered Chris. “More like short and fucked up,” scoffed Brian. “Alright here is why you never sleep in shady motels at night:

It was my junior year of high school, spring break, so mah three best friends and I decided to lose our alcohol virginity. We drove off quite a safe distance from town, and cracked open the beer. Coors Light, if I remember correctly. Anyways, we drunk, played around, and played truth-or-dare for 3 hours. It was about 2 AM when we stopped. I was so drunk; I was seeing 12 people instead of 3. Imagine that! 4 of each of my friends! So Randall, the least drunk of us all, threw us into his car and decided to crash us in a motel for the night. We stopped at the first one we saw, a shanty thing with just 25 rooms total and about 7 light bulbs that worked. Ha! We paid the receptionist and stumbled into our separate room. I slowly fell into a dull sleep.

 I woke up suddenly at around 4:30 AM. I don’t know what woke me up so I stupidly scanned the room, looking for what might have disturbed me. That’s when I saw it. A figure was shambling around the room, or should I say 4 figures, since I was still seeing in fours. The bathroom light was on at the far end, and Travis, one of my buds was not to be seen in the sleeping bag. Figured it must be him who was wandering around. I cursed at Travis for keeping the light on. My throat was parched so I groped around in my pack for some water. Shit. I left it in the car. “Yo Travis, imma get Randall’s keys and get me some water yea?” Travis didn’t reply, he just paced around the room muttering, looking for something. I took Randall’s keys off the table and stumbled out into the cool night air. Taking a grateful whiff, I fumbled with the keys at Randall’s car. Finally, the damn thing opened and I crashed inside. I found the water and drunk it was fast as I could. Shit, this water tastes weird I thought. Looking down at it, I realized it was the Coors Light. Dammit. I started to fell sleepy, so I closed the door and slept soundly.

I woke up to sirens and rapping at my door. I blearily opened my eyes, staring at a fat walrus of a man in a police uniform. I was scared; I was underage. However he didn’t seem concerned with the bottle in my hand. His expression was grave. “Son, I need you to identify some, uh, people for me.” He led me into our room, and I threw up right there. The stench of blood was just too strong. Hanging by the two light fixtures were Randall and Logan, all with a drunken glaze in their eyes. And in the bathroom, oh Travis! It looked like he tried to fight, and he failed. Horribly. His face was peeled off and was placed in his hands. His left leg was in two pieces, one piece resting against the toilet. A huge butcher’s knife protruded out of his chest. It was too much. My best friends. All of them, killed, just like that. “We looked into the motel security cameras kid,” continued the cop, “Well here is the weird part. Lobby security shows you four walking in to get book a room. Then we switched to room security, and at 2:15 AM, you opened the door to your room, and five people walked in. Five. We don’t know where the other one came from and we can’t find him now. We are really sorry, we truly are”.

Brian pulled back and sat on a log, tears now streaming down his face. “And that is why you never stop at a run-down motel for the night”. Whose story is up next?

I'm a transfer student applying to two state universities for Mechanical Engineering. Unfortunately my 1st choice won't notify me of acceptance for a while so I'm registering for classes for my 2nd choice as a precautionary measure. In talking with the department undergrad adviser and looking at the 4 year curriculum, I'm going to need to make up some ground if I go to my 2nd choice because I have focused my transfer credits for my 1st choice.

In doing so, my first semester there I am registered to take 20 credits of the following.

-Thermodynamics (3xx)

-Circuits (2xx)

-Fluid Dynamics (3xx)

-Engineering Analysis w/lab (3xx)

-Materials Science (2xx)

-Statistics for Engineers (3xx)

along with the following two courses to catch up

-Mechanics of Materials Lab (already taken the lecture) (2xx)

-Intro to CAD (1xx)

I have a 4.0 from my transfer institution with time to spare, but I'm aware that doesn't really mean much, and I also see several people saying Junior year is a new ""monster"" that is going to be tough as is. I won't have a job that semester as I will be moving over a week before classes start and will probably just focus on coursework the first semester anyways.

Along with this, my 2nd choice won't let me ""declare"" my major until I have a semester of credit with a minimum 3.0 GPA.

So I'm curious if you guys had any advice or can share any similar experiences, I'm not afraid of hard work, but I want to remain realistic too. I'm not sure of my alternatives quite yet if I choose to drop the course load down because I want to graduate in 2 years and I plan on doing an internship over the summer between.

1b0mtv,2,2013-03-25,"Got let go today with no notice or severance despite contractual obligations, need advice.",LaidOffVet,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1b0mtv/got_let_go_today_with_no_notice_or_severance/,"It's a long story and I don't know all the gory details but I will try to sum it up as concisely and accurately as I can with my current knowledge. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I am a veterinarian. I graduated vet school a few years back and haven't been practicing very long, but I finished in the top of my class and completed one of the most prestigious internships available so I would consider myself to be a valuable asset to any practice. For the last 1 year and 8 months I have been employed full time at an after-hours emergency hospital.  The practice is owned by another vet that also owns a few other day practices and a boarding/grooming facility in the area. I signed a one year contract initially and renewed it for another year after its terms had expired. My work attendance has been perfect and all of my performance reviews have been extremely positive. 

I've had my complaints, but overall, it's been a good job. I've known that the owner has been having some financial difficulties due to the economic slump over the past few years, but my understanding was that my hospital was never the problem. Sure, business had its ups and downs, but we generally made money after-hours. The owner's other businesses were less successful, however, and there had been talk of consolidating the day practices and/or selling the boarding facility to cut down on expenses, but this had been months ago and business had been proceeding along per the usual.  

I worked a 12 hour shift yesterday and wasn't scheduled to work again until next Monday (us emergency vets work weird shift schedules). I woke up this morning to a voicemail from the owner, aka my boss, which I thought odd but figured someone called in sick and they needed coverage or some other stupid inconvenience. When I called, my boss regretfully informed me that all hospitals were being closed effective immediately and to come get any of my stuff out today before the bank locks up the property. According to the owner, it was completely unexpected and they had just found out. Having just woken up, and reeling from the shock of the news, this was about the extent of our conversation. I have spoken with several coworkers, both doctors and technicians, but I have not yet spoken again with the owner. As far as anyone is aware, no severance is being offered and employees have been directed to apply for unemployment. The rumor consensus is that the owner has basically lost everything, including their house and is likely declaring bankruptcy. 

This means that 30+ people, many of whom are my good friends, were let go today with no notice and no severance. This makes me sick. Unlike most of the employees, as a doctor, I have a contract. My contract explicitly states the following:

&gt; This agreement and the employment of doctor may be terminated by either party without cause on 90 days written notice prior to [date redacted, late
Summer 2013, about 3-4 months from now] or by 30 days written notice thereafter. It is understood by both parties that the usual transition time is at the end of the contract period and only extreme conditions can result in an exception.

Now, as I've said, I'm not a lawyer, but I think that this means the owner is in breach of contract and I'm owed 90 days pay. Not to mention all my unclaimed sick and vacation days. 

This clause is included due to nature of my profession and the level of my training: a new job often involves an extensive job search and interviewing process and even moving hundreds of miles. 

I realize that my boss is likely in a far worse position than I am and I genuinely feel horrible that they and their family are going through this. I also realize that they may desperately want to give us all a huge severance package and are literally unable to due to whatever financial and legal limitations they are currently under. I have had no major issues with my boss, but I do find it more than a little bit hard to believe that this was truly not foreseeable and even 2-3 weeks notice would have made a huge difference. 

Being still relatively young and irresponsible, I don't have a large savings account to float me. To make it worse, my girlfriend and I had been planning on moving after my current contract ended later this year but we don't even know where yet (she's waiting to hear back from schools) and won't be ready to move for at least a month or two. So I currently feel completely powerless to do anything to improve my job prospects. 

Should I talk to a lawyer about trying to get some of what I believe is contractually owed me? I really don't want to be an asshole to the owner but I also feel like I got absolutely shat on today, and that clause was put into my contract for a damn good reason. I figure there's a good chance that even if I was to lawyer up successfully, it would be many months or even years before I saw anything so it's not going to help me now, but would they be under some sort of protection if they were undergoing bankruptcy? For now, I'm applying for unemployment and hoping that my girlfriend hears back from schools this week so that I can at least get an idea of where we're moving and start looking for a job. 

Sorry if I've not been as concise as I promised. I've literally been in shock all day and writing this was probably as much cathartic as it was advice-seeking. Also, sorry for any typos, I'm lying on the couch typing on my phone. 

TL;DR - The hospital I work at was closed today and all employees let go with no notice or severance. My contract states 90 days written notice is required for my termination without cause. Don't want to be a dick, but should I sue my boss, and do I have a case?

EDIT: Sorry, this is in North Carolina.

EDIT: Confirmed from another Doc in the practice that the owner is definitely filing for bankruptcy, don't know what type/chapter.  "
1b0e46,0,2013-03-25,Campfire Stories: Bradley,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1b0e46/campfire_stories_bradley/,"So here I am, near the tail end of my national park road-trip across the states, in what is arguably the most beautiful park of them all, Yellowstone. I just recently graduated out of the University of Pennsylvania with a major in biochemistry, and I had landed an extremely well-paying job, but I wasn't due for six more months. How do I spend my time? I am kind of a loner, and besides, the few friends I have are spread far and few across the country busy finding and securing jobs for themselves.  So after some planning, I found myself starting the road-trip with a beat-up Mazda Protégé and a thousand dollars of cash.

4 months later, here I am, in Yellowstone with no friends or family, just a backpack and boots. I call it a day when I see that the sun is halfway to the horizon, and I head back to my camp spot. Sure, I could try to climb this ledge for a little longer, but the nighttime bear killing stories just give me the creeps. I sit down next to my tent and take a bite out of my Granola bar, staring contently at the vast milky swathes of stars that stretch across my entire vision. Suddenly, I hear some yelling in my direction, ""Hey man with the bar! Yea you, wanna join us for some dinner?"" I squint in the direction where the voice came from and see a group of about a dozen people beckoning me over. Sighing, I get up and trudge over. This better be worth it. 

It is quite a diverse group, with people of all ages and colors. One of the people must have seen my confused expression so he explained, ""Haha naw, we are not all together, me and my wife Jenny over here just called everyone in this area together for some good old campfire fun. The name is Brian. What's your name?"" ""Kent, I replied, sitting down on one of the chairs that Brian pulled over. We ate and made small talk a little, and I got to know the group very well in just 20 minutes. 

There was Brian and Jennifer, high school sweethearts from Texas who met each other when Bradley recently took up a job in a dentist's office. They soon married after that, and they decided to take a trip to Yellowstone to ""witness the outdoors"". There was Cooper, a National Geographic wildlife photographer intern, who well, came here to photograph animals. Andrew and his best bud Ethan were recent graduates from Cambridge who like me, came here to kill time. August was a veteran camper, who now at the ripe age of 66 had claimed to climbing Mt. Everest just last year. Yeah right, that geezer is just pulling our strings.  Then there was the group of five; Naomi, Tyler, Russel, Kevin, and Sunny, all neighborhood friends from Frisco who needed some adventure and outdoors in their life. Then there is Chris, a heavy built black guy who plays football for his college. He lives just an hour's drive from Yellowstone, and yet this is the first time he has ever visited. Last and most definitely least, was me. 

""So let's get cracking then, shall we!"" exclaimed Brian, with a cheesy smile plastered across his face. ""It's story time! Rules are simple; the story has to be real, it doesn't have to be your story, maybe something a friend or family member once told you. Oh, but one thing is for sure; it has to be scary. So who's first?"" Bradley said, scanning the group. How bout the new kid? He said smiling, looking at me. ""Um, sorry, I am a good story creator but I am a lousy story teller. Pass"", I said awkwardly. ""Well then, I will go first”, Brian replied. “Story is short, but good”. “Short and sweet?!” muttered Chris. “More like short and fucked up,” scoffed Brian. “Alright here is why you never sleep in shady motels at night:

It was my junior year of high school, spring break, so mah three best friends and I decided to lose our alcohol virginity. We drove off quite a safe distance from town, and cracked open the beer. Coors Light, if I remember correctly. Anyways, we drunk, played around, and played truth-or-dare for 3 hours. It was about 2 AM when we stopped. I was so drunk; I was seeing 12 people instead of 3. Imagine that! 4 of each of my friends! So Randall, the least drunk of us all, threw us into his car and decided to crash us in a motel for the night. We stopped at the first one we saw, a shanty thing with just 25 rooms total and about 7 light bulbs that worked. Ha! We paid the receptionist and stumbled into our separate room. I slowly fell into a dull sleep.

 I woke up suddenly at around 4:30 AM. I don’t know what woke me up so I stupidly scanned the room, looking for what might have disturbed me. That’s when I saw it. A figure was shambling around the room, or should I say 4 figures, since I was still seeing in fours. The bathroom light was on at the far end, and Travis, one of my buds was not to be seen in the sleeping bag. Figured it must be him who was wandering around. I cursed at Travis for keeping the light on. My throat was parched so I groped around in my pack for some water. Shit. I left it in the car. “Yo Travis, imma get Randall’s keys and get me some water yea?” Travis didn’t reply, he just paced around the room muttering, looking for something. I took Randall’s keys off the table and stumbled out into the cool night air. Taking a grateful whiff, I fumbled with the keys at Randall’s car. Finally, the damn thing opened and I crashed inside. I found the water and drunk it was fast as I could. Shit, this water tastes weird I thought. Looking down at it, I realized it was the Coors Light. Dammit. I started to fell sleepy, so I closed the door and slept soundly.

I woke up to sirens and rapping at my door. I blearily opened my eyes, staring at a fat walrus of a man in a police uniform. I was scared; I was underage. However he didn’t seem concerned with the bottle in my hand. His expression was grave. “Son, I need you to identify some, uh, people for me.” He led me into our room, and I threw up right there. The stench of blood was just too strong. Hanging by the three light fixtures were Randall, Logan, and Jake, all with a drunken glaze in their eyes. And in the bathroom, oh Travis! It looked like he tried to fight, and he failed. Horribly. His face was peeled off and was placed in his hands. His left leg was in two pieces, one piece resting against the toilet. A huge butcher’s knife protruded out of his chest. It was too much. My best friends. All of them, killed, just like that. “We looked into the motel security cameras kid,” continued the cop, “Well here is the weird part. Lobby security shows you four walking in to get book a room. Then we switched to room security, and at 2:15 AM, you opened the door to your room, and five people walked in. Five. We don’t know where the other one came from and we can’t find him now. We are really sorry, we truly are”.

Bradley pulled back and sat on a log, tears now streaming down his face. “And that is why you never stop at a run-down motel for the night”. Whose story is up next?

Other specialties include industrial electricity knowledge, automation, fluid power transmission, and my personal favorite so far has been my quality course. I really enjoy statistics and it tends to come natural to me. I have a firm understanding with P charts, N charts. etc and I know how to apply data gathered into real world action.

I really enjoy my degree, as well as my job which I work full time. Currently employed as an IT helpdesk rep. I worked at HEB previously, which is a large grocery store in southern Texas. I worked an internship with them as well.

The internship entailed introducing new product to ""sister"" stores of a similar demographic that performed well in one area, and might make an impact in another area.

If you or anyone might be interested in this skill set, like I said I'll be picking up my bachelors at the end of December 13' and I'm looking to jump right into a full time job if possible. 

I have an offer for a job in Seattle, WA. However, I would love to consider other fun/interesting locations.

If sending your associates across the country is what you do, I would REALLY love to give that a try. I want to travel and see the world doing what I love, which in my mind has always been a customer service attitude towards business.

Thanks for your time.

I haven't spent any time doing iOS or Android development, sans some mandatory labs in Android, but I'd like to make an app or two for my portfolio.

1b40j6,22,2013-03-27,Went to the Career Fair as an Employer.,TomKappa,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/1b40j6/went_to_the_career_fair_as_an_employer/,"I graduated in 2012 with a BS in EE, and now work for an Irving based company. They asked me to attend the UTD Career Fair with the HR rep and I jumped on the opportunity. It was the STEM career fair, but some of my observations might be good for others too.




Here are just a few notes:

* I liked it when people had been to our website and at least knew the basics of the company. 

I understand that might be tough what with all the companies, but looking at two equal resumes I liked the candidate who had been to the website more.


* When people came up to me and listed off their classes, I mostly just laughed. 

It's on your resume (because I know UTD resume format), and it doesn't tell me anything about you. For me especially, it meant nothing. You say you've had a relevant class, but I know that it means mostly squat, which I said to most people. 


* If you know of a certain position or I've mentioned one, ask what the normal activities/duties are. 

I was at the fair looking to hire people into the same position I have, so I could actually tell you first hand what I do. Not always the case, I know. As I was going over details, the more interesting candidates would chime in with projects they had done that were similar.


* Show some interest in your field outside of school. 

For many this is an internship or working in a lab, but as a hobby microcontroller tinkerer, I liked candidates who screwed around with Arduinos or played around with programming at home. One candidate told me he had made the first steps into automating his house, by adding RGB lights that responded based on certain conditions (door bell, temp, etc.) and another one told me about a theater seating program he had written. Those people made it to the top of my pile, literally, because he showed mildly relevant interests, but more importantly their interest to create and then solve their own problems.


* Be sure of yourself. 

I met a couple of candidates who would hardly say a thing, but had a great resume, and I thought less of them than someone who had a worse resume, but good focus on their strengths. This may be tough for many of you, but it's important. At a career fair I'm not looking at a bland piece of paper, I'm looking at you. Do I want you at my company? Do I want to work with you? Do I want to hear about your side projects or your hobbies? If you can't throw little bits of info out there to make yourself unique or interesting, then all I have is your GPA, good or bad.


* Look nice and memorable (if possible)

I could tell who had thrown on a polo, and who had had their suit dry cleaned. They probably tell you to wear calming colors (blues, whites, etc.) but I noticed the more vibrant choices (red shirts, stark black shirts) I could also tell who had come as an after thought; not shaven messier hair, quickly made resumes, and who had been planning for a while; nice haircut/make-up/shaven ironed shirt, etc. If you need help with some of this stuff, go ask your advisor or the career center, they're all really nice and will probably enjoy your cute plea for help.

I've joined a small organization at my school that wants to build a website. The project has had a lot of trouble getting off the ground, and it started almost a year ago.

The goal is to create a website that would allow users to ask other users questions in an interview-style format (sort of like posting text on someone's wall on FB; there's the original post, and then that post has comment replies). It would eventually have features like categories (for finding users), a spam filter, a profanity filter.

We were originally a team of about six programmers, but the leader had different goals (he wanted to make money; we just wanted to make a volunteer effort) so he left and others got discouraged and left too.

That was last school year. This school year we had a somewhat more organized effort, better funding, and so on and so forth. We had a team of three developers, until our lead (or most-seasoned) developer left to pursue her own projects and try to get an internship. So now I'm getting pretty discouraged. We have barely accomplished anything--we have a few URLs with some minimally-functional views and barebones html. The other guy hasn't pushed code in four months, so it's basically down to me as the sole coder now.

I'm trying to convince the leader of this organization that he needs more people, especially since it's a volunteer effort and we're all undergrad students. But he keeps saying that ""he doesn't ask much"" of us and ""all we need to do is put in a little time"". We coders were naive/inexperienced at the beginning, so I'm pretty sure we severely underestimated the man-hours this would require. It seems like a full-blown web development project, something that would at least cost a thousand bucks to pay someone to write.

[Am I wrong?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQl5aYhkF3E) It's true that I've been procrastinating--partly because of school, personal, and job concerns--but it's mostly because I'm concerned this project will never get off the ground, and I'm better off doing a solo project so I'll at least have something in my portfolio.

What I'm most curious about is, if someone were to commission a website like this from you, how much would you charge? How long would it take? Then factor in the consideration that I'm basically getting along with djangobook and the Django documentation. I have no prior web development experience, only super basic programs in C++. (We're writing it in Python 2.7 with Django).

Many thanks."

I've asked a few of my friends that graduated already and they've told me that they've waited till after they graduated to look for a job but that doesn't seem wise especially for someone in my position.

Is there anything I could do to set myself straight?"

I'm currently a ""junior"" in college. I'm pretty scared, as I wanted to go for medical school, but once I transferred to a university from my community college, I was in for a big shock. Everything changed, I no longer wanted to do biology. I was afraid of failing and being stuck with a biology degree and looking at mice poop under the microscope all day instead of being in medical school.
Anyways I'm currently taking a career exploration class and one assignment is to ask anyone that is currently living the life of one of these engineers about just life.

If you wouldn't mind answering... maybe some proof would be awesome :) Ha, it doesn't really matter. I just hope the teacher would believe us. Anyways, here we go!

Why did you decide on you career?

What was the most challenging part of getting to where you are?

What do you enjoy doing in your work?

Is the future bright for this career? Job security?

What do you dislike about this job?

What is a usual day like?

Would internships help me?

What kind of grades should I expect to achieve?

Is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (I live in Nebraska) be a good choice? (Guess you don't really have to bother with this one)

Personal qualities needed for this work type?

Who should I network with?

How much math was involved?

How important is it to know the ""right"" people?

Do you live a comfortable life with a family?

What are your free time like and your hobbies? Cars? Motorcycles? :P

I want to hopefully finish a chemical engineering degree at UNL in 3 years, as I have 2 years of general studies done. I really want to go into petroleum engineering, but I would rather stay in Nebraska for the tuition rates. So chemical engineering is the next best thing. I've always enjoyed chemistry in high school. Plus Breaking Bad is an awesome show.

Computer science is also something I kind of want to look at! If you know anyone with computer science background, tell them to answer this too!

I really appreciate all your help. This will really help with my future and this class.

Thanks!"

1b9kdw,3,2013-03-29,Would really appreciate some advice for my specific situation... (Psych major),ConfusedPsychMajor,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1b9kdw/would_really_appreciate_some_advice_for_my/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I am currently in my junior year of undergrad pursuing a psych major and criminal justice minor. For the first two years of my college career, all my advisors and people I talked to told me to not even think about grad school yet, don't worry about choosing a major, etc. Now all of a sudden, I feel like I am not on track at all for grad school. High school didn't prepare me for college AT ALL. Before college, we were told everything we had to do and when to do it, and now in college we are expected to figure everything out by ourselves with little to no guidance from the school. I guess I didn't get that memo and now I feel like I've wasted the past 3 years of my life just trying to get good grades :(

On top of that, I am currently a Canadian in the US under an H4 visa, which basically means I am a dependent of my parents and cannot work at all, not even on campus or do paid internships. I am also limited in opportunities because i have no transportation (i know that sounds like a really lame excuse, but it is a legitimate problem for me...) to do internships or opportunities somewhere else such as our university's main campus.

But does working even really matter for getting into a grad school? I've heard so much recently about how they look at the research you've done. But what does doing ""research"" even mean?? I am attending a smaller branch campus of a good non-ivy league university, and I have no idea if they even do research here. I've also looked into doing some independent studies such as ""directed readings"" with a faculty advisor and a senior thesis, but do those count as research experience?

Basically, I am wondering how important is research experience when applying to grad programs, and how much do they usually expect you to have done? What kind of stuff SHOULD I be doing right now at this point in my academic career? I feel so behind compared to all these other redditors in the same year of university as myself :/

Also, since the only ""job"" experience I can sort of do is volunteer work, do volunteer jobs that are not related to my degree (working at a hospital, helping the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter) even matter at all to grad programs or should I not even waste my time doing that stuff?

Okay, I probably sound like an unambitious wreck right now, but I would really appreciate any advice or information you guys can give me. thank you so much in advance!"

It is very difficult to find nuclear engineering internships  at this point in time and my GPA is about 2.65.   But I also go to a top 5 school, so I am not sure if that helps or not. 

I have no real experience.  I really just want to learn about engineering in general.  

I realize that I do not make the best candidate.  That is why I think it might be more valuable to just forget the money and do an internship at home by finding a small company through google. 


Nuclear and mechanical are very similar up until senior classes.  I have taken fluids, heat transfer, deformable bodies, thermo, , etc..



Would anybody have any advice on this matter, or suggestions?  Is my assumption wrong by thinking I have a much greater chance of an internship if I am willing to work for free?

I was just stumbling around, talking out of my ass, ... etc..

Then about 3 in the morning, this girl/woman (B) who is an intern there takes me for a walk-- we helped this REALLY drunk woman (A) back to her tent. We started hooking up in this girls (A) tent, and don't ask me why... it was kind of strange. The other girl (A) was passed out right there

We basically made out and felt each other up.  And i'm pretty sure the girl i was with was interacting sexually with the other girl, because i heard both of them moaning at one point. I think I remember having my head on this other girl (A)'s ass at one point, I don't know why.
  
So I got out of the tent early in the morning. The girl I hooked up with left because she was an intern. But the other girl (A) was still there.

The next week, I was hanging out before the performance, making some coffee, when the girl (A) started talking to me. She didn't know me! She was introducing herself and asking if I had ever been at [organization] before. I almost laughed, because I had spent a good part of the night hooking up in her tent, and at least some time with my head on her ass.

Now, I knew she was too drunk and had no intention to have any sexual activity with her.  But I have obsessive tendencies and now I'm guilt tripping over the incident, thinking that I might have had sex and blacked out.  I also freaked out because I think I may have touched her breast (but I'm not sure).  I definitely remember waking up with my  head on her posterior.  I feel guilt and paranoia from this incident.

Here's my situation in a nutshell:

* Computer Science major in College
* I have a regular source of income from scholarships
* I will graduate in December
* I have an internship for the summer making $20 an hour in the Computer Science field at a company I love. 

Here's the situation with my work:

* I work at the college newspaper
* I got great access to sporting events court/field side. 
* Got employment experience
* Picked up a few new skills along the way
* Make $20 per story, which can take anywhere from 2-5 hours. 


That's the basics. I've been thinking about quitting for around a month now, but it just got harder today. I half-assed an application to get a better job at the paper (one with more responsibility) and I got it. I had hoped I would be excited to get the job, or quit if I didn't. It turns out, I'm not excited about the new job (which would start in August) and now I have even more riding on me, which is just making this decision much harder. 

I would really like to use the extra time to focus on more programming projects and maybe even have some free time to decompress. Right now, I'm pretty much non-stop with projects, homework and work. 

I have no desire to do journalism beyond as a hobby later in life. 

Any advice would be great. Honestly, reading over this, I'm looking for people to kind of back me up on this. I doubt I'll change my mind. "

I've never had a job but since the age of 16 I've made money online (more than most students do but not as much as I would earn at a corporate job, it might work out the same if I was to work full time online). I've tried applying for internships, work placements at corporate companies but generally without much success. I've had a lot of interviews, networked a lot with companies but generally for one reason or another I didn't get the job. 

Personally I feel like I just want to continue making money online but I always have doubts in my mind. What if I can't make anymore money online? How will I get a job then? How will I provide for a family/kids if I don't know how much I am going to make every month or if it will be enough to provide for more than myself? How can I tell my parents I am going to leave university without a graduate job without much more than a plan of running my own business?

The whole problem is that all the students are looking for their graduate role and if I don't get one then maybe I'll miss my chance. Let's say 1 year after leaving uni my business doesn't take off as I'd like I can't just walk into a graduate job then. I think it would be cool to work for a large investment bank or similar company but then I'd also like the freedom to be able to travel the world while making money online...

So...

Fast forward a couple months, and I've gotten used to bringing my laptop home with me after work to do some work at home. One of my home PC's, for some reason, has chronic wireless issues (no matter how many adapters I try), so I set up a bridge on my work computer to allow my desktop to receive internet via ethernet cable connected to my work laptop. This works great! I fix the problem, and go to work the next day. As soon as I plug my computer into the dock, the phone DIES on the spot, and I have no network connectivity. I get Systems to come up to help, and they are just as confused as I am. They even bring 2 new phones up to my desk, just to have both of them die on the spot as soon as they were plugged in.

Keep in mind the bulk of the post is a question related to ""how do I go from where I am to where I want to be"".

I graduated from college in May 2012 with two degrees, one of which was an education degree. That pushed my down time between school and work another 6 months for student teaching which I just finished in December. Now I'm in a temp teaching position which fit perfectly with my timing (finishing everything in the middle of a school year leaves finding a 'job' pretty difficult... USUALLY).

I'm 2 months away from completing this position, and am starting to have to plan out what's next. So why is this post here?

I've been dabbling on my own with programming languages and such for a while, dating back to a year ago on and off, and picking it up again recently (last 4-6 months). I don't get as much time on the subject as I'd like, but I try to eek out a few things here and there. 

My ideal next step is something in the CS department. I'm stuck in the position of having a vague (because I'm not incredibly knowledgeable on the different areas of the field) idea of what I want, and not knowing at all how to get it so the question remains as follows:

What would be the logical next step?

If I try to shoot for a Master's degree, I have to hope that a school would take me without prior experience or knowledge except what I could attain on my own (which I understand is considerable). If I go with this option, I have to wait until a spring start up as fall start up application deadlines have already passed.

Alternatively, I've been looking at internships, but my hopes there are dying as the requirement for every. single. one. is someone who is still studying.

I'm just at a bit of a loss because it feels like I want to immerse myself in this field and dedicate to it and start building a future, but I can't really find a method to do that in the current time frame.

I'm not really looking for ""bro you don't need a degree"" type of answers, moreso what YOU would do as someone who is either on the other side (working in this field, etc.) or someone who has faced similar crossroads and found something that worked for you.

My apologies if this is incoherent! Forming words for what I'm feeling right now has been somewhat difficult.

The University of Texas gives me scholarship money, and its tuition is famously inexpensive, so my attendance there would not be much of a financial burden to my family. Also, I have been accepted to some extremely well-regarded honor programs there, one of which has a purpose statement of ""providing a computer science education second to none."" I absolutely love this university already—I've visited it monthly while it continues to grow on me—but it would be silly to not consider my other option seriously. After all, I've always wanted to get out of Texas.

Despite being way far away from Texas, Cornell is probably similar to the state school in academic opportunity. However, it has a reputation of rigorous classes and workloads, and that is something that excites and attracts me strongly. If money were not an issue, I would go for Cornell. However, tuition there is four times the amount at the University of Texas, and, since my parents are divorced, the financial aid office will certainly *add up* the incomes of both families, probably resulting in a calculation of very little financial aid.

I do not want my mother to pay a dime. Her family has to pay for my siblings there. My father can afford up to 30k annually, which is about half the cost of attendance. Perhaps, over the summer, I can earn money through internships, which might take away another 10,000. Would it be wise to try to resolve the rest of the yearly 30k (an amount that will probably inflate annually) through scholarships and, more importantly, through student loans?

Furthermore, are there any additional advantages to attending Cornell that might make the extra costs worth it?

Layla left the next day for New York. She was going to be an actor. She had an internship and everything. It payed nothing and she would have to work another job and live in some shit-hole motel, but that was fine with her. What was important was that she was going.

The drive from Normal, IL to New York was not a pleasant one. She had driven 7 consecutive hours, and after an hour rest, her sister drove another seven hours. Layla was dropped off at the cheapest motel in the least dangerous neighborhood they could find.

I never heard the conversation, but I'm sure it went something like this: 

Sister – ""Are you sure you'll be ok?""

Layla – ""Stop worrying! I'll call home every day!""

Sister – ""Mom will be worried sick.""

Layla – ""I'm 18. She can't control me anymore.""

Sister – ""Just be careful, okay?

I'm sure this was followed by a tearful goodbye as Layla's sister drove off into the night. I'm sure Layla doubted herself as she walked to the rundown motel. I am most definitely sure she was caught off guard by the kindly old man behind the counter of the motel. 

This conversation, I remember word for word.

""Looking for a place to spend the night?"" the cheery old man said, his blue eyes alight.

""A little more than a night, thank you,"" she replied, relieved to find such a slender old man in place of a fat, greedy crook. 

""Here's your key. Don't go in room 16,"" the old man said in a matter-of-fact way.

Layla was caught off guard. Her dream echoed in her mind, but her longing for sleep made her resist the urge to ask why. It was probably just a coincidence. Someone probably just wanted privacy, or the room was under repair, or that's where this psycho keeps the bodies.

She erased the last thought from her brain and went to her room, 19, and collapsed on the bed. She had no dreams of room 16.

The next days she spent looking for a part-time-job to pay for her palace. Her sister, I assume, was paying for the first few days.

She could not afford an apartment, but her laptop was a necessity. I cannot say that I don't sympathize.

She only left the motel for fast food. It was all she could afford. Her conversation with the old man was the same every time she walked back in the motel.

Old man – ""Nice day?""

Layla – ""Could be better.""

Old man – ""Well, have a good one.
                   
              Don't go in room 16.""

By the third day of only leaving her room for fast food, Layla found a job as a waitress. How stereotypical. The actress-waitress combo. She left for her first day and returned exhausted. Her conversations with the old man went as usual. 

Her internship started the next day and her exhaustion must have doubled or tripled. I'd like to imagine she began to give up hope, but knowing Layla, she probably thought it would all work out in the end. Always so hopeful and optimistic.

I'll take a guess and say that's when the dreams started. Every night was the same. It was the motel she was staying in. Every room was 16. Cold sweat and panic became her morning routine. 

She began to keep a diary to, in her words, "" to calm [her]self down."" I have absolutely no idea how reliving a chaotic and exhausting day calms someone down, but to each their own.

The conversations with the old man were the same now, and she had grown too accustomed to them by now to question about the infamous room 16. There were other occupants in the motel, and they all got the same treatment. She, however, was the only regular. No one, that she saw, ever entered or left room 16. 

That she saw.

She could hear the old man's voice in the dreams now. Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16. Over and over again until it drove her from fear to anger, in her dream-state. 

In her dream, she finally put her hand on the knob. It melted to her skin. It sucked her in, absorbing her body in agonizing increments as the old man's voice mockingly repeated, ""Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16."" 

She snapped.

""What's in there anyway?"" Layla questioned the kindly old man.

""Well..I–"" The old man's stutter indicated he clearly was not going to answer. 

She ran past him, straight to room 16. She was about to try the knob, but must have recalled something that resembled her manners and pounded loudly on the door. 

There was no answer.

""Get away from there!"" The old man was in a panic. He was not angry. I don't think he's capable of anger. 

Layla remembered herself. ""Sorry. I...I was just curious.""

""It's–It's all right,"" he said. ""Just take my word on it. There is nothing in there for you.""

Nothing. Nothing at all.

That night, she crept through the silent hallway of rooms to the number 16. The old man was asleep, at least she thought, and no one was there to stop her from opening that door. Her hand turned around 16 and she triumphantly discovered it was unlocked. The doorknob was cold. Cold and grey. It was the kind of unforgiving cold that only a winter day without snow could possess. It was a deep grey like the sky on those unforgivable winter days and no reflection of her face shown off it, as it did with the doorknob to her own room. It creaked impossibly loud as she turned it. She opened the door. She was speechless. What was held inside room 16 was not possible. It was unbelievable. She saw–

She saw–

Well, I don't know that yet. That last paragraph, that's just how I imagine it happening. My name is– Well, I don't think you need to know that. I'm just a story to you. But I'm real. I type this because I am excited to find out what I will become. The kind of excited where you cannot keep your glee in and must share it. The kind that makes you giddy with anticipation. 

But I am patient. Paying the old man to tell no one of my existence in room 16 was easy. He added the ""[d]on't go in room 16"" thing himself. I thought it was stupid at first, but it's grown on me. I like the old man. He's kind, compliant, and most importantly, he doesn't ask questions. 

It didn't have to be the actor/waitress three doors down. It could have been anyone. But she was the only regular in the shit-hole. I've never laid eyes on her, but I'm sure she's beautiful. Her diary was a great read. 

She'll decide what I become, within reason, I've decided. If she writes that I'm a serial killer, I'm a serial killer. If she says I'm a kindly young man with a handsome face and a tragic past, I'll be that. If I'm empty, I'll pack up and leave. The gamble is such fun. Her stories of what I am get more fantastic and horrible with each new entry into the little black diary of hers. I will not disappoint her.

I am insane. I know that. But sanity is not only relative, but also overrated. And I am more than just insane.

I am room 16. 

She will open me soon."

1b9xiu,1,2013-03-29,"Can't decide if I want to go to the US, Asia or mainland Europe in August. Longish details inside.",Kalivha,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1b9xiu/cant_decide_if_i_want_to_go_to_the_us_asia_or/,"Okay, so I've got a budget that allows for one of the three options. Each has different implications. And yeah, I know, first world problem.

First off, I'm an undergrad student of computational chemistry in the UK. I feel like my course is a bit light on the computational part in some respects as I eventually want to go into software development for chemistry applications. To further that goal, I have an internship lined up for June/July doing just that, but it doesn't include implementing new code, developing algorithms, learning CUDA programming or working in a functional language (all of which I want to improve upon and can't as part of my regular degree). 

**US**  
I'd be attempting some professional networking in California, possibly going to Burning Man or alternatively just taking the train up the West Coast. I've never been west of Pensacola, so it's a totally new thing travel-wise, but the career benefits are very very uncertain.

**Asia**  
I'd be going to Pakistan to visit some temples and interesting remote areas and see some friends again, then go to Bangladesh to meet the parts of my husband's family who live there. My professional network in both countries is close to perfect, however neither is the ideal place to do what I want to do. I'd also be able to stock up on tobacco in Dubai and save some money through that, which would be kinda nice.

**Europe**
I found [this course](http://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/index.php?type=courses&amp;code=H9) in the Netherlands which would cover a lot of what I really want to learn, but it'd mean that I'm not leaving Europe this year at all and I fear that it'll be harder to do that after undergrad. I will e-mail the person running the course to get more details soon unless it's really not a good idea to begin with. Plus, the guy's name is Dijkstra. Heh.

***
Edit: I've also found a relevant course at Oxford that wouldn't clash with this one so this might actually be a better option than either of the others professionally.
***

So yeah, this is the first time I'm forced to make a choice between three options that are all really amazing with no one to steer me in one direction enough to make the choice for me in sight. I'd love some input. I also wanted to write this down in a somewhat structured way, I guess.

1bdw19,114,2013-03-31,"I just wanted to say thank you, r/learnprogramming",itsalwayslulzy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1bdw19/i_just_wanted_to_say_thank_you_rlearnprogramming/,"Thank you to this entire great community and all the help it has given me over the past year. Everything from picking a language, to feeling out the fundamentals of programming, to answering my dumb questions about object oriented design, why my code isn't running, etc. Everyone has been super helpful and understanding of myself and many other newbies who want to learn the art of programming.

A year ago, I knew the basics of HTML and nothing else. I was pretty decent with computers, but never pursued it further than learning how to do basic OS tweaks and playing video games. I was a Finance major, and I hated what I was doing. I really dreaded getting a full time job in Finance, and didn't get along with other people in my major. I just wasn't into it, but I didn't know where else to turn. It wasn't until I found r/learnprogramming that I realized working with computers could be a viable career, and programming was actually something I could someday be decent at.

Now, I'm finally getting decent with Java, I've dabbled in C (with the CS50 class), and I've explored some other languages. I've made a few simple websites, and I'm in the process of developing an app for Android. I changed my major officially to Computer Science BS last semester, and I have an internship next summer as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company.

And finally, with exception of class projects and small practice exercises I've done, I'm happy to say that I've shipped my first piece of software. It's a Chrome extension called Simple Blocker:

http://simpleblocker.com/

As the name suggests, it is a simple website blocker that lets you block any number of sites to help you concentrate. It has a sleep timer, as well as additional ""enhanced blocking"" features which make it difficult to turn on, if you have trouble with self control. The app is free, but in the future I may provide a Bitcoin address or something for donations ;) But I really just wanted to create it to learn JavaScript and mess around with the Chrome API rather than make money.

I don't want to rant on for too long, I really just wanted to say THANK YOU! And also wanted to get some quality feedback on my new app!

**TL;DR: Was a miserable Finance major a year ago, the closest I came to coding back then was using Excel. Now, I'm a CS major and have an internship lined up next summer. Thank you guys for your help :)**"

So I'm currently a sophomore Mechanical Engineer and computer science minor here at GT. I'm cooping for my first rotation right now, after which I'll be studying abroad this summer and then co-oping again this fall.

When I finally come back to Georgia tech next spring, I'd like to find some way of making some money. I swim a lot, so I thought lifeguarding at the CRC may be a good idea. However the pay is a lot less than what I make as a coop, and it doesn't look like I'd be able to start working until mid-March (when the CRC actually starts hiring new life guards)

Another idea I had was to look around for a local internship that I could work part time while taking classes. I'd prefer something close to campus (within reasonable distance) because I don't have a car with me on campus. It'd be awesome if i could even find something that let me work over the internet.

My final idea was to look for paid research positions, or even at GTRI, but I wasn't sure how feasible it would be for me to find a position without any prior research experience.

 Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas? Thanks in advance!"

I've assumed a few open source projects, and I'm the  leader of the programming group on my school's FIRST Robotics team. I've also gotten a 5 on the College Board's AP Computer Science Exam. CS is definitely the path for me.

I'm just not sure how I should spend my time and where to go... Those areas have always been very much a blur.

I definitely want to pursue college; one part for the education, and the other to expose myself to likeminded individuals. I plan on pursuing an internship at a local BAE Systems this summer as well. Up until I graduate I'm trying to learn more languages and principles to sort of round me out, as well as pursue new projects.

My grades in school aren't that spectacular, but I'm trying to boost them up as well as do good on my SATs.

What are some things that I should do to better pave my path towards a CS career? A lot of people have told me to go out and apply myself which I've been doing to a relatively good extent, but it's hard given the fact that few of my peers share any interest towards this, and I'm really lucky to get any exposure at all at my age.

I'm sure I'll figure something out, most people tend to, but really if you've been in my shoes or have any advice as to how I should best utilize the remaining 1.5 years of high school that I have left, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Really just anything to give me a nice sense of perspective would be nice :)

Thanks.

Sorry for the wall of text! Oh, and throwaway since I don't really want this semi-anonymous biographical info linked to my main account.


I know this is something that you guys see a lot, since this seems to be the GOTO (lulz) place for those looking to get into a more computer-science based field, but I have a couple questions, and perhaps you can advise me based on my personal situation.


So, first off a little about myself, and what skills and resources I have at my disposal. I am a graduate of a mechanical engineering program with a math minor, and interest in art (couple fun classes added in, and do it as a side hobby). However, when I was in school, my junior year I took a class on programming in C++.

IT.

WAS. 

AWESOME.

Obviously, I loved it, but I felt committed to sticking to a 4-year degree and actually graduating on time and just enjoying the fun class. So I did very little extra programming during my senior year beyond a database class that was ok.


Still, as I'm wrapping up a year-long Co-op (extended, paid engineering internship) in industry, I am fairly certain that I want to transition to something that is more computer science-based.


tl;dr? Engineering Degree, Math minor, art hobby, novice C++ Experience

And with that, what are my options? I have thought about looking for companies with tuition assistance and finding a master's program that I could use to specialize into a more computational/simulation type of engineering. My family is recently moved to the west coast, which as far as I can tell is a good thing if I want to follow them out there. However, as far as looking for stuff locally/getting my face in front of people, I am located in TN.


Also, are there graduate programs that cater to those who are not comp-sci majors and gives them the tools to apply programming to their respective fields?"

As a computer games programming student in UK, I landed a internship that isn't quite related to games. The industry out there is tough and it's 10 times tougher if you are a student looking for a placement. 

Some of my colleagues that also landed placements in software development roles think that they might fall in love with it and basically switch to that, instead of games. Is this the maturation process people in their 20's go through when they realize they want to do something 'serious' in life, and not games? I for one can't imagine myself doing something else **other** than games, even if I will probably enjoy my placement anyway. 


My question is, how do placements that are somewhat different from what you want to do in life change and help you? I for one know that my internship will push my programming skills to the limit and also drag me through all the algorithms and methods I usually hate. It helps that the lemons I'm speaking of represent Microsoft, but I can't help but feel jealous of those that get a placement in a game company.
