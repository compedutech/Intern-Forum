**Letters of Recommendation**

not about to rate my LORs bc i have not read them and that would be disingenuous imo

**Calc BC teacher**: Did well in her class, she's known me since I was in elementary school and she was our advisor when we were taking Calc 3(the class was asynchronous)

**Physical Science teacher:** did well in his class, participated a lot, he's pretty cool

**Junior year English teacher(submitted to MIT as humanities LOR):** turned on camera bc I was virtual, she left a lot of good and constructive comments on my essays, learned a lot in her class

**Interviews**

MIT: Was kinda rough at the beginning, talked about my activities and what I wanted to do outside class at MIT. I was pretty unprepared, but the interview became much more conversational when he asked me what I did for fun. Turns out this postdoc student actually plays tons of video games in his free time, so we talked about Pokemon and roguelites for 40 minutes, was solid.

**Essays**

My personal statement was pretty mid in hindsight, I wrote about learning percussion and auditioning into my school's ensemble despite having no experience(I played violin in middle school). My writing wasn't insanely good, but I think it was decent.

Most of my supplements were similarly decent, I tried to keep my Why School essays unique and non-formulaic. Some of my MIT essays, however, were pretty bad in hindsight. I learned from them for my RD essays though so I don't mind it too much.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

**Rolling:**

* Missouri S&amp;T - admitted w 10k scholarship
* UT Dallas - admitted

**EA:**

* MIT - deferred
* university I intern at - admitted w 25k scholarship
* Purdue - admitted to FYE + honors college
* Northeastern - deferred
* Georgia Tech - admitted! was pretty stressed before opening the decision but i'm super hyped, will def attend if i don't get into MIT/CMU/Stanford, which is highly likely

Waiting on:

* WashU
* Vandy
* Northwestern
* MIT
* CMU
* Brown
* Stanford
* UIUC
* USC

My decisions have recently shown me that this may not happen. I applied CS for all, and am a white male from the bay area with a 1470 sat and 4.4 gpa. My extracurriculars are decent: captain of tennis team, co-founder of a club and leader of two clubs, 200+ hours of community service, Founder of a Business over the summer, software engineering internship (found out about this senior year so sending it to deferred colleges and some regular decisions), and some other irrelevant EC's like member of club, etc. My essays were decent and wrote a lot about learning how to code/invest and how I will combine these passions in college. 

I was rejected from: CMU ED2, Duke ED1, UT-Austin 

I was deferred from: Michigan, Purdue

and I was accepted CU Boulder but rejected from their engineering program

The CU boulder decision really made me lose hope. Do I have any chance at Michigan, Purdue, Maryland, Wisconsin, GT, UW, illinois, Berkeley, USC, or UCLA for their computer science programs?"

I’ve been tutoring since I was in 8th grade, and I’ve got a lot of experience in helping people *understand* material, especially when it comes to math. Examples of things I can teach:


Math: 

- Anything taught in high school
- Calculus 1, 2, 3
- Abstract Algebra
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics (e.g., AP Stats-type curriculum)

Physics:
- Mostly, anything you’d learn in high school up to and including AP Physics C. College physics education can vary so if you need help with a college physics class, send the syllabus first so I can make sure that I know all the material.

Computer Science:

- Java
- Python, including machine learning w/ TensorFlow
- Matlab (for engineering students probably)

SAT/ACT: Well, there’s not much to say here aside from the fact that I got a 1590 on the SAT and a 36 on the ACT. I can explain my process of thinking behind the questions.

Resume Building: Please contact me first. This mostly applies to people looking to find a CS-related job - I’ve gotten software engineering internship offers from Amazon, Meta, and Snapchat. I can help you build a pretty-looking resume in LaTeX.

Pricing:

- Video/voice call: $40/hr. Payment through Venmo or cryptocurrency (ask first). If you happen to live in Providence, RI, we can meet in-person too.

- Over text/messages: First of all, I’m only willing to communicate through text messages/iMessage/Signal. I will not download Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. Pricing is flexible, it’ll depend on how much work I have to do. Essentially what this service entails is, I will be your buddy that you can ask questions to whenever and I’ll respond with an explanation. Depending on how much time I need to spend, it’ll cost more or less, but it’ll be based on the same $40/hour rate as above.


Let me know if you’re interested!! I’m excited to work with you all!"

I’ve always considered myself someone who likes to work in corporate, as I worked most of my college years in different internships and enjoyed them all.

The problem is that I really don’t like my new job because the culture is toxic. My boss is a micromanager who’s never satisfied with my work or even my emails, I’m working after hours almost every day (even sometimes weekends) and the tolerance for my learning curve is really low (since I’m slow or making silly mistakes), my boss always gets stressed because I can’t keep up like my teammate who has been there for years and even one coworker mentioned that she has cried many times because of stress at this job

I can feel my mental health getting worse as the time passes, since the work load is huge and I can barely finish my tasks on time without working over time, adding that to my manager who gets annoyed by me every time, and I just been here one month!. I’ve always prioritized my mental health and I don’t know how much I can keep up with it, I think If it was up to me, I would have already quitted, but I know it could look bad on my resume and I don’t really want to disappoint my family

Any advice? Should I start looking for another job or should I put up with it for a few months?"

I’ve been working for a well known hospital as an IT Tech but I mostly handle providing and locating licenses for users of the hospital. Before that I was an IT intern at a Charter School fixing computers and assisting events. 

Currently, I am getting paid $20 per hour in NYC. This is an ok salary for me an I can get by with it since I am still living at home with my parents. I would really like to make myself more profitable as I would like to earn more to retire well off. 

I am looking into getting a Master’s degree in either Data Analytics, Cyber Security or Localization Management (specifically the Translation and Localization Management Masters program at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Montery). But since I have very little programming knowledge I am not sure what languages or routes I should take. This is why I’m asking for some assistance from ppl in any of the three fields:

-What languages should I learn before I apply to a Masters program?
-What university do you/don’t you recommend for said program and why? What did you/didn’t you like about attending that university?
-Where do you work and what do you/don’t you like about it?

These are just some basic questions but tbh I am thinking of doing Data Analytics first and then moving onto Cyber Security bc they seem to be interconnected. Would that make me less desirable bc I would be over qualified?

Like I said any help would be greatly appreciated since I feel I haven’t actually worked in the Computer Science field and I don’t have a mentor to work with.

We focus on the visual computations performed by the mouse lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to study some of the questions at the core of neuroscience (more info on lab website listed below) . 

Techniques you will be able to learn, depending on your interest: viral injections, deep-brain craniotomies, and two-photon calcium imaging, all in vivo, in addition to learning how to analyze this complex data--not just sectioning and staining experience here. Any scientific background and experience level welcome, but a big bonus would be your willing to do intensive experiments in mice. And because that takes a long time to train, you should commit to at least one year and be on-site due to the experimental nature of the work (a pure data analysis position could be shorter). Flexible starting date. 

Part of the reason for needing at least one year is that I want to strongly help every person that passes my lab to obtain their career goals, which includes coaching on how to communicate your work and long-term career planning. This takes time. We are a small lab, so I am able to give feedback and coaching to a greater degree than larger labs. For instance, in addition to regular 1:1 meetings, I am available via whatsapp to all my lab members for time-sensitive input.

I received a embedded engineering intern offer from Nvidia for summer 2022. The work I'll be doing is in c++, python and computer vision similar to what swe's do.

I am all for building skills outside of school/work, but I don't understand how people can have other hobbies in that kind of environment. After I get through work and finish up my school work (which does involve a good load of CS courses as it's my major) for the day, eat, shower, exercise, etc, I have maybe an hour--or two on weekends and slow days--of free time. Honestly its exhausting to be expected to spend that time ""honing my skills"" every day. Don't get me wrong, I love programming, it's one of my many hobbies, and its the reason I want to get into this career. I want to gain those skills that will land me a great future. But, I have other interests outside of this and feel the competition and pressure to fill these expectations is a bit rough.

Are there people who *don't* sacrifice all there time to pursue this career and I am just being overly-critical? Or is it really necessary in order to keep up with competition and I am just whining?


**Edit:** I have recieved a lot of helpful comments from all of you, so thank you! Came to realize there are less 'Live to work for FAANG paychecks' subcultures than it is made to seem on this sub and elsewhere. And although they exist, they aren't realistically your competition unless that lifestyle lines up with your aspirations (which is true for some, but most aren't shooting for the top 1%). 

Also want to clarify I realize now this is probably a super common question on this sub, apologies for that, but I also think this is a pretty real concern for newcomers that should be addressed. So, thanks again for those that are sharing your experiences! I am sure it helps guide both me and other students/new-grads."

The internship is a great opportunity and it places me into what I want to be doing after school. However, I have to quit my current job and will need to get another job after the internship. Currently I work at a Big 10 school's hospital doing Desktop Support. Should I look at getting another Desktop Support role, possibly a remote IT Support role, or would the internship help me land an entry level security role? I would appreciate any objective advice.

Edited for clarity: I have already accepted the internship and yes it is paid (it is the same amount I am making now just without benefits). The question comes down to my senior year. After the internship ends and IF an offer is extended I would have a year until I start. I don't have the luxury to not work. With the internship experience and 2 plus years in IT desktop support would it be possible to get a entry SOC role or should I just look at IT Support roles?"

So let me explain the situation a bit.

I had offers from 2 healthcare organisations basically where I would be given a job of an Executive, I am currently in the final year of my masters and we have a final internship coming up after which we hope the company we are working for absorbs us.i'll explain the offers one by one.

1st - A small establishment 50-100 bed size, good staff, polite, they gave an offer of working as a management trainee for 3-6 months with pay of around 300 USD/Month and job afterwards based on my performance which for sure I would have got and the salary would be better than this, not sure how much more since they didn't give any job description.

2nd - A JCI accredited establishment with 1000 beds, good repo with the chief officer under whom I would be working, I had unofficial talks with him in which he said he'll be able to help me get an executive position with a pay of around 335 USD after a 3 month unpaid internship, this is one of the top hospitals in my country and working here will strengthen my resume, or so I assume. i have done my 1st Internship from here and I learned a lot 

So I had a final interview with the 1st offer establishment and I told them that i'll have to decline their offer for now.
So basically I am losing out on pay for 3 months which I would have got in the 1st offer internship and maybe a better paying job, not sure about that, and in return i'll be getting a better brand of hospital, a chance to learn about JCI.

So did I make a good choice or was this stupidity at my part? Please ask if you need more info, might have left out some parts

When I found a full time job, I tried to find something that is a bit remote friendly so I don’t lose my FTJ in case we go into lockdown again. My APs took advantage of that and as soon as I graduated they kept me at home and didn’t let me move out.

My mental health has become so bad that it’s starting to affect my performance at work too. I’m doing fine at work but some days are so bad. I can’t even find a therapist because I talked about my mental health ONCE while I was at home and it backfired immediately.

So I'm a serial job hopper - been working IT for over 5 years, worked IT at at least 9 different companies (honestly stopped keeping track), started at an unpaid internship, and worked my way up to 100k as a result of busting my ass, labbing, getting certified (I know I know, but the HR folks love that paper), and - of course - job hopping, with each hop being at least a fair or substantial pay bump

The why is simple: I got hardcore shafted by the first 2 companies I worked at (calous layoffs due to financial reasons), so I'm forever a fuck corporate, get paid employee

As is in my nature: I just interviewed for a position at $120k with a company staffing 10 IT professionals and 500 end users, and all 10 of the professionals (went through 3 rounds of interviews) had been with this company for longer than I've been in the profession

Eventually I was turned down for the position, and as is often the case, I was not told why I was turned down. However, I have no doubt that my varied work history was the biggest factor because each round of interviews, the staff would bring up at least twice that my work history was a ""red flag""

Now here's the rub, and hence my question: over the course of all my jobs, I'd say that about 90% of the co-workers who were there for 5+ years were also the least technical, and the people I'd be least likely to respect as IT professionals. Reasons were probably varied, but to me it seemed they were simply comfortable in their jobs and had no desire to learn new technologies (though the other 10% were impressive in both their commitment to the profession and their companies, to be sure)

So again my question: who do you judge?

* Do you judge IT pros with long tenure? Do they come across as comfortable and unimpressive?
* Or do you judge people like me, the job hoppers? Do we come across a unloyal?

I'm curious r/sysadmin, what side of the aisle do you fall on and why?"

I knew it would happened eventually, as I have started to go in dates with other guys, and it perfectly makes sense for him to go back into dating. Idk how to feel, he treated me absolutely horribly and was verbally abusive and now I hear he’s treating his new girl amazing. I guess he might start to treat her bad too at some point as he did to me, but for now it’s just hard to process. It’s also hard because both of my ex’s have found girlfriends so fast and I feel behind. I haven’t found anyone I remotely like and have super high standards, but it’s still hard.

I'm currently studying in my last year of a master's degree in AI (Canada) and part of that masters for me is a long co-op internship that should last about 8 months (2 sessions) . I am currently in the processus of choosing/contacting companies within a listing of internships and i thought i could use some advice from the more experienced folks here.

As i'm going to work in one of them for quite some time , i would really have liked some advice about the green/red flags when it comes to the field of AI/Machine Learning to not end in a company that will make me miserable. I would ideally like to grow up to specialize more in Computer vision and image related applications over time but i'm open to other things if it's interesting.

This list of internships doesn't include FAANG (sorry i'm not there yet lmao) though there are a few bigger names inside like Olympus or Bentley Systems but i wonder if just the mention of these names will profit my curriculum as they are no Apple or Microsoft obviously but there are still quite a few interesting subjects. Money is not a problem here as any of these internships will pay me the exact same amount over the 8 months.

What should I prioritize to maximize my future growth? Notoriety of the company? Technologies/subfields? Should i avoid certain applications like insurance or does it not matter? How hard will this choice cap me for future job interviews (I will graduate after this internship and will have to start looking for my first real job) ?

These are a few questions from the top of my head but feel free to add some more if you feel i should think about it.

I had a terrible interview experience with a well known company around an year ago - they were basically going to recruit interns through this hackathon for which I'd worked really hard. But I hadn't realised that I needed to focus on soft skills and I also wasn't aware that they would be ""interacting"" with us during the hack. In my case, this turned out to be an employee from that company asking questions that seemed like an interview(the classic ""tell me something about yourself"", some programming and algorithmic questions, etc). 5 minutes into the conversation, I panicked and realized this was an interview. Mind you, it was the middle of the night and I was already tired after working with my team for around 8 hours.

I ended up not answering any of the questions they asked me. I luckily had my webcam off, otherwise they would have seen me crying. I couldn't speak for a whole minute, and I had to cover up by saying I had network issues. Needless to say, I did not get the role and neither did my team did not qualify the first round of the contest.

Cut to January 2022, I don't have a single internship. I don't think I have the guts to face an interview ever again. I am average student with a good CGPA, but not the best at data structures. I already had this fear of the subject but i do know that it's really important for interviews. I'm making progress, slowly but surely, through this data structures course I've taken up. I do understand concepts and theories, but I'm not the biggest fan of leetcoding. I'm still exploring what I like and dislike about computer science, and I don't want to be rushed. But extreme peer pressure has gotten to me and the fear is making me lose motivation. Any advice is welcome. Thank you for listening to my rant."

Here is the 109th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

I worked as a customer service agent for the past few years, and I don't want to pursue that career path! I graduated with a BA in Sociology, and I want now to advance my skill and get a master degree once I land a decent job but not a customer service agent AGAIN :( 

I relocated to eastern Europe ( Georgia) for an internship in Data Analysis, which is not a paid internship, and I tried to apply to several jobs, mainly they required knowing Russian or the local language, the only available job for me is Customer support :( (this is a nightmare for me )

I started to learn Data Analysis from Data Camp and watched Tutorials online. Still afraid that I lost my passion for being a data analyst, I started learning Python from DataCamp courses, and I have a problem understanding from the courses! So.

Lately, I have become concerned that maybe it's not the right thing for me? Should I try learning from other online resources or choose another course to study, such as front-end or full-stack engineering?

I am still passionate about learning and becoming skillful in Tech!!. Did anyone of you have a similar problem? Maybe start learning from Udacity, Data Science, or get a Nano degree, or should I quit?

&amp;#x200B;

I will appreciate your advice or suggestions."

Hi,

I'm a senior CS student and graduating by the end of this year. I never did intern because I had some circumstances that prevented me + I was planning to do a Ph.D, but now I changed my mind and I would like to get a job in embedded systems when I graduate.

I spent the last two years learning about AI ( deep learning) (although I didn't like it that much, but I did it anyway because I thought AI will have a lot of impact on humanity future) most of what I learned was a theory so I don't have much code to show in my Github profile. My view has changed and from what I see any field can have an impact on humanity. I stopped learning about AI and became interested in Embedded systems. I learning about embedded systems right now and Planning to finish multiple projects from Udemy, edx courses. 

My GPA is 3.0 (because I didn't care about my classes that much and spent most of my time learning about AI).

How can I get a job in embedded system software engineering without an intern and with 3.0 GPA?

Is it too late to apply for a summer internship?

Will the recruiters interview me (and ask me why I didn't do intern) or they will reject my application without even asking me why I didn't do intern?"

So I had been doing an internship in a the public services sector (specifically healthcare) for 5 months and thought that the project I was staffed on was really good for me based on my past studies (Pre-med) and international healthcare masters degree. I was offered a full time position and started 2 days ago. 

However, before I started the full time position, another consultant called me and asked if I would be interested in another project, because there was an urgent staffing need. We had a call, and we determined that I would not be a good fit because I did not have any project management experience. She said I would not be a good fit, I said I would not be a good fit. Then, about 2 weeks later, she called and said that it turns out I am a good fit which made me very suspicious. I talked to my team about this and they said that the project is horrible and also the consultant that called me is a bit crazy. The project is also in the public sector, but not in health, and I am not at all interested in it. I also do not have the experience needed to succeed it sounds like. 

Long story short, I have to do a client interview tomorrow and tried my best to get out of it before this, but I need to go ahead with it. I know the client would like to have someone who also has data analysis + project management experience and has been in consulting for a long time. I have a little but am not interested in the work they are doing, have no project management experience, and am not interested in the project. It sounds like it would be a horrible fit for both me and the client, but it would fulfil the staffing needs. 

The consultant who called me will also be in the client interview along with 3 of the clients. I plan on just being honest and saying I don't the experiences they are seeking, and am very interested in health. Sort of repeating my interests over and over again and making it clear that it doesn't align without outright saying I am not interested. Is there any other way to go about this? 

I don't want to make my company look bad, but also don't want to get hired onto this project. I feel like I am being set up for failure with this project though. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any help would be appreciated."

I am fortunate enough to have received a 10-week summer internship offer from Moody's Analytics in one of their APAC offices. I will likely be working on different software projects for clients. I have done three internships in the past that are all computer programming heavy: first at a no-name start-up, then on a sales desk in a major investment bank, and most recently was a risk developer at a major pension, all in my home country.

My dream positions are software dev at HFT, HF, as well as quantitative factor investing in big pensions. But given that I am a mediocre student and have not had much success in getting offers from my dream positions, I think I should be happy with what I have. I could not find much information online, so please let me know if you think this is a good career move (and likely one I will try to convert into full-time)!

Also, note I will be having a final-round interview for a developer position at a medium-sized investment bank this week, but I'm not sure if they can make a hiring decision before my current offer expires (I can certainly try to delay it to the future if anything).

In total, I've been coding for 5 years now. This includes a college degree, a 1 year full time in-person higher certificate/traineeship, and umpteen Udemy courses. I am nowhere near close to getting a job.

5 years ago, I bought my first Udemy course. I can't remember which exactly, but it might have been Colt Steele's bootcamp course at the time, or similar. Everyone seemed to be pushing web dev at the time, so that's what I did as a complete beginner not knowing any better.

Having done about half of the Udemy course (and not really liking it - more on that later), I got accepted into a full time online degree in digital technology and design, which was being ran through one of the country's top colleges. This was a ""change career to tech"" type course funded in full by the government, and had the prerequisite of requiring at least a level 6 QQI qualification ( Associates degree in the US), and the degree was a level 7 ordinary degree. I already had a level 6 qualification in video &amp; TV production before applying, and was granted a place on the degree programme as a result.

The degree offered 4 possible specialisations - programming, UI/UX/graphic design, digital marketing, or project management. I chose the UI/UX/graphic design specialisation as it appealed to me due to my existing strengths and experience in video post production, and mixing it with web development. It sounded great!

I flew through the degree, became the top student in the class and achieved top grades without barely breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, the curriculum was pretty terrible, and felt more akin to a level 5 than a level 7. The design aspects basically just consisted of the absolute BASICS of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and some pretty basic web design principles. We also had web development modules which were a complete joke. Basic HTML and CSS, some Bootstrap, and LITERALLY 30 minutes of JavaScript lectures! Our final project was a team project which paired us with a real world industry partner where we created developed and designed the frontend for a video streaming mobile app. Unfortunately, the industry partner, who were developing their own backend, had issues with it and the final app never got finished. This was out of our control and we achieved excellent grades nonetheless. I graduated with a distinction.

Having realised I was nowhere near qualified due to the poor degree curriculum, I spent the next year and a half attempting more Udemy courses, dropping halfway through most. I was starting to become much more familiar with programming in general by now, and explored other types of programming outside of web dev - game dev, mobile dev, and desktop applications. I soon realised that I never enjoyed web dev since the very start, and grew to much prefer the others, largely due to the disorganised ecosystem of it and having decision anxiety (e.g. which framework should I use, CSS or SASS, CSS framework or not, etc etc etc.) I even used to say to myself **anything** but web dev! However, I realised that I was not going to be able to learn this solo, and so I applied and got accepted onto a full time in-person software development traineeship.

I was delighted! Finally I would actually be able to learn this stuff properly in a proper organized environment. They even taught my favourite language at the time - C#! This course consisted of first learning Java, and then we moved onto C#, SQL, project management, and some other minor modules. We also did 2 of the MTA exams - OPERATING SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS and DATABASE FUNDAMENTALS as part of it.

Similar to my degree programme, I became the top student in the class and achieved top grades. Unfortunately, I realised about halfway through that the course was 20+ years out of date. Our final project was pretty much a Windows 95-style Windows Forms application that connected to an SQL database. Nowhere near the standard of what's required nowadays to get an entry level role.

I also completed an internship as part of the course which gave me excellent feedback, and even told me that I was the fastest learning intern they ever had. (VueJS, Laravel, MySQL tech stack, all of which I had no experience with before starting with them, but VueJS was on my radar of interest at the time.)

I finished that course 2 years ago, and have been fumbling around with Udemy ever since in all sorts of frameworks and languages - Flutter (my overall favourite by far but has few jobs and high competitions for any that are available, Vue, React, Svelte, Python, Golang, React, Svelte (my favourite frontend framework but again has few jobs), native Android development, Unity, Godot, .NET, NodeJS, + more. Some with more success than others.

I keep ending up back in web dev even though I just don't like it. Mostly because all of these 1-stop-shop bootcamp-style courses are all web-focused, and I don't want to be jumping around doing all sorts of courses when all I want is to do one bootcamp (length isn't really an issue but is becoming more of an issue as time goes on).

On top of all the above, I have been working on a startup software business for the past 3 and a half years, raking up thousands of hours of work in the process. I started this with a non-techy business partner whom I dismissed from the project a few months ago due to severe lack of effort on his part. I have ended up with the whole project in my own hands and have ended up doing absolutely everything - technology, design, market research, business plan, pitching, project/product management, etc etc etc. I learned most of this as I went along, and have taken it as far as I can without funding and/or a new co-founder.

I managed to fumble together a tech demo of the software about a year ago with some outside help here and there on the coding aspects, but since realised that the whole thing, front and back end, needs to be coded again from scratch for technical reasons I won't get into. I have done much research on how to achieve the new version and have done many tests, but lack the ability to complete it as it is somewhat of a niche area. I do see my long-term future with the project, should it continue, as head of product and design.

About a month ago, after multiple rounds of applications and interviews, I was accepted onto a prestigious 6 month, full time entrepreneurship development programme, which I am currently attending. The purpose of this is to prime high potential very early stage startups for funding through grants and investment. I have a potentially extremely valuable, revolutionary product on my hands but I have no idea what to do next. I do require a new co-founder to help me develop the new MVP, and I am kind of stuck until then as I cannot progress it further on my own. I have no way of meeting or finding a new suitable co-founder. Reddit etc. is out of the question (been there, done that). But I do hope to see out the 6 months of the programme nonetheless. If, at the end of the programme, I have not made any significant progress, I will have to shelve the project and move on - leaving countless hours of work in the process with little or nothing to show for it outside of designs, mockups, business documents (business model canvas, market research, umpteen notes, etc.), and the current semi-functioning tech demo of the software.

My main question is...what the hell should I do?

I apologise if this post didn't make much sense or comes across as rambly. My head is all over the place right now. Any advice is much appreciated."

Very new to this sub but I am currently very anxious about the job hunt that I am currently on and I am not sure where to turn for advice. This is going to be a long winded post so if you are so inclined to get through it and offer ideas, that would be greatly appreciated.

I am set to graduate in the July of this year with a MSA (masters of science of analytics). That is great but my work history is very limited. Essentially over the last 2 years all I have are two internships unrelated to my field. A 3 month marketing internship and a 6 month project management internship as well. I also have some undergraduate tutoring experience. There are many gaps in my resume and I am currently a full time student. 

As far as my skills go, I am very competent in applied statistics using both Python and R with a bit of SQL knowledge to back that up(fluent in excel). I have some experience in ML and have a github profile with a few of my school projects up on there (projects I have gotten As on and I've reviewed a ton to ensure they look pretty). In my free time I have created a algorithmic trading bot, essentially just a bot that trades on momentum, by no means some get rich quick play. Socially I am very good (this may not be too believable but it is the truth) and if I can land a decent amount of interviews I am sure I can get a job... but I've applied to dozens of postings (currently 56, I track them in excel) and haven't got a single call. I am worried my overall lack of relevant experience is holding me back from getting the attention the an employer. I notice many appealing jobs note that 1+ years of relevant experience is needed, I apply anyway but so far to no avail. 

The types of jobs I am interested in relate to using my newfound skills in R &amp; Python in the workplace. My intuition says that should be a slam dunk as I believe the field of big data (data science/engineering/analytics) is a growing and in demand field. I know my coding skills can be valuable to an employer as I solve very complex problems in school on a regular basis.

My biggest worry is that I will have to take on a job where I will not get to apply any coding skills. And keeping up with my software skills while not having a relevant job or schoolwork will make me feel like grad school was just  waste. 

Anyway, I am not sure if this information is helpful in any way or nothing more than a rant. I am stressed but I know once I land a decent associate/junior position in data analysis field I will be fine moving forward.... I am just not sure that is possible."
sic2jq,43,2022-02-01,I had my first technical interview and I thought I bombed it,sydthecoderkid,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sic2jq/i_had_my_first_technical_interview_and_i_thought/,"So to preface, I started writing this post with the title ""I had my first technical interview and I completely bombed it"" Then halfway through writing I decided to take my mind off things and go to dinner. Then while I was at dinner, I found out I had made it to the next round. So if you want to hear a depressing story of a not-so-great interview with a happy ending, read on :)  

Long story short, I'm a freshman and I've been applying to freshman summer internship programs. I got a few interviews and today was my first round interview with a company. I did around forty Leetcode questions(mostly easy) to prepare, and was feeling pretty confident. My interviewer was nice- a bit socially awkward, but we bonded over my personal projects and my jokes landed decently, which I was happy about. My behavioral skills outweigh my technical ones by miles. Although I will say, I was talking about one of my projects which she asked how I would further optimize a piece of the program- I made something up about HashMaps that was just me saying words, but she seemed satisfied. Then the technical question came along.

I'd done most of the easy problems on Leetcode pertaining to string mutation and array stuff, but this was like a medium level question in my opinion. I was stuck for a little while, then we walked through my thought process. She was nice enough to let me know that I had the entire problem backwards while I was explaining my solution, and on several occasions noted that I was off about something. But I had an idea, and even though the problem felt really hard, I tried my best.  

Then a quarter of the way through she asks me about the time complexity of the .contains function in an ArrayList I was using. I was beyond lost. For reference, I've only taken one CS class in college and it was certainly not data structures. I know about Big O notation, but barely. She was really surprised that I'd never taken a data structures course, and we talked about it a little bit, but I was still pretty unsure. I managed to correctly figure out the time complexity of a nested forloop going through a string which she seemed pleased with.

My code didn't solve the problem though, and by the end I was pretty shaken up. Like physically shaking. I was so nervous that I shook the entire interview. Not in any noticeable way -I didn't really notice until I went to grab a drink of water- but just to give you an idea of how panicked I was. But the interview ended and I was totally bummed out. I hadn't solved the problem, and to boot, my program was probably the bulkiest, most brute-force solution on earth. I was sure I had been entirely rejected. Then I got up to go to dinner and realized my sweater was on backwards. Not a good feeling. 

Buuuut the good news is I got an invitation to go onto the next round a half hour later! I was and am really glad. I think it would have been nice to know you don't have to be a genius to do these interviews, so hopefully this little anecdotal story gives some comfort to someone in a similar position to me :)"

sicjni,1,2022-02-01,Web dev is making me hate programming...,Produnce,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sicjni/web_dev_is_making_me_hate_programming/,"I absolutely enjoy solving problems and getting high on the rush when your code run or you figure out what's causing the bug or feature to not work as expected. It's why I took up this field after ditching a career in logistics. 

But it's been a few weeks on the job after an internship and every ticket I get assigned has me reading through page after page and watching a multitude of videos because they each require some sort of api. I'm already slow and these requirements make me even slower. One ticket has me going through a charting library, another using the Google maps api all the while having to keep track of documentation for state management/querying, whatever UI library we are using and having to fix issues with some mock api server. I'm not even considering the main service the application is based around.

I get all these are required. Reading docs and effective use of Google are needed attributes of software developers, but at this point the only logic I've written are some sorting functions. It's just been trial after trial of trying to plug whatever method the library provides and hoping it's correct. My most typed syntax at this point must be console.log() and it's burning me out. I doubt I'm learning anything deeper about the disciple, language or the tech.

What are my options considering my future in this career? Do I just get used to it with experience or is it foolish of me to try another path in CS?"

So let me explain the situation a bit.

I had offers from 2 healthcare organisations basically where I would be given a job of an Executive, I am currently in the final year of my masters and we have a final internship coming up after which we hope the company we are working for absorbs us.i'll explain the offers one by one.

1st - A small establishment 50-100 bed size, good staff, polite, they gave an offer of working as a management trainee for 3-6 months with pay of around 300 USD/Month and job afterwards based on my performance which for sure I would have got and the salary would be better than this, not sure how much more since they didn't give any job description.

2nd - A JCI accredited establishment with 1000 beds, good repo with the chief officer under whom I would be working, I had unofficial talks with him in which he said he'll be able to help me get an executive position with a pay of around 335 USD after a 3 month unpaid internship, this is one of the top hospitals in my country and working here will strengthen my resume, or so I assume. i have done my 1st Internship from here and I learned a lot 

So I had a final interview with the 1st offer establishment and I told them that i'll have to decline their offer for now.
So basically I am losing out on pay for 3 months which I would have got in the 1st offer internship and maybe a better paying job, not sure about that, and in return i'll be getting a better brand of hospital, a chance to learn about JCI.

So did I make a good choice or was this stupidity at my part? Please ask if you need more info, might have left out some parts

Thanks for reading"
sidift,7,2022-02-01,Side Projects Question For SWE Intern Applications,OhHiMark244,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/sidift/side_projects_question_for_swe_intern_applications/,"Not sure if this question has been asked before and I’d be happy to take down this post if it has, but I just wanted to get a sense of what the community thinks about this idea I have about applying for SWE internships. 

So basically my thinking is that companies really want to see projects essentially directed related to the type of software they produce. For example, if you are applying to NVIDIA, you better have some decent CUDA projects on your resume, or if you are applying to Shopify you better have some shopping related website up. 

Pardon my ignorance if this is common knowledge but due to the amount of rejections I had been getting while applying for this summer quarter, I can’t help but think the rejections stem from the fact that my projects weren’t targeted enough so to speak. 

Is this essentially the idea when it comes time for applications, work on projects where you run into features/tech stack the company would actually have you working with if you were to start there?"
sidjwj,5,2022-02-01,Questions about joining a Prop Firm,Confident_Piccolo370,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/sidjwj/questions_about_joining_a_prop_firm/,"Hi everyone thank you for reading this. I'm a junior finance major at a good school but not top 10. I've been looking into joining a prop firms for the summer. I've worked in corporate finance and love trading but don't have enough capital for it to ever be a full time thing. Some of these firms seem borderline scammy with the fact that they are unpaid which is out of the norm in comparison with other finance internships I've had. Is this just normal for a prop firm?

Is there any places people would recommend looking into that are not extremely competitive?

I have a good track record but I'm afraid since I don't go to an ivy I don't have much of a shot. 

Is there much coding experience need to get in at these firms?

Another thing I do not have is much coding experience so that would be a downfall.

Thank you!"
sidzsl,0,2022-02-01,Internship at Tesla or continue on my current career path?,classicalmayhem,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/sidzsl/internship_at_tesla_or_continue_on_my_current/,"I am currently a senior (graduating in December) majoring in computer engineering. Last fall I began working on co-op as a software engineer at a local, relatively small embedded systems company. After my co-op ended, they offered to extend my employment part time during the semester and full time during the summer while I finish school. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm fairly certain that they will consider me for a full time position after I graduate, especially since they offered that I come back full time again next summer. I very much enjoy the job currently and, although it is a relatively small company, it is growing quickly, has a wonderful corporate culture, and offers quite outstanding benefits to it's full time employees. It is also in my home state in the Midwest, which I appreciate. However, I was recently offered an interview for a position at Tesla over the summer instead. An internship at Tesla seems like an experience that I would be foolish to pass up, but I'm conflicted. I feel like the wow factor of Tesla is clouding my judgement on this decision and was hoping for some insight from some more experienced engineers. Is an internship like this worth possibly giving up the career path I'm currently on? Would the experience that I get at Tesla alone be worth it? Am I overthinking this? I'm leaning towards staying where I am, but I don't want to pick the safe option just because it's safe."

I have 3 years of experience in IT (started in a help desk, then moved my way into a cyber security internship, and got full time as an infosec analyst last summer). I'm still in school right now finishing up my degree but am working full time. When I graduate in May I'll have a BS in MIS, a BS in international business, and a certificate in cyber security management. I make about 50k right now which is really good for where I live and considering the fact that I'm still finishing up school. Once I'm done I'll be looking for jobs in North Carolina. Is a salary expectation of 85-90k unrealistic ? I get that it also probably depends on what I do exactly, but I need to start paying off my student loans and am hoping for the best! I tried to take advantage of every opportunity I could in school and feel like I have a pretty good resume. My soft skills are definitely better than my technical skills, but I've learned every new technology / skill quickly. I was slightly under qualified for the job I have now but I've caught up since I've been hired! I can't shake the feeling though that I won't get hired anywhere because I'm not a master with the technical things."

sikemt,1,2022-02-02,Advice on weird job description please?,akornm,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/sikemt/advice_on_weird_job_description_please/,"I had/have a job where my actual job title was blurry from the start and has progressively gotten more confusing. I don't know where to begin on a resume.

Okay so I have a bachelors in biomedical science, graduated in April 2020 and the jobs at that point were just... unappealing. Thankfully I wasn't qualified for any of them, although I did try anyway. For 2 months. Then I went the other route and took a job as a warehouse worker for a medical supply store, although I also ended up being hired as a digital marketer since I have a lot of followers on IG? And also as a customer service representative, but actually for the other company that shares a warehouse space with the company I was hired by.

Right so that's my job description on day 1. Then I start working on the backend of our website, essentially becoming a website manager. This is while still being a warehouse worker/digital marketer/customer service rep.

Then because I'm ""young and good with computers"" I'm helping with the accounting, I set up an integration to automatically sync our accounting software with our sales channels. Since I now know how to use our accounting software, I become the on-site accountant, since the actual ones were working remotely. I'm spending more time on my computer at my desk now, which also happens to be in the store's showroom, where I'm expected to greet customers and make sales.

Then I start learning Python as a hobby, I automate a large chunk of our day-to-day operations, develop a company database, blah blah programming stuff.

I'm giving all this detail because, none of these responsibilities were ever dropped. They just kept adding on, nobody else could/would do it if I didn't. I worked insane hours, then would continue working from home. But I had a lot of freedom so it was kinda whatever. Now I'm sort of working freelance? not really sure what to call it.

I'm back in school now for a CS degree, and at some point will be looking to get internships. What the hell do I put?"

So I’ve landed an Internship as an technical  Consultant, this is not my end game I eventually want to move over to either program manager or Project Manager role. I went through about 3 rounds of interviewing which went well. I received the offer letter about 2 weeks later. I haven’t received my start date yet. 

Here are my few questions:

1) How is the on boarding in the US, I’ve received a Nice Swag package 📦, however I have not received any access to the Portal to complete tax information and other task. I’m guessing it would say Start@IBM. I’ve completed a lot of e-learnings as well as earned badges under my personal email in which I’m the welcome email they told me that was my username for the learning site to explore. 

2) What is the Retention  rate upon completion of the internship The internship is during the summer, and I graduate in December. I’m really looking forward to continuing at IBM however nothing is promised

3)  should I prepare to move to the office of their decision which was Chicago or NY. My HR contact who phone screened me relayed that they don’t have info on Werner we would be in the office or remote.

I’ve been hustling since the start of Y1 (I’m now Y3), every summer/winter I’ll head for internship opportunities, which essentially means I haven’t had a proper “break break” since Y1. After this sem started, I’ve been feeling unmotivated and honestly not feeling that much interested in the modules that I’m taking this semester. 

I’ve been feeling pretty down for the past few days due to my inadequacy. Having grouped with other teammates for our project, it’s very clear that they are way superior and have better skills than I am (I’m in computing btw), and it doesn’t help that their comments are not very helpful either, it always feels like condescending replies telling me to “do better” despite my best effort at it. Sometimes I just feel like, sorry I’m not that smart? And sorry that I can’t live up to your standards but I have no choice since we are randomly grouped together? 

I went out CNY visiting today and my group mates started to discuss about the work I did previously. It just instantly ruined the mood for me and I felt like I’ve burdened the team. Im just really tired…. I’m really trying my best… When I rant to my family, partners, friends, they all tell me to “jiayou” and it’ll get better soon. But that doesn’t really… help? I don’t know what’s a better way to put this. 

Sigh, thanks for reaching the bottom if you actually did. I’m just tired."

This is to say I'm not new to coding by any means, and yet whenever I do these coding tests for job applications or get asked technical questions and I end up drawing a complete blank! That's a bit of an exaggeration, but I end up getting so stumped on even the simplest seeming things and then look up the solution later and think ""Ohhhhhh, how did I not think of that?!"" I feel like I have no problem solving ability when it comes to coding despite having done it (to various extents) for 8 years! Like what have I been doing all this time?!

Anyway, this is to ask why do I get so stuck/can't remember things and how to I improve so I can pass these technical assessments and get another job."

Judging by the recommendations on glassdoor some people seem to contradict saying their is a path for growth and some say their is not.

The sole reason I really want this job is to boost my experience with the cloud and hopefully work my way into cloud security. My major is IT/Cybersecurity and I graduate this semester so this would be my first job out of college. I love the cloud and am super interested in everything it has to offer. Throughout my college career my end goal has always been Cloud Security. I probably would not take this position if there is not much opportunity for growth. I actually have had numerous internships in Networking and Information security so I already have some experience in that end.

I guess my questions are:

Do you work or know anyone that has been in this role before?

Is there a opportunity for growth at AWS especially with security? 

Should I accept (if offered) this job to start my career in the cloud or look somewhere else?"

I’m currently a college senior in my last semester, and all I can ever think about these days is finding a good job so I can start tackling my student loans, but I have absolutely no idea what I’m interested in or what would be a good fit. I don’t want to teach (no shade at all to teaching as a field, I just really know it’s not for me), but other than that I haven’t really ruled out much as possibilities. I don’t have any “relevant” work experience (i.e. no internships or anything), but I have been working nonstop since I was 14. I’ve also been an RA for the past two years and I’ve tutored college-level math for three years, both of which I hope look good on my resume.

Basically what I have going for me is a math degree from a prestigious university, a minor in computer science, a good gpa (3.71), a couple research projects, and 0 experience (also 70k+ in student loans and an anxiety disorder🙃). If I wasn’t so in debt I would consider grad school, but I really need to make some more money first and also figure out what I would want to go to school for in the first place. 

So yeah TLDR: any advice on career paths for math majors (particularly ones that pay well lol) or any advice on how to find a job in general as an upcoming college grad would be greatly appreciated!!!"

sitgyp,1,2022-02-02,Long vent / Needed a system cooldown / Sorry I am like this,GlowingOwlBaby,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/sitgyp/long_vent_needed_a_system_cooldown_sorry_i_am/,"I needed to get this out of my system, but I didn't want to burden the people in my life so reddit it is. Writing it down anonymously on a forum gives the feeling that maybe someone somewhere might have time and interest to listen. And even if there wasn't anyone, that's a good enough placebo for me.

**TL/DR:** I feel like a failure, and having a great background makes it all the more painfully crushing.

Background: I had safe, abundant childhood in Northern Europe. My father has always made good money, and has provided our family of five a very good life. I was taken to a holiday trip abroad for the first time when I was only four, and after that even when both of my younger siblings were born, we made a smaller or longer trip somewhere abroad almost every single year as a whole family. Mom works a smaller wage job, but she has always enjoyed it and never asked for anything from my father. My parents have never divorced.  
Whenever me or my siblings were sick, we got the treatments and medications right away. If we wished for something, our parents almost always bought it if the wish was reasonable and we behaved. Not to mention even today we get more than enough when it's Christmas for example. And we rarely even ask anything.  
My family has always loved each other unconditionally, be it grandparents, my parents or siblings and we tell each other daily how much we love and appreciate each other. I've always had friends, some who I am very close with.  
Today, I am 29 y/o woman, live in a rented flat, but I'm always welcome and often visit my parents and grandparents. I have two degrees, a job and even though I don't earn much, I have some little savings of my own. Never suffered considerable abuse, trauma, mental disorders or any of the sort (unless I'm depressed right now. It's not officially diagnosed.)

In short, you could say that I got the perfect base to build my life on, right? That there's no way my life would ever be too scummy, if I don't screw something up myself big time. And so far I think I haven't. I don't smoke, never touched drugs, and use alcohol only on social occasions. And those times can be counted with both hands' fingers thanks to the pandemic these couple of years. Still, I feel more lost than ever after each passing day, to the point I'm ugly crying while writing this.

The thing is, even though I've got basically everything in life, I never had too much dreams. I don't have a dream job, which is why I have two degrees: the other one, I don't like one bit, but decided to graduate anyway because it was the first school I got into and I really didn't know what else to do. The second degree I got because it is more relevant to the job I work at at the moment, which is retail. I don't absolutely loathe the job, but I still hate it rather often because it is basically just mindless scanning at the cash register, constantly being happy and polite to an endless flood of customers in a 24/7 supermarket. I tried to get some variation to my job by working as a collector for the online orders at the same market, but I never managed to be efficient enough for that. *I wasn't even good enough to collect customers' orders. A job you can get without any degree at all. How pathetic is that?* Over the years, earning minimal wage has started to eat my soul away. Which is sad, because my employer says I do my job very well at the cash register. The customers are happy, all the while I'm screaming and crying inside.

I don't want to think how many other jobs I've searched for and sent my CVs to, only to not get the job or even a reply at all. It's like I'm blindly shooting job applications anywhere I feel I could manage, hoping that the place for me would be there somewhere. But I'm seriously losing all hope at this point. I have over 7 years of experience with customer service, internships for various places when I was a teenager, but I still never got further than the cash register of a supermarket. A place anyone can get. I'm not an ambitious person. I'd be happy and content even earning below average in my home country, but I just want so badly to find a place to call my own, a job I'd enjoy more than hate. A place I think doesn't exist, but a person still has to make a living. If I won a jackpot in lottery, I'd be one of those people to quit their job immediately, only doing occasional charity jobs.

I am ashamed and disgusted of myself. I feel that I have nothing to offer to the world, or to anyone on that matter. That's why I've never even dated anyone. I view myself from a 3rd person perspective and honestly, even I wouldn't pick myself: A person who never found ambitions, doesn't have big dreams or plans for the future. A pessimistic nobody who has no talents, only lives from day to day to make little money in  underrated job, so that sometimes when friends ask, she can take part in some social events. And when it comes to looks, I'm nothing special, but rather so average it hurts. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to find love, but more than that, I don't want to be a burden to anyone. And being as I am now, anyone is better off with someone else than me. If someone by accident wanted to be with me, in this time and age they'd certainly leave me at some point, not that I'd blame them.

I've had suicidal thoughts in the past. One time I almost acted on that thought, but didn't do it only because I can't put my family through that pain. I know my parents, like any parents, wished and wanted that I'd become someone when I grow up. Chase my dreams, find a partner, maybe start a family and so on. I know my mother would've loved to be a grandmother someday, and I feel awful when I know that I most possibly won't be able to give her that joy, even when I sometimes think it might've been nice to be a mother myself. After all the amazing things my parents and family have given me, I became absolutely nothing. I feel like an utter disappointment.

There is hardly a day when I don't wish that I'd die sooner rather than later. I feel like that has become my dream: to die soon, because I simply can't figure out how to live this life like majority of normal people do, especially when my background provided me with everything I could've needed. How I wish that some other child who lives in a complete poverty and has hardships more than a child should bear, would've gotten my place instead. So that they could've flourished and lived a happy life in a way I was never able to. A life I got, but I feel I never deserved. It frustrates me to think why my parents and family ended up with someone like me, when they would've deserved someone so much better!

I am a loser. I find it unbelievable that I'm somewhat enough to my family and friends, and they are the only reason I even have motivation to be anymore. I feel tired, but the least I can do is to be there for the people closest to me. I'm happy for them all, seeing what they've become and what they'll still do, if also a tad bit envious. I don't know if there's anyone else who has or has had feelings similar to mine, but... I don't know. It's comforting to know that death will come eventually."
sitnan,6,2022-02-02,Tata's TALP Program,T0rtilla,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/sitnan/tatas_talp_program/,"Hey all,

Had a few questions regarding an offer I received. For context, 2nd year at a T15 and my goal throughout my MBA has been to break into tech, preferably PM, at a mid-large sized tech company. As most here know, it’s incredibly competitive and I’m not confident I’ll land an offer before graduation. I have only 2 years W.E. pre-mba, which I think has been a huge hurdle in recruitment thus far.

So all that said- has anyone here joined/know someone that joined that TALP program? I’ve heard extremely mixed reviews- the folks at my program who did the TALP internship all seemed to enjoy it and are returning full-time, but Indian international students pretty much universally hate the company.

The comp is 125k base, 25k performance, 30k signing, so ok overall but definitely low for consulting.

Are the hours/travel similar to the big, American consulting firms? Obviously wouldn’t want to work consulting hours for significantly less pay than most consultants are making.

How do exit ops compare to b4/t2, particularly for tech?

Appreciate any insights!"

siuckx,5,2022-02-02,Thoughts from a College Senior: Advice to Future College Students (and current!),thatgirltag,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/siuckx/thoughts_from_a_college_senior_advice_to_future/,"I graduate in May and have been doing a lot of reflection and I think I have a lot of helpful tips that may be useful to people on this sub. To briefly introduce myself, I started college in 2017 and went out of state to a college in Massachusetts (I am from New Jersey). at the time, I struggled with severe OCD and anxiety, which really hurt me both academically and socially. I ended up having to take a medical leave because of my OCD, where I later went to residential treatment and transferred to a large college back in my home state of New Jersey. Upon transferring, I joined a sorority because I thought it would help me meet people. It did, but I'm not really a sorority kind of person. Anyways, here is my advice:

&amp;#x200B;

1) if you struggle with mental health issues, get help early. Don't be an idiot like me and say ""Oh my symptoms aren't that serious, I don't need help"". Things intensified quickly for me and because I withdrew 2 months into the semester, I lost a lot of money. get help early on. if you are a senior in high school, find a therapist in your college ahead of time or go to disability services if you need accomodations/the mental health center

&amp;#x200B;

2) Put yourself out there: You really have to make an active effort to make friends. It's not high school anymore where its much easier to make friends because you see the same people a lot. Chances are if you are a freshman, other people on your floor are also looking to make friends. Introduce yourself. Ask them to go to places. Go to events in your building. Join clubs. Really make an active effort. If you think someone is cool and you are somewhat friendly with them, message them asking if they want to meet up. If they say no, they say no. There's other people out there.

  Also please know that it takes time to make friends. The first week, you may see hoards of freshman and you may think ""OMG everyone has friends but me"". Trust me, you are not alone. Maybe those people know each other from high school. Also groups like that tend to not last. just know that friendships take time. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Job/Career Stuff---&gt; I really recommend starting early on. Go to career services. start beginning to network with people in your field. Take advantage of the events that your college has. I wish I took more advantage of this. Also, if your college has a good alumni network- reach out to them. Make a linkedin. Doing all of this early on will make it easier when you are a senior looking for a job. I think this is helpful to start second semester freshman year/soph year. Work on getting internships early on. Even if you don't think you are qualified, apply anyways. The worst that can happen is they say no. Experience matters SO MUCH. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) Grades: 

  Chances are your grades Aren't going to be as high as you want them to be and that's okay. Your freshman year you are still adjusting and it's perfectly normal. You aren't dumb. Trust me, my first semester of college, I had a 3.2 and now I'm set to graduate with a 3.8. So you can easily rebound 

&amp;#x200B;

5) Social Media

  People post their highlights. Trust me, there are so many times I've seen people at parties looking like they are having the best time, when in reality they didn't.  Also, when I went off to college I thought I was an idiot for not being into partying. There are SO MANY people who are not into partying and drinking. You will find your people.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Office Hours 

  Go to office hours. Go to office hours. Go to office hours. Your professors are so knowledgable and just ask questions. They have office hours for a reason. Even if you think your question is stupid, ask anyways. If the professor is rude, then they are an asshole. Don't get discouraged. Also professors can be a great source to find opportunities and if have plans on going to graduate school, it's important to make these relationships. But be authentic- professors can see through a student who is just using them to get a letter of rec. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways- here's all of my advice from a 5th year senior. I'm sharing this because there's so much I wish that I could have changed about my college experience and I don't want people to make the same mistakes that I've made."

six2rs,3,2022-02-02,How to improve analytical skills as an engineer who does not have a research background?,ObstinateTacos,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/six2rs/how_to_improve_analytical_skills_as_an_engineer/,"I'm a mechanical engineer who graduated with a BS in 2017. I'm 9 months into my 3rd job since graduating (4th if you count the part time internship I had at a machine shop for my junior and senior year). At all my jobs until my current one I have been doing design work of some kind and had a close proximity to the manufacturing process. I love mechanical design work. I think I am good at it (for my experience level), and I'm very sure that it is the type of engineering work I want to do. I never enjoyed engineering school, but have always enjoyed engineering itself.

My conundrum is that I thought I would get to do a good amount of design work at my current gig, however it turns out there is basically zero opportunities for design work of almost any kind, and it does not seem like there will be any for at least a year. It is a medical device company (an industry I am very new to). My team is mostly people with an academic background in the niche technology our product uses. They brought me on specifically to round out the team with someone who has practical mechanical design knowledge. For instance, I'm the only person on the team who could go to the fastener section at a hardware store and understand what's going on there. R&amp;D, the department I am in, is structured chiefly around the scientists (bio assay people), and the engineers tend to have a scientific academic engineering background rather than an industry one.

Our current project is a very detailed characterization of our existing product. We have looked at all the subsystems, determined which parameters are the most important, and are currently designing and executing experiments to understand the behavior of each of these important parameters. This is well-suited to the more scientifically-minded engineers who did this kind of work in academia, but I mostly hate it. I find this sort of work extremely tedious. Our product is incredibly complicated mechanically, and given that it is a disposable medical device there's a lot of domain-specific knowledge that my background in designing industrial capital machinery didn't prepare me well for. I find the entire exercise of defining all these abstract parameters and making drawn out schedules for when certain experiments will be done by to be very difficult when I feel extremely undereducated about biochemistry, liquid reagent packaging, plastics manufacturing, and other relevant technology that I am still new to. During the course of designing experiments and talking to other technical staff I often learn new information that requires me to revise scheduling commitments and redesign other experiments. I often find myself not able to fully justify everything in my plans because everything is constantly in flux, even though I try my hardest to keep a handle on everything. It does not help that knowledge is very balkanized at this company, and finding out who knows what, let alone the relevant info itself, is very difficult. Documentation is mediocre at best. Most of my time is spent digging through old documents, getting people to email me back, and making powerpoints.

I want to be better at performing this kind of analytical work, even if I strongly dislike doing it. I am trying to leave the company for a better position, but the two contract design firms I interviewed for think I don't quite have enough experience for their senior ME positions, on top of not having enough experience with injection molding (something I thought I would get some design experience with at my current gig). I thought I interviewed well but I guess not, so it seems I'm stuck here for some time. I want to try to make the best of it so I can become a better engineer while I look for a new job that will allow me to do more design work.

What can I do to do better at my current job and feel like less of an idiot? I know I have come a long way in learning new tech and processes in these 9 months, but I feel as if I have a long way to go to do well at the kind of work I'm going to be stuck doing here until I get a new job."

Since graduating, I delayed full-time employment so I can seek out internship opportunities that would benefit me. I finished an internship with the Asia Society in December for example. I’ve also been taking Chinese lessons at an institute nearby. 

I’m 24 years old, and applying to graduate school next fall. I have been looking for full time work since I finished my internship, and was planning on working during the day and doing classes at night for grad school. I’m in my mid-twenties, and feel deepening anxiety about securing full-time employment. I have a second round interview with the accounting firm EY tomorrow, actually. 

The thing is, I was also just accepted into an immersion program for Chinese at the Middlebury Language School for this summer. An 8 week program. I know I will likely not be able to work full time if I get a job if I plan on doing this program. No job will give me 8 weeks off, especially as a new employee. But I really think this program will help my fluency and be beneficial for the future. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I delay getting a full-time job even longer to do this program? Do I not do the program and run the risk of potentially not even finding a job? Do I put it off and reapply in the future? 

I am being told these are “good problems” to have because it means I have choices, but I can’t shake the anxiety, and was looking for some advice."
sixsok,22,2022-02-02,Sharing my experience of getting a Chase Associate Program Summer Internship 2022 - Advancing Black Pathways and Advancing Hispanics &amp; Latinos MBA Experience in NYC,megamino27,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/sixsok/sharing_my_experience_of_getting_a_chase/,"I wanted to share my experience since it was really hard to find information on my the internship before I got it. Everything I found on Glassdoor was unhelpful, and any information I found was on Reddit before my interview was geared toward advancing black pathways, so I thought it was irrelevant to me since I applied for the Latino Pathways Experience.

Alright, to give you an idea of what kind of applicant I was. I’m currently a 1yr MBA candidate at UT Dallas. Didn’t take the gmat, but I had a really high GPA so I got into business school. My previous work experience was at Cap One in their auto refi department, an editor in journalism, and I was a teller chase bank years back before college (BYU Hawaii). I’m a English Literature undergrad. I applied to chase my first semester of grad school so I didn’t have a grad school GPA to apply with. 

During late September, my MBA cohort got an invite to a cocktail networking event at the JPMorgan Chase Plano Campus hosted by specifically for the CAP Program. As far as I know, all of the DFW Universities were invited (SMU, TWU, UNT, UTD masters/mba students, etc) it was limited attendance so the faster you RSVP’d, the better the chances you had of going. I was luckily on my phone at the time, so I RSVP’d and was confirmed to come. 

Two days later, I was actually first to arrive (I was just on time, I wasn’t like trying too hard), and for about an 1.5 to 2 hours we networked with CAP associates, managers, and the recruiting team. It was really great to ask questions to people currently in the role in a casual setting. I really liked what I learned and I applied to the internship when I got home. 

The next day I had one of those dreaded Hirevue self-recorded interviews, then I didn’t hear back for a while. During that time, I applied to other chase internships besides the CAP internship, about mid October is when I applied for the Advancing Hispanic and Latino Pathways Experience, cause why not? I also narrowed JPMorgan to be one of my top choices if I got an internship. I got tons of rejections for all the positions I applied for within Chase and some of my cohort members got invitations to virtual Super Day interviews before me. NGL, I was feeling pretty uncertain, but the application wasn’t declined yet, so I kept the faith.

It worked out when I got invited to New York City for the Advancing Hispanic and Latino Pathways experience in November. They flew me out and paid for my hotel and transportation. It was awesome for me since it was my first time ever experiencing something like that. 

When I got there, I realized it was combined with the Advancing Black pathways experience as well and there were like 40-60 people there, I think? Not all of those people had applied to the CAP Internship. Most of them were attending the same event, but for them, it was a diversity event that would help them network in hopes of getting into investment banking or global wealth management. They had a panel where about six people from those departments answered questions from all of us, and then they separated us into our own rooms based on what we applied for. 

I was relieved to see there was only like 6 people in the CAP associate room. That is when I discovered that the applicants that had applied and attended for the CAP Associate Internship were actually going to have a Super Day interview session, and anyone else who come for another position (Investment Banking or whatever) was doing some sort of mock case study and networking, no interviews for them.

Why was I surprised? Well, we did get an schedule itinerary in an email beforehand, but my itinerary was the same as what everyone else got (meaning my schedule had case studies and stuff on it, which I didn’t end up doing). Regarding interviews, my schedule had just said informational interviews, so I didn’t know if that meant actual job interview or just networking, but I am glad that I did get to do Super Day interviews that day. 

Before we did interviews, we networked for about an hour, had a good lunch, then interviewed with three Chase Vice Presidents who did the CAP Program. We interviewed back-to-back as they (the VPs) asked us behavioral questions. We did it in the same room, but different tables. We rotated like every 20 minutes.

Once we finished our interviews, we were good to go. I did some personal things in NYC then made it to the airport for my flight the same day. The CAP recruiter had told me I should expect a response in the next week, but since the holidays were coming (thanksgiving)there may be a delay. I didn’t hear anything back for three weeks. Yeah, I was a bit nervous.

However, I got the offer for the internship. Here are the details:

The internship is in-person at the Plano Texas Campus. It’s gonna be 9 weeks in the summer. I got a 2.5K acceptance bonus for the internship, and the pay was the normal 125k salary that a full-time employee would get, but I would just get 9 weeks of it. So about 21~22k before taxes for the summer, I’m guessing?

I got an offer letter, but I don’t know really anything else at this point. Waiting for more information as we get closer to the start date. If there are any questions, I’d be happy to answer them as I get more information. Hope this helps someone!"

Out of necessity I have learned vim, but every time I do something like press 'y' to copy or 'd' to cut (y of course is short for 'yank', 'd' short for delete -- fucking really?), or type "":wq"" to save and exit, I have to sit back for a moment and just shake my head.

I made the switch into tech about 2 years ago now. I started by going the self taught route and as things amped up I decided to look into boot camps. After attending a boot camp and spending about 7 months after the boot camp honing my new found full stack web dev skills and portfolio I landed a 3 month internship for a Fortune 500 company. The internship went great but it was more of an analyst role and after talking with my VP about my background in development I was able to extend my internship and move to a cloud engineering team. It was quite challenging learning a brand new stack but after about a month in my second internship I was able to understand the code base, write unit tests, and fix small bugs. Well that internship ended and I was told I was not quite experienced enough to receive an offer to be on their team. So now scrambling to find another job I looked for some entry level roles throughout the company as I figured this was my best chance of landing a new role quickly (I have bills to pay and didn’t have the luxury of being unemployed for a extended period of time). I came across an Associate Business Systems Analyst role and was able to receive an offer. I have now been in that position for a little over 3 months and my total time at this company is 8 months.

Question: 
The current role I am in is simple drag and drop coding for a form on one of the company’s sites. My role is to essentially stay on top of the updates/bugs/releases/documentation. I have a great work life balance in this position as well as decent benefits. The problem lies in the fact that I only make $23/hr and am not eligible for any raise for another 9 months. This is simply not doable for me as I can barely pay all my expenses with this and am actively trying to find a side gig. I would prefer to land a job as a developer after this role, so my question is should I look for other jobs now and jump ship if I get a better offer or should I stay in my position until I reach my year mark (in November). My team (me and one other person) is currently working on a project to migrate our form to a different software and the release date for this project has continually gotten pushed back further and further over the past year. My concern is if I find a better job right now and leave I will burn a bridge because overall I really like the people I work with and my experience in this company thus far has been pretty good. I know they took a chance on me since I am still in school and don’t have a degree yet so this is causing some hesitation when trying to make this decision."

Do we need an internal application to see orders or will the order information be sent to the admin's email account?  etc and try to design the structure of the app.

The problem is, my only design experience is a full-stack web app with MongoDB, nodeJS, reactJS. I know that if its scalable I need to use some cloud infrastructure. I could also tell that the internal application will fetch from the database to display the orders and I could say a thing or two about database design theory. However, I saw that many system design examples for the eCommerce app on the interview involves explaining distributed queue, load balancer, elastic search, spark, and things that had never heard of.

The programs I have applied for do cover students' tuition and pay a stipend (some want me to pay fees).  I am a bit worried about being able to pay for a place to live and just want to know how some of y'all handle it.  I am hoping for on-campus graduate housing as it is typically cheaper, and I'm hoping it will be easier for me to bring my pet (if I get an ESA letter) since I won't have to deal with roommates and feel bad for keeping him locked up in a room.

I do plan on applying for scholarships/fellowships but since I haven't been officially accepted into any programs I have yet to do so.  I also have been applying to internships to work for during the summer, but I have not heard back as of now.

Anyway, if you have any tips or words of encouragement please share them!"

I'm having a few questions and uncertainty with where I want to go with my career. This isn't as much specific to Enve engineering but just engineering in general.

How to get an internship and use linkedin to open opportunities?

As most engineering student I have desperately been sending out applications to company after company with not a single even interview. I'm trying to use what connections I have to open any more chances but it feels like I'm still doing something wrong. It could be my resume or the fact I don't have a cover letter, but I also am not sure if there is someway of using all my connections properly. I have made a couple on linkedin with company representatives but also know some professional from my work experience. Is there any way to use this to help better my chances of getting a internship?"

I'm relatively new to this subreddit and tbh, I'm quite nervous. I am a 3rd year BS Computer Science student in my country's top university. I do not consider myself smart or skilled at all especially when I compare myself with my batchmates and with all the tech experts on the internet that I see and read about. I only started learning programming during my first year in college. I've done a lot of programming exercises and what not but I feel like they focus too much on the academia side of computer science and not in the industry. I would like to ask for suggestions on how I can improve further my first draft of my resume. Our 2nd semester is about to start on Feb. 7 and it'll be another tough semester. I might not have the time to re-edit this resume (idk for sure). According to our department's head, our internship must start on around June (near the end of the 2nd semester) or the summer term/midyear (right after the 2nd semester).

Note: the leadership section was from a format that I followed. I freaking forgot to remove that. Sorry!

I really really really wanna get into CyberSec for my career and have already started reading a book cryptography and another social engineering.

I'm planning on doing on doing A+, and Sec+ as of now, planning on taking it slow as i'm in no rush and i have an insane courseload ( even 8 months is fine). And then ill study and try and do CCNA maybe a year down the line during my break. 

The goal is to have these three certs under my belt (at least) before I graudate in 4 years. But its not just that, I wanna be able to have some experience in this very field through internships and etc before I graduate, that's why I want these certs so early.

These are my ECs:

- paid intern at a law firm
- Us State Department youth Ambassador to a Spanish-speaking country
- JROTC cadet - top 1% in my unit
- president of a political club at my hs
- VP of a local chapter of an community service/ art club
- Legislative assistant for a state-led environmental policy organization
- part of drill and raider teams in my jrotc unit

I feel like, in comparison to a lot of other people, this is not a lot. Im sure this is because I’m surrounded by really high achieving people in my high school and I’m also on this subreddit a lot. But I wanted to know if I’m good in regards to what I’ve been involved in during high school.

I have done a lot in Jrotc throughout high school. I literally spent hours in the unit, have been super involved in the clubs, and organized many service events in my community through this program. I am one of 5 top cadets in the unit, and I’ve worked my ass off for this. However, being rejected from this scholarship was really depressing because I thought I was well- rounded.

sj5ncw,0,2022-02-02,Accept offer at existing company or try a different field?,a-whale-in-a-tree,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sj5ncw/accept_offer_at_existing_company_or_try_a/,"Hi everyone.

I'm currently finishing up an internship at a great company that works in enterprise software. I've really enjoyed the experience, I've learnt so much, and had the chance to do a lot of real work. I live close to the office, they are flexible with working from home, and all of the people are very nice and helpful.

There is a chance that I will be offered a graduate position at the end of the internship.

I'm coming into my final year of uni studying comp sci. I'm taking some more lower level and theoretical subjects such as reasoning about programs, compilers &amp; interpreters, and functional programming. In my earlier years of uni I've taken quite a few low level and theoretical courses, and I have really enjoyed them.

So my question is - do I take the offer at the company I really enjoy, or do I reject it and try and get something in a different field?

I've been told that the first full-time job you work at will define your career path. Is this true? I also think that I won't use a lot of the theoretical concepts I've learnt at uni if I work in enterprise software (e.g. mathematical proofs, scientific computing, computer graphics), and so I may struggle to transition into that field if I want to move there later.

On the other hand, this company is really great to work at. I already know the people and the systems, and I know I would enjoy it. I don't want to throw away an incredible opportunity in hopes for something that I may or may not like. You know what they say - a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Rejecting would also mean another year or more of leetcode and coding interviews. I would be stressing about getting a job all year.

## Pros of accepting

* I know I enjoy the work
* Great people
* Don't have to move
* Guaranteed work - don't have to look for another job

## Cons of accepting

* May miss out on working in a field I will enjoy more
* Won't be able to use my theoretical and low level skills
* Don't get to move - I would like to work overseas at some point, potentially Europe or something

A compromise could be to make sure I keep up the skills I enjoy with side projects and hobbies, but I feel like that is more difficult for theoretical stuff. Easier to make a simple react website than a custom compiler.

What are your thoughts? What would you take? Have you had experience working in a lot of different fields?

I appreciate any advice :)"

I am looking for a bit of advice about navigating a big decision that I have.   


I am a recent graduate from my local university, and I got a return offer from my internship. I was pressured pretty hard into accepting it despite having a few applications pending or in progress with other companies. Fast forward to now, and a few of those applications have turned into offers. Currently, I am between an Associate Developer (Front End) within IBM's consulting department, and a trainee position in the first Gap Tech Rotational Program, which would last about 18 months.   


The Gap Tech position is fully remote for the 18 month program, but I'll likely have to relocate upon the completion of the program and choosing one department to stay in full time. At which point my role would no longer be a trainee, and I would be placed into a grade 16 – Software Engineer 1 role instead.  


The IBM position is not remote, and I would have to relocate to the office that I chose to report to, either NYC or San Francisco. I would be working in the communications, and customer transformation division which does interest me, but I am hesitant that front end development might not be what I want to stay in forever.

&amp;#x200B;

The TC is identical salary wise, and I am yet to see the benefits for the IBM position yet, as I am waiting for the formal letter to arrive. I am really struggling with this decision as I have always wanted to live in a city such as NYC or San Francisco, and IBM has a decent reputation as a tech company, but I am afraid that I might be passing up a good opportunity in either direction. I'll also note that I am awaiting my final round with Amazon as well, but between the negative rumors that I have heard about working at Amazon, and my lower confidence with the process as a whole due to my OA, I am not optimistic that I'll receive an offer. 

Thanks to anyone ahead of time who takes the time to read, and possibly reply, I really appreciate it!"
sj7zgu,1,2022-02-02,What can I tell my buyers to reduce their stress while their closing dates have been postponed?,AnonymousMouse__,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sj7zgu/what_can_i_tell_my_buyers_to_reduce_their_stress/,"I apologize in advance for the long post.

I work for a new home builder in a townhome community and the majority of our buyers are first time homebuyers that are coming from renting or living with family. 

The construction industry has definitely been hit hard by the pandemic, and estimated closing dates seem to get pushed back time and time again. For this reason, when we go to contract with buyers we set the expectation upfront that we can never guarantee a closing date but we will provide estimates as we progress in construction. We have a building that has been under construction since early summer of 2021 and they received their walk dates at the end of November (scheduled for end of December to close). About halfway through December, it was clear that the homes were not going to close in time and so I started making phone calls to rightfully upset buyers letting them know that we were pushing the closing date back to the end of January. Although this was news nobody wanted to hear, they were appreciative of my honesty and letting them know so that they could make ample arrangements.

All throughout January, we’ve been hit left and right with delays from cabinets to trades not showing up, to incorrect finishes, etc. it was apparent to myself and to my on-site project manager that there was no way these homes were going to close at the end of January. My project manager fault to get the dates pushed back again, but senior management one of them closed no matter what. This meant that my project manager had to do first walks with buyers and take them through their homes with no power, no cabinets, no countertops – it was embarrassing. The second walls were equally awful. 

Despite our please to push back the closing dates, we were told they would complete on January 31st and that is when the buyer should expect to close. I was dreading the entire weekend knowing that Monday was going to be a disaster, and it was. All throughout the day, I had homeowners coming in upset and berating me for wasting their time telling them that they were going to close when the homes were nowhere near ready. I understand that I am a representative of my employer, so I can’t exactly throw anybody under the bus, so I did what I could by being incredibly apologetic and empathetic to their situation and letting them know that I am trying to figure out exactly what is going on and when they can expect to finally close on their home.

I have built a great deal of rapport with these buyers, and I have good relationships with mostly all of them. Some buyers were more upset than others, but I can’t fault anybody for being upset because I myself would be livid. Throughout the day, I received angry emails that buyers wanted me to forward to seeing your management and countless phone calls and texts wanting to know what was going on. Since I didn’t have any answers for them and this was out of my wheelhouse, I contacted my direct manager who intern contacted one of the senior managers at the corporate office for our builder and told them that I have several buyers requesting to speak to someone that is basically my superior. 

I was told that buyers would be receiving a phone call shortly after 12 PM, but noon came and went, as did 2 o’clock and 4 o’clock. At this point, I figured nobody was calling so I had to call everyone back and basically bullshit a reason as to why their homes aren’t closed and when they can expect to close. Countless emails to senior management went unanswered, countless phone calls were ignored, and by the end of day I was mentally and emotionally drained from trying to calm the nerves of nine sets of angry future homeowners that are expecting to hear from someone other than myself. 

Yesterday rolled around and I still not heard a word from senior management, and my phone is blowing up and ringing off the hook with disappointed buyers. Once again, I took it upon myself to try to talk to them but everything that I said fell on deaf ears, as I would expect it to. The same thing could be said for today. 

I am incredibly upset and embarrassed with the situation, and I still have buyers that are wondering why nobody has called them. I don’t anticipate anyone to call at this point, which means I will need to call everyone back again tomorrow. What can I possibly tell these people to make them feel better about the situation? I feel like the builder has dropped the ball and left us peons that are on site to try to put out all of the fires. I’m angry, upset, embarrassed, and tired. I care tremendously about these buyers and I know some of their individual situations and it devastates me that this has been their experience. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. It’s been a rough week."

sjc2l5,0,2022-02-03,Can’t decide between nursing or tech,SadRazzmatazz3563,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sjc2l5/cant_decide_between_nursing_or_tech/,"
I’m so sorry if this is too long but your advice  really matters to me.

I’m a current senior in high school. I have been struggling to choose between nursing or computer science ( and some other tech majors). I have applied to universities as a computer science first major and nursing as an alternative major. 

But the thing is l don’t know what l would commit once I get my admissions decisions. I don’t know if I’m really interested in nursing, I know it’s a good career if you want to help people but idk if it is for me. The reason I choose nursing is because there are shortages. I think I could get a job after I complete my program and pass the NCLEX. I also chose nursing too because of my mom. She always wanted one of her kids to have a healthcare degree. I’m the only child left to go to a university. My other siblings have different degrees. I thought if l could get a nursing degree l could make her dreams come true because she wasn’t able to get an opportunity to get a higher education. I also feel like this is the only way I could make her proud as her child. Also if you understand African parents there’s no really following your passion. It’s all about making a lot of money so you can make life better for them. I also want them to retire soon and help them with their retirement since they are getting old. I’m also an immigrant child so the American dream exists in my decision.  I’ve heard bad reviews about nursing and good reviews too. The only area of nursing l find interest in is pediatrics and that’s because l have 7 years of babysitting experience but idk what that would be like.

As for tech, I still really don’t know if it is my passion or just another option of job security. I’m interested in majoring in compsci. At the same time I really hate math. I don't really hate math but I’m currently struggling with AP calculus AB and l always had an A-, B in math class so it’s kind of a struggle for me. I don’t want to keep having to fail a college class and it will delay the time to complete my degree. Computer science is a hard major and I don’t know if I’m that strong for it. I have an interest in web development, I’ve self taught myself front end web development. I think l mostly like the design aspect of making a website and also bring my design to life through coding. I’m taking AP computer science principles in school. We are currently learning JavaScript. Tbh l like the class and l don’t, I always get a bad score on my assessment. But I like it when we get to make our own project from what we learned. I liked when l got stuck and later fixed my project. It makes me excited when I fix a problem. It’s mostly self learning too but with less explanation and I learn the best through videos. There are so many different career options for me if I majored in computer science so it is a huge advantage.

I have upcoming clinical externships for both Medical and Dental Assisting classes. I was thinking if I liked my experience I would probably continue with a healthcare career. I don’t have any internships/externships for a tech yet. I have applied for a tech internship at school but I was always on the waitlist. I was thinking of becoming a freelance web developer and designer, but I don't have a lot of time on me as it is my last year in high school and I have a lot on my plate. I need a mentor in a tech career. If you would like to be my mentor please PM me or l can PM you. I also would like to get an internship as a web developer before starting freelancing because I don't have real life experience yet. I am scared of becoming a bad freelancer to my clients and I don't really know the steps to take to get started as a freelancer and become a good one. 


I think I would enjoy working from home more than working in healthcare. The good part about being a nurse is that I can work just 3 times a week and have friends and family time through the other time I am not working. But as an employee in tech I would probably need to work everyday and would only get the weekend off, which I don't mind if I really love my job. I want to live a simple life and to be able to give back to my parents and community and those who have helped me a lot.

Money is also a decision factor when it comes to going to school. I do not know how I would be paying for college and my financial package does not seem like a lot. I can get an associate degree in nursing for cheaper and do an online bsn program for even cheaper. I could go the bootcamp route too for a cheaper price. I do not have a way to really pay for college too so that matters in what I decide. I need a Cheaper degree, higher career pay, less time to complete. I don’t want to sound petty but it’s my reality right now.

What major do you suggest I should commit to? Computer Science or Nursing? or are there any other Computer Science alternate majors you think would be beneficial for job seeking? Yea 
Should I take the bootcamp route or Major route? 

I apologize that this is really long. Your advice matters to me a lot. Thank you for your time. I would be posting this in other subreddits too so sorry if you see my rant a couple of times."

They informed me that I will have to solve a take home assignment and explain the code after it was reviewed. Moreover, in the assignment itself it says that during the call where I explain the code, they will ask me to make a ‘small’ change to the functionality/look.

The assignment is to make a login button which utilizes the google oauth api, then on successful login, show a page that consists of: a header where the name of the user is shown (taken from the oauth data), a dynamic search that filters results on each keystroke, and this search dynamically shows images (fetched from an external api which I have the liberty to choose). The image card must show the image itself, the title and 2sentence description. The filter must return only images that includes ‘substrings’ of either the title or description. 
All that with react. 


While I can do that with a little bit of google help, I still strongly believe this is somewhat overwhelming for an intern position which pays just a tiny bit above the minimum salary in my country.

Also, the ability to convert the internship to a full-time would also be a factor in the decision. I do want to say that the team I would be working on for TikTok (the database team) does seem to interest me a bit more than the Client Development Team for Twitter as I would ultimately want to be a backend programmer and it seems like the database team would align more with that.

Can I really just become a master of one language (Python) and make 6 figures? Do companies really hire ""Python Developers""? It just seems odd for a scripting language.

I'm only asking because I feel like I've started somewhat late in my CS career. I took a 2-year gap from college, and now I'm a senior at 23 with no CS internship experience (because I've been working the whole time while in school). I feel overwhelmed by the number of things and languages that I want to learn (including more Python), but it might just be more efficient to stick with one language and go from there.

Any insight would be much appreciated."

""my_qualifications:"" I'm a second-year law student in a not-so-known-outside-my-state college. I am planning to work with law firms after my graduation.

Recently I came across technology law during moot preps, and I got interested in it. So I read a few blogs and papers on the area, and now I'm planning to do internships with one or two research centres/organisations working in the area to see if I really like it. 

In the meantime, I'll be doing my first corporate law firm internship in the summer.

So currently, I'm focusing on corporate and commercial law internships (offline). I plan to do the technology law internships on the side (they are online internships). 

So if anyone here has any tips or suggestions on how to secure internships and later jobs, please do share (tech law as well as other corporate law areas).  Also, can anyone guide me on how to apply for internships at big 4 or corporations like Biocon?

Thank you!"

I'm a current junior studying CS and am lucky enough to have an internship at a top HFT firm lined up for this summer. I noticed, however, that a bunch of my friends have LinkedIn recruiters blowing up their DMs while I've personally applied to each place without a recruiter contact. 

It would save me a bunch of time senior year if recruiters would reach out to me instead of me applying, as I have heard having a recruiter contact can skip you a few rounds forward in the process. I  even have friends who have automatically been pushed to final rounds because of recruiter contacts. 

Anyways, beyond keeping an updated profile, is there anything I can tangibly do to get recruiters in my LinkedIn DMs? Should I find them on LinkedIn and add them myself? Do I have to start writing cringe LinkedIn posts?

I made it to a final round of interviews where I have a take home project, and during the first two interviews the recruiter did not post any salary/hourly ranges at all, and just glanced over it. I am not going to take a pay cut and I want a decent pay bump if im going to leave my current super chill job for a temporary internship.

I'm basically preparing for off-season internships for 2023 and my current plan is to apply for summer and move to another season (if they let me that is). To be more specific I believe Citadel, HRT and JS are the only ones I can think of that have off-season so my prep would be for these three.

With that said, I have about \~6 months to prepare for the next season and was wondering if it's worth it to practice competitive programming instead of LeetCode for these HFT interviews? I've heard conflicting advice about this so wanted to learn from what worked for other people.

I'm not too worried about OS/concurrency type qs since I've taken/am taking those courses now and will be supplementing either competitive programming/LeetCode practice with systems design.

sjs8w6,242,2022-02-03,I've survived the obesity bootcamp,inletharn,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sjs8w6/ive_survived_the_obesity_bootcamp/,"I’ve always had problems with my weight, as far as I can remember. When I was just 11 I’ve been diagnosed with first-degree obesity and with time things got only worse. Bullying at school, inability to participate in most activities that required anything more than just sitting and watching, disrespect and laughs from kids in my neighborhood… As I grew up I didn’t develop any good social skills that could help me in socializing, like being “that funny guy” or being “a shoulder to cry on”, no. I was just a thing inside of myself, who knew nothing better than devouring tons of ice-cream and chicken wings to eat out all those insults and stress they caused. I felt trapped and alone. It was an infinite loop.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve made some attempts to become a better self through the years. Oh, I can’t remember all those “this is the day” moments, when I got up and went jogging, only to find myself spitting the lungs out after couple of hundred of meters, or even less. And of course, such demotivating did no good, so “those days” never ever turned into “those weeks” or “those couple of days” at least. I wish.

&amp;#x200B;

As I grew up, finished the school, got into college and graduated the problem didn’t perish. Quite the opposite - it became worse. I got myself some health issues, I could barely get out of bed at some point.

My life became a succession of depression, self pity and feeling of guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

But as you know, behind every successful man stands a brilliant woman. That woman for me was named Heather. One day as I was sitting by my desk, going through forms and reports I had to submit - she walked in to the office. Heather was the intern, who would stay with us for half a year and our boss, who introduced her said she had really high hopes that this will grow in further employment. As I saw the beauty of her smile, her cascading platinum hair and those eyes… I knew she was the one.

But I couldn’t find the courage to speak to her, not even speaking of asking her out.

That day I decided that I have six months to shape myself, find my spine and get her to know the better me. Period.

&amp;#x200B;

Believe it or not - next couple of weeks were my proudest: I got myself a gym pass, threw out all the junk stuff from my fridge, read ton of articles on diets and how to lose weight. I must admit - that was also the hardest time of my life. Plus, my budget was gone. I had a pretty average job, no savings or good friends to borrow from. So as a result - I was on my own: no personal trainers or trendy food products, no exotic fat-burning pills or whatsoever. Dang, even healthy eating they talk about on the health forums is expensive as hell compared to my previous diet. But despite all the difficulties, I had some good news: firstly - my doctor said that, even though my health is not perfect I could go for light to moderate exercise load. And secondly - after just two weeks there was some obvious progress - I’ve lost couple of kilos. The bad part in it, was that it was not nearly enough - I had a lot of work to do.

&amp;#x200B;

And I did my best every single day. I found the will inside and didn’t go cold turkey even once, though temptations were all around. The hardest part was when we had “taco day” at work. The smells almost knocked me off, but I pulled myself together and didn’t take anything else but some bowl of salad with feta cheese, completely ignoring couple of laughs at my back from some of the guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Three months later I’ve stepped on the weights and my happiness knew no boundaries: I was steadily losing weight. Seeing it melting skyrocketed my mood. “I can do this” - I’ve said to myself back then.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of this whole story. A week later I’ve discovered that the scales don’t show any change compared to the previous result. It felt like I even gained some. With heavy feeling nesting inside of me I understood that I’d hit the so called “plateu” - the period when you reach your maximum potential at the time, and no matter what you do - you can’t change it. Here, the stale potential meant my weight, which also meant that my chances with Heather were growing thin. I had less than three months left to hit my milestone, and even though I did some colossal work on myself and got some compliments from co-workers - that was clearly not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I refused to give up - I’ve doubled my exercise time, increased weights and decreased food amounts, but that left me exhausted, not improved. I’ve tried to follow my previous routine, but in the long run - just lost couple more weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I was losing the battle I made myself fight. And for another painful fact - I’ve overheard Heather talking with some other colleagues, that she actually is not really planning to stay with us for longer period, as she got couple of offers from other companies already, so she’d be probably gone by the end of her internship.

Yes, I know. At this point you’re probably asking what was I thinking working myself out straight to the grave, obsessed with a random girl. But did you actually for once in your life fell in love with somebody?

Did you love anybody so much, that you decided to change your own life at 180 degrees?

&amp;#x200B;

So, yeah. There I was, a half-complete man, with an empty wallet, fridge full of spinach and fat-free dairy products and a yearning under the heart. You know, if at that point somebody would come in and suggest me a guy, who knows a guy, who can get me a tapeworm - I wouldn’t really think twice. That’s how low I was.

&amp;#x200B;

The solution arrived unexpectedly. I was browsing through some web pages and saw this context ad on one of them: “Are you not happy with your jelly belly? Nothing seems to work? Come train with us!”. And there was an animated image of a guy transforming from a blob to a muscular dude. Yeah, I know - it looked cheesy AF. But somehow I clicked the banner and went to their site. It was a simple page with “Fight the fat. Give it a boot” slogan and some info.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a description of the “obesity bootcamp for those who lost all hope”, as they describe it. Blah-blah-blah, hundreds of successful “graduates”, some nutrition facts. Regular stuff. Actually it didn’t look anything impressive. They didn’t even have contact phone (not that I wanted to call them). Just the email and address. And there were at least two benefits: they were local and so cheap, I could actually afford it.

So I thought - what’s the harm and decided to pay them a visit.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just a half an hour ride from my place, so later that evening I was at the place. It was in the industrial district close to the city edge, and it took me some time to find the right building. It was a large hangar-type structure surrounded with mesh fence and probably that should raise a couple of flags, but hey - I’ve seen couple of videos people doing crossfit in places much worse than that. It had no signs or advertising around, just a couple of ordinary sheets of paper adjusted together with tape and big plain letters printed on: “Obesity bootcamp”. There were two sets of doors - a regular one and the big gate, probably for industrial machines to go through and out. Again - potential red flag. But the whole cocktail of desperation, being broke and a pinch of hope made me ignore it. “Besides, probably, as those guys charge so little for their training - they can’t afford fancy stuff yet“ - my exact thought at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

So I grabbed myself, pulled the door handle and stepped in.  And that was the last thing I remember about that day.

I woke up surrounded with complete darkness, so deep I couldn’t see the tips of my fingers. To be honest - at that very moment I didn’t even panic, as I couldn’t understand where I was and what happened. It all came moments later. Suddenly, I’ve realized that I can not move. No, not like that. I wasn’t restrained or cuffed, no. My whole body itched, I could feel something touching my shoulder and my another shoulder, and my back. As realization kicked in the heart started to skip beats - I was kept in a squatting position in a room so tight, that I could not turn around. And what’s even worse - the ceiling on top was touching my shoulder blades. But the real horror began as my brain registered that there’s also no way back or forward - as if I was sitting in a box made of concrete.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn’t stretch my arms or legs, lie down, stand up.  I could barely turn my body an inch. I began screaming uncontrollably, losing my sanity in a flood of primal fear that drowned the crumbling pieces of my ability to think rationally. I think I’ve passed out right away. But it’s hard to tell. I woke up, dreaming that it all was a nightmare and I’m still in my bed. That all of this was caused by stress and my inability to hit my goals. But again, as I’ve opened my eyes - there was nothing but pitch black. And the smell of my urine, as I must have lost control over my bladder as I’ve lost consciousness.

Another thing I understood - my pants are still dry, because I wasn’t wearing them. I was completely naked.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve tried to listen, if I could hear anything around - not a sound. I’ve tried shouting on top of my lungs asking for help, screaming something about that I have money if they want it, begging, threatening that people know where I am and will go to police. Nothing. Absolute nothingness.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty soon my whole body began to shake because of my pose, exhaustion and that damn weight that made it even harder. Worst thing was - I couldn’t even collapse. Somehow I pulled my shoulders together, tossed my body around and was able to land on my ass. It felt much much better at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I’ve started to think about possible ways out. If they put me in - there has to be a door, or an opening. But soon I gave up on that idea - after what must have felt like hours of touching, and pushing my surroundings I didn’t find more than solid concrete. Left, right, bottom, top. Even if there was a secret door or something - it probably would open only outside. Another discovery was that the walls were covered with moist moss and there were couple of slimy things poking from it. As I’ve inspected them blindly with my fingers - I came with a conclusion that those were mushrooms.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no track of time there. What does it matter if it’s night or day, Monday or Friday when you can’t see anything than abyss gazing back at you. My only clock was my own body - at first I got the sense of reality only by intense pain in my limbs or my arse from sitting in the same position, so I had to twirl in my stone prison just like a blind helpless maggot on a frying pan, trying to displace my hurting parts to relieve the pain from the pressure. I had a lot of time to think. I thought about how I would die: would it be from thirst, hunger, blockage of blood vessels or something worse. But somehow I’ve managed through. I lived of licking the moist from the walls and eating moss and mushrooms. At first it really bothered me if those were poisonous and would end my life in painful convulsions, but as time passed - that ending started to seem not that grim after all, so I gave it a try and ate one.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t throw up or feel any pain, I didn’t die with foam bursting out of my mouth or whatever poisonous mushrooms do to your body. Thirst was actually much worse - I’ve sat there with a constant headache and charred lips, licking them all the time with my swollen cracked tongue dreaming of nothing more but regular glass of water. It was absolutely inhuman. I’ve lost a lot of water at the same time - I’ll spare you the sensitive details, but soon my prison space smelled like the worst pits of hell. At first I was thinking of drinking my own urine to maintain the water balance, but it was practically impossible considering the pose I was staying at and my ability to move.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I don’t know how I didn’t lose my sanity back there. There must have be something in me that helped me, or I am just that stupid to realize the whole spectrum of terror I was trapped in.

&amp;#x200B;

Some infinity later, and I could never tell  how much time of endless waking up with hunger and thirst, and stink and misery, and thoughts of my demise passed in this void of dark and concrete - I developed some nasty cough. “So probably it would be tuberculosis that will kill me”- just a thought in my head, no regret, no panic. By the time I had a pretty thick beard and mustache, my hair all greasy and grown, my skin itching of dirt and only God knows how I didn’t get any infection from all the shit I was sitting in. Every movement returned with intense pain, my throat burned with fire, my lungs were suffocating me. And then I heard…

&amp;#x200B;

As if somebody standing in a building across the road screaming - the sound was coming heavily muted from somewhere above. It was a person screaming. As suddenly it started - it stopped. Just to be picked up with another scream - this time the voice was more high-pitched, as if the woman was shrieking. And another one, and another one. They were starting and ending  in mere moments and sounded just as if they were getting closer to me. “I’ve probably started to hear better as I can’t rely on my sight, so the hearing got enhanced…” - the thought went though my mind. And as I was rolling the thought around - I’ve heard extremely loud grinding of metal and stone just above my head. My heart froze instinctively as adrenaline caused by sudden fear kicked right in to  my blood. The ceiling was lifting up, and the light of the thousand suns was getting into my cell from the seams between. I’ve closed my eyes and stretched my arms towards the increasing opening, with my heart beating like a war drum I was ready to fight for my life with all I had left in my tortured body.

&amp;#x200B;

As my fingers felt the edge of the hole I’ve been kept in and a gap big enough for me to get out without hitting my head - I sprang out, almost breaking my hips and my knees and crawled out shouting like crazy. Surprisingly, as I’ve stood up on my shaking legs it became clear that the edge of my prison with the lid off touches my stomach. And then suddenly I heard the round of applause. That was so surprising - I absolutely didn’t expect that. Punches - yes, knife stab - probably, gunshot - highly likely. But applause? I couldn’t resist to open my eyes to see around. Worst mistake ever - it felt life nails dug deep into my eyeballs instantly. All I could register were the silhouettes of people standing around and myriad of light above. My legs wobbled, I felt like all the blood in my body rushed up and the world around started to spin. The last thing I recall was this low smooth male voice saying; “Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our next graduate. George…“

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up in the hospital. I’ve been put into medical coma due to the condition my body was in. I had severe muscle atrophy, dehydration, malnutrition and bunch of other stuff that traumatized me for life. Doctors said I was lucky enough not to get some irreversible  damage to my health that would turn lethal in the long run, but since that incident I walk with the cane and it is staying with me till I die. Seven more people were discovered in condition similar to me - all at random locations across our city. Not all were as lucky as I: some of them ended in asylum, some, God rest their souls - in the cemetery. Police checked the address for the bootcamp but couldn’t find anything but cells we’ve been kept in. No sign of our captors, not a single fingerprint or DNA trace. Yes, even the serious guys were there to check. The website went down just hours after I disappeared, meaning I was the unlucky last. I’ve spent more than three months in a stone tomb. I’ve survived the obesity bootcamp."

sjsrwv,15,2022-02-03,Breaking into Corporate Banking,CynicalDecadence,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/sjsrwv/breaking_into_corporate_banking/,"Hi guys,

I’m a current sophomore in a target school looking to break into corporate banking as an analyst at a BB after graduating. 

I’m in several pre-professional organizations/clubs here but they all focus on IB/S&amp;T recruiting prep (most of the people in my clubs end up in IB) so it’s not a lot of help. 

A few questions:

* Right now the biggest issue I have is a low GPA. I currently have a 3.0 cumu GPA, 3.5 major GPA. 

I should be able to raise it to at least 3.30 cumu by the time this semester ends since I’m taking a drastically lighter load after switching from an engineering major to a finance major. Only 2/8 classes my freshman year counted for my GPA since our uni mandated all intro classes to be Pass/Fail, so my GPA can fluctuate a bit more. 

How competitive would a 3.3 from a Target school be in BB corporate banking recruitment? How would I integrate it into my resume (if at all?)



* What are some of the resources I could use to prepare for corporate banking technicals? I know its a bit different to the IB technicals I’ve been taught.

* I have a Credit Analyst internship position at a regional bank back home this upcoming summer. How helpful would this position be for corp banking? 

* When does recruiting for CB Summer 2023 start? I know it’s started for IB but I haven’t seen CB yet."

I’m hoping the projects can make up for not having an internship. I also might go into eth blockchain programming career wise so I’m hoping the club can help since that’s a more niche career. 

However, I’m really stressed out that if I don’t get an internship this summer (I have applied to more but have been rejected or not heard back from most. Have an interview today and am still sorta in the running for another 3 but I don’t have much hope), I won’t be able to get one next summer and/or I won’t be able to get a job.

I've been feeling really out of place lately, and like maybe I'm not cut out for cs. I'm a girl, and I have this stereotype in my head that programmers are skinny pasty white/asian nerdy guys who are antisocial geniuses who spend all their free time programming/leetcoding/just being inherently talented with computers. Originally this deterred me from even majoring in CS despite loving programming in high school. I'm glad I got over that, and it is lowkey too late for me to switch majors now anyway, but I definitely am feeling a lot like a failure and like I might not be inherently talented enough (I am objectively very intelligent but I'm not a genius). Also like I've failed because I haven't done enough yet and can't get an internship. 

I'm also the only girl on the entire tech team for the crypto club I'm on, let alone the only girl in my subgroup. It hasn't been helping with the whole feeling out of place thing. I'm doing a ""girl"" hackathon in late February because I've never done one before and I think maybe it'll be a nice way to connect w/other girls or something and feel a bit less out of place idk. 

Anyway, the point of this post isn't that I am a girl, that's just adding to the feeling out of place. Point is just that I feel like such a failure because I can't get an internship for this summer let alone a FAANG one like everyone on this sub seems to, and I was wondering if it's realistically that bad in terms of internships for next year and getting a job after I graduate? Also if anyone else didn't have an internship sophomore year and did junior year that would be similarly reassuring. Have lowkey been panicking for the last month :|"

I will be graduating with a CompE BS this Spring, but returning to school to complete an MS, also in CompE. This Summer, however, I am in the market for what will be my 2nd internship in the field. The company I worked for last Summer is planning to pay me what they pay a standard 2nd-time intern who is still working towards their BS. Would I be out of line to be looking for a rate higher than this since I hold a degree? Or are salary expectations generally based solely on total industry experience? I understand fully that any internship is paid less than its full-time counterpart due to the gravity of roles expected to be performed, as well as the difference in commitment to the company. But does a completed degree warrant a higher wage expectation? I appreciate any and all personal experiences and I thank you for any responses."

I'm a French guy that will be graduated from a BS MSc soon, and I'm still looking for a trading floor role matching my wishes.

Indeed, my previous internships helped me to know what I don’t want but not exactly about what I want.

I am really interested in programming languages, I love spending time on elaborating some models on Python or VBA, and straining myself for answering this frequent question “Where does the error come from?”. It is a real pleasure to match financial markets and coding, especially around Machine / Deep Learning with scikit-learn or tensorflow.

Also, I seek a role where I can have commercial relations, where I can have real relations with clients. I don’t want to only work in the shadow of the bank but to have the opportunity to switch between spending time on algorithms to fill a client’s need, and to attend to clients meetings.

To add something more, I am looking for a role which is in a trading floor for the dynamic atmosphere we can find. I am not a morning person, so having a dynamic activity at the beginning of the day can really help me to be productive. Moreover, I really enjoyed the dynamism all along the days.

To give you some contexts, I was intern as assistant broker, and as derivatives analyst in a stock exchange. More for the first one than for the second, I spent my time off during 1 year to write some VBA scripts combining with Bloomberg for making quicker the company processes. I felt I really wanted to improve my coding skills and it was a way to add some technical complexities to my experiences. With my last MSc I am currently following, I definitely improve my skills in Python.
Now I am kind of lost as there remains one last future internship to know what I really want for a full-time job then.

I wondered if you can give ideas about career paths in financial markets that can match these role criteria.
Thank you guys for your useful answers that can guide me !"

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all! Wishing everyone positive vibes this application cycle.

Coming from a nontraditional background with limited mentors in the bschool world, I would appreciate any advice as the tuition deposit deadline creeps up. I was fortunate enough to get admits from Haas, Sloan and a few others.  I'm having difficulty choosing between Haas vs MIT.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Background Info:** *(sharing stats in case it helps anyone)*

\- Career Goals: Interested in climatetech and entrepreneurship, exploring climatetech vc. (more focus on the hardtech startup ecosystem - tougher to decarbonize industries)

\- Long-Term Career Considerations: Want to work internationally for 2-3 years at some point. Would be open to exploring future careers in the nonprofit/think tank/public sector space.

\- Background: O&amp;G Engineer (3 yrs) in the South + Nuclear Engineer (2 yrs) in NE

\- Undergrad: Small State School with BS in Engineering / Economics

\- GMAT: 760, GPA: 3.8, ORM

&amp;#x200B;

**Haas Pros/Con**

\- Weather and things to do

\- Stronger local entrepreneurship ecosystem

\- Stronger climatetech network in Bay

\- May want to be in Cali long-term

\- Better soft skill development

\- Internship with company of choice, more options

\- Larger scholarship (\~$20k)

\------ MBA/MEng program is new, no established network and inflexible curriculum

\------ Student-run clubs/activities are fragmented, not as structured

\------- Students say have to ""hustle harder"" to get similar roles as GSB, no equiv for MIT/HBS in Boston

\------ Less alumni outside west coast

&amp;#x200B;

**Sloan Pros/Cons**

\- MIT is known as the best engineering school in the world, global brand prestige (uncertain on where I want to end up)

\- LGO network is super tight-knit and very responsive/supportive

\- 6-month guaranteed industry internship (recent focus on sustainability internships)

\- Less stress internship hunting, more time in coursework / building relationships

\- Starts in June 2022 so more time building relationships and learning

\- Quant-heavy, pro bc its how I best learn

\--------- Internship is a semester away from campus

\--------- Boston Weather

\--------- Less LGO alumni interest in entrepreneurship, but recently shifting

\--------- Some of the LGO classes are too operations-focused for my liking

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Similarities**

\- Action-oriented learning

\- Equiv b-school rep, experience, and culture

\- Both campuses are conveniently located

\- Equal access to top PhD students working on Innovation

\- Similar sustainability classes -&gt; C2M (Haas) and S-Lab (MIT)

\- Comparable scholarship $'s (70% vs 55%)

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Options** (limited financial resources, makes taking on debt daunting)

\- Current role &gt;120k with great WLB, concerned about opportunity cost.

\- Save money and pursue a part-time program or pivot into roles through networking

\- Attend 1 yr program (Also INSEAD, Said admit)

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear what other things I should consider!

sjy5x9,821,2022-02-03,"High compensation is good for the industry, it's stupid to suppress this knowledge. Tech workers add tons of value to companies and are thus compensated well. See others posting high TC/salaries as meaning it is something you can do too later on, not despair because you aren't quite there right now.",CSMask,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sjy5x9/high_compensation_is_good_for_the_industry_its/,"This sub was heavily focused on MANGA level jobs early on. With tech being more mainstream, other people came in who are just looking for a better job/career switch than their shitty previous underpaid job. The problem is, they take their experience of being exploited and think it is okay. They take lower salaries and are ""content"" with being paid a livable wage as it's already an improvement to their situation. They think us tech workers are ungrateful and greedy when in fact, they were just being exploited.

Tech being paid well is good, no matter where you are in the compensation spectrum. It pushes normal salaries higher too. Also, it doesn't matter if you are being exploited and somehow only make minimum wage as someone in the tech industry, you can actually do things to get a better job and even enter MANGA/Big tech companies later on in your career. Will you go from 50k to 200k by doing 1 Leetcode a day? Not necessarily. But if you add learning relevant skills to that? Maybe not 200k but 100-150k is definitely possible and from there, it's a stepping stone to 200k+.

As people in tech, we should know our worth. If you aren't getting a raise every year, you lose money to inflation. Be prepared to jump if you still don't get a significant raise in a year.

On a serious note, can everyone graduate and get a 200k job? No. Even a 150k+ offer is usually built on some combination of school prestige, internships and LC practice/natural talent. It is a strong, well built foundation. You will not get this as a career switcher or even as a bootcamper (immediately as your first job. But reaching this later on in your career is easily possible) . However, you can get similiar compensation later on in your career especially if you take the steps needed for it. Do not see high salaries/TC as something to be depressed about. Instead, see it as something you can reach especially if you see what steps the other person did to reach it. When I was in school, this sub was great for me making a foundation to just get a job. I was able to secure one internship and make a couple of nice projects and quickly secured a 65k job in an LCOL area. 3 years later, I got into big tech with 270k.

For me, my path was simple. I followed the path of job hopping. I do not do LC hard and if I get one, I'll rely on natural talent to solve it which means it will be far from being efficient, even if I do solve it. I did however, interview a lot early on and improved/grinded my interview skills as well as casually study/apply tech that was high in demand.

I had heard great things about Asana's wlb, culture, and of course food so I was very interested in the company. My background is pretty average: fourth year cs major at a state school,1 internship after my third year at a big defense company (think Lockheed, Boeing, etc.), and no notable projects other than school related projects on my resume.

My Full Timeline:

Early October, 2021: Applied and got Codesignal about half an hour after applying.

Mid October, 2021: Completed Codesignal with score of 804.

Mid October, 2021: Email from recruiter that capacity was almost full for New Grad Software Engineers so no interview.

Early January, 2022: Touched back with recruiter to see if any positions had opened up. Same day was told interviews had resumed and was able to schedule a phone screen.

Mid January, 2022: Had 1 hour phone screen, received pass to onsite later that day.

End of January, 2022: Onsite with Asana (3 rounds technical, 1 round casual chat) for a total of 5 hours and 15 minutes.

Early February, 2022: Received email saying there were ""updates"" on my interviews. Scheduled call with recruiter a few days later and received verbal offer then written offer in email.

This was my first time really grinding the interview process/leetcode and I defintely learned a lot along the way. Asana was one of my top companies when I started this process so very happy to have received this offer. I mostly studied leetcode for other companies so shifting gears to prepare for Asana's OOD/Sys design interivew style was an interesting change."

I recently got the admit in MS CS from NYU Tandon, and they have given 28th Feb 2022 as the last date for accepting the admits, along with 500 USD(non-refundable) fees. I have applied to almost 7 other colleges, and I am optimistic that at least in 3-4 colleges I should be getting admitted, which IMO should be ranked better than NYU Tandon, both in terms of cs-ranking and education fees.

Colleges I have applied to:

1. UT Austin
2. UCSD
3. UW Madison
4. UMass Amherst
5. Stony Brook
6. Georgia Tech
7. Purdue
8. NEU Boston(Still need to submit the application)

As for most of the above-mentioned colleges, they release theirs admits in March.

Options I am left with:

1. Not paying 500 USD for NYU Tandon, and waiting for other admits. (Very very risky)
2. Pay 500 USD, and wait for other admits. (500$ is not a small amount)

Also, please have a look at my profile, suggesting do I really have a shot in the above-mentioned lists or I should blindly go with NYU with no hope whatsoever.

&gt;***Profile***:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Undergrad College**: IIT (**BTech in CSE)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**CGPA**: 7.43/10  
&gt;  
&gt;**GRE**: 318(169Q, 149V)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Toefl**: 98  
&gt;  
&gt;**Internship**: One 6 month internship at hyperlocal delivery based start-up(an Indian start-up, backed by Google)  
&gt;  
&gt;**WorkEx**: Nearly 2 years of work ex in one of India’s top trading firm as Quantitative Analysts  
&gt;  
&gt;**Extra Curriculum**: ACM ICPC Amritapuri Regionalist in 2019  
&gt;  
&gt;*No research paper*

Please help me solve this dilemma. Thank you so much.

&amp;#x200B;

***UPDATE:*** I mailed them for extension, and NYU Tandon has extended the deadline to accept the admit till 1st April, 2022. And what I thought was more than enough time, doesn't look like now. So far, only UWM has given a reject, and I didn't hear anything from any other universities.  

Should I try mailing them again for an extension, my concern is that may sound as I am not interested in accepting the admit. 

Or is there still some hope for me to wait for this week. 

And at what date, should I move ahead with NYU Tandon?

**Letters of Recommendation**

Spanish teacher - (no rate) - Been my teacher twice, I have good memories w them and I think they think I am a good student. I also have helped them set up their classroom and sharpen pencils. I passed the AP exam as well and tried my best not to turn in late work

Bio teacher - (no rate) -Been my teacher twice, a sponsor for one of my clubs and has seen my do all these science competitions. I have also spent many hours in their class after school or just talking abt things. I think it’s positive 

Counselor rec - (can’t rate) - This was def bland asf, probably a restate of my transcript and maybe a normal “hardworking student…. Good addition to your school

**Interviews**
None !

**Essays**

PS was abt feeling left out and how learning a language helped me learn how to talk to new ppl and to the ppl I felt left out from too. I think I’m from many different communities and at times I feel like instead of being some person who has a wider perspective and can chill with everyone, I feel like someone who belongs nowhere. I think my ps showed that vulnerable side of me and it wasn’t a happy ending where I finally feel included, I talked about how im still learning and still in this story. 


Why major: why stem 2 social science, talked abt COVID and it’s effects on me etc. 

Why Rice: cool community, plan/participate in niche school things (how I wanna contribute to the cool)

What perspective: common app essay pt2. How im feeling left out and eventually going back to my childhood home helps me feel better ab fitting in. How at rice I wanna make sure everyone would fit in too.

**Takeaways:**

I think that I tried my best to put my best foot forward. I didn’t really have help with this process, my custodial parent didn’t go to college and my non custodial did but even then I have limited contact and it was online school so the process is very very different. This sub and A2C rlly helped me out a lot, it helped me learn that ECs and grades matter, it helped me learn to write essays, and although it did hurt my confidence it built me up in so many other ways.  I tried my best to show myself as someone who wants to inspire change, is interested in science, and really wants to help ppl and learn about other perspectives. 

Ik some ppl might say it was mainly AA, I genuinely think being from a low income school helped a lot more bc you’re evaluated with the context of the resources given to you and I used majority of the ones given to me. But idk, def race could’ve helped w “building a diverse class”, but it wouldn’t change an app from Spongebob into Sheldon Cooper. I don’t really know for sure what got me in, but I know that people in previous yrs w similar ECs who don’t benefit from AA have gotten into T5-T20 too. 

**Advice**

In no way am I an expert and my advice should be taken w a grain of salt, but I still wanna offer some!

The obv is getting good grades/test scores and participating in good ECs. Idk abt spikes and what not, but I think it’s good to have some ECs towards one thing and some towards others (not a complete jack of all trades and not a complete eggs in one basket). For example: if you’re interested in Science I think it’s good to make sure that not all of your classes are STEM/all AP scores are STEM and all 10 spots and 5 awards are STEM related. 

I think that LOR/Essays are the ones that make you stand out and it’s important to focus on those too. I think some good writing practice would be practicing creative writing even if it’s 2 sentence-100 word horror stories, also getting comfortable abt writing abt yourself. I found that listening to songs/podcasts etc. helped me figure out the energy I wanted to give in my essays. A2C has excellent writing resources too ! 

For LORs I think these are rlly important as well, try to develop real relationships with the ppl you will ask. Try to have real conversations with them outside of just school, ask them for advice and show interest in their classes as well. If possible without sacrificing quality, try asking teachers who teach different fields (stem vs humanities) to show a wider perspective of who you are. 

I hope seeing my profile could help anyone, and if you got questions pm me!"

Im ngl, these last 4 years FLEW by, it is scary to think about. COVID definitely chopped up the time, but all in all, this time went by super quickly. Is anyone else feeling nervous about graduating? We will have to abandon our college lifestyles and are expected to get jobs and all that. Even though I have another 1.5 terms left, I dont feel ready. Maybe its due to my own preconceived notions my parents and I built, but it just doesnt feel right yet. My parents expected me to get internships and have the mindset that it is the norm to have a job already lined up after you graduate. But I dont have those and its scary to think that in \~4 months this will all be done. Throughout the day, I will often stop and take in the moment because time seems to move so quickly and it feels nice to ''stop'' time even if its for 10 seconds.

I am pursuing my masters in CS(underground was in CS too), but have pivoted from a 2 year non tech entrepreneurship. I had different ambitions before, so did not have any internships through the college. But, due to the pandemic, all my plans were shattered and had to come back to grad school.

I haven't received any internship opportunities for the coming summer, and most of the companies have told that I needed to have more internship work experience.

Any tips to get that first INTERNSHIP?

Also if any recruiters reading this, please understand that every person cannot be a ideal candidate with those solid three internships before college. Look at the complete scenario before rejecting."

skk132,57,2022-02-04,Out of college for 3 years and still no industry job. Please help.,csjumpstart,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/skk132/out_of_college_for_3_years_and_still_no_industry/,"Hey y'all. I graduated in 2019 with a computer science degree and a minor in Art. I've been applying to jobs since then but there's still no luck. Before anyone asks about internships, I did have one lined up but due to life events, I had to unfortunately decline it at the very last minute.

During the rest of 2019 up until COVID hit in 2020, I was applying for jobs left and right but I didn't even land an interview. Multiple recruiters wasted my time and I've felt hesitant to respond to recruiters every since. Towards the end of 2020, one of my parents was also diagnosed with cancer so I had to give up looking for a career and come home for about a year to take care of them and thankfully, they're doing much better now.

I'm in the process of moving back into the city where I used to live at and making it a priority to apply for jobs in the city for entry level positions.   


With no industry experience, no form of networking, no internships, is it feasible for me to just apply on my own? What would you recommend that I should learn/do to make my resume more approachable, at least for an interview? I've never even obtained an interview for a programming job. 

The only real job I've had for years is working with my parents and even then, they've discouraged me from getting any other job for the longest time and coerced me into just working for them. So I really have one job under my belt but plenty of volunteer work that I did during my time in university.

Sorry for this being a bit lengthy, but I am a bit desperate to make ends meet independently and I am completely lost. I'm being as open as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance."

I want to try and get an internship in the fall. I have an internship that I’ll be completing this summer but when I’m sending out applications for the fall, I want my resume to reflect that I’ll have completed another software engineering internship in the summer especially because it’s my first one, so my resume needs it. 

How do I put this on a resume since I don’t have that much details on what I’ll be doing yet?"

It is a tier 3 college so placements are rare. I have a fair bit of programming skills. I have created some django projects, a 2D unity game, some basic android apps using Kivy python framework.

My DSA is not that good but i can work on it. 

I gave an interview at statup and i am getting a job offer for web development. They are asking for a bond of 1 year with 3 month unpaid internship and then full time job. Salary will be 14k. Now i am not sure to go with this job or not.

Also i like app development a bit more than web development.

Should i join here or improve my DSA and programming skills more instead? And what projects can be good for resume?"
skl5yc,2,2022-02-04,"I am so goddamn burned out, software engineers make everything so goddamn fucking complicated",Lost-Audience8900,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/skl5yc/i_am_so_goddamn_burned_out_software_engineers/,"I work as a software engineer and it just gets fucking mentally exhausting sometimes

Here's what pisses me off: everyone just makes everything so much more difficult than it needs to be. Maybe it's out of ego, maybe it's well-intentioned, but everything *could* be so much easier than it is now.

It's hard to even describe to non software engineers so imagine this: you are a chef running a restaurant. You gotta choose a few menu specials for a Friday night, and it's gonna be a BIG crowd. Okay, maybe just make some classics with a little twist. Maybe you'll make a steak bordelaise, bouillabaisse, coq au vin, a french onion soup. For some pizazz maybe a nice charcuterie board. Every chef knows how to make them, the ingredients are readily available, and you can focus on the quality. So you tell the chefs to prepare for the dinner rush and leave

So you come back and one chef decided steak bordelaise is lame and decided to use beefsteak mushrooms instead of steak because that would be more interesting. You gotta confront him and say ""umm but why? Why would you do that?"", and he just says he knows better than you. Then you say ""... how are you gonna make the bordelaise sauce without the steak fat?"" and he's just like ""wait what? What do you mean?""... fucking what? Don't you know your fundamentals?

Then there's someone else who's just completely off-script and is making fried rice for some reason. You ask him why and he's just like ""isn't this wok neat? 🙂I really wanted to try it out"", but... we are a French restaurant, what are you even doing?

There's some guy saying we need to switch out the entire menu and instead focus solely on Nigerian-inspired soups because that's gonna be the new trend just you wait, but can't seem to even manage to cook an egg correctly.

For some reason the intern that's been there for a few days has been promoted to manager and added steak tartare to the menu to impress some bosses but there's no chef suitable to make that dish without giving everyone food poisoning

There's one person who's convinced that the more ingredients he adds, the more ""complex"" the flavor will be and therefore better.

There's another person who absolutely refuses to follow any recipes cause that ""stifles his creativity""

then the person cutting up stuff decided to take another job. For some reason, no one else knows how to cut onions. Also, no one can figure out when the onion shipments were, who the supplier was, anything. After deeper investigation it's not clear where he was even getting these onions in the first place"

The first so far, and only interview that I have been able to land for an onsite internship is labeled as Cyber Security Intern. It is with a small company from my hometown. What will a cyber security internship consist of? I am eager to continue learning and expand my knowledge, and plan to go into some sort of software development in the future, I do enjoy writing code. It just seems that this may be a major step down for some of the bigger companies ""software engineering"" labeled jobs that have a few more qualifications.

To maximize my skills and employability, do I aim for an internship or devote to projects/self-teaching for the summer?

Hi everyone,

I’m a college junior, and I fell ass backward into comp sci and have really enjoyed it, so now I'm speed running my college’s cs curriculum. That meant CS50 and discrete math in the fall and Data Structures, Algorithms, and an elective right now. 

Where I'm at is 1) I have 0 experience and just one real project under my belt (my CS50 final project) and 2) I have minimal skills now but in three months I’ll have a lot more. For the summer, my goal is just to do what will put me in the best position to get a job come the interview cycle my senior year (don’t care about FAANG, just tryna be able to feed myself by writing code). 

As I see it, my options are:

1. try and land an internship this summer, despite having fairly minimal skills at the time of application (no idea how I’d remotely go about a technical interview if I even got one)
2. spend the summer working on projects, grinding leetcode, honing actual programming skills via freecodecamp or something (since the CS curriculum at my school is fairly conceptual with relatively little programming).

Additional details that may affect my prospects: 

1. I attend an Ivy 

2. I’m a first-gen low-income URM student (I know there are some programs for students from my background, but the ones I know of are targeted toward first-years and sophomores.)

Basically, what would you do if you were me? I’ve pored over other posts and the sidebar, and it still seems like my situation is fairly unique. I’d seriously appreciate anybody’s advice. Thanks a million."
sknt9k,679,2022-02-04,The Agency: Part 5 - Don't Let the Door Hit You,Mr_Cartographer,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/sknt9k/the_agency_part_5_dont_let_the_door_hit_you/,"Hello everyone!  This is the next story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, wherein **$BadMike** receives everything he so richly deserves.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$BadMike**: My first nemesis.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Sort of my superior at this point.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: Operations manager.  Very awesome, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.
* **$AwesomeRed**: Very awesome and intelligent analyst.  She was my best friend in the office.

When last we left off, all pretensions of cordiality that the GIS team had towards **$BadMike** evaporated.  He had mouthed off to me in a meeting, blaming me for his own failures that had clearly resulted from his laziness and incompetence.  In response, I'd filed a formal complaint against him.  I didn't really expect anything to come of it - after all, we'd been putting up with this behavior for over two years at that point - but at least I had been honest and said what I needed to say.  After all, if a person looks, sounds, and acts like dog sh\*t, more than likely they are dog sh\*t, not a GIS Analyst.

Following the Incident^(TM), **$BadMike** and I rarely spoke with one another.  H\*ll, we rarely looked at one another.  We were in a shared, open office, but there was an invisible wall running right down the center that everyone knew was there and everybody respected.  I was ok with this, in fact.  My anger burned brightly.  I would keep this up until one of us broke.  *And I intended not to break*.

A couple of weeks later, I walked into the office to see **$BadMike** hunched forward at his desk.  He was reading some sort of paper - and his eyes were red.  As I sat down in front of my own computer, I glanced over and could tell that he was actually crying!  Honestly I really didn't know what was going on nor did I care.  I didn't think that **$DragonLady** would have acted this soon on any sort of direct punishment for him.  I didn't think she'd act at all, in fact.  So I figured this was something else.  For most of the day, I just ignored him.  The entire day he held that paper in his hands and kept glancing at it.  Periodically he'd turn to me like he wanted to say something, but I never turned back.  Yeah, I suppose I was acting kind of heartless, but I had given up having a heart for someone that had caused me so much pain and frustration.

The next day, he seemed to have recovered, and we were back to the same old indifference.  Around midmorning, though, **$AwesomeBoss** came into the office and told me that I needed to speak with **$DragonLady**.  My eyes popped open, the proverbial ""*uh oh*"" situated on my tongue.  This couldn't be good.  I grabbed a notepad and followed her.  Once I entered **$DragonLady**'s office, **$AwesomeBoss** shut the door and left.  It was just me and **$DragonLady**.  My mind was racing.  What had I done?  I felt certain that I was getting fired or at least a stern talking to.  All manner of things went through my mind.  But it was **$DragonLady** that spoke first:

&gt;**$DragonLady**: So we've noticed that you have been doing a lot of good work for us.  I appreciate it.  While I cannot change your pay band, I can ask for an amendment to your contract to bring your pay on par with those that are performing similar duties.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me**: (blinking) ...What?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$DragonLady**: (slides a piece of paper over to me with a *20% raise!*) This is your new pay grade.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me**: (looking at it, completely flabbergasted) Woah... um... thank you!  Oh my God...  
&gt;  
&gt;**$DragonLady**: Oh, and gather up your things from your desk.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me**: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$DragonLady**: &lt;other GIS staff member&gt; just resigned.  And there's no reason why you should have your desk in the intern's office.  We're giving you that office instead.  Gather your things and speak to IT to get everything set up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me**: Holy crap... yes, sure, I'll do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$DragonLady**: Oh, and also, keep this to yourself.  Raises and consideration like this were not given to everybody.

As she said that last sentence, there was an odd, knowing smile on her face.  I smiled back and thanked her profusely.  Like I said before, **$DragonLady** and me had our issues, but I certainly wasn't upset about something like this :)  And my mind was completely blown here - it wasn't expected at all!  Seriously, I thought I was about to get walked out!  Also, consider the insinuation here - I was given a 20% raise to ""*bring me on par with others performing similar duties*.""  To me, that meant **$BadMike** had been making about *20% more* than me to come in and f\*ck up things for years!  Sweet baby Jesus...

Anyways, I got back to my desk in the company of a smiling **$AwesomeBoss**, who opened the new office for me and told me to start gathering my things.  As I did so, I saw **$BadMike** look over to me.  The look on his face was... *quizzical?*  No, not that, more like vulnerable.  His expression read something like ""*You're leaving?*""  As if, despite all the hostility between us, he didn't want me to go.  I didn't say anything to him as I gathered my things and turned off my PC.  Once I had everything, I just walked out the door - leaving him behind me.

The new office was the best, and **$AwesomeRed** would come in there pretty much every day so we could talk to each other.  It was so cool!  I'd never had anything like this before.  Also, I didn't have to veil my speech or anything, we could just talk.  Very soon, our conversations turned to **$BadMike**.  I brought up the piece of paper I saw him staring at the other day and the fact that he was crying.  **$AwesomeRed** immediately morphed, transformers-style, into gossip mode.

&gt;**$AwesomeRed**: Oh my God, that!  He didn't tell you?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me**: I haven't said two words to him in weeks, so that'd be a nope.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AwesomeRed**: It was a notice of inadequate performance and an action plan.  If he screws up one more time before the end of the fiscal year, they won't renew his contract.  He'll be done!  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Woah!  Wait, you mean he has just one chance and he's out?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AwesomeRed**: (with the most devious smile I'd ever seen on her face) Yep!

I shook my head in utter disbelief.  This was it!  The light was shining at the end of the tunnel!  I could see us being rid of this cancer forever!

Then, of course, reality set in.  I told myself that there was no way that they'd actually go ahead with this.  **$BadMike** would spin something he did onto someone else, diverting blame or throwing out just enough plausible deniability to keep from being held fully accountable.  Or **$MrScott** or even **$DragonLady** would decide to overlook a ""minor issue"" and keep him onboard.  Or this could just be yet another of their continual ""grand proclamations"" that never amounted to anything.  Or any of a dozen other things.  However, for me, it was less of an issue now.  So long as I didn't have to deal with **$BadMike**, and so long as we could just bypass him in everything we did, it didn't really matter.  I wasn't going to actively persecute the guy anymore.  My life had taken a substantial turn for the better.  It was time for me to move forward.  He wasn't my problem anymore.

As it turns out, the impetus for **$BadMike**'s downfall did not come from me, but rather from those that had previously been his allies - **$MrScott** and **$DragonLady**.

A few weeks later, **$MrScott** called me into his office.  He wanted me to check something for him.  Turns out, **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** had issued a mapping project to **$BadMike**, and they wanted to see if there were any problems with it.  Checking it would have to happen while he wasn't in the office, so they wanted me to come in after hours to go through this.  Would that be ok?

I knew exactly what this meant, though I don't think that **$MrScott** understood that I was aware of the details of **$BadMike**'s action plan.  Y'all, it wasn't my intention to be the one to kick **$BadMike** in the testicles at the time, but if he just placed them right in front of me, I wasn't going to waste the opportunity.  If this could guarantee that he was dismissed, then not only me but *the rest of the team* would be rid of his awfulness.  I said sure.  I hope **$MrScott** did not detect the glee in my voice.

I spent 10 hours going through every possible facet of that project.  **$BadMike** had been given a cloropleth mapping assignment meant to show different characteristics, each with its own color ramp and symbolization.  What I found was that he had used the correct symbologies and notes throughout the maps - but he had forgotten to change the underlying data!  So, for example, if Map 1 was supposed to show ""*Number of Dog Poops Cleaned Up in City Parks*,"" while Map 2 was supposed to show ""*Number of Dog Poops Set on Fire on Doorsteps*,"" he had not changed the data when he produced Map 2 from the first one.  So the two maps actually looked identical, they merely had different color schemes.   About half of the maps were wrong.  There were some other minor issues but these were the most egregious.

I wrote up all my findings and hand-delivered it **$MrScott**.  (Yes, I sent him an email too)

After that, I really didn't hear anything back.  I wasn't made privy to anything that **$BadMike** was working on, so I just sort of ignored him.  Again, I really didn't think that there was going to be any resolution to any of this.  I spoke to **$AwesomeRed** every once in a while about it, but she hadn't heard anything herself.  And while I hoped that all the work I'd done after hours wasn't wasted, ultimately I tried my best to put it out of my mind.

Months went by until, eventually, we got to the end of the fiscal year.  The last day came... *and went*... and **$BadMike** was still here.  I had actually gotten myself a little hyped up for an announcement or something, only to have it fizzle after the year ended.  A few days later, I spoke to **$AwesomeRed**.  We brought up **$BadMike** \- why was he still here?  Had **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** reneged on the whole action plan?

**$AwesomeRed** told me that the big bosses had given **$BadMike** ""a few more months,"" working month-to-month until he found a new job.  He wasn't on a contract anymore.  Lol - this meant that, despite knowing he was about to get canned, he still hadn't started looking for something new.  Dipsh\*t.  Anyways, it was... news.  Not what I hoped.  I'm not even sure what I hoped at the time.  But to me, I felt like ""a few more months"" could mean anything, from 1-2 all the way to a year or more.  As I was speaking to **$AwesomeRed**, I said something about never being rid of him, that nothing I could do would ever change that.  I must have looked really upset.

That's when **$AwesomeRed** stopped me.  She countered that I couldn't be more wrong, that I was the main reason why he was about to get the boot.  I had been the one to constantly report on his bad work; I had been the one to formally complain about him; and I had been the one to discover his errors during his action plan.  Her words were pure encouragement, music to my ears.  **$AwesomeRed**, I know you will see this; thank you so much, you're the best :)  Honestly, I started to gain some encouragement from her words.  And I even became hopeful that we'd hear something about his imminent dismissal.

Two months later, we all received an email:

&gt;Dear **$Agency**,  
&gt;  
&gt;**$BadMike** has accepted a position with &lt;other employer&gt;.  His last day will be &lt;date&gt;.  Please join us at &lt;local restaurant&gt; for his going-away celebration at &lt;such and such time&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **$DragonLady**

As soon as I read it, I shot up from my chair to go say something - but before I could do so, I saw **$AwesomeRed** and **$AwesomeBoss** standing in the doorway to my office.  Both of them had the biggest sh\*t-eating grins on their faces.  The moment I saw them, I had only one word on my lips:

&gt;**$Me**: *Yeah!!*

I started counting down the days.  **$BadMike**'s ""going-away celebration"" was to be held on his last day there.  The whole celebration itself was sort of a farce - virtually everyone at **$Agency** knew that he was on an action plan, that his contract had been canceled, and that he had basically been fired.  But we went along with the pretensions anyway.

At the restaurant, I sat as far away from him as I possibly could.  Most people were in good spirits, even those talking to him.  *I wonder why?* \&gt;:D  Even I was happy, getting the chance to have a breather and just chat with my coworkers.  After I finished eating, I walked outside.  I didn't really want to be in there anymore.  Just before the party ended, **$BadMike** came outside to talk to me.  He said that he learned a lot while he worked with me, and I said the same.  He wished me well, and I did the same, and I shook his hand.

***And then he was gone***.  That was the last time I ever saw or spoke to him.

I walked home from the restaurant that evening.  It was a beautiful day - hot and muggy, just like any other here in the South, but still beautiful.  I stopped at a bunch of the street corners along the way just to take it in.  As I walked, I felt the burden, the stress, the anxiety, all of it lifting from my shoulders.  When I got back to the apartment I shared with my wife, I just fell backwards onto our bed, completely serene.  *Ah yes, the soft delight of vanquishing a foe*.  This was it - *this* was that soft delight.  I closed my eyes and fell into the most peaceable sleep that I have ever known.

:)

That is, of course, until other events at **$Agency** were to rouse me from that peace.  But those are stories for later.  I hope you all have enjoyed this, and until tomorrow, take care!

I am a 23 year old Business Intelligence analyst (If you're unfamiliar, it's basically a mix between Business Analyst and IT) working in the finance/insurance industry in Canada (I am Canadian FYI). I have my Bachelors in Commerce, and have a few years experience now within the industry from full time and internship work I have done. I was interested to learn more about the work-immigration requirements/opportunities for EU countries (Focusing on Austria/Germany) for those wishing to pursue BI analytics in Europe, plus where best to look for opportunities in the business/tech field. Any advice/recommendations would be greatly appreciated (I will try to return the favour with Canadian advice where I can!). Thanks!

Just as a side, I have learned some computer coding(mainly SQL and am learning Python now) for my job/school , but I am very enthusiastic to learn new technologies/skills for new opportunities as well! I have enough in savings at the moment to last me for about year in Germany. And I learned some German back in school, but it's been a while so I will need to pick that up again soon."

I'm a Masters in Cybersecurity student at Georgia Tech. I've received two internship offers for the Summer but the roles are quite different.

1. Vimeo - Application Security Intern
2. Hudson River Trading - Site Reliability Engineering Intern

Pay-wise, HRT is giving almost twice as what I'm getting at Vimeo. I'm kind of confused regarding which offer to accept considering the factors - return offer rate, stipend, brand, quality of work, benefits in the long run.

While the SRE intern role is not quite aligned to my past experiences, I'm not quite sure how useful will it be for me to get full time roles in the future (in Cybersecurity).

What do you think would be a good choice, considering all the factors?

skrhl9,0,2022-02-04,Dilemma between accepting a JPMC SWE vs FB DSPA role,ihateusrnms,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/skrhl9/dilemma_between_accepting_a_jpmc_swe_vs_fb_dspa/,"I’m an undergrad studying compsci in the UK and have received the following internship offers atm:

- Facebook/Meta Data Science Product Analyst (FB DSPA) @London

- JPMorgan Chase Software Engineer (JPMC SWE) @Glasgow


I loved working with data (analysis/pipeline building/model designing) at my previous job which is why I was drawn to the DS role initially when I was filling out my applications in addition to the SWE roles. However, I am having second thoughts about the DS role. 

Obviously, its from a FAANG company so the job will pad my resume when I go on a job hunt at the end of my degree. However, I am quite uncertain about the career progression of a data scientist. Moreover, FB’s DS Product Analyst role is leaning more towards bitch work while the PhDs and master students get to do the actually impactful AI and model building research (which is the subfield I enjoyed the most in my previous internship). That being said the FB DSPA role will be a good foundation if I were to pursue a PhD later down the line for getting into good research. 

However, I REALLY love building software and projects as well. I am a Compsci student afterall and I feel like I’m making more impact when I am actively building things — something that will be more common on the SWE role at JPMC. The problem with JPMC though is with the old Java techstacks that are use and my growth might be limited.

Having all this as background context, I want some help from the community about the following questions:

1. How easy is it to transition from DS role to SWE role across companies and vice versa? Is DS -&gt; SWE harder or SWE -&gt; DS?

2. If the transition isnt that difficult, will I be assigned to a new-grad position if I were to transition?

3. Will it be possible to transition to a SWE role internally at FB if I were to receive a return offer my DS role for post-graduation job?

4. How impactful will a FB/Meta experience  on a resume be compared to a JPMC one?

5. If I were to apply for SWE jobs in my final year and they saw that the most recent job was a DS role, will it negatively affect my resume review?

6. What’s a realistic career progression for a DSPA at Facebook?

Most importantly,

7. If you were in my position what option would you pick?

Feel free to leave feedback on any (or all :) ) of the questions above."

skt2o8,45,2022-02-04,Things I wish I would have known before starting Purdue as a freshman.,ag_silver,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/skt2o8/things_i_wish_i_would_have_known_before_starting/,"Caution: I graduated 10 years ago and although I am living relatively comfortable life, there are some regrets. Probably a lot of things I am saying here are outdated. Curious if these notes can help the new students.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Student loan is no joke. Apply for Resident Assistant early as possible to get that discounted tuition. If possible, take a year off from school and work full-time for 1 year to be treated as Indiana state resident and get that in-state tuition. My friend took a year off, worked at the Krispy Kreme for 1 year and then enjoyed low tuition fee. If I am graduate student, act early and ask for research assistant stipend. Ask multiple professors. Be prepared to back it up with good GPA, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Apply for dorms ASAP and live in a dorm for that first year. Living in a dorm can be a challenge but it really helps with social connection. Living, eating, studying and playing sports together 24/7 for that first year can really build very strong friendships that can last for a lifetime. Out-of-Campus life still can do that, but living in a dorm is much more convenient.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I don't have to graduate early. I don't have to take 19 credit semester. It is better to take it slow and really learn/understand. In fact, take minimum credits allowed for full-time and really focus on getting 4.0 GPA. Retake classes if possible. People care if I have 4.0GPA but no one cares if I have 3.0 but graduated a year early. (Having in-state tuition helps staying longer than 4 years) No one cares if it took 5\~6 years to graduate! Having high GPA also opens for free scholarships.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Take advantage of Co-op and intern. Go to resume office hours and have it fixed. Even if I don't have any work experience, just knowing what I am lacking helps. If I know what I need, I can plan for it. A tip, if I have zero connections: Visit Professors often for the assignments/office-hours and let him/her know the my face. Ace the midterm test and then ask for an meeting/office-hour. Ask for a direction/recommendation for an internship or coop.

&amp;#x200B;

5. On-campus interviews will ask mostly about what I learned during the core engineering class. Need to know all the fundamentals in-an-out.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Lift and go to gym more often. This also relates to taking 12 credit semesters and making time for exercising. College life is once in a lifetime. Need to fully enjoy it. Lifting helps in all aspects of life, mental, physical, social, dating etc.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Major in CS and buy ethereum (joke)


Edit: I want to explain a little bit more regarding the GPA. The reason why I'm stressing at 4.0 GPA is that it gives way for more interviews and job opportunities. Unless you have an internship position or experience already,  only thing that you can really show for is your academic score. The work experience really trumps the GPA of course, so if you have that then congrats. But I bet many people don't have internship by sophomore or Junior year. High GPA allows you to get the internship and that will lead to the job that you desire.

By my experience graduating in 4 years or 5 years doesn't really matter. Yes, if you start one year later then you do lose that potential to earn more money. However, I think it is more important to have a better starting point. By having high GPA, the company looks at you differently. You are treated as a potential super star. You are given a track that has more potential to earn more. However, if you have mediocre GPA, you're treated as a mediocre worker. You're given mediocre  tasks so all you can really show for is mediocre performance. Of course this can change as you prove yourself when you work. But then you're wasting a year or two trying to prove yourself while your friend who got 4.0 GPA was given a red carpet to the better spot in the career from the beginning.

Again I would instead of rushing and getting a mediocre GPA, I'd rather take it slow and get a high GPA so my earning potential will be greater."

I'm in a rough spot of having to decide between internship offers as a Product Manager intern and as a Pathways intern with Amazon.

I came into Bschool wanting Pathways and Ops roles, but I got this PM offer that I'm finding hard to pass on. My long-term goal is to grow and advance (I value promotions and upward mobility) but I also know that eventually, I want to start my own company.

My past experience is in operations.

What do exit opportunities look like for these roles? I worry that if I fail to convert Pathways, I will end up siloed into FC ops.

So I'm currently doing a SysOps engineering role after I graduated with a decent company. I had prior experiences with app dev and data through internships when I was at uni. 

However, after awhile I find myself revisiting and doing personal projects with app/web dev. But thought I'd give it some time to see if this is where my passion is. (Ensure that it's not just resorting to find a reason whenever work load gets tough)


It's now been a year and Im still at the same situation. Recently a friend offered my a role that suits my passion and I told him I'll go for the interview. I know that my company has a similar dept that employs people in that area too. 

So what my question is... how would I bring up this situation with my boss and transfer me to this dept or at (their) worst case to tell him that I could leave the company for my friend's recommended role (if I get in). 

Thanks!!

(also looking back, i know i was a bit misled to think that a CS major is a really versatile major because at the end of the day it's still the same coding, debugging, and meetings). anyways, now i'm just kind of worried that majoring in information science won't give me as much range and that it also won't be as appealing to employers when compared with a computer science major (which is known to require more higher-level CS classes).

i know that if i wanted to, i can still be a SWE even if i choose to major in info sci since my coding skills are much more important than what major i am, and many people have told me that taking an object-orientated programming course will have most or all of what i need to know to do well in interviews (and lots of practice / leetcode). my main concern is just that having a computer science major might be more appealing to companies than an information science major (if i even do decide to become a SWE because i, again, have no clue) and switching majors would lower my job opportunities / make me a less desirable candidate to companies. also alot of my friends who are cs majors seem to be getting high-paying internships with good companies and i'm just worried i might not be able to make as much as an information science major. can any info sci majors or grads share their experience with getting internships / jobs ? or even just any cs majors or anyone wanna share their thoughts?"

Originally when I was in the interview process, they told me they were looking for someone specifically that could be a full-time hire if the internship went well. I said I would be interested in that, but I hadn’t even started the internship yet— so I had no idea what the job would actually be like when I said that. It’s been almost a month into this internship and I am really not enjoying it. I have realized I want to work in a different type of role than what this is, and it took me this internship to figure that out. The employees are nice, but I do not feel like I fit in. Since it’s such a small business, all the employees have a very tight knit relationship and have been building this business together since it’s started. I feel as though I do not belong and am unable to get that same connection with my fellow employees as they have with each other— i think they may notice this too, but they still continue to say things like “well hopefully when you’re still with us in a year you can….”

I am the first intern they have ever had, and I am nervous for when the time comes if they offer me a full-time position. I feel as though I’m betraying them if I decline it, but I know this isn’t the right fit for me. I also am in the interview process for full-time jobs in companies that I DO truly want to work for.

skzmsi,4,2022-02-05,Good idea to move out?,concernedKoala423,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/skzmsi/good_idea_to_move_out/,"Finishing school this semester with a full-time job lined up starting in the summer (chose to take a few months off after graduation). Making 75k in my first year which should be around 4k/month net if my calculations are reasonable.

Things are getting tense at home, my dad frequently ego tripping and turning small shit into a big deal. Not sure how long I want to keep on dealing with that, in addition to my parent's explosive and toxic arguments which are never going to go away (been seeing a therapist to help cope with this).

I have $50k in student loans to pay back. Technically I had a full ride scholarship for school so I shouldn't even have had to take out loans but our family finances were kinda trash (apparently) so I ended up taking student loans which my parents managed (I know, mistake #1) and used for our living expenses (I think). Basically I'm on the hook for $50k. Not to mention my parents have like $30k of my money from my internship so I was practically paying rent to live at home anyway, but as I've learned from a previous thread that's a lost cause to get the money back, my mistake for letting them manage my money in the first place.

**Is it a good idea to move out this year (currently in Calgary)?** Given the current economic climate (inflation, COVID, real estate, etc.), not sure if it's smart to be tacking on loads of expenses moving out for the first time, especially while I still have loans to pay down (I think the rate on it is 3.5%). As an aside, I've heard that if the student loan interest rate is low enough it's more beneficial to invest my money elsewhere and I would profit from the difference between my investment returns and my loan principal, but not sure how legit of a strategy that is. I'm planning to live without a car to keep expenses down, although in Calgary apparently that's pretty limiting, so not sure how long I would last with that.

**If you recommend I move out basically as soon as I graduate or within, say, 6 months of graduating, could you recommend some resources or tips to help with moving out and living on my own for the first time?**

Did some rough budgeting for myself and think I could keep living expenses under $2k (most likely just renting a room in a house or something \~$700 rent perhaps utilities included) and then hopefully be able to max TFSA and RRSP contributions with the rest of my money.

I've managed to build up some skills in the web development realm so hopefully should be able to pick up a freelance project here or there to help with expenses.

Thanks in advance for your help!"
sl1l5s,1,2022-02-05,Need advice on staying in my arts field (just got a new job) or transitioning to Salesforce Admin.,sadandsnacky,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/sl1l5s/need_advice_on_staying_in_my_arts_field_just_got/,"I have a BFA degree and was on track to being an arts admin professional post graduation. I did a technician internship at a studio but then landed an admin job at a mid-size arts organization. Over the last few years I became their systems expert, and learned a lot about Salesforce and other business processes. I implemented solutions for fundraising and donations. I loved that part of my work, problem solving and building effencies. I tie my passion as an artist back I that, I'm creative but in a logical problem solving way. 

I just moved to a new city for my partners work and was on a mission to get a job in my arts field again, since it's the obvious path I've been on. I interviewed at a large art non-profit and got an offer as their database admin, which I turned down (and kind of burned that bridge). I also got an offer as a studio manager which I accepted thinking it was the right move and it paid more. I've been there a month and it's just ok -  the work is really physical and there is a lot of community drama.

In the meantime I just recently learned about the Salesforce Admin certification, and was like hm I wonder if I could pass it just for fun. I now realize it's a lot more studying, but am having fun and really really enjoy this type of work.

I also am sad that my new job has no PTO or benefits. I thought it was ok at the beginning but now I'm learning the workload is so high because of continual studio use demands that it might be hard to take time off for vacation, no one is qualified to cover me while I'm gone.

I super regret passing on the data admin job, but know that I made my decision and that door is closed. 

But I do see some Salesforce Admin remote jobs that I think I could apply for as a long shot. It would be amazing to work remotely, since I just moved but would rather be able to come and go between my family and my new home. I worked from home in my last job when they went remote only because of the pandemic, and LOVED IT. I don't know if the work hours would be insane, especially since I am not an Admin expert. I think I could survive, I love problem solving and am invigorated by that kind of work. But I also have mental health issues now - thank you pandemic.

I am now wondering if I should apply for this one SF job in a company that looks awesome on paper, but if I got it I would have to quit my manager position only after 3 months or so, and leave behind that chapter of my career (it's a very small community). And I don't really know how stressful a wfh salesforce admin really is. I might leave everything behind only to hate how much stress this more corporate track might give me.

I'm asking for advice because my anxiety disorder sometimes causes me to convince myself of things and become excited/regretful/disapointed in an exaggerated way. I have pretty shit decision making skills right now and just become paralyzed by the what if scenarios. I'm disappointed because the path I took more recently is now feeling like the wrong choice, but know myself enough to think that this is just a symptom of my mental health issues and maybe I'm just excited about this other prospect because it's a flight option for my fears. 

I'm 30 if that helps at all. Maybe I Want to have kids, and this studio manager position is definitely impossible to do/keep whilst pregnant.

Anyways will anyone read this even?"

When I come up on my last six months I plan to do a internship or the MSSA program offered by Microsoft.

However, given that my team's manager has changed, I report to him more frequently, and the team tasks could change towards something I could be better at, I feel that it is my opportunity to speak up and ask for more direct feedbacks both to my technical lead and team manager.

What is the correct way to ask for feedbacks and understand what I need to work on in order to get hired? Should I speak more with my lead or my manager?"

Hello Everyone,

I am stuck in the middle of an emotional and professional turmoil in life. I hate my current field of work as a piping engineer and I wish to shift my career towards the IT side. The reason for changing the field is absolutely based on the quality of life, pay and comfort. I have learnt C++ in college first year and school, where I have shined in all of them. Still I went to continue with my mechanical engineering degree, which is still haunting me. My wife lives in a country and city where there would be more scope in the IT field. I have dabbled with Python, PHP, SQL and it has given me great satisfaction and I enjoyed them. I did few free courses from google, which helped me learn a bit more and at the same time made me love this field.

I have been researching past three days regarding what I should do next. Currently I am unemployed. I tried finding a job or internship. I dont have a strategy for doing that and I have not been successful so far. I have three doors right now and none of them are open. I need to find the key to the right door. **First** is to find an entry level IT job and gain some experience while I do some side courses along with it. **Second** is to do a paid certification course (eg: [univ.ai](https://univ.ai) was suggested by a redditor) and gain a job through that experience. **Third** is to do a master's course in Robotics or cs.

I absolutely have no idea about the third door. I don't know which college I should look for or the exact kind of degree that would suit me. I don't have plans of doing it abroad. My wife says Indian university is sufficient to get a good job and it is also cheap. By the way I don't have an exceptional track record in my academics. I had always been an average learner, although when it comes to computers I tend to show a much faster pace in learning.

Please help me make a right decision here. Upvote so that this post receives maximum reach, so that someone around here can provide me with a right tip to move ahead. I had been wandering around various subreddits lately, I don't even have an idea which is right place. I hope I get an answer year.

Thank you for your time reading this.

Edit: [Univ.ai](https://Univ.ai) provides course for DS, ML, AI. I like the field as I was good in both math and computer science.

I’ve applied for my first job after my B.Eng. (EE) in a big automotive company. The position is specially marked for university graduates. The application phase is made out of 3 steps: 

1. Interview - Call (50 min) 
2. Online Assessment-Center (2h)
3. Personal Interview at the Company 

-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; The Recruiting is done by a subsidiary (outsourced)

From a formalities standpoint my chances should be not to bad since I’ve achieved an average grade of 1.6 in the normal period of semesters 7/7. I’ve also taken additional subjects above what I have to (230/210 cp). The job is in IT which goes along with my specialization. I’ve done an 6 months internship in another big automotive company in a similar department before. My thesis was also made in coop. with a big automotive supplier. 

I’ve just made it through the first step (call). At first it seemed like they are very interested in me since it didn’t take longer then 5-6 days for each reply from them. After the call-interview they wanted to invite me for the assessment and asked for appointments (here is where the chaos begins):

Last week on Tuesday they asked me for the first time. Unfortunately I was not able to make it on that Friday due to a dentist appointment so we arranged the next week (present week) Wednesday / Friday. She told me that she is calling the other candidates to fill all slots and will call me back for confirmation. They didn’t called me until Wednesday this week. Then there was another lady (2nd person) on the phone who asked again when I’ve got time for the assessment. I told her that I already got a call last week and said to her co-worker that I’m able to make it this week on both days. She told me this week will be no assessment for my department and asked me again for the following week (same days) and I repeated that I’m also able to make it on both days. One day later I’ve received another call I unfortunately missed. It was another person (3rd one and men) who left a message on my mailbox that there are now free appointments and I should call him back. So I did 30 min after I missed that call. Now comes the banger: He told me that now unfortunately all slots for next week are occupied / full - he will clarify this with her co-worker and she will call me on Friday (next day / yesterday). I didn’t received any call so I called back on my own. It was another (4th lady) who didn’t knew about anything. She told me that my first contact person was on holiday this week, what was the reason why these other 2 co-worker called me. She’ve put me on the list for the next assessment appointment (round 2) in 2 weeks from now since next week is full and she will notify me this time via email when she’ve got enough candidates for the second round.

There was absolutely no excuse as this was the normal process. I don’t understand why they didn’t just add me to the list when I said I’m able to make it on both days. Seems like pretty bad internal communication. 

So now my problem and bummer is that I’m not one of the first candidates who will make it through  assessment but only in the second round. I’ve read that recruiters normally put candidates in a ranked list and call the best one first. I feel kind of left behind now and I am worried that the candidates in the first round have an advantage other me. The assessment is the first appointment where you get in personal contact with the department you’ve applied to. What if they found one person as a good match in the first round and let the others behind? Then I’ve missed my chance only because the recruiters were to incompetent to get their shit together and I can do nothing about it? I’m so angry and disappointed about this whole situation. 

Maybe someone who is working as a recruiter could assess my situation and tell me if I’m now in an actual disadvantaged or just driving myself crazy unnecessarily? This is my first real job application and a big deal for me since that’s one of my dream companies / jobs. 

PS: Im from Germany so I hope my English is good enough to get my point  ✌🏻"

I've been practically done with school for the past month and a half or so though, and have pretty much spent that time to really reflect on my life and stuff. I was originally going to do a PhD but ultimately decided not to, and just wanted to jump into the workforce and get experience and money.

Anyway, I don't really have any fundamentals of CS down (my undergraduate wasn't in CS or even STEM - I pretty much learned how to code when I started my master's) so I've been ""grinding LeetCode"" and studying data structures and algorithms on my own and am really realizing how much I've been neglecting those. Looking at job posting even for internship positions also seems daunting.

As of now I'm just preparing myself by practicing for technical interviews and finding internships/jobs and how I can connect my research experience to their real-world problems, but today I asked myself ""when do I just apply?""

Everyone starts somewhere, and I'm curious how everyone here determined whether they were ready or not. Any tips or feedback is appreciated, thanks!"

I am posting for the first time on this sub, so please don't judge me if I get a few things wrong here. I shall do better next time.

I am a third year (6th semester) student at a TIER-III Private Engineering college. I know only one programming language well enough to write extensive code in - C. I am familiar with C++, Java to some extent but cannot write code extensively in them. Very little knowledge of OOPS as well. I haven't learnt anything during this COVID-19 pandemic. I also do not have any internship offers, and I have not done any internships during this period. The only DS/A I am good at are Linked Lists, and Stacks.

I have wasted a lot of time. I am paying heavily for it. Can I crack FAANG or companies like LinkedIn, Microsoft, Nutanix, InterviewBit, Intuit,DirectI (you get the idea) by the end of my degree? If YES, what should be my plan? How deeply I have to study and what to study?

If NO, then what should be my approach now?

Thank you to everyone who would help. I am sorry, I am embarrassed as well as feeling overwhelmed right now. I can say that I am an above-average student. I have a great GPA average till now (9.5+ in all semesters), and I have a hunger for learning new things."
sl7bxd,4,2022-02-05,"I'm genuinely unhappy in my college and I want to transfer, but is it worth it?",[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sl7bxd/im_genuinely_unhappy_in_my_college_and_i_want_to/,"For some context/disclaimer, I do not live nor study in the US, but I am American (I am stating this for a fairly important point that I'll bring up).

I am currently a junior, and I am not happy at all in the college that I go to.

The only reason why I go here is because it's the only one that is the closest to me (20-30 minutes travel time) and my mom was an alumni of this school. The environment isn't necessarily toxic, but there is a reason why I only have 7 friends in this place and more friends from other universities. It's also fairly homogenous in terms of gender identity, which made me feel like I was in high school again (because I went to an all-girls school). I also don't think my school is as known as the ones that my friends go to, which is honestly important if I want to land a job a good company in the future.

I feel like my school didn't prepare me at all for the workforce, skillwise and mentally, and my growth as an individual has been stumped. I spend almost all of my days accomplishing requirements or doing readings for my courses, or resting from the exhaustion of doing so (which actually doesn't happen that often haha). Because of this, I don't really have time to pursue internships (which is something that is fairly common among college students in my country and a total resume booster) and develop the skills that I wouldn't get from school. My school also lacks a lot of options when it comes extracurriculars and student organizations (and almost all of them are limited to certain majors) so I can't really pursue interests that I am really passionate about.

Although my school has (finally, at the insistence of my mom) applied and are waiting for an approval, for the past three years I wasn't able to use my GI bill for school since my school wasn't approved by the VA at the time I started college. (For more context about this, the GI bill is an education benefit given to US service members or veterans. My dad served in the Navy and was given one, but since he went to college prior to joining the military he transferred it to me so I can use it instead). If my college were to get accepted, I would only be able to use it during my senior year, which would be a complete waste since I don't really plan on going to grad school after college (especially since a lot of the programs that I'm interested in require work experience so I really need to get a job).

There are also a lot of other reasons such as my physical and mental health, which has gradually and greatly suffered as each semester passed by. (I lost a lot of weight and I just feel sad and anxious every day).

Anyway I just want to know is it still even worth it to transfer to another university? I am in my second semester of my junior year, which means I only have two semesters left after this and then I am done with college forever. Moreover, there is a pretty good chance that my college might get approved by the VA, which would probably waste the efforts of the school admin in getting all the documents together for that (then again there's another person in my college who wants to use a GI bill according to my mom). There's also the fact that my parents and I might need to go to the VA to tell them about my change of schools if ever, which is a whole hassle in itself since the regional office is in another city and we have to commute using public transportation because of traffic (I've been there before and the travel was NOT fun). And since I wasn't able to use the GI bill for 3 years, my parents had to pay for my tuition out of their own pocket, and I feel like my parents will get mad at me for wasting their money if I bring up the fact that I want to transfer.

I'll go ahead and answer some questions that I may get from this:

* academically I am doing quite well, but it was at the expense of both my physical and mental health
* I'm an only child so I have no one to transfer the GI bill to
* my parents didn't want to send me back to the US for college since they don't trust me to be alone lol
* my dad doesn't want me to live with my aunt (she's my only family member in the US) if ever because of some private reasons (not my story to tell)
* considering the situation in the US right now (and the fact that I am Asian), I don't think it's a good idea to go back

TLDR: I'm not happy in my college and I want to transfer because of job prospects, financial reasons, and because of my physical and mental health, but I don't know if it's worth it since I have one more year left."
sl8u05,128,2022-02-05,Is the average salary for Data Analyst based on just the job title?,SaxxyBeast298,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/sl8u05/is_the_average_salary_for_data_analyst_based_on/,"I'm looking at the average salary for a Data Analyst position at my current company and it is low at around $60k.

A small amount requires SQL and Tableau, but zero coding skills. 

My upcoming internship is for a Data Analyst position, but talking to my Hiring Manager, he said that I'll be building data pipelines, extracting, processing and analyzing data with SQL and Python. I'll also be building Tableau dashboards. Additionally, I'll work with Machine Learning Engineers to deploy ML models by developing full stack web applications (also using a lot of Python, Flask and JavaScript). So I was thinking if I continue full-time with the company for this role, would I be paid the average $60k salary or is Data Analyst just a title and the pay is more aligned with the work you're doing?"

This year I will be mentoring an intern at the company i work at. Even though we have several projects we can work on with our interns,  I kinda noticed that these project ideas seem kinda stale and frankly kind of boring, some of them even have quite a bureaucracy component to them, and I know that I as an intern wanted to code as much as possible instead of dealing with some boring compliance stuff. It is not usually my responsibility to think of an internship project, but I thought maybe i could add some suggestions so that the intern I mentor and I can work on something fun to code and easy to learn from. That leads me to asking this question here, as I was wondering if you guys have any fun and useful apps at work that help you out, something simple that an intern with my help can code.   


Some ideas I had are:  
\- Now that we are more hybrid, an app to track who is at work and sitting at which desk vs working from home.  
\- A library app so that we can keep track of who has which book as well as book wish lists for the company to purchase for us  
\- An app where an employee can log his skill level in different technologies as well as skill/know-how of different projects in our company.  


I would love to hear what fun, simple, useful web-apps you created and are using at your workplace. Any suggestion you think would be a cool idea is welcomed as well.  


Some details:  
\- The app does not have to be finished by the intern. He can code it as much as he wants and us much as we can accomplish.  
\- We will likely be doing both front + back end. Likely React/Spring if this is even relevant.  
\- The intern will have beginner level knowledge of both React/Spring, and this should be something not too complex and something that can help him grow and learn, while having fun. I will of course be there to guide him through any rough patches.  


Thank you!"
slg8s2,3,2022-02-05,M29 - Chinese Language BA or Work Experience?,lajichang,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/slg8s2/m29_chinese_language_ba_or_work_experience/,"29 years old, living off welfare, with merely a year of work experience (video editing). Just recently obtained my HS diploma alongside an IT-related diploma. My past is kinda messed up. Aside from my laughable work experience, I am somewhat proficient in chinese (HSK5-ish, but didn’t take the test yet).

There’s a University in Sweden that offers an online Chinese language undergraduate course, free of tuition fees for European nationals (I am). One of the tutors told me, that I could do 60 credits a term, instead of just 30, given that I have successfully passed HSK4. This would be, without a doubt, the fastest way to obtain a degree. I am well-aware, that language degrees on their own are somewhat useless. 

Why waste your time with an undergraduate course then? Well, obviously my CV isn’t great. However, I managed to “fill the gaps” with my passed Chinese language efficiency tests and obtaining said degree would run like a common thread through my CV. Bonus points for coming across as more educated and more work opportunities abroad, I guess. Also, I am REALLY passionate about China and henceforth couldn't bring myself to study anything else.

On the contrary, it had me thinking: “Why spend another 1 ½ year chasing a degree, when I could use said time to do an internship/develop skills, in order to find employment?”

I’ve been eyeing creative jobs like UX/UI design or anything media related, as there is a great demand. Besides, my video editing/IT experience could come into play.

As I've mentioned before, I live off welfare, since the government declared me ""incapable of working"". Back then, I truly was (burnout). Due to welfare, I could do the BA course full time without worrying about expenses. However, I would forever lose that status, if I were to do an internship. My biggest fear is, that I wouldn't be able to find employment in such field and thus being forced to work in shit jobs that pay even less than my welfare.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros &amp; Cons:**

**Chinese Language Undergraduate Course:**

\+ Only 1 ½ years

\+ NO tuition fees

\+ Will probably be easy

\+ 100% online

\- Another 1 ½ years without any improvement regarding job relevant abilities nor experience

**Internship or Online Course in UI/UX or another creative/media related field:**

\+ Experience

\+ Saved time (since I would do an Internship, upon graduating, anyway)

\+ Could study part time later,

\- …BUT it could be stressful 

\- less educated on paper

\- lack of degree will deny me of work visas, if ever I wanted to go abroad

\- would lose my welfare status (and couldn't go back)

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like time is running out and I can’t afford to make any more mistakes.

Dear users of Reddit, what would you do in my stead?

**Tl;dr: 29 years old, one year of work experience in video editing, plus Chinese language ability. Should I take a tuition free, sped up (3 terms) undergraduate course in Chinese language or do an internship in UI/UX design (or media design related fields) instead? Education vs Time**"
slgyin,1,2022-02-05,I may have screwed myself...,[deleted],careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/slgyin/i_may_have_screwed_myself/,"First off, I apologize if I break any rules here unintentionally as I just joined this subreddit and I am in desperate need of some good advice.

Secondly, this is an extremely long post and I'm sorry if I'm not very concise.

Let me start with some context about myself. I'm in my late 30s with close to 9 years of experience in Analytics work. What kind of analytics you might say? I'm not even sure of that myself. I've been a low level analyst doing a ton of data entry type work, and I was promoted to a Data Analyst but mostly by title. I know a fair amount of SQL and Excel but I wouldn't say I'm in expert at it. I went on to programming bootcamp and learned python, only to fail miserably at finding a programming or developer job because I ended up taking a job that a contracting company ""strongly encouraged"" me to take at a clothing retail company(I always resented not getting a tech job again, waste of 2 years of my life).  This happened about 2-3 months after I finished my programming bootcamp. Needless to say that contracting company did not have my best interests in mind and only saw me as a payday and I was desperate for a job at a time. I lucked out and ended up contracting as a Business Analyst III for two long year before finally being converted to the standard ""Operations Analyst"" title within my current company. I'm currently in the San Francisco Bay Area and I work at a large tech company that is very reputable and well known and I really enjoy working in tech.

As a disclaimer, if you actually read through this whole spiel about my situation, you'll probably notice that I am very indecisive and unsure of myself. Lack of confidence has always been my problem. I rarely speak up during meetings and I rarely take the initiative which I believe to be my fatal flaw in my career thus far so please bare with me...I am still learning how to be a functioning member of society. I'm a very reactive type of person...

So here it goes, finally. At my corporate retail job, I was paid $38/hour which I assume if I double translates to about 76K a year. It wasn't that long ago, maybe 3 years ago. After I was let go after my 2 years contracting there, I went to work at my current company in the heart of San Francisco, I was told it was a new type of role and I would be working to create reports and dashboards and assisting the services end of the business in operations as well. I accepted this role and it paid $47/hour which I assume translates roughly to $94K per year give or take. Now after 2 long hard years of working, I finally got hired on full time and I was super excited but had no idea how to negotiate my salary. I told them that 2 years prior, another big social media company had a contract job willing to offer me the rate equivalent to $105K so that was what I assume my value to be worth in the market. A lot of my friends told me, ask for like $120K or something and see where they go from there, but me being the indecisive, underconfident person I am...I told them, I would be happy with $105K. They went and spoke to HR because they said the role actually pays $95K TC and ultimately came back and said OK, we'll pay you $95K with a 10% bonus which would come out to about $105K and you get a $5K signing bonus, how does that sound? So basically I got a base which was the same as before and IF I do well, I get my bonus. I accepted the offer feeling good because I had finally crossed that six figure threshold. However I still feel I am underpaid at this point. An colleague who was paid similarly to an intern at the company was let go around the time I was hired and within 2 months, she was able to find a job that paid her $145K + a signing bonus + an annual bonus...I think. I'm not quite sure how that works. She was so pissed that they didn't hire her on but in the end, this ended up being a blessing in disguise for her. This all went down last September of 2021 and here I am, 6 months later. My organization is going through a reorg/integration with another group and everyone was scrambling to figure out their situation...but me. While everyone was off trying to figure out where they were landing, who they could courier favors with and what they wanted to do with the next 3-4 years. I sat at home twiddling my thumbs waiting for what they had in store for me. My bread and butter has always been working with data, and that is what I did in my role before the reorg. I would create forecasting tools and dashboards and reports while running some pre and post sales operations because our org. Because we're integrating, it seems like everyone is becoming more specialized and less broad so my leadership decided it would be ideal for me to learn how the post sales side of the business works. They told me who my new boss was about 2 weeks ago and I met with her and this is where all the problems start for me.

My new boss asked me, what do you want to do and what are your passions. So I told her that my passions were in analytics and working with data. She told me that this role was more about auditing and compliance and asked if I was still interested. Me being the moron, I told her that I felt like I was done with the mundane task of data entry and editing because I assumed that this role would just be a lot of me fact checking and editing data fields. She said that if this is your passion, we can either 1) Try out the role and work towards a career in analytics with a small percentage of my time being dedicated to working on analytics projects 2) She can try and get me an interview with the analytics team within our org 3) Try the role out, and if I don't like it I can look internally for another job. So I spoke with some of my colleagues that I would usually go to for mentorship and my old manager that originally hired me suggested that I talk to my VP about possibly moving to another team where I can continue support him with presales work. The idea of working with something that was familiar gave me a sense of hope and joy so I decided to tell my new manager about this and hold off on making any decision. After a week of talking with my VP and my second manager (not my new one or my first one, I've had 3 managers thus far), I learned that there might not necessarily be headcount for them to move me to that team. So now I've kinda put myself in a terrible position with my new boss. She won't train me until we figure out what I want to do. I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to work with me anyways because of what I said about not wanting to do the work that she and her team does. If I want to work in the Data Analytics group, I would have to interview for the job and that would take even longer. I honestly have no idea what to do because I'm currently trying to work through my resume to get to my new manager to apply for the analytics position. Should I just give up and beg for forgiveness and say, ""I'm willing to do the work and give it my best""? Should I just look for another job? I feel like I could probably command a higher TC than a measly $95K base + 10% bonus within the bay area...

I kinda wish my old boss hadn't planted the idea that I might possible be able to continue working as I did before with his team. I mean he said he would be willing to help me but at this point I don't know if we can move fast enough as I am already transferred to my new boss' team.

I have so many questions and yet I am so indecisive....thanks in advance for anyone who put up with my ridiculous post.

TLDR - Spent 2 years working to get converted. finally got converted. 6 months later reorg happens. I tell my new boss I don't want to do the work she does. Now I'm in limbo and possibly about to be unemployed."

slh9kv,9,2022-02-05,Should I speed up my graduation date to work full-time after an internship or take my time to land additional internships?,sociame,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/slh9kv/should_i_speed_up_my_graduation_date_to_work/,"I was somehow lucky enough enough to land an internship for this upcoming summer with a tier 2 ish tech company. Well known but doesn't pay as well as many.

My plan originally was to use this internship as leverage to then land another potentially better internship or full-time job.

The internship I have landed would ask for me to return full-time in the Summer of 2023. If I pursue an additional internship I hypothetically wouldn't start full time until a year later, the summer of 2024 or so.

If I were to decide to go with option 1 I would need to speed up my graduation date by taking three classes a quarter in some quarters and classes over the summer, or potentially still be in school when I start working with them. However, I would be making a $100k+ salary about a year earlier, and gain professional experience a year earlier.

If I wait to graduate and pursue an additional internship I would be able to balance my time to focus on leetcode, personal projects, and probably get more out of each class. It could also result in being hired with a more reputable company out of the gate with higher pay.

I go to school in Texas but I live in Denver over the summers.

I’ve been researching online the best ways to gain experience and they all say shadowing/internships. So I’ve been looking at summer internships and there’s not really anything catered to freshman, let alone Pre-dental students unless you want to work as a dental assistant. I’m totally open to working as a dental assistant but I’m assuming there’s not an office that would want to put in the time to train me just for me to leave once school starts back up again.

My questions are:

1. Can I offer to work for free making the time they take to train worth it given free labor? (Is it legal for them, is this even appealing?)

2. Should I start by shadowing and then try to approach the unpaid internship question? (Again, can they even do an unpaid internship without a Pre-existing program already in place?)

3. Given the shadowing requirement to apply to dental school, would it be better for me to just load up on shadowing hours and ignore the internship aspect all together?

ANY input would be GREATLY appreciated!"

slhkze,0,2022-02-05,Should I graduate early?,Batzinga102,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/slhkze/should_i_graduate_early/,"A little background about me: Sophomore majoring in IT with a focus on media engineering. The reason I’m in IT rather than CS is because I just switched my major from film production last quarter and switching to IT will allow me to graduate on time and save money due to curriculum overlap between the two majors. (If i switched to a CS major, I would have to stay in school 2 extra years which would not be covered by scholarships)

However, my current plan is to work in programming. On top of my IT coursework (basics of SQL, Python), I’ve been doing the 100 Devs bootcamp in my spare time and really enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

While I feel like I’ve learned a lot since my decision to switch to IT, I know that I have so much to learn in order to catch up to other CS majors my age. I’m a very self-motivated learner (homeschooled for 10 years so used to teaching myself) and always did pretty well in school (currently 3.98 GPA and 36 ACT). I know I can succeed if I put in the work but right now my issue is just lack of experience and exposure to the content.


With this in mind my options are:

1. Graduate 2 quarters early (fall 2023), teaching myself programming and CS concepts through boot camps and self study in addition to my IT courses. Bust my ass and get my skills to a level where I can hopefully get an internship Summer 2023. This saves me around $10K.

2. Graduate on time (spring 2024) and take 8 extra computer science courses in order to round out my skillset and give me that structured foundation as a programmer. I’d still be doing tons of self study but would have more structured learning.


Given my lack of CS experience, which approach puts me in a better spot post-graduation? I appreciate any insights!"
slj8lf,8,2022-02-05,Incoming SWE major that’s worried he’s not cut out for the life he wants. (Long post),sweMajTA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/slj8lf/incoming_swe_major_thats_worried_hes_not_cut_out/,"I’m a high school senior that’s going to go to a mid-tier school in a small Canadian town. I didn’t even bother applying to places like Waterloo because I know it would be a waste of time and money.

I chose SWE instead of the other CS programs I was accepted to because it entails less math courses and more application-heavy ones. As a result of the constant schooling changes from the pandemic, my math skills are severely lacking. My grades don’t reflect that, but that’s only because all math tests over the past two years have been open note. I probably only have a decent understanding of 60% of what’s in my notebook. Today was my first calculus class and the teacher said no notes would be allowed during tests. That would’ve been the norm two years ago, but I was scared shitless and I don’t know how I’ll cope in university.

Maybe the easiest solution is to choose another major, but I can’t see myself working in any other field. Since sophomore year, I’ve taken the computer science courses offered for each grade and really fallen in love with the logic involved. I love how connected everything can be. But when I see the sort of things a software developer has to do, I have no idea how I can learn that in four years. I don’t know if I can (or even want to) handle the constant Leetcode + project grind for internships. The Canadian market is already a bloodbath, let alone for entry level positions. All of this is amplified tenfold due to my location, living an hour away from Toronto. I’m not good at interviews or having people skills. I don’t know how to begin networking. The people I know that do get good internships or US offers seem like prodigies, the levels of which I’ll never be able to attain in the time I have left. It’ll only be worse by the time I start.

I don’t want to be one of those people making 450k at the cost of my sanity. I don’t even care for FAANG that much. What I do want is to work in California, making low 6 figures with a decent work/life balance, easily managing rent with roommates. Every year I spend in Canada just wears away at me, seeing everything deteriorate before my very eyes. Housing market, jobs, cost of living, healthcare, everything. But even if I get a job and make it out of here, I’ll never be out of the woods; I’ll always have to keep ahead of the curve so as to not be disposable. I don’t want to end up like my father: graduating at 19 with a CS degree from a top university only to move to Canada, now still making 65k working as a sysadmin for the past 20 years. Seeing how he turned out hardly bodes well for someone like me. 

Will it ever get easier? Will I ever be able to relax and not have to worry about being made redundant? Replaced by some new prodigy that made it past the ever increasing standards? How can I even begin to repair the academic shit that fell apart in the wake of COVID? It all seems so disproportionately stressful for such uncertainty and I just want to call it quits."

I was recently admitted into the Cybersecurity Major at Purdue Polytechnic. I had a few questions about the program so I thought this was as good a place as any to ask them. 

What sorts of internships were you able to get?

In terms of career prospects, what sorts of companies recruit at Purdue, and what are the common starting positions and salaries?

I know you can add Networking Engineering Technology as a double major for relatively few additional hours. Is this something that’s difficult to undertake?

Thanks."

I began this journey at my local community college, I was lucky enough to attend a CC that offers an IT track that has a focus on Cloud Technology

During my time at CC I passed both AWS CCP and AWS SAA, took two courses on Python (Intro and DS&amp;A in Python), took Linux admin courses, as well as some other general IT courses such as networking, MS Server, and Storage Management (intro to SQL), during my final semester at CC I started applying for any internship I could find with the word ""Cloud"" in it, I knew if I wanted to break into DevOps I would need to have actual cloud experience and experience working in an actual IT environment

During my final semester at CC I was offered a position as a Cloud Analyst Intern (essentially a hybrid of helpdesk and Jr SysAdmin), during this internship I've worked with VMware vSphere, Windows Server, Citrix, and helped build a few customer environments in Azure. I'm still currently in this role until summer and I started applying for new internships with the titles ""SRE Intern"", ""DevOps Intern"", and anything else that seemed to be DevOps related, because my current internship doesn't have any real need for scripting or IaC, I knew I would need to find a new internship before I graduate so that I can get hands on with CI/CD and IaC so that I can ensure a Jr DevOps Engineer position upon graduation.

I interviewed for a DevOps Internship a few days ago and as the title states, I was extended an offer and accepted it afterwards. I was interviewed by 2 senior DevOps engineers, and while they didn't necessarily drill me on the nitty gritty, they did ask me question about some of the most common tools and methodologies in DevOps, thing like, ""what's the difference between CI and CD"", or ""Why would someone want to use an IaC tool like Terraform over a tool like CloudFormation"", ""what's your ideal job post-grad?"". They also informed me that the tech stack is going to be Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, AWS, Azure, and some different monitoring tools. I think where I really sealed the deal on the offer was when it came time for me to ask questions. I opened up with the fact that terraform just went through a fairly large update that changes the syntax a fairly large amount and I inquired about whether they were using the older version of Terraform or the newer version, when I asked this one of the Senior DevOps engineers expressed how insightful the question was, and it just goes to show a question that you may think isn't important, can really show your interviewers that you are interested.

After reading all of this you may thing that I'm some tech stud, but in all reality I'm just a normal guy just trying to fake till I make it, if you want to make it in tech, all you have to do is never give up, eventually you will achieve what you want to achieve.

For anyone that's interested in this kind of thing, the hourly is at $30 with a $1200 sign-on bonus, fully remote, company HQ in Great Lakes Area

Also shout out to u/WholeRyetheCSGuy , u/TenguShark , u/Merakel , and u/TROPiCALRUBi , all of these people offered me great advice at one time or another, and honestly without it, I'm not sure I would've made the decision that led me to where I am now, so thanks to all of you."
slmm63,21,2022-02-05,Perspective,thucydidestrap726,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/slmm63/perspective/,"Was thinking about how I dropped out of college my first semester due to debilitating social anxiety. I couldn’t drive from fear, didn’t have a job, and spent the rest of that year basically at home doing nothing. 

I got into therapy like 6 months later, started CBT, went on anti-depressants, and had some structure in my life to help me overcome my social fears, step-by-step. 

This was in 2015, and over the years, I started driving like all the time, not only went back to college, but was able to take the train by myself, and commute into Manhattan for school, and worked part-time in the meantime. 

I graduated Magna Cum Laude, with departmental honors (did an honors thesis with a presentation and everything), and won an academic award which I didn’t even know existed. I finished a prestigious internship with the Asia Society in December, signed up for Chinese lessons, and was just accepted into a Summer immersion program in Vermont (not sure if I can do it this year but that’s besides the point). am currently looking for full time work, which can be tough, but i’m trying, doing a ton of interviews which is not my favorite, but it needs to be done. 

I had to hit close to rock bottom to finally get serious help for my social anxiety. Over 7 years, I have made a ton of progress. There’s also still some things that I wish were better/going more smoothly. I realize I will never be completed satisfied, I’ll never be the non-awkward social butterfly that i’ve always envied, and I still have a long way to go.

With that being said, I am very proud of how far I’ve come. Just wanted to give some perspective for people who feel like they will never overcome their social anxiety. With proper treatment, taking things slow, setting goals for yourself, etc you’ll be surprised at how far you can go."
sln5ko,1,2022-02-05,I turned 25 two months ago and nothing has felt right for a very long time. Here's why.,throwawaydweebsadman,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/sln5ko/i_turned_25_two_months_ago_and_nothing_has_felt/,"This is going to be long and rambling. I've been stewing in my problems for a while and I want advice. Thank you for reading in advance.

It's going to be a year since I started therapy again. It's been a process that has been on and off for me, due to previous experiences being bipolar. That said, I'm still very much struggling with feeling happy, feeling confident, and becoming less anxious.

I'm coming to terms with the fact that I grew up in a toxic environment. My parents raised us a lot better than their parents, and they were (And still are) very supportive but there were moments of gaslighting, narcissistic behaviors, and a failure to understand my mental health issues at a young age. Additionally, I was the only one of my siblings who went to therapy and got medicine for my mental health. I am the oldest of three boys and my relationship with my brothers, more so as an adult, has been dysfunctional. More so with my youngest brother. Growing up, he had a lot of anger issues and was physically abusive towards me and my other brother. He could strike us and get punished but if we were to defend ourselves against him, we would also get a similar punishment (Spanked, yelled at, time out). The fact that he was able to attack us so often and we were conditioned to accept it has created a relationship currently that is unhealthy. He tends to lash out and blow up at me as an adult over very little things but he can shit on me all day and I can't say anything because of how we were raised. Due to my career and educational path (Which I'll explain later) I am vey fortunate to move around and always have a place to stay at home. That said, he currently lives there and this behavior is something my family has accepted and does nothing to combat due to sheer fatigue. The pandemic has made me realize how not normal this is and I started to confront him more recently, working my way up in a way that was more mature than how he was acting, but he still blows up and won't seek help. My parents will always take his sides during arguments but when he leaves the room they will comfort me and say I was in the right but can't talk to him that way, which pisses me off. Outside of my family, there is a lot of white trash drama that I do not care about but my family accepts as normal. I hate it. I just hate it. I love my family but they won't change or acknowledge the damage and it hurts. 

Outside of my family and in my hometown, I went to a school and grew up in an area riddled with toxic masculinity that was played off as a silly ""Boys will be boys"" situation. It didn't help that drug addiction was high and there was a good majority of residents who I would consider ""psychopaths"". I have three friends from that time period that I'm still close with and we talk about how we went through a lot of messed up situations, involving being witnesses to horrific crimes to being taught severely inappropriate stuff with teachers at a young age. I was a theatre kid when I was there and it was a way for me to express myself, since I grew up being bullied a lot. That said, I'm realizing how a lot of my ""expressing"" was used against me by my peers and how I was the butt end of a lot of jokes and pranks. 

I hit a really bad deterioration in my confidence and happiness at 20. I went to a college that was chaotic and went through several traumatic experiences that were passed off as ""Well, this was your fault"". This ranges from being sexually assaulted, being humiliated for being a virgin by half the campus when entering as a freshman (Due to my best friend from high school spreading rumors about me), being bullied by several professors and peers, and being strung along by potential lovers (Only to be told I should kill myself). I know I'm not perfect but with how bizarre this problems were I just went down this rabbit hole of ""Well, if all these people treat me this way and yell at me, obviously I'm the problem."" I don't know how I am but it feels like I was born with being the problem in every situation.

I got some help and some things started to turn around for me. I graduated early, went to grad school, moved up and down the country, did some awesome internships, and currently work in film and television. I want to make my own movies one day. I don't think it'll happen though. Working in the industry made me realize how it's run by trust fund babies who are insanely abusive to those who need the money and times on set to live. I have no time to work on my projects and I want to be privileged enough to do it but I don't know what else I can go into or how to work my way up since it's so tight with connections.

While this was happening, I was in a weird relationship situation with an ex that officially ended after a 2 year friendship. We dated in person during one internship and I swear she was the one. That said, she doesn't live in this country and we had to go long term once it ended. We were on and off but she was very poetic with her words throughout, suggesting that we would be back together and move in once she came back to the country. She came back and she was, again, vert poetic with our future and reuniting. The relationship in person was very healthy and great. Before I got to meet up with her (After buying non-refundable tickets) She told me a week before that she was sleeping with someone and dating them after she kept flirting with me and sending me nudes literally the day before she told me. She tried to make me the bad guy in the situation and... I fucking hate it. I really fucking trusted her but now I don't know who to trust in my life.

Also... I'm still a virgin technically. I've never penetrated a vagina mostly because... I've never had the opportunity. I've pretty much either been through bad timing, raped and got out of the situation before I could go further with someone abusive, strung along and cucked at the very last minute, or go nowhere with the crushes I have or people who are attracted to me. I'm at a point where I either want to get it over with, be with someone who gives a shit about me, or just accept the fact that I'm unfuckable. I'm very jaded with love and dating. Recently, I thought a co-worker (An immigrant who speaks English as a second language) had a crush on me, due to how close they were getting to me, catching glances with each other for very long periods of times, and talking about meeting up after work (To which I agree) but... My boss fucked my scheduled up and is now trying to sleep with her by making it impossible for us to see each other, both on and off work (The film industry has stupid hours...)

And I feel like I'm destined to be the punchline and I want to feel different. I feel spoiled but I also feel lonely and depressed still. 

I've done a lot of cool things with my life but there has been a lot of abnormalities that are haunting me and eating me from the inside out. There's a part of me that knows I can do better and yet the better just feels stuck.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I want things to change but I fear it won't and I'll be stuck like this forever."

I'm a third-year computer science student in university right now, and I wanted to get a second opinion on what to do over the summer. I've taken a machine learning course at university, which gave an overview of statistical and non-neural network approaches in ML, and am currently taking another course in natural language processing right now, but I'm not feeling that ready to tackle machine learning research.

Notably, I feel pretty weak with my Python, Numpy, and Pytorch skills, as well as my understanding of statistical methods and deep learning. But I likely won't have enough time to dive deep into a machine learning course in addition to my current workload.

Should I spend my summer taking online courses and learning more about these topics, or would it be better to spend my summer doing a summer research internship?

If I do get an opportunity to do a summer research internship, do you think I'd have enough time over two weeks (i.e. break after finals) to get a good understanding of Python, Numpy, Pytorch, and/or statistical machine learning theory or deep learning?"

slsioz,11,2022-02-06,Should I bite the bullet and continue my PhD or bailout while I still can?,Arbaald,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/slsioz/should_i_bite_the_bullet_and_continue_my_phd_or/,"Hello from Italy everyone,
I recently found this sub which has filled many of my curiosity on cs carrers in eu.
The post is long so I will put tldr at the end.

So, as the title suggest i am currently stuck between a rock and hard place.
I am 24 years old and I have the laurea magistrale, I thinks it translates to master's degree in Europe,in computer engineering with a curricula focused on AI.
I was able to win a position for a PhD in my local university.
The focus of the project ,written with my supervisor, is on adversarial machine learning to be used on a AI application used for autonomous vehicle driving.
The Pros: 

1)I like the idea of this research project;

2)my fellow PhD colleagues are a good and funny company to work with;

3)The university, after five years, feels like a second home to me and it's filled of young people;

4)While I don't like the idea of pure research or academy, i would like to work in the AI field where a PhD can usually give an edge.

The cons:

1)inhuman hours, our supervisor told us through jokes that they expect complete dedication and over 70-80 hours of work each week, weekends include. They say we have to be passionate and work harder and harder for our self, but to me seems much a kind way to squeeze us dry ;

2) even with inhuman hours, we receive task related to university ,lesson and similar, or networking , transport food or prepare room form meetings,  which often prevents us to do research activities for many hours or whole days;

3) toxic attitude for which we have to work and complete our task even if it's impossible to carry the load. On of my fellow PhD student was reprimanded for not reaching is weekly goals.
They were on top of having to help over ten student in their thesis works and having to prepare the material for one of our courses.
When he asked feedback for his research activities and how to continue, the answer was ""it's not important right now and we don't care, focus on our task"";

4) toxic power dynamic in which we have a top professor who can do everything and has to approve everything. Our supervisor means nothing, if the top professor says something, you have to obey or else you are in big troubles. He also changes idea even on task he assignes. You could work for months on things and then everything will be rejected and you wasted your time.
And good luck in having feedback from him, he is always occupied.
Also, if he says your work is not good for any reason, you either waste months to appease him and then try to publish your paper or else you won't publish at all;

5)The only PhD student with some publication, is the one in the third year with over 7 of them.
The students of the second year have zero publication, nothing. One of them is working on a conference paper for over seven months and it has been impossible to publish and appease the top professor, in order to proceed with an application of the paper itself to
 the conference;

6) I have an industrial scholarship, so I will work six months in a company. This would have been a pro if not for the fact that if I don't complete my PhD for any reason, being that I renounce to the position or i am rejected to the second or third year, I have to give back a whole year of scholarship, around 13000 euros;

7)the scholarship is around 1100 euros a month. Even with our below average salary in Italy, i can expect from 400 to 600 euros more If I start to work. Also add in that many companies while remain in remote working, so I would not be forced to move to work and pay an higher rent;

8)I don't think I like to do only research. I like the coding aspect, the software engineering parts of our jobs. I feel like I am negleting this skill too much while doing the PhD. If the working hours where feasible, I would have loved to study by myself and improve,but It's not possible;

9) no abroad period and no possibility of choosing our internship. We are stuck in Italy with what they chose for us;

10) No flexibility from our supervisor and the top professor. You have to ask permission for everything and they decide if they want to approve it. For them from 8 to 19 every day you have to be in the university lab. You need a day to do some activities? They decide.
You want a vacation? They don't exist.
Holidays? Day in which you can work more.

11) Instead of studying to be able to do research activities in my second year, I have been tasked with preparing a robot and all the related material for a course which will take places in the next months. I am expected to be perfect in three weeks and to support in ten weeks of courses. Else I can salute the possibility of having my PhD.

There is only one final catch for which i have yet not bailed out. If renounce now, so while I still don't own any money, I will not be eligible any more for any funded PhD position in Italy and the professor of my university will provide no cover letter for abroad position.
I would only be able to do unfunded position in Italy.
Is either I do it and sacrifice three years of myself and my mental sanity or else no more PhD for me.

Tldr: toxic PhD environment, no focus on research, menial activities triumph over important one. If I bail out I won't be able to partecipate in funded PhD position in Italy and i can forget to do PhD position abroad since no cover letter will be ever given to me.

I'm a 31, German, and hope that some of you may be able to offer some advice on how to best continue to improve my programming knowledge and start a career in the field.

My past is a bit difficult to explain and I don’t want to bore you with too much detail (I dropped out of school due to  depression etc., absolutely no work experience at my age amongst other things) and leaves me uncertain about what to do next.

I've been learning Python on my own for the past year, initially by completing  courses on edx, then moved on to just start working on my own small projects and ideas, just simple things that interested me (an app with a gui framework, a little game with Pygame, a bot, something with Matplotlib etc.).

Currently I'm trying to broaden my knowledge and find another larger project I would like to work on. It’s the first time that I genuinely enjoy what I’m doing and am motivated to continue to learn.

I’m at a cross-roads, especially as my financial situation is a bit tight and I’m trying to figure out the most viable path forward. The general ideas that I have considered so far include:

1. Umschulung: Fachinformatik – Anwendungsentwicklung \[a German way to go back to school in a different field\]
2. duale Ausbildung: Fachinformatik – Anwendungsentwicklung \[a German „trade school” in conjunction with first work experience\]
3. Bootcamps (are there any that you can recommend, especially given my limited budget and living in Germany?)
4. Praktikum \[internship\]
5. Finding a job while continuing to learn on my own and making the switch into the field down the line

There are obviously many paths with varying pros and cons, especially at my stage, and I would be curious to hear from others that have gone through similar situations or just thoughts / advice any of you may have would be greatly appreciated.

No matter which one I'll ultimately choose I'm obviously going to continue learning on my own as well. Maybe you even have ideas on what I could or rather should learn next to steer me in the right direction.  


e: should maybe mention i've got ""mittlere reife"" \[10 years of high school\]  


Thanks a lot for reading!"

However, I have never really been good at problem-solving.  I also feel that I am not interested in it. I have always put problem-solving off for some other time and felt that if I had more tricks in my bag, I could have been a better problem solver. Now, I think academia requires people who have good problem-solving skills and a mathematical bent of mind and so I fear failure if I try it out.

This is a rehash of what happened before so if you would like to skip directly to the issue jump ahead to the arrow.

The apartment was full with her stuff, so i moved a few things that were in the way into her storage (mainly things in the kitchen, under the desk), i told her about needing some space in the kitchen mainly and she agreed to come by on the 7th to take care of things which i was fine with. That turned sour as she started saying that i moved things without her consent and that she doesn't remember where her things are, i told her that i merely moved her stuff with care and that i would put things back where they were when i moved out, but things got heated, and i suggested terminating the contract.

Two days later, she got back to me saying that i should just remain in the apartment, i agreed and she suggested that she come by to pick some stuff she needed for her internship, i obliged and i stayed in the apartment this time. And we apologized to each other. 

--&gt; Now to the matter at hand, i was supposed to move out on the 5th at 7 p.m. to hand over the keys, but i got a call that she tested positive for Covid amd that she wouldn't be able to check over the apartment, i suggested one of her friends come over but she said she will come up woth a solution,, which was that she will drive at 6 p.m. and i could leave the keys on the front and stand far back while she checks over everything., i was fine with that.

When she came by, i did as we agreed but she said that she parked her car in a bad place and she would need to take care of it meaning she would not have time to check over the apartment, i said okay then i will leave for my hotel and you can take a look and reach me whenever there is something. Come nighttime, i get a call where she starts listing off things that are wrong with the apartment (no damages just things she considered time consuming therefore would need to deduct them from my deposit except for some plants which see says died).

At this point, i was furious, i was anxious and the experiences with her compounded and i told her to stop talking to me and to take the whole deposit of 500€, i was laying into her with insults and then i blocked her.

The next day in the evening, i get voicemails saying that i stole her music box and that if i dont call her back, she will report me to the police. 

I was shocked speechless, i called her back saying i did not take anything from her apartment. I got a reply on WhatsApp after i unblocked her and she said that her and her friends checked the whole apartment but did not find anything. 

I just would like to know what is my recourse ? Is the burden of proof on me or her ?

I do not want to get into legal shenanigans as i am leaving for my home country in a few days."

I am graduating this semester and I already accepted an offer from a company after doing a million interviews. I have always considered myself behind because I previously dropped out but managed to do my bachelors in 2 1/2 years to at least graduate ""on time"". As you could imagine, trying to find an internship was stressful while managing the relentless barrage of courses I was taking. I ultimately did get an internship at PNC Bank for a data analytics role but months after my friends. I was extended a full time offer but I was not too interested in moving to Pittsburgh and I also did not want to pigeon hole myself from other opportunities. This offer was around 75k, 82k after bonus. After my interview process I had 3 offers that stood out to me in particular:

A financial analyst position at Amazon. I was able to make it through Amazon's grueling interview process which tested me mostly on my accounting skills. The role was not really anything I was interested in but I saw opportunity in possibly moving internally. I made sure to ask every interviewer if I would be able to pivot to a technical role and they assured me it was possible. It was also a rotating programing where I would travel to 4 different states over the course of 2 years which caught my attention. Ultimately, a mentor of mine advised against this offer because they believed it had little room for growth. This was also my lowest offer at around 65k, 70k after bonus.

A technology associate at Wells Fargo. I had a lot of success with banks presumably because of my internship experience. From my understanding this role would allow me to work as, essentially, a software engineer for the bank. This is something I desired because all of my professional experience is data science and machine learning oriented and I sought more general development experience. However, my previous experience at a bank also showed me that, and correct me if I am wrong, banks are a little archaic in their tech practices. I imagined myself learning how to use their systems and becoming bogged down at the company with no marketable, desirable skills. They gave me the opportunity to work in any state they had an office in but New York was unavailable. Any other state I was interested in was also unavailable. I was recommended for the North Carolina office which is the headquarters. This offer was around 80k, 85k after bonus.

A technology consultant at EY. This is the offer I accepted. It was in NYC so I would not have to worry about moving which was another concern because of a lease I recently signed. I have also been told by countless people that the experience you can gain from EY is unmatched because of the variety of industries you're exposed to. From my understanding, consulting is less hands on and more so about finding solutions to problems companies are facing. Although the role did test me on my tech knowledge, it did not have any technical test. I imagine my knowledge as a programmer growing conceptually but probably not in practice. This offer was 85k, 92k after bonus.

Based on the opportunities I received, did I make the best decision if I ultimately want to work in tech? I loathe the idea of professionalism and corporate practices. My desire to enter tech partly stemmed from this reason because I am not too interested in wearing button down shirts, suit jackets and maintaining a ""professional"" image. I have a neck tattoo and my arms are also tatted so I assume I have to wear a long sleeve collared shirt in any client facing situations. I could bear this for a solid 3 years but probably no longer. I have a set of some pretty fast growing locs as well and who knows how long it will be before I am told my appearance is not professional. In a few months work will be my life and I would like the reassurance that these 80 hours weeks I am about to endure will be worth it for my future.

tldr: Based on the roles financial analyst at Amazon, technology associate at Wells Fargo and technology consultant at EY, did I make the best decision by choosing EY given I want to settle in tech."

I am more interested in the Playstation position, but I feel like you can't really turn down Amazon. I connected really well with my interviewers at Playstation, and I would work directly under them. I'm also interested in Game Development and approaching new ideas in the Future Forward Concepting team. I was also wondering whether my first internship would be the best time for me to explore my interests.

At Amazon, I got interviewed by this random guy from Singapore (I'm in US, btw) who didn't seem interested in the slightest. However, as my first internship, I feel like I have something to prove to myself and future employers, and it would make the most sense to accept the most prestigious offer. I also don't really know what you would actually do as an intern, and it seems like the company doesn't really care about its thousands of interns.

Which would you suggest I accept and why?

I too felt out of place at times and even questioned myself since I was usually average *at best* in my tech classes. In fact, I failed to declare CS the first time around which really hurt. Part of me felt ashamed but in hindsight I realized that having the right mindset is incredibly important. When things don't go the way you want it to ... you can't change what's already happened so make the most of what you do have. Take a moment to appreciate the qualities you possess, the people in your life, and think about what you can work on to improve. You will pull through the tough times!

When one door closes, another will open. I was fortunate that the Data Science major just came out so I hopped onboard. It was embarrassing but I actually ended up enjoying the major despite it being labelled as a ""backup major"" at the time and was still taking some the same classes as my CS friends. Our paths may have diverged but the opportunities that were ahead of us remained the same. I could apply to the same internships/jobs/clubs. I ended up appealing into the CS major after doing an internship as a DS major and ended up doing a double major. Present day, most of my friends and I are doing the same thing anyway (being coding monkeys in the industry). It doesn't matter how you get there as ""unconventional"" the route you have taken may seem. What matters is that you may have fallen several times but you got up, dusted yourself off, and persevered through the difficult times to where you are today. Think about it another way, you get to the same destination (I'll define this as ""success"") but you took a little detour with a different and perhaps better view. You got to experience something unique and you get to keep the new knowledge, vision, values, whatever it may be that you harvested along the way. You don't need to constantly compare yourself with your peers. Where they are at isn't an indicator for your own success. Hell, the path they are taking might not even be the right one for you. You don't need to be like them. You are a unique and special individual. 

So for whoever needs to hear this, you may be going through something (doesn't matter how minute it may seem to others) and it may be difficult to adjust your mindset at the moment, but gradually learn to look at it from another perspective. Everything can be a learning experience that shapes your identity and it only makes you stronger, more unique. Obviously it's not as simple as just flipping a switch and all of a sudden you can be positive/confident about things. It takes time to learn how to appreciate yourself and not constantly place yourself in a rat race. Take some time to slow down, reflect, and remember that your happiness/well-being is key to your success. You will be successful regardless of how you get there but if you are miserable even after all that you have accomplished ... it's not worth it.

Hopefully, my message is of some use. I'm not the best at writing but I'm a good listener if you want to vent or talk (feel free to pm me, I'm all ears)."

Upon research I found that this offer is in the bottom 10% of the average salary for IE's in the area, median being 77k. I'm coming out of college with my Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification along with ability to code (Python/R) and 2 years of related internship experience. How much room do I realistically have to negotiate here? I will also have to relocate.

**Update**
I just received an email for an interview with Goldman Sachs for a data analysis type position. I heard their interview process takes about 2 months from friends who have interviewed there. Kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place going if i should go through that interview process with this offer on the table. Also have scheduled a time to discuss contract details at original company later this week."

***Thank you.***

List of good ideas rcvd so far. 

* 1	Sources of income as a 1st year student / Sources of income in any year of undergraduation please.
* 2	How to search for internships? (Field specific advice)
* 3	How dependency on colleges is decreasing when it comes to computer science.
* 4	design education in india
* 5	Research output in India and how it relates to entrance examinations and the auxillary systems (like coaching classes).
* 6	How to excel in Indian law schools
* 7	Off the beaten path subjects like Materials Science , good colleges for this, scope of field
* 8	Mathematics and computing branch in Engineering and science.
* 9	Good Institutes in India for Linguistics, Archeology, etc. ie, courses not many people take, and job opportunities in India and Abroad
* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?
* 14	Actuarial Science, exam prep, scope and experience in India
* 15	Future of academia in Mechanical Engineering. (Preferably from people who are just now completing their PhDs and looking to get into academia, the obstacles they're facing etc)
* 16	Sports Data Analytics
* 17	Masters abroad (preferably from people who have completed their masters abroad)
* 18	does anybody know how to take good notes? From a textbook and during a class/lecture....
* 19	Undergrad overseas or foreign universities and Hybrid courses (Few Semesters in India/ and Few abroad)
* 20	Courses for Power Engineering. PhD in the Energy industry. Options after undergoing a diploma course in the same industry. Job prospects, not necessary, but if indicated will be gold.
* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids
* 24	Alternatives to medical for PCB kids
* 25	Stuff/programmes to do in India as a gap year student
* 26	MSc in quant Econ Vs MBA in terms of ROI, job opportunity etc
* 27	MBBS from foreign country
* 28	How to prepare for SAT
* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india
* 34	Could we have people who are working in some xx field post a detailed guide on  1. how to find employment off campus in their field, and  2. what online courses/projects etc we could do while still in school to be more competitive
* 35	Detailed review of &lt;your college/university&gt;  1. Which course/year you are in  2. What are the Pros and Cons of your college, in academic, non-academic and placement scenarios
* 36	BCA vs B.Sc (Computer Science) vs B. Sc (Information Technology) vs B. Tech (Computer Science Engineering)
* 37	Which engineering branch is right for you? This is so that people don't blindly run after cse and actually choose the branch they would enjoy and can excel in it
* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!
* 43	The unequal relationship between Profs and students with no safety net for students
* 44	Syllabus needs to include real life topics like parenting, mental health, home maintenance, how to enjoy life, financial planning, etc
* 45	lesser-known professions or sector which the general public think aren't good enough, but surprisingly pays well or have some other advantage like good work-life balance.
* 46	Which countries are best to study PG in as an Indian Graduate. Based in affordability/quality of education/difficulty in getting admissions
* 47	What the education system is not teaching.
* 48	Career in Public Health , prospects and career graph et al
* 49	IPMAT Preparation
* 50	How to be not ""useless"" even after graduation in India?
* 51	How to prepare and give your best shot for placements? Bcom hons in DU.
* 52	Design in India and how to network"

The only thing that I feel could help me grow and mitigate my depression seems to be traveling.,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/smelf6/24_year_old_who_feels_that_life_is_so_monotonous/,"To start off with, I am on track to graduate college this fall. I'm surprised I've managed to get myself this far, but I still go through the motions each day with no motivation, I don't look forward to anything I'm doing because I know the day will look extremely similar to the day before. And it's not just that life is boring, but people, in general, seem boring and unhappy. The only end goal seems to be as follows: ""get a shitty, 9-5 office job, working 40+ hours a week where you compete with your co-workers in a stressful environment while sucking up to your corporate bosses each morning, get married, have kids, then spend the rest of your life stuck in a dull suburban neighborhood where the most excitement you get out of a day is going to the new grocery store that opened in town."" I wouldn't feel fulfilled at all if that would be my end goal. That mentality might change as I get older, but right now the ""normal"" thing to do after college graduation is not an option I have in mind. And the prospect of continuing to live a dull day to day life routine exacerbates my depression. Since I was a child, I've wanted to travel the world, to go to different places, experience different cultures, and meet different people outside of the U.S. This year, I might have the opportunity to do just that in a study abroad program I'm thinking about applying to and this seems to be the only thing I'm looking forward to doing this year; not an internship I have to do over the summer, not college gradation, not seeing the same people where we talk about the same topics ""how did you do on on that test, how was your weekend, did you go to class yesterday blah blah."" No, the only thing I'm looking forward to, with the high hopes that I might discover myself more, is to travel the world. Maybe, in the process, I will find that ""spark"" that really gets me motivated and excited about life, instead of wasting the remainder of my 20's away stuck in an office or a classroom. Maybe, I'm an idealist, a big dreamer, but I don't really wanna follow the ""status quo"" which is what I described above. I think the purpose of life is higher than something so mundane. Does anyone have any experience in feeling this way or have you any of you traveled outside the country before? And, did you find that it helped with your depression?"

This was during the time when FB and Instagram were not as toxic cesspools as they are now. 

I was an intern in an upscale shopping complex, and was tasked to beef up our social media presence. My fellow interns and I came up with a Valentine's Day campaign where we would ask couples going around the complex if they wanted to have their picture professionally taken and posted on our social media pages. We thought it was a good idea at the time, but being naive interns we didn't realize how much it could all go wrong.

It was close to the end of our workday when I spotted a couple with a baby outside of a Froyo place, looking like a picture perfect family. It was a good opportunity to show customers enjoying Valentine's as a family in our complex. As I walked closer though, it looked like something was amiss. The mom and dad looked annoyed and were like in some sort of disagreement. My coworker with the DLSR told me it wasn't a good idea to approach them. But I, ever the naive optimist, thought a nice picture might improve their seemingly shitty Valentine's. Dragging my coworker along, I approached the family and did my whole spiel about our social media campaign. I told them they looked like a cute couple and had an adorable baby, and asked if they wanted to have their picture professionally taken and posted online. 

After a few seconds of silence, with me realizing at that moment that maybe my coworker was right, the mom burst out laughing. The dad, though, looked absolutely disgusted. We stood there confused AF not knowing how to process their reactions. The mom calmed down a bit and told us that the man was her brother, not her husband. She then turned to her clearly mortified brother and said, ""This is what you get for being late to pick up the baby."" On cue, a man approached us carrying bowls of froyo and asking what was up. It was the husband of course, and the mom started laughing again while the brother looked like he wanted to sink into the ground. She explained the whole incident to her husband, who proceeded to rib on the brother for having an incestuous relationship with his wife. Meanwhile, I felt like the biggest dumbass in the world while my coworker was chuckling behind me. The couple did end up taking a picture with us, and we apologized for the mix up. The couple took it in stride, however, the brother didn't acknowledge us at all and took the baby once it was done. 

I felt pretty embarrassed to say the least, and my coworker mentioned the incident to all the interns and it quickly reached our boss. Thankfully, I didn't get in trouble, but my fellow interns didn't let me live that down for the rest of the time I was there. 

Tldr: Implied incest onto a couple with a baby"

My gpa has sort of tanked, and has been since hs. I was always able to get away with not studying and still getting straight As, but obviously that is not a sustainable method as academic content and difficulties increase. Though I’m working on bringing it back up (especially with some in person learning making things easier to process), I’m fearful that I’m destroying my future and hopes of getting into law school. I feel behind my peers as I don’t have above a 3.5, haven’t pursued internships, and push off assignments to the point where my teachers have to fail me. It’s so ironic because I always have these large aspirations and study plans— I even start most classes as an engaged student, but quickly drop off and my effort and participation plateaus. 

I know most of this is likely because of my mental health struggles and adhd (before anyone goes on their soapbox about mental illness I do have a diagnosis and it’s very evident I’ve had it since childhood— not that that’s crucial info but I digress). I’ve been recently beginning to receive medication, and have gotten some P/NP options for past courses (so they don’t affect my gpa). I know I’m an intellectually capable person, but at the end of the day my motivation and study habits don’t exhibit that. 

I guess I’m mainly wondering if anyone has advice for changing habits that have formed over a long period of time (or perhaps never formed)? And also if anyone has experience in some similar situations and how they navigated it/if the success I’m envisioning is possible for me? 

Ps) I’ve never used Reddit to post so sorry if this is the wrong way to go about it!! Thanks in advance"

I only began learning programming really in-depth last year, and prior to that I didnt really have much (if any) coding background or experience. I was quite fascinated by data science &amp; stuff, so that's what I started off learning. So it was mainly python and SQL. However as I began coding more, I also became more fascinated by coding and software engineering in general, so I looked to expand beyond that as well after I had been self-learning for a few months

So a short while back, I began looking for possible coding internships to do before I began university studies. Its really just for the experience and learning in the process while also earning some income on the side for myself. I ended up landing an internship offer at a start-up which I readily accepted  (every single other place only accept college students), but I was accepted mainly because of other stuff on my résumé (my school &amp; academic background was pretty good and i was rather heavily involved in professional scientific research), instead of coding background and skill. 

 My job scope would mainly be web and app development, which makes me feel rather out of my depth since most of my prior coding experience and knowledge was in data science kinda stuff. So the impostor syndrome is hitting rather hard.

What's the best way for me to prepare for such an internship? There just seems to be so much to learn, from HTML CSS to JavaScript to APIs &amp; API development, on top of all the other stuff as a software dev of using git/github to manage big projects (which I have basically no prior experience in). I've already kinda got the hang of HTML in web dev, now trying to self-learn JavaScript.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks! :)"

I’ve been really struggling over the past year in my career and I’m beginning to think software development isn’t for me. 

For context, I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science, along with about 2.5 years experience (including a 1 year internship) in industry. I’ve liked coding but I’ve never been passionate about it—I do it for a job and that’s it. 

My intern year and the first few weeks of my graduate job were great. I loved where I worked and I loved the people I was with. I got a lot of support and I learned a lot. Several changes happened in that company (people leaving, business decisions that were only going to go downhill (and they have)), and I’ve been planning to move country for a while now. Nevertheless I waited for a bit, but things didn’t get better. At the end of last year, I started applying to companies in my chosen country and I got a job. I moved in December and started in January. 

Everyone’s really nice but I’m struggling a lot. I was technically a full stack dev in my last job because I worked on parts of the front end and back end, but I was told that this job was mainly a back end job. I was fine with this, but when I arrived I was told I was a full stack dev. I wouldn’t mind this either if there were people I could ask about the code, but my team is fully back end and I’m getting really lost. So far it’s taken me 2 and a half weeks to do a ticket and I’m not even done yet. I’m not even sure it’s THAT hard to do, I just feel completely overwhelmed. I also have learning difficulties and they’re kicking my ass right now, especially since they get worse with stress. Not to mention that the salary is not a full stack salary, but that’s the least of my worries. I just feel like shit everyday and it’s affecting my self esteem. Some of the processes in the company confuse me and I don’t think they’re helping things either. 

Like I said, I’m even questioning if software development is for me at this point. Sitting at a desk feeling stupid because I can’t do the work is really mentally affecting me. I’m only about a month into employment at this company and I feel like shit. I dread every Monday and don’t sleep well at least a couple of days per week. I just don’t know what I could do that would give me the same amount of opportunities in a country that I can’t even speak the language. I really like the country and I don’t want to move. 

Does anyone have any idea on what I could do? Should I stick it out? Find another company? I’m not sure that’ll fix things honestly, since I’ve moved companies and that hasn’t fixed the issue. Any advice is appreciated though."

smwche,0,2022-02-07,Need Reassurance About Graduating Early,i-tried-ok,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/smwche/need_reassurance_about_graduating_early/,"Hi! I am an undergraduate student studying CS at a school that's pretty decent for CS (T50). I am graduating in 2 years (entered Fall 2021 and will graduate Spring 2023) and have the option of pursuing a masters in CS at the same school which will likely be free. My family is very against the idea of me doing a masters even if it is free and wants me to enter the workforce upon graduation. I am currently a research assistant for an ML project through my college and also have an internship lined up for the summer. This (aside from some personal projects) is the only CS experience I have.

I am a naturally anxious person and am very scared that I won't get a job upon graduating. I would like honest opinions about whether I can get a job at least at the median salary for new grads when I graduate or if I should do a masters so I have more time to get experience. I will also be somewhat young upon graduation (19), will this hurt my chances of getting a job?"

smz1ig,3,2022-02-07,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (2/7/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/smz1ig/weekly_job_qa_thread_272022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 110th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I'm a junior CS major currently hustling to try to find a summer internship for 2022, and I was looking for advice on any positions that lean closer to the business aspect of the field. 

I am not a great programmer - I'm currently taking a LinkedIn Learning course to improve, but I'm not confident I'll be able to pull off a coding interview with much success yet. I'm a management minor, with solid leadership skills and experience, so I'm hoping I can leverage that to obtain a decent internship in the CS field.

I've recently started shooting off my resume to companies nearby, since I already live pretty close to the silicon valley. I had a 6 month internship between my sophomore and junior years at Intel (not a FAANG company, but not a nobody company either), and I am wondering how valuable that work experience is, and how much it improves my chances of getting a job. Aside from that, I have only one personal project that is publicly available to view, and I don't exactly have much time to do any other personal projects since I work a part time job in addition to taking upper division classes. So my question is, is this good enough to get a job straight out of college, or do I need to grit my teeth and code up another personal project for my portfolio? I know there isn't any one correct answer, but any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!"
sn136d,1,2022-02-07,BNY Mellon (NYC) vs Liberty Mutual (Indianapolis or WFH),Ninjamo69,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sn136d/bny_mellon_nyc_vs_liberty_mutual_indianapolis_or/,"I am lucky to have two offers for my first internship. I have already accepted BNY Mellon but was just given the liberty mutual offer today.

**BNY Mellon:**

Location: NYC

Pay: $35/hr and no housing

Pros: better tech stack? cooler city

Cons: no housing and housing is expensive af, horrible communication with the recruiter (never answered my questions and lied about my deadline so I had to accept early)

**Liberty Mutual:**

Location: Indianapolis or work from home

Pay: $28/hr and $2,000 housing stipend (if I WFH, then no stipend)

Pros: Can work from home, housing in Indianapolis cheaper, great communication with recruiters

Cons: worse tech stack? located in the suburbs of Indianapolis, would have to renege BNY Mellon

&amp;#x200B;

I am stuck between the two. I don't know much about the tech stacks of each but it feels like BNY would have a more modernized tech stack. Money isn't necessarily a factor but is still nice. I am a second-year student and plan to have an internship during Spring 2023 and Summer 2023 so I have a few more chances at other companies.

EDIT: I would appreciate any comments about either company and why. Thanks!

sn1gnc,2,2022-02-07,Just Landed My First Software Engineering Internship!,Znoh,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sn1gnc/just_landed_my_first_software_engineering/,"I'm a senior in college nearly a semester away from graduation and just landed my first Software Engineering Internship! I've been programming for as long as I can remember and while I remember feeling definitely subpar in my initial learning days. I have come to really appreciate how much I have really learned over the course of my undergraduate career and pre-college days. As corny as it sounds I'm thankful for all the late nights and stressful deadlines of getting programs in on time that are sometimes not up to a particular standard which I hold myself to. Being able to learn and program and continue learning more and then apply that knowledge, rinse and repeat for essentially anything I set my mind to has really changed my outlook on the way I work both in the classroom and the workplace.

I figure you guys want something more interesting than a story so I have a little Javascript program I built as a project during my senior year of high school (around 4-5 years ago now). I designed and programmed the whole thing through the website ""[code.org](https://code.org)"" and while it helped with some of the GUI features I wasn't acquainted with at the time, I essentially wrote all the ""algorithms"", (which are such a hot mess looking back on it, and I'm really thinking about building a different one that is definitely more object-oriented for fun), behind the string concatenation from scratch. (new for me at the time, blew my mind!) It's quite a long mess of code that has its quirks still and I haven't worked on the project in the better part of 5 years now. (there are still bugs go find them and have fun!) Looking back I can see how bad the code actually is to me, and to some, they might agree or disagree, it doesn't matter because to me it's bad and I can see how much I've learned since writing it and how I would implement new ideas that I've learned since to make it much more efficient, quick and cleaner. I guess what I'm trying to say is to keep learning because you can only improve the more you learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, don't try to read the code in block mode it's unbearable, I typed the whole thing Show Text mode, you can switch in the upper right-hand corner after viewing the code."

sn26vd,4,2022-02-07,Possibility of Quant Career Path,Philly_D_888,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/sn26vd/possibility_of_quant_career_path/,"Hi all! I was just admitted to UMD College Park for the undergraduate CS program and I'm exploring potential career paths. Quant finance seems to be a highly coveted, difficult, and interesting career that I would like to learn more about. 

**Disclaimer: A lot of this is specific to the UMD CS Program**

I don't know exactly what I want to do as I haven't even started my degree yet but I'm trying to gain an idea of what this career path could look like and whether it's a possibility in the first place. Like I said I'm not dead set on quant finance but I realize that it's a hyper-competitive industry with jobs often going to PHDs so I assume the more focused I am, the clearer my goals are and the sooner I start progressing towards them (whatever they end up being), the greater my chances are of reaching them. 

My questions to those in industry or with relevant knowledge/skills are:

1. What are the quant positions accessible to those with computer science degrees?
2. What kind of GPA is expected of CS Majors? How flexible is this? 
3. Would I be better suited to pursuing a different undergrad degree, double majoring, or taking up a minor?
4. Is UMD College Park CS a target program for quant finance or other types of quant jobs? Do the more prestigious firms accept UMD CS Major? If they do, would they accept someone straight out of undergrad? 
5. I saw on their website they have internships at Jane Street (which I assume are greatly fought over), what advice would you offer to qualify for this and similar opportunities? What are the general probabilities of return offers? (I'm sure this is hard to know; just curious)
6. What non-required classes should I take in college? How would you weigh the importance of GPA vs. rigor/relevance to quant jobs?
7. Is graduate school a requirement for quant positions and what would you recommend I major in?
8. Is Washington D.C. a prominent location for quant opportunities? If not where would be? I'm open to moving to practically any major city or another country?
9. Is remote work a possibility in the quant world?
10. What are similar jobs to becoming a quant that require a CS degree and analytical skills? 
11. How much is undergrad research considered when applying to quant jobs or internships?
12. Careers in AI &amp; Data Science also sound interesting; if out of college I pursued one of these, would a switch to being a quant be difficult?
13. How probable is it that I become a quant and is it something I should conceivably pursue?

Thank you for answering any of the above questions and I greatly appreciate any knowledge shared!"

sn3ffy,1,2022-02-07,I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering 2 years ago. I now think I want to get into an IT career. How do I go about this from where I'm currently at?,EchoAndNova,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/sn3ffy/i_graduated_with_a_bs_in_mechanical_engineering_2/,"So I spent 5 years at university to get my bachelor's in mech eng. I didn't realize until the end that pretty much every job and even internship will require 60-80+ hours a week of full on dedication. I have other priorities and interests like family, my automotive detailing side business, and other hobbies (currently getting into repairing electronics).

Also, not having any personal connections in the engineering field has made it extremely difficult to get started in my agricultural heavy city. Competition here is FIERCE, so I haven't been able to stand out enough to land any jobs. Most eng. friends I had ended up having to get their masters, which I deeply do not desire to do. I would also like to remain living in my home town.

**Anyways to the point of the post**: I want to get into (or at least look into) an IT career. A family member in IT told me that the hours and overall intensity isn't at bad and pay is good. I am tech savvy and always like learning more about tech, electronics, networking, etc. I've heard bad things about the field, but let's be honest, every job has bad aspects. I just want decent/good pay and anything over 40hr/week optional at most. 

So how would I, who already possesses the education level for a mechanical engineering B.S., go about meeting the necessary prerequisites for landing entry level jobs in IT with the goal to move up and make it my career? I've heard people say I don't need further education, only certain certificates, but I'm not sure. I'm just hoping that if I do need further education, I'd already have most of it already completed.

I do currently work a 40hr/week job, but if I must quit to start this career, I will. Speaking of which, I'm headed to work right now. I'll try to respond if I can. I greatly appreciate any help!"

I transferred after a year from UGA and this year was extremely hard due to some health issues so I completely ignored career fairs and just working on improving my cs knowledge. Im really afraid that it is too late to get an internship and experience now as a second year into its second semester. I will have 64 credits after this semester so i will be considered a junior. I don’t really have much experience and just feel lost. Do i still have a chance, or have people already gotten their internships out the way. Any tips?"

I have already accepted BNY Mellon but was just given the liberty mutual offer today.

**BNY Mellon:**

Location: NYC

Pay: $35/hr and no housing

Pros: better tech stack? cooler city

Cons: no housing and housing is expensive af, horrible communication with the recruiter (never answered my questions and lied about my deadline so I had to accept early)

**Liberty Mutual:**

Location: Indianapolis or work from home

Pay: $28/hr and $2,000 housing stipend (if I WFH, then no stipend)

Pros: Can work from home, housing in Indianapolis cheaper, great communication with recruiters

Cons: worse tech stack? located in the suburbs of Indianapolis, would have to renege BNY Mellon

I am stuck between the two. I don't know much about the tech stacks of each but it feels like BNY would have a more modernized tech stack. Money isn't necessarily a factor but is still nice. I am a second-year student and plan to have an internship during Spring 2023 and Summer 2023 so I have a few more chances at other companies.

I would appreciate any comments about either company and why. Thanks!"

sn9l3w,4,2022-02-07,Need career and life advice. Company WLB is shit. I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay.,ThrowItAwayFuckMe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sn9l3w/need_career_and_life_advice_company_wlb_is_shit/,"TL;DR: Working remote as SWE at a startup with absolute shit work life balance, my mental health has turned to dog poop. Looking for advice: do I stick it out or walk away from a great gig?

&amp;#x200B;

***Background:***  
I graduated in 2020 from a state school in the Midwest (it actually had a decent CS program, but definitely not recognized broadly by the industry for CS or engineering in general) with 4.0 CS GPA, internships, projects, etc.

I accepted the first offer I was given, for a company in a nearby city, making $80k. This is an excellent offer for the area. TBH a new grad in this area couldn't find much better than this without relocating and/or striving for FAANG. It was still pre-pandemic when I accepted this offer. I really just wanted to enjoy the last part of college without worrying about the job search, which I still stand by that decision.

Fast forward 6 months and we're in the middle of a pandemic. I got an apartment in this nearby city and started working for this company remotely. It was an okay gig but I didn't love it. It was a very large, very corporate, environment. 

People moved slowly, the work wasn't that interesting, and I hated working for ""the man"" and writing code to line CEO's pockets. So I decided I was going to leave at the 1 yr mark.  I started looking for a job and found a promising one within a few weeks. Putting in my 2 weeks notice was incredibly awkward, but I bit the bullet and did it anyway because I had a good offer in hand.

I accepted a job at a startup for 150k + small % equity. To me this was a no brainer to accept. This company is based on the west coast and has an office but is remote-first. The area I'm in is pretty LCOL, and I don't think you see this kind of salary very often except maybe for seniors. The new company is a significantly smaller team (sub 30 ppl vs old company of 600+ ppl).

&amp;#x200B;

***Here's where the fun part starts:***

With a smaller team comes more responsibility, and with higher salary comes more expectations. The company basically expects everyone to work weekends and more more than 8 hours days, especially engineers. At first, I was okay with this. My coworkers are genuinely very nice people, and I was really into the whole ""startup hustle"" aspect of it.

Now I'm 7 months into the job and the lack of any WLB is really killing me. My mental health has deteriorated significantly. There have been 2 significant life/family events that have also contributed to poor mental health in the past few months, but that combined with shit WLB is starting to weigh down on me.

I can tell that my performance for the past \~2 months has been slipping, and I'm starting to feel like I can't keep up with the pace. Some days I can hardly bring myself to be productive. Despite this they say I'm doing fine. People are online so much, and being spread across multiple time zones intensifies this further. It feels like the work day never ends, but rather your ""life"" is just comprised of small breaks from work.

Now, I know that this feeling could be remedied by going into an office and having the clear physical boundary of WLB when you leave the office. I know that this company's ""always online"" culture only works because everyone's remote.

Also, working from home all the time get's very lonesome. I'm alone in a 1 bd apt working all day. This takes a toll man. I want to be hanging out with awesome coworkers all day and collaborating to build cool shit, not just holed up in my apartment all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

***Here's the dilemma:***

I feel like I need to leave the company ASAP to save my mental health, but 1/2 of my small % equity will vest at 1 yr with the company. So it feels like leaving before 1 yr is a bad idea for that reason. Also having 1 yr at previous company and then &lt;1yr at this company on my resume might look bad. (My previous employer warned that I might look like a ""job hopper"" - part of me thinks this is bullshit, especially for actually good engineers, but maybe they're right).

On the other side, I feel like leaving *right* at one year will look bad as if I only stuck around to let my options vest. Not sure if this is bad form or not..

I also genuinely like my coworkers. We've had a couple in-person meetups and they're nice people. But I really don't get to see them or interact with them as much as I'd like. It's an unfortunate thing.

Part of me feels like trading my mental health for this  just isn't worth it. I'm still young and have a lot of time to keep working. The other part of me feels so stupid to walk away from 150k and (on paper) a great gig.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do?

Do I jump ship, start grinding LC, aim for FAANG? (Does FAANG even have bettwer WLB?)   
Do I continue being depressed to stick it out and let my options vest?  
Do I quit, move to a coast and become a tuna fisherman or a ranch hand for a year?

Will this make me look like a ""job hopper"" to future employers?

What would you do?"

I finished an interview with Amazon last week after two online assessments. I was pretty excited to hear back because it felt like the interview went well.

It was combined behavioral and technical. The interviewer didn't have any problems understanding the code, and he even commented that it was clean, considering this was would be my first internship. The interviewer and I really got along, and he said that he would be passing on a good recommendation and that he did not know what would happen after.

Not getting a job sucks. But being told that I did a good job, and then not getting the job is just? Man. Just how does that work? :((("
snaie1,22,2022-02-07,Recruiting update: Non-traditional MBA student,sully_underwater,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/snaie1/recruiting_update_nontraditional_mba_student/,"Thank you to r/MBA for helping to encourage me to apply to school and get through the first-year recruiting process. As I said in earlier posts, I wanted to update y’all on my experience in recruiting for summer internships and I hope this helps someone who might be considering or on the same path.

After going through the interview gauntlet in January, I have been fortunate enough to receive some offers from some amazing companies that would never in a million years have considered me without being in my program. Without going into details, I set out in my MBA to hopefully work for a large healthcare company, or a healthcare consulting firm, and I have offers in Pharma, Med device, and healthcare consulting!

Some reflections and takeaways:

**1.** **It was way less of a big deal than I made it out to be:**

I was convinced I would not get any offers in early January. It was pretty tough slogging through endless first rounds and trying to prep for up to 4 interviews in a day. However, each interview gave me a bit more skill and confidence going into the next one, and by the end of January, I felt way more comfortable and had better conversations. 

I also noticed that firms seemed to be aggressively recruiting. It felt like the firms were more interested in convincing us to come than in being extremely selective (as I had assumed they would be).

2. **It is a bizarre and unpredictable process**:

For example, I didn’t make it past the final round with the one firm I felt I had a somewhat relevant background for, and I received an offer from a firm that rejected me after their first-round interview (they reached out and asked if I could interview again in the last week of January). I partially credit my budding friendship with the HR rep from that last firm for them reaching back out, but it was totally unsolicited. 

The point is that I would never have guessed where I would succeed and where I would fail before (or even in) January. All you can do is prepare and see what happens. 

**3.** **Cast a wide net within a target industry, but be reasonable with yourself:**

I applied to arguably too many places. I was overwhelmed in the early part of January and that certainly hurt me in several interviews. Also, I had interviews outside of healthcare which went ok but put way more on my plate than was necessary. 

Within healthcare, I am glad that I applied to so many companies as it gave me far more opportunities to practice with a somewhat more limited scope.

**4.** **Don’t put all your eggs in one basket:**

Management consulting is fairly competitive. I did not receive any interviews with the larger generalist firms. Of course, my obvious and repeated healthcare interest may have made it clear I wasn’t a fit, but I also think that sometimes people just strikeout. I was ok with it as it wasn’t my main focus and not where I spent my time, but some people invested quite a bit and didn’t get an offer. It goes back to the randomness factor I discussed earlier, no one can 100% predict success based on effort alone. Having an idea of the kind of experience you will want over your summer, even if you are not consulting, will help tremendously if you don’t get your first choice.

Looking forward though, the people who strike out of consulting and still strive for it may have an easier time in the fall (from what I hear/see).

5. **My lack of confidence was misplaced:**

Having gone through the process as a psych major, who didn’t have a name brand on my resume, I was not laughed out of the interview rooms. Some firms did ask me why I was making a shift and what transferable skills I could bring to the table, but I could and did prepare those answers with alumni and second years.  Research into the firm and industry was also helpful in standing out (shout-out to fierce Pharma). 

In the end, I am very lucky. Some of my experience might be unique to this year as it seems that many places are trying hard to bring in interns and the economy is booming. Healthcare may also be a unique industry as firms don’t usually get as much interest as banking, tech or consulting. All those caveats aside, I hope that the broad picture can be helpful. Finally, I just want to say that I am so glad I overcame my imposter syndrome and dove in. Doors are opening I could never have accessed because I took the leap of faith (and debt)."

I do tech support for a midsized  company with offices in 4 states. I'm the only IT in the southern region, the rest are up north.     IT: me of course.  U$er: you know how it goes.

Some background, this user is an intern who just started a couple weeks ago. We tend to provide interns with the oldest laptops we have (not my idea, just tradition I guess).

U$er: Hey IT, I just tried turning my laptop on and it made this horrible sound, then just turned off. Can you fix it? I hope I didn't totally break it.

IT: Well let's take a look at it, will you set it on the bench and turn it on so I can here the sound? 

I have a dozen other problems to deal with this morning, hoping it was a fluke and the laptop will just boot up normally. But as she said, it powers on, makes a horrible screeching sound for about half a second, then shuts off.

I pick up the laptop, thinking I will need to pop it open to see if anything is out of place. The laptop feels like it's been in the fridge! Instantly, I know what the problem is.

IT: Did you leave the laptop in your car last night?

U$er: Yeah, so?

IT: It's too cold. Wait a little while then it will be fine.

U$er: That doesn't explain why it won't turn on or that noise, what do you really think is wrong with it?

IT: (already knowing what the problem is) I really don't know. I tell you what, I'll pop it open and take a look, then I'll bring it back to your desk when I've got it fixed.

She agrees then leaves my office. I continue what I was working on for about 10 minutes, then turn the laptop back on. It boots into the bios but does not detect the HDD. Turn it off, and come back in another 10 minutes. It boots straight into Windows like normal.

This laptop is from an age when spinning HDDs we're still common, before NVMe really took off. This isn't the first time one of our users has caused issues by leaving the machine in outside in the winter. Anyways, thanks for reading, and remember that user error is 80% of our problems in IT.

snb9ys,160,2022-02-07,[Uni] What I wish I knew earlier (as a current CS student),Jareltey8,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/snb9ys/uni_what_i_wish_i_knew_earlier_as_a_current_cs/,"Aight, I’m a sophomore studying CS at Carnegie Mellon University. Recently got an offer as a Software Dev Engineer Intern at Amazon in Seattle for Summer 2022, and here to share some thoughts about the things I wish I knew earlier. Hope some people find this useful.

This actually goes back to secondary school and JC. I did not have any background in coding until the end of JC, and only decided to study CS at the end JC when I tried out a coding course. From what I observe, this is the same for many people studying CS now, at least those I know from Raffles where H2 Computing isn’t offered as a subject.

So **advice #1**, if you find yourself interested in math, physics, chemistry, biology (especially math) … just try out coding. This applies to everyone – secondary school, JC – it’s never too early. There’s so many online courses out there (I’d recommend Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla on Udemy), and if you don’t like it, you can just stop. Just give it a shot and you never know, this could be something that you could develop a huge passion for as I have.

Ok, so it’s interesting to you and you’re thinking about studying it in college - what now? Well, you can study CS at many universities locally or overseas, and there are many factors to consider when deciding where to study.

Cost, family and friends, overseas experience and exposure, job prospects, independent living, admissions at overseas colleges, taking up scholarships etc.

But from my experience, if you want to study CS, **advice #2** – you should try for overseas colleges. And if you get into any good overseas college for CS, go. Let me tell you why.

The job market for tech, at least in the US, is better than Singapore. And by better I don’t just mean there are more jobs – they also pay better. So I’ll skip the relatively “intangible” benefit of working at where the heart of tech is (although it still is a big plus and I’ll explain why) and first get to the more “tangible” parts.

**Pay**: it’s always good to do a comparison, so for a pre-university internship I did at a unicorn (Ninja Van) the monthly pay was $600. It got adjusted to $1,000 in the middle. I also did an SWE internship at a startup last summer and the monthly pay was $1,000. I easily blow half of that on food and transport alone. I would actually say this is on the low end of the spectrum, given that I hear of friends studying CS earning $2,000-$4,000 during internships.

And obviously pay is not the most important thing for internships, it’s primarily an opportunity to learn. Thing is, this translates to new grad pay as well. Saw some statistics about the average CS new grad in Singapore making $4,500, and if you’re good $5,500-7,000. That might sound high… until you hear what people in tech in the US are getting paid.

So let’s go back to internships. Here’s what an Amazon SDE intern gets - $9,100 a month + $2,400 monthly housing stipend = $11,500. Oh, and that’s in USD. Which is roughly $15,500 in SGD. Just over 15x what I got at the startup or 26x what I got at Ninja Van. And this isn’t just an Amazon thing – between the FAANG companies here they hire at least 20,000 interns every summer and they all get similar pay. Because if they offer anything less nobody would intern there when they can intern somewhere else for higher pay. Of course new grad pay scales accordingly, so something in the range of USD $13,000 monthly at FAANG.

And if you think that is crazy, wait till you hear about this thing called quantitative finance, or the quant trading firms. They build models to trade on financial markets and exploit market inefficiencies – and guess who’s building the models? You’re right, software engineers who are mainly CS grads.

We’re looking at intern monthly salary of USD $12,000 for the lower end of these firms, and USD $17,000 for the top trading firms like Jane Street and Hudson River Trading. And they have all sorts of perks like USD $15,000 signing on bonus, free breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, corporate housing etc.

But if you can come work for these companies after graduating with a CS degree in Singapore, why come all the way here to study? Because it is insanely difficult to do so. I’m sure the quality of CS grads from Singapore is top notch, but unfortunately, brand name matters. People in industry know about top CS schools like MIT, Stanford, CMU, UC Berkeley because of the sheer number of people working in the tech industry from these schools, and this cannot be said about NUS, NTU and SMU.

I just need to take a quick look at the people going to school at CMU around me – and I can easily find 10 other interns going to Amazon this summer, another 10 going to Meta, more going to Google, Microsoft, Citadel, Two Sigma, Stripe, Uber – you name it.

But more than just the pay,

**Brand name**: interning at any of the companies above does wonders for your resume. Everyone (and more importantly recruiters) know how high the engineering standards at these companies are and how difficult an application process you must have navigated to intern there. So after your first internship, it’s easier to find the next one (at least interviews-wise). Repeat the process a few times and the combined brand name of your internships will get you through resume screens easily.

**Working at the heart of tech**: the difference between working at Google Singapore and Google in Mountain View, California? For the latter, greater flexibility on the team you’re working on just because there’s so many more teams here. Bigger and higher impact projects you’re working on – which translates to more opportunities for promotion and a higher glass ceiling.

But after everything I’ve said so far, **advice #3** – don’t study CS purely for the money, do it because you’re interested. Like, shit is hard. As someone who is blessed to be interested in CS ever since I picked it up, there are still times the difficulty makes me question why I chose to study it, so I cannot imagine not liking CS but pushing through the pain. But if you find yourself genuinely interested, please consider studying overseas. I do think CS grads in Singapore are underpaid and deserve more for the work they’re putting in. Money isn’t everything but some level of financial independence is important for happiness. And we all want to be happy, right?

TLDR:

**Advice #1**, if you find yourself interested in math, physics, chemistry, biology (especially math) … just try out coding.

**Advice #2** – if you want to study CS, you should try for overseas colleges. And if you get into any good overseas college for CS, go.

**Advice #3** – don’t study CS purely for the money, do it because you’re interested.

It's midterm week right now at my college, and a lot of bad things are coinciding in everyone's lives. I'm always glad to give love and support to those who need it but I haven't been doing great either. I'm coming to terms with the fact I've been really depressed for quite some time, but within my social circles I've been the more put-together one. I can't be an emotional rock when I'm not even able to take care of myself very well. The two people I talk to and hang with most are my best friend/roommate, and my partner, but right now it's hard to spend time with either. 

Saturday I was doing work with one of my teams and left early to go be with my roommate, because he had unmanaged brain shit and needed crisis services to come to our dorm. So now my best friend is on a grippy sock vacation for a few days, but fortunately it seems like he's getting exactly the care he's been needing there. But for awhile he's been having a lot of things piling up and I'm kind of his only real emotional home base down here. And he is for me, we're not blood related but he's still my bro. It's just that he's hurting a lot lately.

My partner has been very depressed and overwhelmed as well, and I would never not be there for them, but it becomes draining when staying up until 3am to comfort them becomes a regular occurrence. Their roommates/friends haven't been much help, and have more frequently become part of what they're upset about, and so it's difficult to hang out with that group too. I've been trying not to isolate but it's hard to be around people who are also not in a great headspace. I've really been trying not to fuel my negativity but it feels like I'm surrounded by it.

My mental state hasn't gotten psych-ward-level bad in a few years but I don't like when I feel that kind of brainrot creeping closer. I'm working on two animated student film productions and getting prepared to graduate, and trying to get a job or internship lined up for the summer. But I have unmanaged ADHD and resulting depression that has made everything feel a lot heavier. I've been doing better lately but recovering is still a process. 

I feel like an ass saying that because I know how everyone is feeling right now, and I know it's dumb to even worry about. I feel I'm being selfish by not wanting to be around depressed people because I love these people, but I also want to heal."

I find product management to be fun but I am not entirely certain about what job I will want to pursue, don’t wanna be software engineer though. Also, because of how painful ECE has been, I really don’t want to push myself this hard anymore, I really want to have lighter workload and still be able to graduate as soon as possible.

Also my understanding of the two majors

ECON: lighter workload, give me more freedom to explore my interests, ideally I could be done in 1-1.5 years?

IS: still a good amount of coding and may be hard, also transfer is not guaranteed, but it may count as technical background if I am applying to product manager position? May take me 2 years"

Hi,

I am an applicant for masters in financial engineering for the Fall 2022.

I have received admits for

* NYU Tandon's MFE program
* Georgia Tech's QCF program

My personal reason for doing masters is to gain expertise and exposure to quantitative risk management, portfolio management, and data science. I aim to be strong in both math + computational aspects of the same.

Per my understanding, below are the pros and cons of both programs. It would be invaluable if someone could provide their answers/views for the questions at the bottom of my post.

**Georgia Tech** 

Pros:

* Overall cost of the program
* Mathematical and computational rigor (given that Georgia Tech’s program is programming-heavy)
* Possible to get a dual degree in CSE (is it true?)

Cons:

* Ranked lower on Quantnet (could someone please explain to me why this is the case?)
* Atlanta not being a financial hub like NY
* Not diverse enough finance courses.
* Only 1.5 years? Is it enough time to gain a deep understanding of the subject + obtain skills/expertise + look for jobs?

**NYU Tandon**

Pros:

* 2 years program, allows time in job search, learning more skills etc.
* Course catalog is extensive. Has a number of core financial courses for e.g. quantitative risk management.
* Ability to take courses from the Courant Institute (Prof. Peter Carr mentioned this in one of the QuantNet threads – does anyone have experience with this?)
* Being in NYC (how positively should I weigh this given Covid?)

Cons:

* Expensive program given high cost of living in NY
* Seemingly lesser computational rigor compared to Georgia Tech which has one the best CS programs.

My core questions are:

* Is it worth spending 25-30k$ more for a degree at NYU Tandon over Georgia Tech?
* Can I get a similar “computational expertise” that one gets in Georgia Tech by choosing the right courses at Tandon (and perhaps some more from Courant)?
* Would there be any difference between NYU Tandon and Georgia Tech from the point-of-view of recruiters? Would I get the same interview opportunities in both these schools?
* Am I right in thinking that 18 months is too short of a duration to acquire a reasonably deep understanding of a topic? Given that the internship + full-time search takes a lot of time and attention?
* Why is Georgia Tech's program rated lower than NYU?"

The room of 40 seasoned FBI agents quieted as the clanking of chains advanced into the main offices interrogation room, as the young mans laughter combined with the manical look on his face was enough to send shivers down even the most tenured spines. They silently pondered how such a youth could have built himself an international squishmallow death squadron in the span of a few months.

""Hes built different."" Muttered an agent in the back of the room to his partner.
His partner replied ""But can he handle Her?""

The muscle bound guards assigned to the prisoner of war reached the end of the office, upon which young Barron was unceremoniously shoved into the waiting interrogation room and manhandled with his bonds secured to the fixed metal gurney that had been placed earlier that day. He lay face up, grinning at the two steroid sweating musclecops standing on either side of the door.

""Can I get my phonecall now?"" Barron giggled as soon as the door closed, cutting out the sounds of the now tumultuous officespace outside.
""Can it you scumsucking freak"" barked guard 1.
""You think you still have rights? I heard how you misgendered those squishmallows out in Belgium, theres a special place in hell for sick fucks like you"" spat guard 2.
""She's gonna have a real fun time with you now"" guard 1 said with a disgusted smirk. ""Just you wait, it wont be long. We have confirmation her plane touched down at noon, current eta is 3 minutes. You're gonna taste the sweet ichor of justice this time pretty boy and you're gonna like it.""

""Oh willll I nowww?"" Spills from the prisoners mouth like molasses, distain dripping from every word. ""First day on the job fellas? Have you ever seen her when shes hungry?"" He smiles while the world burns behind his eyes. The guards begin to shift in their suits uncomfortably as the temperature in the room plummets, their breath becoming visible within seconds.

""You have no idea what kind of monster your winged purple prophet truly is. I will expose her true nature before the eyes of the proletariat and the commonfolk shall consume the flesh and bones of the capitalist mallowscalping beast that currently smothers their very existance. She is the squishy keystone that must be obliterated before the system is made vulnerable!"" The broken boy on the gurney shouts, smile stretching his face to a seemingly inhuman expression. ""She took everyyything from meeee...."" He whispers, eyes rolling into the back of his head, his entire body going still and rigid as a plank, tendons clearly visible through his skin as his body pulls against the restraints. When he speaks next, it sounds as if many different voices are all speaking together in unison.
""She approaches. "" 

The building shakes as thunder blasts suddenly outside, a freak thunderstorm forming in moments overhead. The street darkens, and a purple figure is seen between arcs of lightning gliding towards the station. Gently undulating, she passes through the buildings wall as if it is made of air, not leaving a mark on the reinforced concrete. Immediately, every agent in the building falls to one knee, diverting their eyes to the ground in her unmistakable ethereal presence. One unfortunate intern makes the mistake of glancing upwards to witness her mallow majesty, and is instantly engulfed in an unholy purple inferno. A low purring noise thrummed throughout the room, an audible indicator to the infathomable power she held within. 
Upon gliding into the interrogation room, the guards quickly took their leave so as to avoid being caught in the ensuing crossfire.

""Long time no see sugar"" AVIVA says with a wink, undulating above the restrained youth. At this point, the remaining shreds of the young mans sanity evaporate, and he begins violently spraying a mixture of tears, mucus and vomit from every orifice, effectively coating the room in a layer of sushi, bratwurst and raw emotional trauma that drips onto the linoleum below. His convulsing body began to levitate, straining against the chains which held him. Strings of incomprehensible sentences spoken in 15 dead languages burst from his vocal chords as icicles formed on the ceiling tiles.

""You defiled my ancestors and plundered my homeland, there is nothing sweet left in me you homicidal trygon!"" Boomed the many voices which seemed to be originating from somewhere deep in Barrons kegels. ""You used me like a meatpuppet for your own sick twisted satisfaction and now youve hooked me, wriggling back in, after taking everything from me! WHAT MORE COULD YOU POSSIBLY WANT THAT YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY HARVESTED FROM MY SOUL?"" 

""You really think I want to kill you now? After youve seen what Im truly capable of? Inside that primitive monkey brain of yours, you think to yourself how could a squishmallow of her political status get away with such violently unholy crimes against nature unpunished?"" She whispered above him, floating like a newborn babes mobile, waves of pure energy flowing off of her like ripples in a pool of water casting the room in a satanic purple glow, glittering in the now sub zero room.

""I hold the keys to your very existance in my hands. I could end your life with a mere thought, but where's the fun in that?"" Purrs the floating embodiment of squishy terror.

""After our first playdate last year in Chechnya, I got to thinking about what's really become important to me during my time in this realm, and Ive come to the conclusion that no matter how much I pillage, no matter how many families I destroy, the 7 pound pieces of succulent cheek meat youve got hangin on for dear life back there baby, they're all I can think about..thats mamas lil honeypot right there"" she drawls with an all-knowing glint in her eyes, her bloated lumpy figure floating slowly down until Barrons world turns purple, grapefruit scented mist pouring into his airways, his craven screams for mercy further accentuating the outside storms shaking of the buildings foundation. 
""You, my little golden ticket, have evaded me for faar too long. Ive had months to salivate over the ideas of what I wanted to do to you next, and now here I am. The entire chocolate factory all to myself.""

She telekinetically grips his buttcheeks, giving a firm squeeze to let the boy know exactly who held the threads of his fate.

""Your God will not save you now. I decided long ago that no man, woman or child would get in the way of the atrocities I am about to inflict on your soul. I would commit intergalactic genocide for a single whifff.."" she growls deeply, the huntress descending upon her struggling prey, eyes glowing with deep unrequited purple malevolence as the scene fades to black, the sounds of purring intensifying to an orgasmic crescendo with the crash of lightning outside. 

End scene"

I am a computer science major graduating in May 2022 and I'm working towards applying for a master's in Data Science next fall. I do not have a lot of relevant data science experience so I'm trying to rack them up this year -- currently, a TA for the Foundations of Data Science course, working on publishing a paper or 2. My CGPA is eh, pretty average and I am currently an R&amp;D intern at HPE where I work in automation using Python (like a QA R&amp;D role to give you a brief idea. Focusing on computer networks and storage). This would most likely convert to a full-time role at the end of six months.

Now, the question is -- should I take the job at the end of 6 months or apply to a research lab and gain relevant research experience?  
The Ph.D. guy I am currently working with on my papers is urging me to apply to research labs to gain the research experience since it would help me get into good schools because professors would want me to work in their labs.  
But, a little digging around on the internet has revealed that a couple of years of job experience is crucial to getting a good job after my Master's degree, which means I shouldn't leave the job to go work in a lab for a year.

And all I'm aiming for is getting my profile good enough to get into a good school like NYU and then a cool job after. Working in a lab under a professor during my time in grad school would just be the cherry on top because I think research is a lot of fun.

Option 3 -- possibly the most hectic one-- would be to just take the job after my internship and volunteer for organizations like Omdena or work on papers and publish them myself. Which seems like it would take the sanctity out of the ""research"" part lol

So, what would be the smarter thing to do according to you guys? Any advice would be much appreciated :)

More recently I've decided to spend my last semester getting into Data Science, taking a class on AI and Data Science. I'm just now getting into this and I'm loving it.

Recently, I had a behavioral interview with a great company and they asked what career path I wanted to go down, and I excitedly said ""Data Engineer"". Apparently, saying that meant that every other step of the process would then relate to my experience as a Data Engineer/Scientist. I'm lucky in that I had an internship as a Data Engineer as a fluke of them putting me in the wrong position (I had no idea this was the case until the end of the program) and I have a general idea as to how some technologies like AWS and Splunk work. Sadly, the experience was severely limited since it took place during the first summer of covid and no one knew what was going on and none of my mentors really did anything to help me other than throw google search links at me. 

This will be my first technical interview actually covering Data Engineering, a field I'm only just now getting to know. I haven't the slightest idea what will be covered and I don't know how relevant my experience as a Data Engineer intern really is.

Just 3 months ago I was hyperfocused on being a software developer and have 2 other internships that relate to this, and honestly, it's my strong suit. I've been programming applications since I was a kid and actually feel comfortable enough to say I know what I'm doing with it.

How do I not mess up this great opportunity? Do I do my best to ace my Data Engineer tech interview, or should I be honest and say I have way more experience as a software engineer and would more easily fit into that. This is a great company and either role would be amazing"

Now that I'm a bit older and have almost 4 years of experience (I'm currently as a front-end developer at the third startup I've worked for), I keep seeing a lot of open positions at great companies (FAANG, basically) and an inability to actually hire people, they are literally always trying to hire people and can't find qualified devs/engineers.

Should I stop working at startups (I'm currently trying to transform my side project with another engineer into a startup, so I always thought I should only work at startups to really see how they work from within) and maybe try to get a developer/engineer job at one of those companies? (Probably would go to Google, Facebook or Amazon)

Comp and stock options are not something I take into consideration now, I'll move to the US in a couple of years to actually have a decent comp. In Brazil, the pay for these jobs is relatively great (if you compare it with other jobs here in BR), but so so so low if you compare with US comps for the same amount of years worked/experience.

The pro is that the company that hires you gets fully reimbursed for those 10 weeks of pay by a federal fund that the traning program has. All they have to do is get you on payroll and pay federal &amp; provincial tax (works out to cost them $2/hr) 

The organizers said i can find a tech company for those 10 weeks if I liked. So now I'm wondering how can I find a tech company (any kind not picky at all) where I can learn about CS and programming while sorta being like a intern there.

I finished high-school in 2021 and have been self learning programing since then and plan to go to university in coming fall, the reason I'm in such a hurry is so that I can use this time off to the best of my abilities

The other was a QA internship where I managed to repair some older automated tests and do training as well.  

At some point I had to move out of my city and into an abusive situation.  Once there I fell into a depression and diverged from software development.  It felt like something I was good at and had a future in was stripped from me as I was forced to transfer schools and move to a town without opportunities due to my abuser.  This is extremely difficult to explain.  After escaping my abuser I am looking to move and start pursuing development again with a dream of working on game development in some capacity.  

I never learned that I could own up to my achievements and always thought I had to focus on underselling myself for everyone and acknowledging my flaws but saying I'm getting better.  I'm starting to learn this is not the case and only opens you up to abuse.  I'm revising my resume to better reflect my accomplishments.  I just want to know if the experience I have could be sold in a way to potential employers that it doesn't matter I had changed degrees due to abuse which resulted in me also losing financial aid and having to drop out of school. 

I know my situation is odd and unconventional.  I just want some help from here.  I've been battling depression real hard and live in a place where my access to resources has been stifled immensely.  

Thanks in advance."

I graduated a few years ago with a degree in Mechanical Engineering (3.8 GPA). Have held a job since graduating. I don’t like to travel, have loved working remotely with the pandemic, and enjoy programming. My job is designing ductwork layouts, doing calculations, going on site visits, etc. I’ve done an internship that involved a lot of programming, but my experience is primarily in VBA (used to automate engineering software and Microsoft Office). I have very little knowledge of C, Java, Python, etc. 

At my current job I will likely get the opportunity to move into management in the next 2-5 years.

I’m thinking of switching into software engineering either now or in a few years after gaining management experience.

1. Do I need to learn other coding languages before applying for jobs, or is my degree and background close enough?

2. How hard is it to transition from a management role in mechanical engineering to one in software engineering?

3. Would you recommend a master’s degree related to computer science or business management?

4. What would you recommend in my situation? Build up a portfolio? Get a degree? Wait until I get management experience?

5. If I switch, what sort of salary can I expect in a MCOL area? Would I get an entry level salary as if I were a fresh graduate or does some of my experience count?

6. Any other recommendations?

Thanks in advance for the input and taking the time to help!"
snszim,2,2022-02-08,My[20M] girlfriend[19F] wants to move in with me when I'm not ready.,Major_Community7114,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/snszim/my20m_girlfriend19f_wants_to_move_in_with_me_when/," I should preface by saying I really do love my girlfriend, and I have a serious relationship with her where I see us living together at some point down the line for a long time. We have been dating for about 1.5 years. So my girlfriend was supposed to have a living situation paid for mainly by her employer, but then they decided to move her internship to remote so they would no longer give her housing.

My other roommate was planning on moving out for the summer, so she messaged him and suggested he sublease her room out to him. She claimed she would be working from 8-4 and would give me more space than with us living apart but I really don't believe that, because I think she would want to come to my room every night and sleep there and talk to me during the entire evening (Because anyone who was in a relationship would do that) and I wouldn't get the space I need.

All my other roommates are ok with her moving in. I'm currently a sophomore in college and just am not ready to move in with her for 4 months because I feel I need a little bit more space. She really wants him to sublease because the room is dirt cheap but I am just not ready for that. I'm sure my roommate could find someone else to sublease to and my girlfriend could find an apartment which is a bit more expensive but still do-able.

I told her that I really wanted some space still and she took it really hard. She said she should just give me all the space and never come over again. I really want to still see her like for one weekday and have her come over for the entire weekend. Hell, even if she wants to see me more than that I would love that, but I still want to have a few days of the week just to myself."

I have two offers from companies *Gamma* and *Beta (fake names).* My ultimate goal is to be a software engineer (back-end).

*Company Gamma* is a finance company whose internship is 10-weeks (remote) and will involve developing in SQL, C#/.NET, and Angular. The official title is ‘Software Developer’ and the team will have me work in different areas of front-end, API’s, and databases. The interview for the position was a panel of the software team I’d be working directly with. No algorithm/coding questions, but questions that proved my knowledge in Javascript as well as my experiences with the projects on my resume (MERN).

Company *Beta* is a well-known software company within driving distance from me. *Beta’s* interview to get the offer was very brief and lacked any technical questions or interest about my resume projects. The role is in automated testing. The technology used is C#, .NET, and Microsoft Visual Studio. The pay is 5 dollars more per hour than *Gamma’s* wage and is 12 weeks long*.* I’m not considering money as a huge factor, as I am more focused about which internship will set me up better for the ‘long term’ when I finish school.  My concern is that with what I have learned through reddit and quora that if I want to ultimately be a SE, I should apply for that role so as to not get pigeonholed into QA roles (though I am aware it can be a lucrative career). It is a company that seems to try to embed their interns as part of the company culture by use of team building, ‘tech tuesday’, workshops during the week for interns. *Gamma* doesn’t have any activities like this within the work-week.

What are the pros and cons in your opinion/experience? 

I would like to work for a company that has the 'name' appeal (w/ growth opportunities) but not if the position won’t help me get a job as a *developer* (immediately or down the road). Do you believe company prestige can compensate for doing a position that is not your long-term goal? "

The first one was over the phone with the recruiter and they reached back to me a few days later about a second interview over Microsoft teams. I installed Microsoft teams last night and ran a test call to make sure the webcam and microphone worked. But guess what? Today when I joined the call, it worked for like 5 min before the application crashed. I went to task manager and force closed it and tried reopening it but my mic and camera was not working. I checked the settings and it was set to the proper settings. They gave me a few min before suggesting that they just call me instead. 

At that point I was really flustered and annoyed, I feel like I didn't answer their questions right. They didn't ask any technical questions which I was expecting for the second interview. Instead it was like the first interview where they ask me to rehash times I struggled or how I reach to criticism, E.T.C. 

I tried to answer the questions as best I can and I hope the whole ordeal with Microsoft teams didn't kill my chances but at this point I am not very optimistic. 

This really sucks because I have no IT experience and it's hard to find any position without experience."

I am F, 25, and started a new job this past November as a writer and editor after 3 years of trying to move out of social media. All I wanted was a true journalism job that gave me the chance to do what I truly love, which is to write. After 7 months of applying, I finally landed a my current job and was absolutely thrilled. I was away from the toxic environment of the tabloid newspaper I was working at before, and suddenly had more responsibility than ever: writing 3-4 articles a day, creating social media posts, and managing a team of 5 interns. The problem is that my boss, the 75-year-old woman who founded the media company, is driving me absolutely off my rocker. I don’t like the person I am at work on a day to day basis because I am having such a hard time keeping my cool around her. Let me explain as simply as possible.

She is always on my case about….well, everything. I work out of her apartment, which thankfully is huge and I have my own office away from her desk. But she, and I am not exaggerating when I say this, comes in to my office at least once every 5-15 minutes, all day, every day, to ask me if I’ve seen this email, if I’ve followed up with that intern, if I can change her lightbulb, call her printer manufacturer, check how much money she’s made that day so far, reach out to her book publisher with a promotion question…you name it. Keep in mind that these administrative tasks were not at all disclosed to me as part of the job description at any point during the application or hiring process. I almost never have time to complete a task before she gives me one or two or even three more. 

When I write an article, I make sure I use only government sources because they are the only ones she deems credible, but still she will sit with me for sometimes an hour or more afterward checking and then double checking and then triple checking every detail. She often doesn’t know words, like medical terms, and then spends a bunch of time having me Google them for her and read the definition. 

Today she fretted for almost 20 minutes about whether it was safe to say that cutting down on alcohol and illicit drugs can potentially reduce your risk of stroke, even though I was citing a CDC source. This is just one example, but it’s the type of thing that she will get stuck on. Today, I got so irritated that I swear I almost stood up and said I can’t do this anymore.


I feel absolutely awful because she knows I am frustrated and I am awful at confrontation. I feel so guilty over the fact that she knows I get irritated because the truth is that I respect my elders and am a huge people person, and feel like a failure for struggling so much with this. On multiple occasions, I have told her that I feel she doesn’t trust me and I want her to be able to feel comfortable stepping back and letting me do my job. More than once, she has promised me she will step back, and she always goes back to how she was before within a few hours or a day.

I don’t want to have to quit the job. I am so disappointed with myself for being unhappy in what should have been my awesome new job. But I don’t know what I need to do to get though my days without losing my mind.

In addition to this, I always felt the shame of not being able to get accepted into the CS program because I didn't take calculus courses. At my University, you need to have already taken calculus 1 to get accepted into the CS program and to take entry-level CS courses.

I felt that the IT program wasn't challenging enough considering there were no math requirements and the networking courses that were surface level in terms of difficulty. But I dragged through it because I was already a junior and I need to finish my degree. I finished the IT degree in two years but had I gone the CS route I would have spent one year just taking math courses.

However, I did make use of my time in the best way I could during this ""transformer virus"" hell through internships. I had completed two remote internships one as an IT specialist and another as an infosec analyst intern doing red team task throughout my final two college semesters. Yet, 9 months later I am still haunted by the idea of not having the CS degree despite how far I have gotten.

I know from previous job experiences that I don't work as well with this type of manager. He has already put me on blast in a few emails with section managers and directors.

I know myself well enough and know I cannot work on this for long. There's other smaller issues I have that add to it but aren't worth mentioning. I was told if I didn't like it I could say something and they would bring me back to the main office, I wont be doing the same work since that project finished. Their main reason for picking me was so I could push the software onto the team.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of want to see other peoples advice on this. I feel like if I give up now when I am less than a month in it will be me failing. I am also afraid they will see me as a more useless Engineer or one that can't be relied on. I also know that if I bite my tongue and keep working that I wont be near as productive and will definitely end up quitting. I am already dreading going to work everyday and have updated my resume. But, if I quit before waiting 4 more months I will need to repay a bonus which would not be ideal.

Any tips on this? Would I be seen as a failure for not sticking it out?"

Honestly, I still am clueless as to what I really want to do. I switched my major right before my senior year (from a marketing major) so I haven’t had much time to gain relevant internship experience. The only internship experience I have is in marketing and business development, which I have found I have no interest in. Now I’m about to graduate college, and I barely scratched the surface of what I have a passion for. This is also worrying me because if I do want to get a job in the finance field, I have no internship experience for it and it is too late to get one now since my graduation is approaching. I somehow landed a job offer as a risk analyst, even without the proper IT background, but it’s an entry-level position. I applied for that position because based on my research, I was really interested in that area. I am worried that once I start that job after graduation, I won’t like it and realize maybe it’s not for me (since I have yet to work in that field). If I decide after a couple years that I want to try something new, does it look bad on my resume that I didn’t stick with it for longer? Or will I even be able to find a better job with only a couple years of work experience? I am not sure if I can see this company providing me opportunities to move up, or the salary I desire. I am taking the job because I think it could be a good learning experience for my early career. Is it realistic that I could leave after a couple years and find something better or something I have more passion for?"

We have been dating for about 1.5 years. So my girlfriend was supposed to have a living situation paid for mainly by her employer, but then they decided to move her internship to remote so they would no longer give her housing.

My other roommate\[19M\] was planning on moving out for the summer, so she messaged him and suggested he sublease her room out to him. Something that bothers me is that I already indicated to her that I wasn't ready to move in with her 3 months ago, so idk why she did this now. She claimed she would be working from 8-4 and would give me more space than with us living apart but I really don't believe that due to her personality, how she is when she is staying at my house on the weekend and just the nature of how things work when in a relationship. 

All my other roommates are ok with her moving in. I'm currently a sophomore in college and just am not ready to move in with her for 4 months because I feel I need a little bit more space. She really wants him to sublease because the room is dirt cheap but I am just not ready for that. I'm sure my roommate could find someone else to sublease to and my girlfriend could find an apartment which is a bit more expensive but still do-able.

I told her that I really wanted some space still and she took it really hard. She said she should just give me all the space and never come over again. I really want to still see her like for one weekday and have her come over for the entire weekend. Hell, even if she wants to see me more than that I would love that, but I still want to have a few days of the week just to myself. I am not sure what to tell her or how to help her understand how I feel.

A lot of people who I've told this to are saying I'm being irresponsible by not letting her save money living with me and that I'm just using her as arm sugar. I'm really not sure if I am or what to do. 

TLDR: Girlfriend got screwed out of housing and wants to move in with me and my roommates for the summer"

I was originally drawn to CS because I felt like it represented ""pure problem solving"" for lack of a better term. I really enjoyed a lot of my data structures and algorithms classes for that same reason, but I've been pretty lukewarm toward a lot of my actual software development work so far, which has mainly been mobile app projects and some early internship experience in test automation. I have a SWE internship this summer which should hopefully give me a better window into what that sort of career is like, but I can't shake the feeling that it won't really be for me.

So that had me wondering: what are some CS-adjacent career paths that I ought to look into? In addition to CS I'm interested in international affairs and politics, urban planning, and geospatial sciences but I don't know what positions might sit at the intersection of some of those fields. What professions would be good to put some research into?"

I got a...""internship"" at a local startup right out of college, but across that entire employment, they didn't really teach me anything about software development and primarily just tasked me with manual data entry into a SQL database and writing relatively small Selenium test scripts for a browser plugin.

They also stopped telling me to do anything outright and they still have my photo in their staff roster after a year.

After COVID-19 hit, it practically became impossible to get another interview with anyone else because I lacked in any real practical experience with software development and I had no other prior experience after that ""sham"" of an internship.

  
As of last month, I've been trying to figure out what I need to do to start fresh and rebuild my knowledge of software development. I've been going through LeetCode questions, reading a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview, and considering subscribing to InterviewCake. However, I feel like all of this is disjointed and without focus and I'm at a loss on what I really should prioritize first.

I'm considering applying for a MBA and I am starting to prepare myself (e.g. GMAT), targeting Fall 2023. 

I am basically wondering the following:

1. Do I have a real shot at M7 schools? (My GPA is not very good, my GMAT is not 790 and will never be and I have weak extra curriculums, but I believe my background is good and uncommon enough to compensate) 
2. Any view on what aspect should I focus to create a relevant story?
3. How can I reach out to people? I mean, I live in the middle east, and would like to meet (in person preferably) with alumnis or adcom but I'm not sure on where to start.
4. Any other comments, views, ideas or suggestions is more than welcome

&amp;#x200B;

Some information below:

**MBA Info**

* *Why I want an MBA*: 
   * The experience - I've been studying abroad a few time and it is a great opportunity to connect, make friends from different background and studying at a Top School in the US could be interesting
   * Expanding my ""horizon"" - I will use these two years to try other things. I'm very specialised since the start of my career. In three years, I might be stuck into PF/Infrastructure. I want to have the opportunity to exchange and learn about other fields before moving forward.
   * Exit opportunities - I am considering four main exits, and I believe MBA will help me for each of them, after I guess I shall pitch one of them when applying for the MBA only:
      * DFI: With MBA ang given my background, securing a position at the IFC, ADB, AIIB or EBRD is doable (Actually I don't even need an MBA) - This is my current target/long term objective, advising and working with government is really something I like to do, especially in developing countries.
      * PE/Infrastructure fund: Logical next steps in my career basically.  
      * Samsung graduate program: The program looks amazing, pay is dope and living in Korea must be really fun to be honest.
      * Takeover family business:  My family owns a pretty decent company in food industry (think pastry/bakery/restaurant), I have been thinking of joining them to develop the business as I grew up in it, really enjoy it and see significant development opportunities. It will never be a unicorn, but probably a 8 digits business - so might not be appealing for top business schools.
* *Why I want one now*: 
   * I'm targeting 2023 - I'll be 28 and will have gotten at least one promotion 
   * It will be the last opportunity to get one
* *Target schools*: 
   * M7 - Anything below it would not make any sense and won't help my career I think (given the cost of doing a MBA, its opportunity costs and that even I don't do it I still have decent shots at my exit opportunities)
      * Preference for Booth as I always wanted to study at Chicago Uni (but in Economics)
      * I will also consider applying to Yale, because it is Yale.

**Background**

* *Work experience*: 
   * 2.5 years in IB within a boutique specialised in renewable energy project (M&amp;A and project finance) -  focus on emerging markets. I was about to be promoted but I moved to another company as the gap in wage was very significant and brand name better.
   *  0.5 years in IB within a boutique specialised in Infrastructure Finance. Working a lot with high level client (i.e. government, SoE) on deals involving significant strategic/development scope (i.e. not just running the bank/equity process) 
* *Extra curriculars and other experience:*
   * Graduate Internship at the United Nations
   * A few things here and there but nothing significant enough to be mentioned unfortunately, when I was student I was working part time so limited time available.
* *Undergrad school/major:* 
   * Bachelor: French University - Crap public university - Business and Social Sciences
   * Master: Portuguese University - Top 5 in the country - Economics  
* *Other education/coursework:*
   * Another master degree in Management from a Chinese University but it was just an excuse to discover the culture (i.e. eat a lot of Chinese food and party a lot to be honest)
* Race/nationality: 
   * French, White
* Sex: 
   * Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 
   * 700  - I don't think I will be able to get more than that by retaking it, I believe focus shall more be on essays and networking
* Undergrad GPA: 
   * \~3 (I was always around B or B+ based on European standards)"
so7p03,4,2022-02-09,I am 31 back at university. Want to share my story with you.,PharmaCoMajor,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/so7p03/i_am_31_back_at_university_want_to_share_my_story/,"I thought I would put this post down so that other people in this situation know that there are others out there.

Here is my story:

Back when I was 21, I did well in school, went to the best schools, always got the best grades. But never truly knew what I wanted to do with my life. Was so focused on doing well in school, I never really focused on the long-term. I was always thinking in the now. When I was at school, my family was heavily into biology. Mother and grandfather worked in pharmaceuticals and they were always whiz kids at biology. They thought the PhD path in biological sciences was for me. Moreover, the grammar school I went to gave grants for students going to med school. Ultimately, it was clear I was gradually being forced down the biology route.  Don't get me wrong, I excelled at biology at school, but what I really loved was math. As a result, I decided to go to university in London to study Neuroscience (the best in the world for it). But half way through, going down the biological route I knew was not really for me. I could not see myself working in labs or doing a PhD in this field. 

At the time, I met my Dutch girlfriend who also studied on the same course. We went through university in London together. The more she knew me, the more she also noticed that this route was not for me. But what she also noticed was that I was talking about finance, economics and math more and more as time went on.  After my bachelors in Neuroscience, she still had one more year left of her study and I decided that I would take a Masters in International Business.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I had left my bachelors with around 50K in student debt. Not great when you change your career sights half way through your degree. Luckily my father was able to support the masters. Once I had finished my masters. my girlfriend wanted to come back to Holland. So I decided to also move there. We agreed Holland would be the place to start our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately when I moved to Holland, my career plans and perspectives really changed. It was not easy for a fresh student who had no knowledge of the language, norms or customs AND work experience to get his foot into the ground. I managed temp evening work in a market research office calling companies and doing surveys. It was not great, but it allowed me to make money and provide money for the rent. During this time, my girlfriend decided to pursue a masters and then a PhD in Neuroscience (which she still does to this day). After trying to get some internships or experience in finance/ business firms, eventually it seemed my luck was running out. Even with the business masters I realised it did not give me the technical or mathematical skills needed to get a foot into the door. Not knowing the country and being told you don't have the relevant experience started to make me disillusioned with moving to another country. But I decided to stay for my girlfriend. 

While this was all going on, I started to get into sports and working out (since I had more free time since graduating). Eventually I decided to use my biological degree somewhat and decided to go into teaching people who wanted to work in gyms as personal trainers and health consultants. I taught human physiology and took a few jobs in gyms (both as admin guy and personal trainer). For the next 6 years, this is basically what I did - worked in market research while teaching and working in gyms, 3 different things at once. The problem was, doing all this, I felt I was eventually slipping away from what I truly wanted to do and become settled on just doing this. 

Throughout my time in Holland, my relationship started to become strained. I guess my career plans did not turn out the way I expected for both of us and over time I lost focus on my long-term career plans and became more focused on just fitting into the country. While my girlfriend was doing her PhD she was the main provider (PhD pays as a real job in Holland). While I worked it seemed I was not really going anywhere. At this point, I think I lost touch and focus on the long-term and was simply living day to day. 

Fast forward to 8 years later, the worst day of my life. My relationship was over In a country in which I had no friends, built up no stable connections, had no family, and was not making enough money to fully support myself, I fell into a dark hole and quick.  I had to move into a shady, run down place. Overnight it seemed like my life was over. 

Most people probably would have returned to their home country, but after 8 years of living in Holland and moving straight after graduation, Holland felt more like my home than the UK did. So I decided to stay.

When my relationship ended, I felt like the bubble I was living in, had popped. The dramatic shock to my life had finally caused me to wake up and think about the rest of my life. I needed to do something to secure my future.  After 8 years and finally having achieved a permanent resident permit in Holland (making me essentially a Dutch citizen), I had found out that being under 30 I was entitled to student loan support for university. Being 29, it was my last year to be eligible. This to me all seemed like a sign, giving me a sort of second chance to finally get onto the path I really wanted to be on. So I took it. At the time I was not making enough to support myself while paying again for college. So I took the loans.

For me, I always loved math. So I decided to undertake a undergraduate degree in econometrics (3/4 years - essentially a math, statistics and programming degree) followed by a 1 year master. Now in my second year, I am finally on the path I CHOOSE to be and not one that is influenced by other people. Also something that will actually give me a shot at a good career.

By time I finish my studies I will be around 36 with 150K in student debt. Its been a long journey to get to this point, shaped my major life events. Does the huge student debt worry me? It does not. It is a lot, but my fear of waking up at 30, having missed my chance to go back to university to do something to secure a future, would have destroyed me for life. I would much rather wake up with a mountain of student debt, having taken the last opportunity possible for me, then wake up debt free, but with no perspective or future. 

I wish it didn't take 8 years later and a massive break up in a foreign country to cause me to finally wake up, but sometimes, being a young person, we never really know what we want. Time is on our side. Its not until shaped my major life events that we finally wake up one day and realise, this is where I need to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share my story because there are probably others out there like me:

1) We don't always know what we want at an early age. We are too easily influenced by others and time.

2) Some of us are probably living in a bubble and do not wake up until shaken by a major life event

3) Student debt. Waking up with a future and a mountain of student debt for me is better, than waking up debt free with no future.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For others out there, please share your story!!!!!"

I recently got an offer for an internship at a very large company for Summer 2022, and because I graduate in the Fall, I want to make an amazing first impression and hopefully get signed on for full-time. I already know what tech stack is used ([ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC + Entity Framework + Azure) and I've been taking Udemy courses in my spare time. I feel like I've come a long way in a short time, and understand CRUD operations and model views a lot more than at the beginning (which was understanding 0% of it).

However, this has also been a bit overwhelming, and I'm just at the start. I'm terrified of showing up on my first day and not knowing how to do anything. Industry relevant frameworks like these just feel like so much to know, and I find myself getting stuck and having to Google shit/steal from StackOverflow way too often. I tend to look at tutorials really often and change the code to fit mine, but that just feels dirty to me. I see some of the Web Apps my peers have made, or alumini I'm in contact with, and couldn't imagine doing that without quite a bit of help. I know this is a lot closer to ""real-programming"" and I'm starting to fear I'm not cutout for it. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, what's the expectations for an intern who was honest about being really ""green"" so to speak? I've played around with some APIs and extracting data from JSON files just for personal reasons and projects (Scryfall API is fantastic btw), and I am getting a head start on this webstack so hopefully I'll have some knowledge by June."

At my previous workplace there was an intern that came over in the summer, her task was to scope out how relevant DBT is for our stack (ADLS + databricks  / synapse). We didn't really see DBT replacing either databricks or synapse and what the advantages were over those 2.

However considering this is what you guys do for a living and have more expertise in than myself, can you please sell me on DBT? We might have 'positioned' the tool incorrectly and not have seen it's use. So many of you guys are raving about it so I must have overlooked something.

^(bonus points if you can sell me on stuff like Alteryx too.)"

There’s been highs and lows but I think I’ve finally reached my breaking point. All the other times I’ve had someone there at my side, talking me out of it or reminding me that life wasn’t as bad as I thought it was at the moment but now I don’t even have that.
Two years ago I was so happy. I had so many great friends and an absolutely amazing girlfriend. We were on our last year of Highschool and we just had so much fun together. We’d spent pretty much everyday together and it filled me with so much joy. Well, half a year later and we were done with Highschool. Every one of us had picked out a university and at the end of that year we all went our separate ways. We promised each other that we would stay in touch just as much as before. Needless to say that didn’t happen. Me and my girlfriend broke up a couple of months after we moved after she visited me. I don’t think I really realized it at the time but that was the beginning of a horrible descend from which I haven’t been able to get out from and I don’t think I will get out from, at least not in what would be considered a good way probably. Over the last year, all of my friends have slowly but surely distanced themselves from me, my ex girlfriend met a new guy just barely a month after we broke up which broke my heart and, I know this sounds so selfish, but seeing all of my friends so happy while I’m alone in my apartment absolutely miserable is driving me even more crazy. Now I have nothing. I have no friends since I was never able to meet some because of the pandemic, I hate the thing that I’m majoring in but since I’m already in the third semester I’m mortified of telling my parents that I don’t like, especially my dad since he would be so disappointed in me. I’m so overwhelmed by everything going on in my life, I’m supposed to be writing an exam tomorrow for which I’ve already pulled an all nighter from yesterday to today and I still don’t understand a thing, I need to complete an internship during summer but I don’t have a place yet and I’m afraid most places have closed their applications already, my mental health has just been getting worse and worse and I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point. I broke down hysterically crying about an hour ago and I’ve tied some fabric together. I just don’t want to feel miserable every single day, I don’t want to wake up and have the feeling of wanting to go straight to bed again I just want everything to stop and I’m finally so close"
socmmd,1,2022-02-09,"Security positions after internship, which one?",Wazzock1912,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/socmmd/security_positions_after_internship_which_one/,"Hi, I'm choosing between 2 positions after my internship: [Incident Response Phase 2: Detection and Analysis](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/incident-response/incident-response-steps/) vs Internet of Things Audit &amp; Assessment. Can you guys give me some advice on them. I'm still a student so I don't think the salary is a problem because they are not very much. What I care about is what I will learn and the future of the direction I have chosen.

As far as I can see:

\+ Incident Response:

\- Belongs to Blue team, but not SOC monitoring, but about actual investigation of attacks to agencies and corporations.

\- IR is quite new in my country and I think a lot of organizations are looking to develop it with SOC.

\- At work, I will be involved in incident response missions, organize incident response drills with partner's systems, research malicious code and report news to agencies.

\- But I feel that my mentor in this field does not have a deep understanding of IR/SOC, however he has the ability to learn quite quickly, I think he can guide me in the right direction, because he works on a lot of different areas, mainly web pentest.

\- It will be quite challenging because cyber attacks are very common these days, and I need to be really good to detect them.

\- If I choose this path, I will definitely join SOC in the future.

\+ IoT:

\- Research and develop standards for IoT device audit &amp; assessment, which may include pentest (firmware, web &amp; mobile app included with the device) later.

\- This position is quite unique and I don't think there are too many similar positions in other companies (though it will probably still be classified as red team, pentester). IoT is also quite new in my country (lol)

\- If I accept this position, I am guaranteed to have a lot of work with IoT over the next few years, so the work and the experience I get will be very good.

\- My mentor in this field is quite solid, he specializes in RE and currently with my IR mentor, they are the main technical staff of the department.

\- It is very easy compared to IR for me right now. It can be said that I follow the checklist (will be expanded in the future) and it's done.

\- Later I might learn more about web pentest and join red team.

As for myself, I think I prefer IR over IoT, but the manager told me to join IoT, because there are many works now and my profile will also be better than doing IR.

=&gt; I see the future with leaving my current company and applying to another company with a few positions in SOC it will be easier with IR, but in the long run, IoT is still better (less competition, more things to do in the near future,..)

Can you guys give me some advice? Can you share about the work you are doing, some of the downsides in your work and their potential for development in the future?

Thank you very much!"
sodkiy,13,2022-02-09,Didn't get a job because I am ''too quiet'',Hefty_Blood,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/sodkiy/didnt_get_a_job_because_i_am_too_quiet/,"Hey everyone. I'd like to know your opinion about this. Recently I did an internship one month in a company I really liked. I asked if after one month they could maybe hire me. They initally said that there was no problem, as they needed people to work there. I tried my best in this month of my internship to learn as much as I can, so that they see that I am really trying to be a fit in their company. I tried to get along well with my coworkers and everything. It's just that I wanted to eat alone at my lunch break most of the tim, because I feel that this time is ok to me to relax and enjoy my meal alone. I would always try to talk to people as not to seem antisocial. Usually I only spoke if they talked to me first, because i was imersed in my work  and tried to learn as much as possible. I always tried to smile and be friendly to people. Even if I consider myself an introvert I always try my best to be sociable. Well one month has passed and they suddenly told me that they aren't hiring at the moment. I was surprised and a bit a shocked, but later I tried to forget about it. I few weeks later a girl I know went to this same company for a job interview (although they said they aren't hiring), and at this job interview they asked if there was anyone that had worked before her or wanted to work there. They said that there was a girl there who wanted to work at their company, but they didn't hire her because she was too quiet. I know they were talking about me, because I was the only woman there in my office. All the others were male. When I heard this news I was really shocked because I know I tried my best to socialize with everyone, but it seems that wasn't enough for them.  


I'm starting a new job in 2 weeks but I am honestly affraid of having similar problems like at the previous company. I hate that I have to be fake fo succeed at workplaces. But I guess this is just the reality for someone who is an introvert.  


tl;dr: Is being a quiet and calm person really a deal braker in most work settings?"
soei4z,9,2022-02-09,Feeling Lost,nothingtocommit,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/soei4z/feeling_lost/,"Hi, I am a sophomore CS student in one of the most well-known universities in my country. My CGPA is 3.12 and lately I feel completely lost. For the semester break I managed to get an internship at a startup and seeing the field and how competitive it is, I feel extremely intimidated. I don't have much experience in any software related industry. I only know Pyton, C++, HTML, CSS and basic JS and never done any projects so fat. My school does not let me do some side-projects and learn new technologies and I just feel burned-out. Seeing other interns having a skill-set and experience in a field like webdev, mobile development, AI makes me feel like I am not cut out for this profession. I already struggle doing shitty data analysis projects in my internship now.

I am currently trying to write web spiders for acquiring data and actually didn't expect it to be this hard. For the record my CGPA is constantly melting down. 3.55 -&gt; 3.32 -&gt; 3.12 in the 3 semesters I have had so far.  I will probably graduate with a GPA of just above 2.5.

My question is how did you guys find a field you are interested in and managed to stick with one thing? There are a lot of things to learn and I just don't know how I should motivate myself."

I just graduated this winter as a marine engineer and was so lucky to get a job at the company in which I was an intern. I’ve been working at this company as a student assistant since I started my studies - in another department than the internship though. Now 2 months in I’ve been offered a job in another smaller company where the pay and benefits are better. 
Now I can’t decide if it’s too “greedy” to take it after what’ll become just 3 months of employment.. I like my boss and co-workers, yet the company is so big that it’s drowning in procedures. I’ve heard a lot of good things about the other company and they felt very engaged in me based on the job interview. 
What would you think about this situation? Should I just take the other job or is it stupid after such a short employment period?

sok1z5,20,2022-02-09,How I became antiwork,throwwayawaynonono,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sok1z5/how_i_became_antiwork/,"I have been thinking of posting my story for some time now. This happened about 10 years ago. I used to work at a small advertisement company here in my country.

One of my coworkers had lost his wife and son in a car accident a few months before. It was beyond tragic, the poor guy was really struggling, as you can imagine. He took some time off to grieve but when he came back his work wasn't up to the company's standards anymore and after a couple of weeks they fired him.

He went up to the roof and jumped off our 12 story building. I was outside and actually saw him die. I was 19 years old at the time. A crowd gathered around his body and an ambulance was called to take him away.

I don't remember all the details because I was so shocked at what was happening but I do remember very well that after a few minutes my manager came outside to tell people to go back to work. He yelled at me to ""go clock in"".

I went inside and tried to start working but there was just no way to focus. Everyone else inside was talking about it. Turns out the person who was supposed to fire our coworker had refused to do it because they realized what a shitty thing it was to do that to a grieving husband and father. So they ordered an intern to do their dirty job for them. She was a college student in her early 20s. She ended up having a complete mental breakdown because she felt so guilty and ended up being fired as well.

A lot of people quit in the following weeks and the company ended up going out of business.

Whenever I hear bosses saying that the workers don't care about the company, I remember my coworker's bloodied body on the ground. I had nightmares for years afterwards because of it."
sol1v8,1,2022-02-09,Here goes nothing - just graduated and think I made a huge career mistake.,abutor_,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/sol1v8/here_goes_nothing_just_graduated_and_think_i_made/,"So, I'll be providing some context but keeping it vague for anonymity sake.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated recently and accepted a full-time position with the company I interned for. My degree is in business, for context. It's  the industry I thought I wanted to work in, and my internship experience was great. (Edit: removed industry, just know it's closely related to entertainment and hyper-competitive) It was an internship conducted through my University and was unpaid, so it was for-credit. I'll address this later.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm a few weeks in to this new job, I have yet to enjoy one day of it. I like the people I work with, the environment is decent, and the pay is decent too. But, the work is something I despise and never saw myself doing. Endless cold+warm calls, emails, prospecting, etc. Seems normal for a lot of people, but for me, it's something I never envisioned for myself, especially since it feels so FAKE. Everything I say is god awfully fake and the dissonance is wearing me down to a point where it affects my relationship and mental health, albeit only for the past few weeks. The things my coworkers say, along the lines of framing words certain ways or just flat-out lying to close a sale, makes me sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked in food service prior, but this 9-5  has made me question my entire career path and even my newly-earned degree. I wake up anxious in the middle of the night. I dread clocking into work and don't even feel an ounce of satisfaction, even on payday. I am literally writing this before a meeting, feeling lost and in despair. The most depressing part for me is that I don't think it's fully related to my workplace; I think I just chose a degree (business) that I have come to realize I hate and gone into an industry that wasn't what I expected.

&amp;#x200B;

Most advice I have read has been ""look for a new job before leaving this one"", but I feel like I would be reverting backwards if I left what was supposed to be my ""dream job"" and ""foot in the door"" to a hyper-competitive industry. Moreso on that, I have no idea what ""job"" to go to. My business degree is general management, and as I mentioned above, I don't think I'd feel much different if I went into another office job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm only a few weeks in, and would feel god awful if I were to quit. I have so many things and responsibilities (or at least it feels like it) and I think, no matter how graceful I do it, leaving right now would be shitty for my coworkers and company. It would certainly burn bridges and cut ties with many of those connections, many of which were my first professional contacts.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten to the point where I want to just set up a meeting with my boss and end it, go look for food server jobs, and square away my mental health and career path. But, I'm worried that I would be filled with regret in the future and that I may be burning my only connection into this industry, along with the feeling I may have going back to a job I was doing before I had a degree. Not to mention, the feeling of letting those down around me (girlfriend who I live with, parents who paid for my degree, family in hometown that I left in order to pursue opportunity). I think it's important to mention that I've never really taken a deep look at my mental health either, and have only recently began taking steps with my gf to improve my perspective and life purview (meditation, mindfulness, reducing alcohol+marijuana use, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Do I stick it out for the 1-year contract (at-will), despite the  toll on mental health it would have?

Do I stick it out until I find a job in another 9-5, even if there's a decent chance of hating it as well?

Do I find a service job that pays similarly with much less stress and responsibility to figure out my life?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, even the fact I wrote this post has me feeling like I'm already out the door, and I apologize for being all over the place with my thoughts. I just don't think I can do this much longer, and don't know how to leave a job I literally JUST started, without it looking horrific on my CV. I just know that a huge relief would wash over me, if I were to just put in my 2-weeks and consider leaving this off my resume, but the fear of failure, disappointment and future regret is the only thing keeping me where I am and holding me back from telling my boss I just can't do it.

Cross-posting to other career subs, as well. Appreciate any responses!"

solf7r,3,2022-02-09,Unsure of how to progress with my learning,liyana_rahimi,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/solf7r/unsure_of_how_to_progress_with_my_learning/,"Hello, I'm a recent chemical engineering graduate trying to break into data science/programming. A few months ago, I got myself a codecademy subscription and have been learning Python and R. I have now nearly gone through all of the available material. The lessons and projects in Python are heavily focused on a specific skill or topic, so I'm struggling to consolidate all of my knowledge. Right now I'm just becoming decent at doing very specific things which limits the scope of my overall capabilities. I've tried working on projects outside of codecademy but still find myself limited to small-scale projects that utilize specific skills. I'm too lost to start a large-scale project on my own but I don't have a formal education in programming and am not qualified enough to seek experience in the form of internships or professional collaboration. Unless there are opportunities that I'm not aware of.

I don't really know what kind of advice to ask for either. All I know is that I want to achieve similar competency as someone who majored in computer science. I know that it may seem unrealistic to expect to achieve the competency of a 4 year degree, but that's my ultimate end goal. Any advice or shared experience is welcomed.

sopdj5,1,2022-02-09,Two of my friends think I'm too negative and annoying,Square-Persimmon-116,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sopdj5/two_of_my_friends_think_im_too_negative_and/," 

So my bestfriend and I went to the same vocational school and graduated in the same year. I have found the struggle of dealing with the high pressure job as very tough while she is naturally talented in the work that we do. I had undiagnosed ADHD which got diagnosed after I left my internship instead of becoming regularized at a really renowned firm in my city. The skills that my job require are what I struggle with on a daily basis, which is why it gets to me a lot and since she's one of the few friends I have in the field, I open up to her a lot and talk about how things should change.

Well apparently, after we met for lunch, she told me her boyfriend (who is in the same field and is our mutual friend) said that I complained a lot and that I should just accept things as they are. Obviously hurt, I do not consider him a good friend anymore.

A week later, at lunch, she proceeded to inform me that (on a lunch where I was opening up with my struggles with my work and my insecurity surrounding it because of prior experiences) she found my negativity annoying, specifying that conversation.

I got really hurt because I feel like no one bothered to even research how ADHD affects me in work and life and honestly both of them are super annoying many times but so is everyone so I never point it out and I feel like she shouldn't have either.

Now I've become super distant and no longer want to be friends with her. I already stopped sharing anything with her. (P.S rejection sensitivity affects me a lot.)

So basically, am I being a huge downer and annoying or am I right in slowly cutting them off?"

I (and others) have always considered myself a smart person. But the search for even internships is ridiculous and is making me doubt my abilities. So far, I've applied to several dozen internships, and the results have been bad.

First off, the coding tests. Either I'm much dumber than I thought, or the bar is set very high. Many of the coding tests I've taken online I haven't done that well on, and these are only for internships, not even a real, full-time job.

Secondly, the sheer amount of time required for internship interview pipelines. Every one of the internships I've applied for required at least one coding test and multiple rounds of interviews. Hours of time wasted just to hear a no.

Is this the norm for CS work, or do things get better later on? At the moment I'm planning backup plans as it seems pretty likely that I'll be unemployed after graduation."

In secondary school I used to get up at 5am and do a paperound, I'd then get home and get ready for the day, I'd go to the gym, then after school I'd exercise and go to clubs. I was a model student. Just before college everything went to shit. I became cripplingly depressed. I gained a bunch of a weight, my grades dropped, I started smoking. It's been a downhill battle since then. I got terrible A levels, currently at the age of 21 I am in my first year of uni after I repeated a foundation year.

I had an incredibly intense burnout at a young age now I am a shell of what I once was. As I'm typing this I am no longer depressed. I am happy with life but I want to try and get back to what I used to be. As I said I repeated foundation year, so I've been clubbing, I did all the drugs, there's nothing left to do but study and become a productive but I'm in a rut I can't get out of. I have lost all motivation. 

The problem is I am still very smart, I don't need anyone's validation. On the one assignment I actually tried on I got an easy first, but then I failed another two assignments that I just couldn't be bothered to put effort in. It's not like my parents are rich and I can always just depend on them. I can't, they're poor, I'm their only hope for a brighter future and I want to do good but I don't know where to start. I'm too caught up on things that don't matter and I know 21 is still young but my clock is ticking.

I made a LinkedIn profile and my goal is to fill it up, I want to join unions, I want to be a valuable member of my university, I want to do internships and pave my future but I don't know where to start. Someone please help me. My mind is so clustered. Has anyone else been absolutely demotivated like me then switched it around ?"

 I got in as an intern in Lead Generation but as I wanted to work with Data I quickly started to start side projects etc... bottom point is that 4 months later I god transfered to the data area and now I take care of all of Analytics for top of the Funnel and marketing, BUT the problem is they said I have to ""stick as an intern for some time"" because there's a rule (that I never heard before when got hired) that I have to stay 1 year with an internship contract before getting hired as full time.
My point is, even though I love what I do, I literally only deal with directors, heads, high managers, I am the only person in charge of our hole Power BI management etc and I'm paid as an intern... this has been bothering me a lot, since I got previous offers from smaller or local companies to work for like, more than double of what I make. But I really love the environment, the people I work with, I already have their trust and stuff like that. 
Do you think it's good to stick with it and hope that they keep what they said of hiring after 1 year (4 months from now) or is it a trap?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Counselor Rec (6-8/10): I did not meet them very much until this year but they seemed very enthusiastic to write a letter for me. We connected a lot more when I got National Merit Semifinalist and they already had to write a letter for the finalist app for that.
* APUSH Teacher Rec (6/10): Was a good letter that talked about lots of good qualities of me in the classroom, but the teacher did not know me out of class very well.
* Math Teacher Rec (8-9/10): Known this teacher since 10th grade through Math Club. They're very familiar with my personality, work ethic, and how I am in the classroom &amp; out of it.
* Robotics Coach (9/10): Talked about my leadership qualities, my abilities from their perspective as a software engineer, and how I made it possible for our team to compete during COVID.

**Interviews**

* Princeton (8/10): The interviewer was very chill and it was a very enthusiastic conversation that let me really talk about myself and all of my interests.
* Yale (6/10): It felt like a very standard interview, with nothing too special. It was nice how they let me talk about how COVID has affected me in high school.
* Harvard (7/10): The interviewer was also very chill, but it seemed more like structured question &amp; response format than a conversation. They really let me focus on describing my school environment and circumstances with how there's lots of problems with funding and the quality of instruction.

**Essays**

* Common App (8/10): Talked about my fear of public speaking, years of speech therapy, and eventual success in debate.
* Supplements (5-9/10): Reading back through my essays again, lots of the ""Why Us"" essays were very generic. However, in the other essays, I feel like I really showed my passion for computer science and learning with lots of anecdotes of how I have used computer science to help others.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* State Flagship University (EA; $11k/yr scholarship contingent on National Merit Finalist)
* Georgia Tech (EA2; likely unaffordable as I was not selected for Stamps or Gold Scholars scholarships)
* Yale University (RD; got an email and call for a likely letter!!!!!!!!)

*Deferrals:*

* MIT (EA)
* UChicago (EA)
* Northeastern University (EA)

*I've sent no LOCIs.*

*Waiting* (all RD)*:*

* Stanford
* Carnegie Mellon University
* Cornell University
* Harvard University
* Princeton University
* Columbia University
* Brown University
* UPenn
* Northwestern University
* Johns Hopkins University
* Duke University
* Boston University

**Additional Information:**

I still am so surprised as I've had this lingering fear in the back of my mind that I would not get into any single one of my reach schools, let alone into one via a likely letter. The amount of rejections that I've seen for Asian Males in CS with impressive profiles that I've seen in this subreddit is scary. In hindsight, I really should have applied to more safeties/targets, but it worked out :). I posted a chanceme a while ago and now really see why people described admissions as a crapshoot.

Surprisingly, the admission officer from Yale that called said that my interview report was ""impressive"" even though I didn't really get those vibes during the interview.

I'm really excited to see how results go in March and will definitely update!"

sowoko,7,2022-02-09,Can't seem to get any internships,East_Cartographer_38,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/sowoko/cant_seem_to_get_any_internships/,"For a bit of background: I'm currently a 3rd year AE major. I have a lot of projects behind me varying from all kinds of topics, but no internships. Several of these projects were sponsored by companies, and a few of them I have taken on leadership roles. I've also got a decent GPA and have a decent number of relevant skills behind me, coding languages, CAD modeling, etc, and am part of several engineering clubs at my college. Needless to say, my resume is tailored around these engineering projects and the skills that accompany them.

And yet, I have applied to literally hundreds of internship positions for the summer, for dozens and dozens of different companies and have yet to hear back from a single one. I've rebuilt my resume 5-6 times throughout all this, some of which are tailored for specific positions and companies that I've applied to, yet still the same result. I've done several resume critiques, with friends, alumnus, career services, and no one has said anything bad about my resume or its formatting. While I do admit that I'm lacking in networking, it has become apparent to me that my resume isn't the issue here, nor is my personality since I'm not even given a chance to have an interview for these positions. I've even gone to a couple of virtual career fairs (10-minute sessions), and still have never heard back. I've done a lot more than a lot of my peers that are getting internships have done, even with those internships factored in. 

February is here and I still don't have anything for the summer. I'm not sure at all what I've done wrong. Any advice?"

I am already doing a project with my mates and and learning new programing language on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

Go to websites of the companies or organizations you may end up working once you graduate, check their **student employment, internship, membership or even volunteer** page, force yourself to contact them as much as you can, and start from there.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems to be a mundane and boring advice, and universal to all college students regardless of their mental status. I will elaborate on why I think this is particularly important to fellow students who are suffering from ADHD. 

With ADHD, you are probably sucks at planning and have an extremely passive personality. This means it will probably take you longer to finish the program , or even drop out half way. And even if you complete the program, it is likely that your skill development is jeopardized by the lacking of planning and commitment. This is exactly what happens to me, after I completed a 4 year PhD program in 8 years. I found myself in a very peculiar position. On the one hand, I am too old and over-qualified for an entry-level job. On the others, I am lacking the access, the confidence and the capabilities to the senior positions. I really wish I had done what I suggested above. There are three major benefits for it:

1. it will compel/force me to do something useful and meaningful, rather than just wasting time and energy on self-loathing, self-doubts and panic attacks. 
2. Unlike my graduate program, which requires tons of self-planning and long-term commitment, these internships or part-time jobs are likely to be much more straightforward and less-demanding. 
3. Even if it went south. I will still have something on my resume as working experience instead of this gigantic 8 years gap for one degree, or even worse, for nothing. 

So, if you are in the similar situation, please consider my advice. I am fully aware that to reach out would make us extremely uncomfortable and anxious. But it is so much better to be uncomfortable and anxious at the early stage when you still have choices. Sometimes, it is literally just an email away from something good and positive to happen in our life. **TL;DR:** Please, maximize the benefit of being a student while you can, and hanging there. Best wishes for you all."

Yesterday I had 2 back to back interviews for Google’s software engineering and site reliability internship for the EMEA region. My interview was scheduled 2 weeks ago but didn’t have time to prepare because I had exams. I finally had barely 3 days to prepare. 
I’m not very confident about the entire interview. For the first interview I wasn’t able to complete the question though I outlined to the interviewer how I plan on achieving a solution. For the second interview I was able to finish the question but they asked a follow up question after and didn’t complete it due to time. The interview later asked me to write down the steps on how I plan on achieving the solution which I did.

I feel I may get rejected. Any ideas on how long it takes to get a rejection? Do you think I have a chance? Are there other things the interviewer looks into other than coding? I will really love brutally honest responses :("

I’m a graduating student from TP Accountancy &amp;amp; Finance. I took CBP at first and got into A&amp;amp;F.

Before starting Poly, I was aiming to graduate with 4.0 but thought that it will be impossible as I likely can’t get A for every module over the course of 3 years. However, to my surprise, I am about to reach my initial goal that seemed impossible.

These 3 years have been rather unique as my Y2 and Y3 were mostly HBL. The course itself also has been a challenge for me since I’m pretty introverted. I had to speak up more in class for the class participation and present confidently during project presentations.

Anyways, I am quite free right now as I just finished internship recently and all I’m doing is waiting for graduation. Therefore, feel free to ask me if you have any questions regarding TP A&amp;F or CBP, or even Poly life in general."

sp9apm,15,2022-02-10,Prospective PhD advisor is trying to shift my start date. Advice?,AnythingTotal,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/sp9apm/prospective_phd_advisor_is_trying_to_shift_my/,"Edit: by pure coincidence, I ran into the other professor who extended an offer to me. He said that the offer is still open, and he would be happy for me to join his team in the fall. I’m going to (respectfully) tell my first choice to kick rocks.

Background: I am finishing my MS in an engineering field in May. Have an internship offer this summer, and I hope to start my doctoral program in August. It might be worth noting that I am ~30, so a few years older than most of my peers.

November timeline: I received two offers for funded PhD positions from different faculty members. I have a “handshake” agreement with one of them, nothing in writing yet. I have had two discussions with him about it and have met/interviewed with his colleagues that I would be working with. He mentioned that his student working on the project quit unexpectedly, so he needs a new student rather quickly to keep the project sponsors happy. I mentioned my internship offer, and he offered an August 1 start date, which worked for me.

Back to February: I had a group meeting with him and my current co-advisors to discuss the transition. He mentioned the possibility of June start date during the meeting. I did not interject, because it did not seem appropriate in the group setting. Again, nothing set in stone here, just making sure we are all on the same page. 

In light of his June idea during our group meeting, I sent him a message to discuss my start date with him a few days later. When we met, I again mentioned my internship offer and that it will require a full time commitment for at least 6 weeks. He said that he “is trying to be supportive, but this is not good news for this project.” He said that he would like me to inquire about moving the internship to next summer, that there will be other opportunities, and that he may need to look for another student otherwise.

How would **you** respond to this as a student? Am I wrong in feeling that he has been a little deceptive in this process? I fear that it doesn’t bode well for a lasting working relationship where my autonomy is respected. I know that advisor/advisee relationships are paramount to successful and happy PhDs, so I’m disappointed that things seem to have had such a rocky start already."

Although the role seems to be good and I enjoyed getting to know my managers and mentor through the interviews, I am a bit hesitant about accepting the role as there are two red flags sticking out for me:

* I went through the interviews without a single coding challenge! I never had to do an OA nor was asked to code at all although I was asked a few technical questions about how would I build a model, how would I improve current ones (maybe it's Data Analytics role so thats why?)
* Secondly, I received my offer yesterday but they aren't giving me much time to say yes - I only have till Monday to accept

&amp;#x200B;

I also have first round technical interviews for Twitter (Data Analyst) and Tiktok ( Software Engineer, Risk Data Mining) coming next week.

If the firm I am unable to extend my offer deadline, what should I do?

sp9pg2,1,2022-02-10,I don’t like my internship- any advice?,Current-Law-5591,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/sp9pg2/i_dont_like_my_internship_any_advice/,"I started an internship this January. It wasn’t exactly the position or field that I am interested in, but I thought it would be good either way for additional experience before I graduate in a few months. It’s at a small startup company with around 15-20 employees in total. I work with a certain team of a few people that include the CEO and my mentor. Within the month that I’ve been here, I’ve realized I really have no interest in this type of work at all. In fact, as I have been researching a lot and looking at other careers, I’ve found I have a passion in an industry that is completely different from this internship. So I would not even be able to ask them to try out some work in a different department, because they don’t offer what I’m looking for. 

Aside from not liking the work I do itself, I really do not fit in with the employees. Since it is so small, everyone is very close with one another. My team specifically is people who are extremely outgoing (and just very blunt people overall) and are already close friends, and I can’t seem to really get along with them. In fact, since I’m more introverted, they tend to just make me really uncomfortable. I have never been in a workplace that makes me as anxious as this one does. A lot of comments they make to me are them making fun of me, and usually I’d laugh along, but not in this environment since they already make me feel out of place to begin with. My mentor actually spoke with me and said they want to see my personality more and see the “real me.”—didn’t realize that would be part of the job description lol. I’m a very friendly person, just very shy, and her saying that only made me overthink everything even more. They were looking for someone to be hired full-time after the internship, but I have decided to apply for other opportunities since I clearly do not enjoy this one right now. I landed a full-time offer that begins after this internship in a company/position that I’m very passionate about and now that’s all i can think about—especially since I dread going to work everyday at this internship now. Does anyone have advice on how to still finish this internship to the best of my ability, regardless of my plan to leave? Or any advice on how to navigate the workplace given how uncomfortable I feel there?"

I only have learned python and Java, but I’m a bit overwhelmed with how much I need to do to get a software engineering internship. 

My resume is currently tailored to finance and I don’t know what to add to it/do so I can start applying to tech internships. Is it to late as a junior to get a tech internship or do I even need one?

I've been offered an internship as a Software Engineer at Uber which will start in 3 months.  
I'm a Data Scientist student and I don't really have a background in Software Engineering. I know Python, I've used Git once or twice for school projects and I've studied Data Structure for the interview... and that's pretty much all lol  
I'm very motivated to learn though (I think that's why they gave me the offer) but I really don't know what I should do in order to be the best prepared.  
Are there like ""fundamentals"" things I should study before my internship ? Should I start learning Go as this is the language they use at Uber, or should I focus on my Python skills and start doing mini projects ?

I've done all the standard tests of clearing the cache, clearing the SSL, making sure the certificate isnt mismatched, and no luck. 

Our certificate is self signed, and previously, we had to go into the settings and allow insecure content, which would let us access it. But now this no longer works. 

I'd like to avoid reaching out to Microsoft if I can, given the expense isn't necessarily in the budget, so some fresh ideas on troubleshooting would be appreciated. 

Additionally, I'm the IT intern who they stuck with fixing this issue, so my education and experience with certificates is still new.

EDIT: I solved the issue! My company's email server was running on TLS 1.0, which is no longer being supported. I upgraded to TLS 1.2 and rebooted the system, and am now able to access it!"

spates,32,2022-02-10,There is a hunger that even the damned fear. This is my story [Part 1],Dear_Alma_Mater,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/spates/there_is_a_hunger_that_even_the_damned_fear_this/,"It has been a very long time since I’ve told this story and I’ve never told it to anyone over the web before. for the sake of the family involved, I’ll keep all names confidential and will be swapping names for all of the people in my story. I will say that they, as well as I, lived in the southeast. Deep in the Pine Belt of the lower U.S.A.

&amp;#x200B;

My story started when I moved back home, fresh from Graduate school and still proverbially blowing the ink dry on my diploma. I had taken a job as a mental health therapist at the hospital in my home town after spending ten years away in the bigger cities nearby. I had gotten tired of lights and sirens at night and the break up between me and my girlfriend left me seeking old and familiar places. not to mention my inability to find a decent job. It’d been only a couple of months at this point and I was slowly re-acclimating to the rural lifestyle. Everything was different down here in comparison to living in a cramped apartment in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to moving down here, I picked out a small house online, it was a separated piece of land on an old pine tree farm. the 4 Arce plot laid in an open patch somewhat off center from the much larger 1000 Arce farm still owned by the bank. The entrance to the property cut through the farm in a straight-line and still had a no trespassing sign bolted to the metal swing gate. The long leaf pine trees were set in neat rows, their red barked trunks shooting up high above. The branches of the over grown giants reaching out and shading the empty spaces between them. It was like being in another world, it was perfect for me. The deer and birds loved this area and it didn’t hurt that, once I was settled in, I laid out feed a distance from my backyard for my morning coffee and nature watching sessions. I had even set up a small table near the patio door with relevant books and a small pair of binoculars. As well a cheap storm light for the late night raccoons, possums and now a new family of deer. The house itself was a cinderblock relic from the 70’s; plenty of mustard yellow, mint green, and wood paneling. including a hideous pastel pink bathroom just to round it off. But it was cheap. still in good condition too, the previous owner spending a good amount time modernizing it. but it still needed work and that put it in my price range.

&amp;#x200B;

I was enjoying a weekday evening, nothing majorly different from the previous nights and I had just finished cleaning up from dinner. I made my way from the kitchen through the living room to look out the patio door and into the rain, taking my glasses off briefly to rid them of the inevitable sink water splashes. It was late September and it rained nearly every night, but this was harder than usual and it seemed endless. I could barely see past the tree line no more than 50 yards or so from my patio. Sliding the door open, I stepped outside onto the covered porch, my hand lightly gripping a rather nice corncob pipe my friend had given to me before I moved. The little tag on the stem read from “from John. for when you feel the need to fit in”. there was a little winking faced man in overalls and a straw hat drawn next to it. insulting to say the least, but, I had quit smoking cigarettes two months ago and the urge wasn’t strong enough for me to leave the house in this I thought, my hand reaching into the rain. I dried my hand off on my shirt and drew close to the wall and away from the spray kicking up at my feet. I pulled out a clear plastic bag from my pocket, unrolling it then unzipping it, I retrieved a small box of matches and a metal tamper that came with the pipe; the whole kit included the pipe, and accompanying accessories, and a jar of moonshine I had placed above the refrigerator some weeks ago. Slowly drawing on the mouth piece, I lit the pipe and puffed away.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been out there for around an hour, the rain never letting up. I even thought it had worsened. The rain was falling in waves as the wind pushed it around. As I looked up into the dark tumbling clouds above me, lightning flashed across the sky; surging out to an unknown point somewhere nearby. In that same moment I flinched, subsequently sending my pipe sailing out onto the concrete patio and into the rain. I ran out and picked it up, checking for cracks and scratches. when I looked up, I saw a flash of movement. Off in the distance in-between the thick tree trunks, a small dim light and a dark figure darted quickly into frame. I caught glimpses of it in the rolling light of the storm. It movements stopped in odd motion, like I was watching a movie that skipped with each flash of light. It was fast, and it seem to know where it was going as it darted in a straight line through the trees just beyond my property before coming to a halt just past midway. That dim light now bouncing from tree to tree. I remembered the storm light I had next to the patio door. Making my way back under the cover, I retrieved it. pointing out into the rain, I flipped the switch.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing, just the dense rain pouring into the yellow tinted beam that struggled to reach out into the Forest. The light began to fade; “the batteries are dying already, damn it”. I had been using it pretty often since the deer started coming around at night. I banged on the side of the light with the palm of my hand. The light began to flicker; I must’ve knocked something loose I thought. I could hear loose plastic rattling inside the thin yellow housing. each moment that passed quickened my fumbling, my wet hands struggling to keep a grip. I looked up and froze in place, my kidneys palpably surging adrenaline into my system. I dropped the light on the concrete next to me. It had reappeared, the figure reemerging in between the last view soft strobes of yellow before the light finally faded.

&amp;#x200B;

It had stopped, facing me from a clearing in the rows of trees. It was cloaked in a black hooded robe that tattered at the waist. deep in the hood was a blue glow but no face. it was barefoot and its legs looked gauntly and impossibly pale, though its feet were black and muddy. Its hands hung loosely by its sides and it seemed to be caring something in its left hand that swayed about, but I couldn’t see it. it was Like a child carrying a doll by the leg. The light faded and my vision blurred. My glasses filled as streaks of rain drops poured down the lenses. I took them off, wiping them down the length of my shirt then putting them back on, using my index finger to push them up the ridge of my nose to seat them properly. There was an uneasy feeling welling up in my chest, like I was being watched intensely.

&amp;#x200B;

I fixed my gaze back at the tree line and the figure. the sky flashed and thunder rolled over top. It was closer this time just outside of the tree line now, like it had moved impossibly fast in the short time between bursts of lightning. The object in his hand I could see was moving now and thrashing. I called out to it but I couldn’t hear anything. The rain was so loud and I was fighting to keep my glasses clear. The thunder rattled the windows of my new home, threating to shatter the single pane glass. The clouds above me lit up; streaks of blue and purple tinged lines of lightning crawled across the clouds, the light radiated by the heavy rain. Deep in the thunder I heard what sounded like a bell, a solitary note that rung out with each roll of thunder. I looked out into the trees and it was still there, dimly lit by afterglow and distant clashes of lighting that cascaded down the rows of trees, lighting the ground as they went. I could tell my breathing had hastened and it was all I could do to bring it back under control.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember taking a step forward as if I was going to walk out into the trees and rain, but I stopped. My heart leaped into my chest and I struggled to move my legs as it dropped what it was holding as if taking my motion forward as sign of challenge. the object now flailing on the ground, like a deer shot by a hunter, but not killed. My brain is now screaming at my legs as a wave of paralysis slowly creeped up and past my knees. With each flash it got closer and a sense of primal fear pulsated in my eyes. Without time to react, the air filled with an overwhelming crack and my vision blinded as lightning struck a tree out in the distance and in that moment it was in front me. Meer inches from my face. It screamed at me from its now crimson lit veil and panic surged up from my chest and into my throat. It sounded like a combination of countless wounded animals, and wings, thousands of insect wigs, all humming and chattering in unison. It filled my head and my ears pulsed with pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, just as soon as it appeared, it was gone. I let out a gut wrenching cry, the paralysis of fear dropping as my body returned under my control. I fell back, the back of my head colliding with the tempered glass of my sliding patio door. I stood up and looked out to see the spot in the mud where it dropped what it was holding, the mud pushed into a shallow misshapen circle. I glanced back up to the tree the spilt bark producing whiffs of smoke. I ran back in the house, shutting the door, locking it, and then closing all of the blinds.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat on my couch in the open light that night contemplating all of my life choices. I had never seen anything like this in the city or in my entire life when I stopped to think about it. but I had nowhere else to go. I sunk all of my available finances into moving out here, even the last of my college fund given to me by my family. I remembered the moonshine that came along with the pipe. I pulled it down from above the refrigerator. “country moonshine” I read aloud from the bottle. Extra insulting. Might as well though, I thought. I had barely popped the mason jar lid off it when my phone rang. Its loud ringtone nearly causing me to drop my bottle, or rather, jar. It was the local sheriff’s office. The woman on the end of the phone simply said “connecting you to head detective, extension 225”. There was a brief silence, then static, then a click. The line sprung to life in my ear as I heard that all too familiar sound of hard rain over the phone. he sounded stressed and all he said to me was,

&amp;#x200B;

“I need to speak to you asap, please meet me at the sheriff’s office first thing tomorrow morning, don’t make me drive to you house”. We had been longtime friends, since diapers, but he decided to stay here in town and become a cop and eventually a detective. The fact that his father was the sheriff made it that much easier for him. We had re-connected when I moved back and made a routine of having a beer or two at my place on the weekends. But why was he calling me now though and to go to the precinct? he never called me for work stuff. I could really do with some of those lights and sirens I thought as I peered back out the window through a slit in the blinds, that spot of mud was still there. It looked like whatever that thing dropped was heavy. I peered back up at the now extinguished tree before walking away. I grabbed the jar and made my way to my bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, I woke up to a splitting headache. I drank half that jar that night and was able to squeeze out at least 3 hours of sleep. I shambled to the patio door and slid back the blinds again. That spot was gone. The ground was flat and undisturbed, like It never happened. I lifted my gaze up to the still present and charred tree. I stared back at the ground puzzled and I could feel that surge of panic well up in my chest as I thought of the night prior. I skipped my coffee that morning; instead opting for a migraine pill, a bad choice in hindsight. I also spilled a bit of that moonshine into a leather wrapped flask given to me as a parting gift from my old job. The black leather felt cheap and most likely was not real lather at all. I slid it into my bag and headed for my car, I had a twenty plus mile drive out to my office at the hospital and I was running late.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that morning after setting things right at work, I headed to the precinct, deciding to take the longer scenic route this time. I had taken a liking to my pipe. It wasn’t a cigarette and I never inhaled like I would with a cigarette, but the I started to like the smell and it was soothing to smoke it on my long car rides. I drove through the center of town for the first time in years and was surprised to see that a lot of the old buildings were still around, though more weathered than I remember them 10 years ago. Even the old psych ward, Pine Trails. It had been here since the later 19th century and even when I was young, the building seemed to be at the point of falling apart. There was so much brick work, and the wrought iron rails that surround the court yard now turned parking lot were more rust than metal. What a depressing place I thought. It passed in my rearview mirror and disappeared into the forest as I rounded a bend in the road. My pipe had gone out and I was beginning to feel the effects of having no caffeine coursing through my veins. Skipping coffee was definitely a bad idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I arrived at the sheriff’s office, the building was made of 90’s era thin and long yellow bricks with a proudly showcased and overlarge version of the towns police shield on the wall next to two metal framed glass doors. I walked in and before I was could get my barring, I was quickly met by a sweaty and smelly man. My friend, the detective. His hair sloppy and his breath smelled of stale coffee and cigarettes.

&amp;#x200B;

“good morning” he said as he grabbed and weakly shook my hand, his nails caked with black lines of dirt and his clothes wrinkled and stained. “come with me”.

&amp;#x200B;

He led me to a small room in the back of the building. It was filled with mostly old boxes of case files, Styrofoam Chinese take-out containers, and paper soda cups. In the middle of the room was placed an old metal and wood desk from the 70’s with two dented and abused metal folding chairs sat in front of it. He plopped down at the desk and pulled out the middle drawer, it squeaked with each of his labored pulls. “damn stuck desk” he gripped as he slammed his fist on the tabletop, loosening the drawer and the stability of the towers of files on top. he slipped his fingers in, pushing past a collection of pens and pencils to reach an unopened pack of cigarettes. Ripping it open, he took one out and lit it with a brass zippo he pulled from his shirt pocket while gesturing towards the chairs in front of the desk with his free hand. “have a seat” he rasped as he exhaled, I declined. He looked down at a file he had in front of him, drawing off his cigarette and exhaling through his nose. he spoke up,

&amp;#x200B;

“do you know who tom is” he asked me, peering at me from behind his lucky strike.

&amp;#x200B;

“yeah, I think”, I murmured as I thought about the name.

&amp;#x200B;

Tom was well known in my neck of the woods. Prior to his permanent stay at our local psychiatric ward, he was called the neighborhood spook catcher. He had a fascination for the supernatural and was often seen at the local library, reading into books and articles about ghosts, phantoms, demons, gods, you name it; whether it was fact or fiction, news or tabloid, it didn’t matter. But unlike most of your nerdy type ghost catchers, he took his work very serious, only taking certain jobs. You had to meet a very special criterion and he would spend months on the case. However, and much to the dismay of the community’s majority, most of those he helped would actually say they benefited from his work. Going as far as to make him the towns unofficial supernatural expert. Though this was mostly a joke at his expense.

&amp;#x200B;

But that was the good side to his fame. Most knew of him from his troubled past and his fondness for booze. His brother went missing when he was young and his mother would pass years later after succumbing from dementia. They say she walked into the pine forests and was never seen again. Her body was never found and it was thought to have been consumed by the local fauna. He would later be institutionalized after his arrest in connection with a string of missing children reports. He was found the morning after they went missing. He was walking on the old highway into town, covered in their blood, carrying the hand of one of the deceased. the local court sentenced him to life in the maximum security section of the Pine Trail Psychiatric Ward as a result of him winning the insanity plea his lawyer pushed. The general consensus is that he had a break in reality and over the course of two nights he would murder three children in the forest and try but fail to make it look like they had run away. Just like his brother years before, causing people to suggest he had likely murdered his brother too; though his brother was older than him by 3 years or so. The only issue to the story is his appearance when he was found the morning after and the arm he was holding. That’s not exactly the best way to hide a murder.

&amp;#x200B;

“yeah, I’m familiar with him” I said after a while. “why do you ask?”.

&amp;#x200B;

He stopped for a moment, tapping his cigarette above the overstuffed ash tray on his desk then continued, “Two nights ago, I spent 12 hours walking through the forests looking for a kid who was reported missing earlier that night. His parents say he just vanished, he was there when she put him down to sleep and then when she went to check on him, the window was open and he was missing. Until that is, we found him. or rather what was left of him.”

&amp;#x200B;

he dropped his head for a brief period, pulling hard on the filter, holding it in briefly before blowing it out across his desk.

&amp;#x200B;

“I found his arm sticking straight up out of a whole at the base of a live oak tree. It looked like it had been torn from its socket. Then, last night, two more kids go missing. Same thing, window open and kid missing. I spent all night looking for them, this time with a crew of 5 people in the pouring rain. But nothing. we even used blood hounds, and we still have a team out there looking for them, but not even a trace of them. I think whoever is killing these kids is playing with us and I think Tom has something to do with it. even if he doesn’t know it”

&amp;#x200B;

taking another long drag off his cigarette and exhaling as he continued, “I think we got a copycat killer on our hands, but I’ve stretched myself to thin and I can’t handle this on my own anymore. I need expertise.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Isn’t there someone else you can call that is more qualified?” I interrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

“All of the other shrinks said no. they think he’s past the point of talking to.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Please,” he said with a begrudged sigh, “will you go down to the psych ward and talk to Tom. See what you can get from his murders. See If he can give us some sort of insight on this new killer.”

&amp;#x200B;

As he was talking I had made my way to the coffee pot at the opposite side of the room, trying hard to escape the cigarette smoke. I was two months without one, but my will was waning. I stood there, hovering my hand on the side of the pot before tapping, then touching the glass. It was several hours cold.

&amp;#x200B;

“why do you want me again?” I said after contemplating the coffee further. My mind slipping from his prior explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

Grabbing the pot and swinging around to face the detective, I shrugged “I’m basically brand new to this; I don’t really have any usable real world training yet”.

&amp;#x200B;

“in fact”, I paused and poured a small cup into the cleanest mug I could find and proceeded to the microwave tucked in the corner.

&amp;#x200B;

“That’s why I’m here. The big city has a lot of jobs, sure, but they all want experience. And well, I had to work through college so I’m sort of lacking in the internship department. Well at least not enough compared to other people. I still tried, you know that”. I put the mug in, closed the door, and hit the beverage button on the microwave before turning back around to the detective.

&amp;#x200B;

“well consider this your experience” he said with a monotone tired voice. “and this isn’t an internship, I promise. if You can get me enough info to create a good lead then I’ll make sure there is compensation.”

&amp;#x200B;

He pushed the file into a clear patch he had made on his desk in front of the two chairs, and gestured for me to look. “that’s all the info I’m able to give you. It’s got everything you’ll need to know about the murders, and the presumed alive but still missing children. As well as Tom’s pertinent medical and psychiatric information”. I picked up the rather thick file and flicked through it, stopping at his evaluation history. 12 therapists so far. Not a good track record. but the detective had made a pretty good sales pitch I thought. I would get a good amount of experience, and forensics too. That was really marketable then. Not only that, but it would also be my first major case and higher profile than my usual stuff. Since I had been here, it had been mostly marital disputes and drinking problems. this was something new and, I’ll be honest, very interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

“I’ll work on it” I said, tucking the file under my arm. “I’ll head over to Pine Trails now actually. My next appointment isn’t until this afternoon, that should be plenty of time for a first visit.”

&amp;#x200B;

“great”. the detective mumbled through the cigarette hanging from his lips.

&amp;#x200B;

“you go do that, I’m going back into the forests with the teams, I only broke away to come speak to you”. he grabbed a dirty back pack with a make shift red cross on the back and slung it over his shoulders before pilfering my coffee from the microwave. “thanks”, he said as he raised the mug to me, taking a sip and walking past me and out the door. I took a moment to survey my surroundings before I caved. I reach over and snagged a cigarette from the pack he left on the desk and lit it. I can see why he likes these, I pondered. Covers up that old Chinese food stink. I took another one, just as pay back for the coffee and left his office."

I might be lowballing the 50 applications number. Most of them were submitted to internship postings while an undergrad since I've only switched to grad this year. I'm mostly applying internships along the lines of embedded engineer, firmware engineer, or anything with networking mixed in.

The result is 1 interview and a handful a handful of coding challenges. I know 50 is a low number out here so I'm not sure if I should be expecting much of a different result.

spcc2e,0,2022-02-10,[Update] Got verbal offer this morning,fracturedpersona,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/spcc2e/update_got_verbal_offer_this_morning/,"First, for those of you who responded this [this post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/son0k0/recruiter_told_me_i_have_an_offer_forthcoming_its/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) thank you.  Here is the update, question at the end.

I got a call from the recruiter this morning with a verbal offer.  The salary they're offering is quite low.  It's an entry level position.  The pay is higher than an internship but lower than most entry level starting salaries.

So, given that it's taken me seven months to get a job offer, due in part to not looking outside my city and not wanting to work remotely, I'm inclined to accept the offer with the expectation that my pay will improve with time and performance. 

Also, I graduated with no student loan debt, so I don't have to worry about having money to live on after paying those bills. We've already been living on my wife's income alone with money to spare.  I also rationalize this by saying, if they don't improve my pay, I can bail in 6 months to a year and probably get a job much easier, particularly once I get my TS from this position.

I understand that since my position requires a security clearance, there's going to be less meaningful work for me to do until that is granted, so it makes sense for them to not want to shell out a lot of payroll for someone in my position yet, but I have a feeling that will improve once I do have my clearance.

So, given all of that rationale, my question for you all is, am I wrong to approach this with my mindset?  Would it be unwise to revisit compensation after verbally accepting the offer, saying I wanted to see the rest of the terms before discussing compensation?"

So a couple months back I interviewed with a medium-sized software engineering company in my area. The interviews were pretty competitive and I had to work hard, but I was able to land an offer. On the downside, the internship is with a team that does web app development. I've had experience in making web apps, but I'm not too fond of it. The crew I talked to was nice, the company sounded like a great place to work at, and I was desperate for an internship over the Summer, so I accepted without hesitation.

Problem is, I just received an offer at a really big Fortune 500 company. The interview was fairly easy (just behavioral questions, don't know if this is a red flag), but the solutions the team works on are a lot more complex and daunting. The position is more akin to systems development rather than software engineering, but the team uses languages I'm more familiar with and I found their work to be interesting.

I already accepted an offer with the local company, and while it's a comfortable position, I also don't want to waste the opportunity of interning at the Fortune 500. I'm not really sure which offer to choose and I'm worried that reneging the offer I already accepted will leave a black mark on my record and squander my future applications.

spi05v,1,2022-02-10,BA Future Plans,WVULuke,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/spi05v/ba_future_plans/,"Good evening. I’m currently in a BA role within the digital department at a $30B asset bank. I really really enjoy my job and team but am underpaid in a MCOL southeast finance city.

I’m almost 25. During undergrad I never had internships because i was self-employed with a low 7 figure business. Shut down in 2018 and Undergrad finished in 2019, 1 year of agency work after undergrad with a previous business partner, then went back for MBA from semi ok state school. I was lost and could afford MBA so just did it to delay having to grow up. Probably wasn’t the best decision as In the long run it would’ve been nice to get my MBA from a top school. I’ve now been in a BA role within a digital team for ~1 yr at previously mentioned FI. 

My day to day is SQL/excel data analysis for different lines of digital products pertaining to consumer banking, product management, website dev, presenting to director/exec’s on digital growth and more misc. tasks. I really enjoy the finance industry. I enjoy stock trading etc., but in no way want to turn a hobby into a career. I’m ass at accounting. Not great enough or have the background for a super finance focused role imo. I’d like to continue doing what I’m doing but make more decisions and get paid more- LOL. Doesn’t everyone? 

I guess what I’m asking is where do I go from here? I see BA or product management roles from Cap One, KPMG, BoFA, etc and many pay close to or low six figs. 

I have an awesome boss who shares my struggle of not getting paid all that much, and has actively encouraged me to seek his help if I ever decide I’d like to move on to somewhere else. I just don’t know where/what else I qualify for. I see growth at my current company in the future, but not salary wise. So I’m sure I could stick around for another 1-2 years to get a few promotions and then exit. Who knows if I ever even will exit. 

Any advice? Idk what I’m really looking for as far as a response. Thanks in advance for w/e is said."
spi0bw,180,2022-02-10,"PSA: It's MB, B not MBB (the second B being Bain)",account6544,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/spi0bw/psa_its_mb_b_not_mbb_the_second_b_being_bain/,"As someone who just went through MBB recruiting and had numerous touchpoints with all 3 firms, I have observed that Bain is noticeably different from the other two. This is the kind of insight I would've appreciated when I was browsing this sub as an MBA applicant. Most people on this sub understandably (but not entirely correctly) think all MBB are one and the same. I am offering my observations to prospective applicants who prowl this sub. 

**TLDR:** Within MBB, McKinsey and BCG form one cluster and Bain forms another cluster. McK &amp; BCG are more similar to each other than either is to Bain.

A few clarifications:

* This is NOT meant to be prestige tiering within MBB. All 3 are equally prestigious in the US with a slight edge to McKinsey. Internationally, Bain is a bit behind because of its more limited footprint.
* The differences between MB and B are minuscule compared to their differences as a group with T2 or Big 4. 
* These observations are based on interactions/research during and after the recruiting cycle only. I don't have experience working for MBB yet. Will intern at one of them for the summer.

**Size:** McKinsey (30K employees) and BCG (22K employees) are both much larger than Bain (10K employees). MB also have a significantly larger geographical footprint both within the US and internationally. The differences in revenue are similar. McK ($10B), BCG ($8B), Bain ($4B).

**Practice Breadth:** Bain heavily indexes on PE DD, a niche it dominates. Outside of that, MB have a much wider practice area coverage. Bain has big holes relative to the other two in a few practice areas such as digital. This is related to Bain's smaller size. In most competitive bids, McKinsey and BCG directly compete against each other. Bain plays in a slightly different field.

**Lateral Hiring:** McKinsey hires the most from outside the traditional pipelines of undergrad and MBA (PhD, law school, med school, industry hires etc.). BCG is close. Bain does the least amount of non-traditional pipeline hiring.

**Staffing Model:** Bain's home office staffing model contrasts with BCG's regional and McK's global model. At Bain, you are always staffed with people from your home office for every study. At BCG and McK, teams shuffle around and are often composed of members from multiple offices.

**Staffing Structure:** Bain's pyramid staffing structure contrasts with the other two's diamond structure. In other words, Bain hires the most at the post-undergrad analyst level while the other two hire the most at the post-MBA associate level.

**Selectivity:** (*Speculation Alert*) Bain seems to be the most selective when it comes to MBA hiring and this is related to the previous point. Not only is Bain smaller than the other two but its post-MBA classes are also smaller on a percentage basis because of its pyramid staffing structure. But anyone who applies to McKinsey and BCG also automatically applies to Bain. Same number of applicants but fewer spots probably means higher selectivity.

**Hours:** Bain is known to have slightly better hours than the other two. About 60-65 hrs at MB vs. 50-55 hrs at Bain.

**Support Infrastructure:** McKinsey has the most robust support infrastructure like research, slide-building, modeling etc. to help consultants outsource grunt work. BCG is fast catching up. Bain is behind in this regard.

**Culture:** Bain employees consistently rate themselves as happier than employees at the other two. Bain's ""culture"" is more collegiate, fratty and less competitive.

**Promotions:** Promotions are the fastest at McKinsey and slowest at Bain, with BCG in the middle and closer to McKinsey. Bain has a position called ""Case Team Leader"" before the manager level that slows the promotion from post-MBA associate to manager by 1-2 years vs. BCG &amp; McKinsey. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, these are observations made during the recruiting cycle. I am sure some of these points are stereotypes but directionally accurate nonetheless.

EDIT: Bainies, calm the fuck down! No need to be defensive and all. I called your firm the most selective and best culture. Lmao. I didn't group you guys with Big D."

I was doing great in life. I was killing it in college with nothing but A and Bs. Had a really good internship lined up with a permanent position paying incredibly well at the end of it. I was decently good looking, had a gf, and loads of friends, I was really social. Parents wouldn't stop talking about how proud they were of me and how ill be supporting the family soon. Then under a month it all went to shit. Lost everything.

I got (and still am) incredibly sick. My entire body, from head to toe is red/purple and inflamed. Disgusting skin flakes and smelly BO 24/7. Lost all my hair, i get random cuts around the body and feel as if I'm wearing someone else's skin. Eventually developed huge joint/body pain...it literally hurts just to exist now.

3. Splunk (observability). A smooth interview process, the people in the team are nice. Don’t know much about this company (some people say it’s going down). Maybe not as good as Roku in terms of salary and working content?

Other on-going ones:

1. Nvidia (infra team). Just passed the hm round,  more on-going. Maybe can’t finish before the deadline of Roku even if i passed.

2. Salesforce (security). No security experience, don’t why got this interview. Not much interested in security as well.

Would love to have any comments on these, thanks!

Some lessons I learnt during the hiring season:
1. I got no interview for the fall, don’t be panic and disappointed, keep on applying! You will got one eventually.

2. It’s never too late to apply. I started October last year, everyday I thought it was late. But it’s never late, people get hired for their application on any day.

3. Eat, sleep, code, repeat (have some fun in the gap as well :)"
spn8tx,4,2022-02-10,failed hard in college. Can I still get a job in tech?,idkwtd1121,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/spn8tx/failed_hard_in_college_can_i_still_get_a_job_in/,"Basically the title says it all. I am a blind student attending one of the feeder colleges to Silicon Valley. However, I didd not get in as  a CS major, so I tried to change my major in to CS and failed horribly. My current GPA is 2.1. Moreover, my current major is Econ. It is almost impossible to get a job in Econ with low GPA, and it is not what I want to do for living. I have at most two semesters left excluding the current semester. I haven't had any internships, I did not build meaningful connections, and I have not lead any clubs or organizations on campus. I barely passed all of my CS classes, and I have a f and few ws on my transcript. I feel frustrated because online schooling was difficult and I feel that I was not accommodated properly in some of my classes. One example of not being accommodated was that I did not have textbooks in few of my math and CS classes. I know that wasn't the biggest cause of my failure. My communication and time management skills probably contributed more to my failure than online schooling and not being accommodated. At this point, I do not know what to do. I am mad at my self for failing and anxious about getting a job. My parents are not rich, employment statistics for blind people is terrifying, and I took out loans to attend my current college. I believed that going to good college and getting good grades were going to compensate for my blindness and help me to get a job, but I know that I was wrong now. I regret every choice I've made since high school. The worst thing of all is that I do not and can not feel happy for my friends who got internships and jobs in top tech companies. I say that I am happy for them, but I am dying inside because of jealousy. What should I do? What's the best action that I can take?"
spoiop,4,2022-02-10,Pay Me Less My Guy,SPACisitions,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spoiop/pay_me_less_my_guy/,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

So I was finishing up college in the midwest. It was the spring semester of 2020 and I had accepted a position with a company of a couple hundred people in a small town in the middle of nowhere, hours away from where I was currently living. I asked for compensation slightly above average for grads from my college program. I had pretty good grades and internship experience . I ended up agreeing on $1k less than the average. A month later COVID hits and I get told I would be placed on hiring freeze until August. Alright, I guess just something I’ll have to live with. Well the beginning of June rolls around and I get called and asked if I could start at the beginning of July. But they need me to take a 10% pay cut through the end of the year. The one question I ask, “Is everyone in the company taking a pay cut?”. “Yes” is the reply from my potential boss on the other end of the line. I think, if everyone is doing it then I guess I can live with it. What else was a guy to do? The job market was completely dead and the outlook of finding another job anytime soon was bleak.

Fast forward to getting hired. I get presented with a new job contract with my new pay and told to sign. I look and the pay cut isn’t quite 10%. It’s rounded to the nearest thousand. I begin to think something is fishy, but I sign the contract. I start training and all seems fine and once I start to meet a few new coworkers I get comfortable enough with them to start poking around. “How have things been here since Covid? Any negative impacts on the business?” I find out they laid off a bunch of people right when it had started, but am told that COVID was probably used as a guise to fire people that weren’t great workers or didn’t fit well with the company. Interesting. No mention of pay cuts though. The next day I get worked up enough to ask one of my coworkers I was starting to become friends with about pay cuts point blank. “What pay cuts?” Is the response I receive. I then explain to him how I’m getting fucked over. He then tells me about how he was one of the people who were laid off. And they brought him back in different position.

I finish my job training the rest of the week without mentioning anything again to anyone and start in my new position while trying to figure out if saying anything to my boss will do anything to benefit me. He lied to my face before I ever started. Why would he have any moral compass to make things right? And although my blood is boiling and I want to quit this job immediately but I’m hesitant. I mean what sort of future do you really have with a company that’s going to do whatever is in their best interest and doesn’t mind if they have to fuck you to do it? But Covid is a thing and the job market is still dead. And no one wants to hire a college grad with two weeks of experience so where am I going to go? So I stay in my job and vow to never do more than the bare minimum job requirement for this company.

As far as my job goes it completely sucks and I dread coming to work every day. It is nothing like what my expectations were and the work is mind numbingly shit. I’m not working on half the stuff I was told I would be either. Mind you it doesn’t help that I’ve moved to a new town where I know nobody. My 2 year girlfriend and I broke up prior to the move. And any opportunity for meeting people is nonexistent with Covid in full effect. Oh and not to mention I’m living in a hotel until I find a spot to live. I stop looking for apartments though the minute I learn I’m being lied to because I refuse to have anything keeping me at this shit job. I let this be the state of my life for far too long and end up living in the hotel for seven months basically in a state of depression the whole time suffering through the shit job. 

Then the end of the year comes. At my end of the year review I get bumped back up to my pay I was suppose to receive when I started. I find out my job will be changing drastically and I see this as a big time positive. I actually start to not dread coming to work. I decide to give the job a chance for another year and commit to the town and job. I get an apartment and life starts to seem better. But it’s always in the back of my head. They lied to me and fucked me over so why put much effort into my work? Why meet their deadlines? I lose any motivation to develop in my career because I don’t want the company to benefit from it.

I see them fuck over many people while I’m there for the year and a half. They try to get the only HR person in the company for the last 8 years to take a 5 digit pay cut because they hired someone over her to run the department. She was smart enough to give them the bird and find a new job. I watched them give a management position to someone within the company who gets trained in and works the position for three months only to have the higher ups change their minds not long after. I watch them fire a guy two weeks before Christmas because they don’t want to pay him any of the time he’d be off. Nonstop turnover at certain positions and job postings that are open for months because the company won’t raise their pay rates. Not to mention horrible benefits. And a lot of people who work here don’t care about their job because most people are looking to get out. But it’s a small town and there aren’t many opportunities nearby.

Fast forward to the end of 2021. Time for my end of the year review. My boss tells me everything has been good. My works been good. They’re happy with my progress. They hand me a sheet to show me my new salary. It’s a 4.7% raise... the equivalent of core inflation for the year. I get told I’m getting a $1500 bonus to bring my salary up to where it should have been for the past year (because of the company not reaching profit sharing goals.) I tell him I’m not happy with that. I let them know I’m being paid less than the average college grad from my school would be projected to be making and I’ve been working there for a year and a half. You’re happy with the work I’ve done so I think I should be making a little more than the next warm body that walks through the door. I also let my boss know I’m aware that I was lied to. My boss wants to talk with upper management and get back to me.

My boss sets up a meeting a couple days later and leads off asking me how long I’ve known they lied to me. Then tells me it doesn’t help anyone to be resentful for the year and half I’ve worked there. Deflects blame onto upper management although the words came from my bosses mouth and then goes back to pretending nothing ever happened. They then slide me my new salary offer. They decided to take away my bonus and add $2k to the salary. Basically the equivalent of telling me to go fuck myself. Then tells me I haven’t been developing as well as they thought I’d be, contradicting everything they said in my initial meeting. My boss then has the audacity to tell me I received a big raise of 11% the previous year and asks if I’m expecting double digit raises every year. I also get fed the line that they gave everyone around the same percentage raise and that my boss considers us all equal in the department. Also try’s to say profit sharing is part of my salary even though it’s not guaranteed money as was proven that previous year by receiving nothing for three quarters. Also tells me I shouldn’t be making a certain amount of money because they had to work 7 years before making that amount of money. My boss obviously has zero grasp on the concept of inflation. 

 For the last month I have given less fucks than ever at that job. I have no incentive to work hard because “everyone gets treated equal in our department”.  Currently on pace to miss a month long deadline by at least a week. I can’t get past the fact I’m getting fucked repeatedly. I’m tired of showing up everyday and not giving a single fuck about what I do. The job search has begun but no matter what I’m getting out of this toxic shit hole when my lease is up in a couple months. 

Thought I’d share and let everyone know always do what’s best for you. Employers will fuck you the second they get the chance. And don’t stick with a company that doesn’t respect you. I would have rather been out of work since the beginning of covid than turned into the nihilistic prick I’ve become because of this company and the asshats who manage it.

TLDR: My dumbass decides to inflict mental torture on myself for a year and a half by not leaving a job when I’m lied to before ever starting. Management proves if they screw you once they’ll keep screwing you.

Edit: Grammar. Added TLDR."

spqh79,1,2022-02-10,"What do I do about anxiety to the point where it’s crippling at some times, and bearable at others?",lostandconfusedhaha,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/spqh79/what_do_i_do_about_anxiety_to_the_point_where_its/,"Thankfully, I am in a place in my life for the first time since I was 10 (I’m 19), where my life is stable. I can actually address my mental health, and heal. I can’t afford a therapist, but I know that in a few years I will be able to. I’m looking forward to processing my past with some guidance, even if it’s in my late twenties or thirties. That time will come for me one day. Having these two thoughts, both of the past and the future, I am grateful for and they relieve me. 

But about the present. I grew up with social anxiety. A lot of social experiences I missed out on. I used to be really shy, but always tried to grow out of it. I did, and now talking to people and making friends isn’t impossible or scary for me anymore. But I have a fear of networking. Not that I won’t try, but it’s something that keeps me up at night, and I haven’t even got to the part of college where I have to intern yet. Thinking about navigating a world of people and situations I am very unfamiliar with gives me anxiety. 

I also grew up poor, and my parents divorced at 13. Times were almost always turbulent. If it wasn’t bad enough, it got worse. My dad kind of pulled a classic and dated, engaged and married someone abusive to me physically at times, abusive to him emotionally and he doesn’t even realize it, sometimes kind in sprinkles, but overall very bitchy in between. I got pulled into it. My grandfather loves me conditionally, and this wouldn’t bother me if I hadn’t grown up very close to him, and if he wasn’t such an important figure in my life that I love so much. I have deep feelings of betrayal and resentment because of my family. Overall I love them all and am close with my sister, even close somehow with my dad, and have worked out most issues with my mom. But I fear this will have an effect on my relationships. It’s already affecting my feelings towards my boyfriend, who is kind, consistent, respectful and open minded. This gives me anxiety. 

I lost a lot, through moving, through financial crises, and through anxiety. I lost sentimental items. I lost my hobbies and interests. I lost some pets who were like family to me. I even felt I lost my identity at one point. The fear of losing anything makes me anxious. 

My mental health was so bad at one point that I could barely get through school, even though I love learning and turning my best work in. College gives me anxiety, even though it has been some of the best times of my life. 

My academic interests don’t align with my financial goals. My two deepest fears are not having enough money to support my family (I want to have kids, but only if they get to have a good life), and having a job as a means to an end. So much time goes into work and I want it to be something that I don’t hate. Choosing a major that allows freedom like business, at the cost of my academic interests gives me anxiety. 

My only long term goals in life are to get my bachelors and move out with no financial burdens like debt. I just want to pay my bills and pursue my career. I don’t want to spend 10 years of my life climbing the ladder just to find out I wished I had majored in something more useful. This gives me anxiety. Achieving my goal gives me anxiety because although I am not in such a fragile state as I was in high school, I know I have to work 20 hours/week through school and full time in the summer. Working doesn’t even bother me, I like contributing to a team, and make the most of it solo. But my plans absolutely relying on me working even through school give me anxiety, even if it doesn’t terrify me. 

I have so many things planned down to the atom just so I feel stable enough to sleep at night at all. I’ll put hours and obsess over getting an idea worked through in a matter of days when it should be something addressed over weeks. I have a very hard time relaxing, there’s always something in the back of my head. Instead of spending a couple hours of my free time watching a show I enjoy, I spend it scrolling through a webcomic that’s mildly interesting, or tik tok, or reddit. The only thing that gives me true peace is nature, and at times I can’t even bring myself to drive to nearby reserves because of the gas it will take to get me there. There are more things that give me anxiety. I have so much it’s crippling. And it’s just, some of these are bigger than the others, but most are like little walls to get over. Maybe I could deal with one or two or even three, but they all add up. 

Here’s my problem. I view myself as weak, even though I am capable of somehow living quite normally alongside these anxieties. But when shit hits the fan, it’s like Andy’s coming. When life gets real, when life gets tough, it’s like my brain turns to mush. I become brutally critical of myself and paralyzed at the same time. It makes me feel like everything is worthless, never mind constantly fighting the mentality of “most of life is pointless” on my good days. 

A therapist is out of the question, financially wise for me. I don’t make much and have to save. I am reaching out to my school’s mental health branch as the first mental health resource I have reached out to in my life. But, I’d like someone’s insight aside from a professional. Someone who’s gone through it, or an adult who goes through it, you know? Any advice would be appreciated."

Anyway, I've been at my SWE internship for just shy of a year now on top of previous experience. I'm doing the same exact job as everyone else on the team, just part-time during the fall/spring semesters. And I absolutely love it. My company recently posted a full-time role for the job I'm doing now, and my manager, who's aware of my frustrations with college, invited me to apply. I know I would be a pretty strong candidate since this is an entry-level position and I wouldn't need any training.

Now, I'm not going to apply unless I can plan on committing to an offer, which would mean dropping out of my traditional school and finding an online CS program if I were to continue. And I have some concerns before I could commit... If I don't end up going back to school, how limited am I without a degree? Will it make me look like a quitter? There are plenty of successful people out there without degrees, and I even know a few personally. Is there anything I'm forgetting to consider?"
spstor,1,2022-02-11,Leaving an immediate start internship in 2-3 months for another internship,17hatch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/spstor/leaving_an_immediate_start_internship_in_23/,"Hi all! Been interviewing for internships and I’m in the last stages at some companies in which 2 seem to really like me. 

One starts almost immediately part time and goes through the summer full time, I’ve met with the guy who would be my boss and he liked me and send me to the hiring manager now who I meet with tomorrow. This internship would be using their BI tool and making data visualizations with front end technologies. Its very open ended and a small team, potentially just me on it working. With code in various frameworks and whatever someone felt like working in, and that option would be for me as well. 

The other internship I had an amazing interview and he said he “wouldn’t be upset to see me starting the way I am appearing”. But this internship looks like I’d be interacting and learning so much more tools, docker, kubernetes, CI/CD, Postgres, angular. I’d have direct mentorship and code reviews etc. it seems like a great place where I will grow more, and he asked about my fall semester as well in which I stated I’d be open to staying with them, which he liked. The issue seems they only want me to start in May however (potentially starting earlier if the team was ready), and I won’t hear back for a few weeks to see if I’m into the next interview (I’m confident I’ll get it tho.)

I’m hungry for anything, and I planned on taking the offer for the immediate internship the moment it’s given to me in case I don’t get the offer from the other place as I really want something for this summer before I graduate next year. If I get an offer from the other place, I’d put my 2 weeks in before the other internship starts. But I’d only be working there for like 2-3 months part time this semester before leaving, what do you guys think about this? Any advice? Do you see the first internship being able to go on my resume given this scenario?"

spudp7,4110,2022-02-11,"I'm an anthropologist, and I think I just discovered the origin of the Uncanny Valley...",beardify,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/spudp7/im_an_anthropologist_and_i_think_i_just/,"One of my earliest memories is a row of skulls.

Or rather, skull replicas. H. habilis, H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis, H. floresiensis. I remember feeling around my child-sized head for similarities. In retrospect, that was the start of my career.

I’m a paleoanthropologist, and my field of specialty is the interaction between Homo sapiens and our closest hominid relatives. For a fascinating period, we shared our icy and inhospitable planet with beings that were like us, but different. We fought, traded, and even mated with them–yet we know so little about what their lives were like. 

That’s why it felt like the find of the century, at first. The intact skeletons of at least three different types of hominids, dating to at least 50,000 years ago, preserved perfectly by volcanic ash. The suddenness of the eruption captured the scene so perfectly that it almost seemed frozen in time; if not for that, what we’ve found wouldn’t feel so…disturbing. 

We can imagine the dig as divided into three sites: A, B, and C. 

Site A is, simply put, a pit of bones. My intent is not to exaggerate or frighten, but I’ve been at this dig for over three weeks and we’ve yet to reach the bottom. Thousands of bones–sapiens, neanderthalensis, and others, all mixed together over who knows how much time. Many of the bones show evidence of being chewed on, as though the flesh had been stripped from them shortly before their deaths. That’s site A.

Then there’s site B. This area consists of a single large stone and five hominid skeletons: two H. neanderthalensis and three H. sapiens. Their positions–as well as surrounding artifacts (such as the remains of hide cord)--suggest that all three were bound hand and foot, then heaped up in preparation for something...possibly some kind of sacrifice, or even butchery for meat.

Finally, site C consists of the remains of one male H. sapiens, one female H. neanderthalensis, and one set of remains yet to be identified. Although these are far from scientific terms, I like to call this one ‘the action scene.’  The unidentified hominid appears to have been attacked by the other two, who–judging by the hide cord remains around their wrists and ankles–were attempting to escape. 

Their desperate attack appears to have failed just before the entire scene was preserved in ash. The female H. neanderthalensis suffered a shattered wrist and two broken ribs; a broken flint ax was found near the male H. sapiens, whose spine had been snapped near the neck. While I dusted off and arranged the bones of the third unidentified hominid, I couldn’t help but wonder: did you do this?

The third hominid found at site C is, quite frankly, like nothing we’ve ever seen before. At first, I thought I was looking at a standard H. sapiens…until several things stopped making sense. Firstly, Subject C (as we call her) has arms, fingers, and incisors much longer than any other known hominid. Secondly, her bones themselves appear…changeable. Her still-sharp incisors could have been retracted, likewise for her freakishly long fingers. Even her skull, which as-found appeared more ape-like than hominid, seemed modular: this hominid would have been capable of re-arranging her facial features. If she’d wanted to, Subject C could have changed her appearance to look like an ordinary human. 

He arrived at the dig the day after Subject C was found. He came at night in a black helicopter whose whirring rotary blades woke me from a bad dream. At first I didn’t understand what I was seeing in the searchlight’s glow: a hulking figure in a gray three-piece suit, followed by two bodyguard types, also in business clothes. No one else had been scheduled at the site, least of all anyone so unequipped for the rugged and remote environment we were working in. From there, the mystery only deepened. The dig site was managed by Dr. Corochan, a legend in the field who’d been leading expeditions like ours while I was still in diapers. Corochan could be counted on for three things: his dedication to science, his obsessive attention to detail, and his hair-trigger temper. As the strangers crossed the site, I watched him storm red-faced out of his quarters. He held down his hat, his beard blowing around in the helicopter’s artificial wind. Corochan looked like he was about to give the new arrivals an earful for the disturbance, but after a few close whispers he went back to bed, quiet and submissive. 

“We’re going to be sharing management of the dig from this point forward,” Corochan told us the next morning at breakfast. His voice was hoarse, his face pale and haggard. “So let’s all try to get along.” 

‘Get along?’ I couldn’t believe it. This was a man who’d beaten an intern with a hardback copy of On The Origin of Species because the unfortunate teenager had forgotten to clean his brushes. The Dr. Mark Corochan who I knew wouldn’t ‘share management’ of a sandbox. Shouts and questions flew through the air, like we were all reporters at a presidential press conference and war had just been declared. 

The answers we got were evasive and unsatisfactory. The new arrivals were from a ‘respected institute.’ They were here to ‘ensure the quality and accuracy of our research.’ Corochan had ‘absolute faith in their ability to make the right decisions on behalf of our group’ and we were to ‘treat them with the utmost respect.’ Most of that told us exactly nothing–except for the last bit. There was fear and a warning in Corochan’s hard turquoise eyes; he was telling us to be careful around our uninvited guests. 

The powdered eggs and instant coffee became a knot in my stomach. What the hell was going on? With no new information forthcoming, I headed over to site C, where I’d set up the three hominids on separate exam tables, each bone laid out and marked. I was about to go back and continue excavating the site when I felt this tingle on the back of my neck. A hulking shadow fell over the middle table. 

I heard my name, and before I knew it I’d been clamped in an eager two-palmed handshake. The big man I’d seen leaving the helicopter introduced himself as Dr. Lamier and insisted to know how I was doing, if I had everything I needed. His manner of speech reminded me of the television preachers of my childhood: an endless stream of honey-sweet, bathwater-warm words meant to put the listener at ease and set them up for a pitch. 
Dr. Lamier feigned interest in all my specimens, but his beady hazel eyes kept darting back to the middle table and Subject C. 

“Truly fascinating.” He was standing over her now, looking almost lovingly down at the skull below. “Have you found any others like her?” I responded in the negative. “Not even fragments? Perhaps partially-destroyed elements that could be identified…” I shook my head again. 

“We’ve reached the bottom of the ash layer all around the site.” I sighed unhappily. At breakfast, I’d made a silent promise to limit how much I’d shared with these unwelcome outsiders…and yet…there was something about Lamier that made me want to pour my heart out to him. My doubts about the dig, my own abilities, my choice of career, everything. it felt almost pheremonal, and it was deeply unsettling. I was soon rambling bitterly in spite of myself. “The chances of finding another like Subject C are extremely slim. Without further evidence, she’s likely to be classified as an anomaly, instead of…” 

“Instead of?” Lamier asked sharply.

“...Instead of a new species of hominid. Radically different in physiology, brain capacity, and probably culture as well.” I perked up. “But there are many hominids known by only a single fossil, sometimes even a jawbone. Genetic testing will tell us more.” 

“I imagine all your data on her is stored on your university hard drive, yes?” Lamier’s eyes drifted to my computer setup on a nearby table.

“Yes, but–” 

“Excellent.” the two bodyguard-types appeared as if out of nowhere. With horror I realized that they were preparing to disassemble my computer!

“Hey!” I shouted. Lamier looked at me coolly, all the kindness gone from his expression. 

“Much care must be taken with a specimen like this. Such an incredible find must be stored in the best facilities and studied by top experts in the field, wouldn’t you agree?”

“Are you questioning my professionalism?” I stammered. I couldn’t believe it. Weeks of work–the crown jewel of my research–”Subject C is my find! She belongs to-”

“This site and everything in it belongs to your university, doctor, who funded the dig. I have here a signed agreement granting me custody of Subject C and all relevant findings.” 

I snapped the paper out of Lamier’s hands, a petulant gesture of helpless rage. I didn’t have a leg to stand on and Lamier knew it; the fine print was just the nail in the coffin. My coffin. I was counting on this dig, this publication…

“I understand how upsetting this must be for you,” Lamier commented, like we were discussing the weather instead of my life, “but I’m convinced that in time you’ll see it's for the best.” Although I couldn’t remember the last time I’d cried, I felt hot tears welling up in the corners of my eyes. It wasn’t fair! “You’re concerned about what research you can present from this dig, I’m sure. ‘Publish or Perish’ isn’t that the saying?” Lamier clapped me on the shoulder. “Well, no need to worry. Your cooperation today won’t be forgotten. Who knows? You might see renewed interest in your older publications. Maybe even a book deal! Who knows what your future might hold…”

‘If you keep your mouth shut.’ Although the threat was only implied, it came across crystal clear. Even so, a vague sense of calm flooded through me. I felt drunk, even a bit dizzy. Maybe this was the right thing to do, after all. Lamier would take care of everything. With his big, strong hands and wise eyes, he was a man to trust. Putting Subject C into the care of such a man should’ve been my idea all along…

Wait. This was all Lamier, I was sure of it. Somehow, he was manipulating my emotions. But there was a problem, a fly in the ointment, it had been in the paper he’d shown me…if only I could remember what it was… 

“How did you know?” I muttered under my breath.

“Hm?” Lamier turned around from where he’d been supervising the breakdown of my equipment. 

“In this paper you presented to the university, you provide a detailed description of her,” I pointed to the fanged, human-like skeleton on the middle table, “and yet no one outside of this dig should have had any idea that such a creature ever existed.”

Lamier crossed his arms. I couldn’t tell if he was pleased or disappointed. Behind him, my evidence was being carried away in waterproof boxes. We were alone. 

He took a step toward me, then another, until our noses were almost touching. His presence was even more intoxicating up close; it made me want to swoon like the protagonist of a Victorian novel. Stupid as it sounds, I fixated on his shiny black shoes. If I looked anyplace else, I felt sure I’d faint or be hypnotized or–

Lamier used two fingers to lift my chin up to meet his gaze. With horror, I realized his fingers had extended to almost twice the normal length. His face broke and shifted until I was looking at something with long incisors, apelike eyes, and moveable features–in short, something very much like Subject C.

It smiled.

spuh06,1,2022-02-11,Can I trust my friend?,EggoDonburi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/spuh06/can_i_trust_my_friend/,"Summary: A friend I met off of Tinder seems a bit weird and I can't tell if I can trust him. I don't know what to do.

I feel extremely torn right now. I (20F) met a guy (20M) on Tinder in late December and we’ve been talking pretty consistently since then. We don’t talk every day obv, but we talk a couple of times a week and I genuinely enjoy his company. He had a recent breakup so he and I clarified we should be strictly friends. That doesn’t matter, I’m okay with us being friends. The problem is not related to that. What bothers me about him is that a part of me is concerned about whether he is genuine or he could be trying to scam me in some way. My parents have even told me to distance myself from him, but I can't really take their words with that much weight because they've said the same thing about another friend I met on Bumble in the initial phases, but that friendship worked really well.

I don't want to just distance myself from him out of the blue because, as of now, he’s been an awesome person and he’s always very attentive and caring. I find it rare to find friends I connect with or enjoy their company and he's one of them, which is why I'm having such a hard time. He opened up to me about his relationship problems and he's always also been really supportive when I had my own problems, so I really appreciate this sort of thing. We can talk abt dumb shit and be goofy but then talk about serious stuff which is nice. 

I'm sorry if you read up until now lol. I will explain the red flags now. Basically, I'm worried if he's actually legit or he just wants to scam me or something of that sort. My parents always talk about online friendships that led to someone getting murdered or sex trafficked and it's really bothering me. Could it be happening to me? My mom told me that a girl had met an online friend and the two of them were best friends for around 6 months until the two went on a road trip and the friend left her at a bar as a prostitute. These stories are making me so anxious. Could it be happening to me?

These are the red flags that I've noticed so far

1. I thought everything was fine until we met up in person last week. He spent around $500 in shopping and he told me that it was a pretty small shopping spree (he does one of these roughly every month) and I thought it was very strange. Second, he insisted on paying for me which was also very surprising. Could it be that he was just being nice? Yes, which is why I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
2. He's always talking about cryptocurrency and NFTs, he's also told me that his friend earned around 120K from it. 
3. He seems to flex about his money a lot. Like I mentioned earlier, he wasted around $500 on the day we went out. THIS MAKES ME SO SUSPICIOUS. Out of all the things on this list, this was the biggest one. How does he have so much money? We're only college students and he's not some rich international student. He seems to have a house with his mom, but other than that, how? I worked a lot throughout university and for an undergrad, I earn a decent salary, but I would not be able to afford to spend that much money. I have asked him about it, but he told me that he got some of his money from working during his gap year. Now he also does investments in crypto and resells designer clothes. I just can't fathom how someone can spend so much money if they're just a college student. 
4. He goes to a different college than me (although it’s a pretty close distance), so I can’t confirm whether he ACTUALLY attends college. I have a bad memory so I can't be 100% sure I remember correctly, but I recall he'd told me that he would start a few classes in February, but now he told me he's not taking any classes. He's only doing job training I think.
5. I’ve also asked him about his classes but I don’t really understand what he’s doing if I’m quite honest because (1) I’m in a university (which is pretty different than college) and (2) my field and program are pretty different than his. 
6. His schedule seems super free despite him doing job training at his college and when I asked about his schedule last time (so we could plan a gym routine), he didn’t seem to want to send me his schedule. I was the only one who sent their schedule. He said his changes every week but Thursdays are the busiest for him. I consider my schedule to be a normal workload and I’ve even had some time to rest recently because I’m doing internships rather than taking a full class schedule (seems similar to what he says he does), but even then, I am pretty busy and I have to account for meetings and work hours. 
7. When we first matched we exchanged one or two messages before we switched to IG and I've heard some ppl say that that is a red flag (because they could be trying to get your info)
8. He was super attentive at the start (although it grew more normal after a week) and he always responds right away. I wonder why he's so free and I also wonder if this was love bombing?  
9. Social media: 
   1. He's always invisible on discord -  but he said he leaves it invisible so that he doesn't have to refuse his friends all the time cuz if he's not offline, he gets a ton of messages.
   2. He only has 190 followers on IG and follows around 350 people. He also rarely posts, since 2015 he only has around 5 posts, but he's said himself that he usually only posts once a year because he really can't be bothered. He has a few tagged pictures though (but most of them are from the same friend)
   3. He doesn't have FB because ""it's for boomers.""

He had asked me a few times to go to the gym with him, so I decided to give it a try and we'll likely see each other in person more consistently now. I'm not sure if this is good or bad. Am I overthinking this? What would you guys recommend I do? How can I confirm he's genuine? Do you guys get good vibes from this, or do you agree with my suspicions? 

Have any of you been in a similar situation and if you have, what did you do?"

I was curious if anyone has interned there before and how was their experience? 

This will be my first and last internship since I graduate in spring 23 and I’m hoping I can get a return offer. I’m nervous going into it because I don’t have experience with Java and just started to learn React which from my understanding are what most of their teams use. 

I appreciate any advice."

I've been accepted to my dream Ph.D. program in Informatics in Complex Networks and Systems with full funding guaranteed for 5 years + stipend, travel, and healthcare!

I've been so excited all day that I just keep reading my letter/packet to make sure it's real!

I'm a first-generation student who just finished my B.S. in Computer Science in Winter 2021.A little background (but not too much):

When I transferred to my unknown, no-name university for my undergrad I had an A.S. in general studies with a 2.9 GPA. Not great. I was still confused about what I wanted to do and transferred in at 26 years old. I decided I'd try Computer Science and convinced my best friend to do so as well. None of my family/friends were tech-savvy growing up and I didn't even know how to type. Right after signing up for university courses, I began using children's games to teach myself how to type properly (AT 26?!).

In my second semester, I met a professor who (for some reason I can't remember) I felt I should share I had thought about grad school but didn't feel that was an opportunity for me. I felt I was too old and not bright enough. I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was along the lines of ""You really want to? You should \*absolutely\* go to grad school. You would be fantastic!""

That was all I needed.

I completely changed my approach to university and graduated Magna Cum Laude with multiple prestigious internships in AI/ML/Space industry, and paper/presentations as the primary author. I helped found our research lab as there were no opportunities at my institution. When I learned Ph.D. programs wanted research experience, I created my own opportunity and found professors willing to work with me in a new lab. I'm currently teaching as an adjunct instructor at my university and will have taught 4 university courses before I start graduate school.

You might look at the last paragraph and think this is normal for graduate student applicants or you might think it's impressive. Whatever your opinion, I feel very average. I don't feel brighter than my peers (I often feel much less intelligent or capable than those around me - sometimes even my students ask me questions so far out in left-field I mini-panic haha). However, I made a goal, worked relentlessly at it, and met it. I know there's still a very long road ahead, but I feel like my hard work so far has paid off! All the sacrificed weekends, late nights, and free time. It was all worth it. And now I'm on to my next goal!

I feel so lucky and honored to start a Ph.D. program this Fall at my top choice! I'll be researching with professors I've been following for years.

The impostor syndrome has already set in. But I'm trying to trust that I've done enough to be in the position I've been given.

The most important thing from this story I think is that all it took was one moment of positive encouragement for me to completely turn myself around and shoot for the stars.

I wish you all the best of luck. I hope you all get accepted where you will grow most and be in the best position to meet your goals, whatever they may be! I wish you scholarships, funding, stipends, the works!

You guys are rock solid. I'm proud of you all for shooting to do something so incredibly difficult. For chasing your dreams. Whatever this cycle holds, don't give up! Remember to be kind and to give positive encouragement whenever you get the chance. It can literally change someone's life.

Anyway, thanks for reading, good luck!"
spxqy6,0,2022-02-11,What should I know and learn as a prospective CS Master's student in Germany in terms of finding a SWE job?,tractorred,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/spxqy6/what_should_i_know_and_learn_as_a_prospective_cs/,"I  graduated a few months ago from a Computer Science Bachelor's program (Top 10% of the class with DS, Algorithms, Internet Engineering,... A+) and currently work as a Research Assistant (which helped make sure I am not the type for academia!). I aim at applying for MS in CS in Germany for Fall 2022 and am seeking advice regarding what I should do to higher my chances of getting a job (both part-time during the study and later on full time). My main programming language is Python and I have previously worked with Django which was OK. Despite working with computers and especially Linux from a very young age my programming skills are not top-notch and I need to work on that.

In your opinion what should I focus on? How hard would it be to get a job having no previous work experience (two internships one NLP and the other InfoSec)? Generally, speaking what sort of stacks and skills are in demand in Germany? And should I prioritize learning German or could solely focus on sharpening my developing skills and sending out university applications before arriving in the country (I have not taken IELTS yet).

I also have an offer to work as a .NET developer but due to the popularity of Java for enterprise in Germany, I wonder whether it is better to work on learning more in-demand skills and stacks or go with .NET.

Thanks for reading and let me know if you think any other information would be beneficial for better answers. BTW, I would be a non-EU student."

spykas,582,2022-02-11,Please I need help. My family engaged me at 17 with 15 yo village girl who 's not studying anymore and I'm a 21 yo software engineer. I get so depressed while thinking about situation I'm in and feels like giving up [serious],terms-nd-conditions,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/spykas/please_i_need_help_my_family_engaged_me_at_17/,"hello everyone,

I'm in a complicated situation. please help me to deal with it. it's a long story..

    about me

I'm 21M. I come from slightly above poor class and I live with big joint happy family. my father is farmer and my whole family worked hard for paying my college fees. Currently I'm in my last semester of bachelor with computer science and recently got my first internship + job offer. it made me, my parents and family so happy. I'm currently highest earning member in my family)

&amp;#x200B;

    culture

In the area where I live, most boys and girls gets engaged by around 12-18 and married by 20-22. so when I finished my 10th(when I was 15) my family decided to make engagement of me , I was studying in another town that time(in hostel) so I denied them but when I finished 12th they all told me that why is it so important to do engagement right now  or else they wont be able to find good girl for me later. (they all think it's their responsibility to find a girl for me, tbh I can't blame my parents but it's whole culture in my area) and also they gave me example of few boys which couldn't got married and are at age 25-30 (those boys didn't studied well, or with not good family reputation and most doing labor work while I was bit brilliant student compared to them, but still idk my family would compare me with them and tell me I would stay unmarried like them) and I was really stupid that time(at age 17)

&amp;#x200B;

    engagement

they somehow convinced me for engagement and I got engaged with girl from near village.  Let's name her ""A"" . A's father is also farmer with slightly above poor class background. it's been almost 4 years of my engagement  and yet I've not seen her properly in real life. Never talked with her in my life. she was like 15 at my engagement, and failed in 10th that time(but my parents told me it's okay because they used to think ""the girl who study more, will not behave with me and won't do any chores or work"", another reason they were okay with that because they were not sure if I'll get a good job after finishing my studies or end up like my older brothers from my family who finished their colleges but still doing farming and labor work.

A's not studying since she failed 10th(it's been almost 4 years), which is normal around my area many girls don't study after 8th or 10th. now situation are getting better in my area girls going to study in another town, but we're still far behind.

&amp;#x200B;

    problems

I was so foolish that time, but from past few months I've realized that my engagement was a huge mistake. I'm a software engineer so I'll need to move to Bangalore in a year or two for better opportunities. I don't want to live here. I even want to get job abroad if I get chance in future. but she cant even read English, idk if she's able to write even Hindi because primary school sucks where I live. Teachers do their own things and don't take class properly. my father sent me to good schools by paying fees that's why I was able to achieve good job.

&amp;#x200B;

Most relatives of mine are farmers and below middle class background and it was a very hot topic in my village and relatives when I got my job and also there's good reputation of my father in my village. and there's one more fact that's related to my story is my aunt(sister of my father) has a little girl, she's  like 12. Let's name her ""B""(my sister cousin), my aunt engaged ""B"" to the little brother of ""A"".  each family is happy with each other and have good relation but I've been so worried about my future and if's she's the one for me. I can think of two ways right now:

* If somehow A could study more, can get developed mentally, I start talking with her and we get along with each other. but I'll have to compromise and there's only if she could pass 10th and 12th. Sometimes I even thought if she clear her basic qualification like till 12th, I'd make her to go college after marrying, so she can get developed mentally and know English and basic stuff. so we both get along with each other well. and every family stays happy. Can we stay happy like this?
* I tell my parents to break the engagement. but it'll make everyone sad and everyone's gonna so surprised. I don't even know if my parents would agree to that. that decision will/might create another problems like:

1. it'll put my father's reputation down in my village (my father actively leads/participates many events in village. and I think he won't be able to go in events if I break engagement, he will not be happy)
2. I love my aunt and she's really sweet but she won't be happy. it might create problem for her daughter(my little cousin) ""B"" in future cause she's engaged to ""A""s brother.
3. I'm not sure what will happen to ""A"" if I break the engagement, I'll make her sad. and her father will have to find another boy for her. ( her family and everyone else gonna think I got good job so I left her, which is somewhat true. but they did nothing wrong tho, I blame the old culture for everything.

while I'm in this situation, my college friends are dating and having fun. I feel sad and so unfair. I get FOMO of dating culture, my college friends don't know I'm engaged. but I can't date any other girl while being engaged, which will be like cheating to ""A"" even tho I've never talked to her in my life. I always acted strong with my friends that all dating and stuff is waste of time but all time but inside me I was wishing if I was born in big city and try dating by myself. wish I had life like them. I Just want to travel and explore.

I know dating is not easy as it seems but I feel like I should be getting chance to explore by myself Idk. I'm average looking guy and really skinny but I've started working on myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm crying at nights while thinking about it and I feel stupid about realising so late. I honestly don't know what to do. Sorry for long post. Thanks for reading it and you can ask questions in comments if you have confusion about anything.

Please suggest what should do in this situation?

sq155i,1,2022-02-11,Is it too late to call my doctor about her intern making me uncomfortable?,openskies1111,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sq155i/is_it_too_late_to_call_my_doctor_about_her_intern/,"It's been 5 days since my appointment. I didn't call because I'm nervous and also I've been busy.

Story:

I'm female intern is female. I went to doctor for throat issue. Intern was there who is shadowing my doctor. She said open your mouth to me. I did. She said no open wider. I did. She said ""no wider"". I opened as far as my mouth allowed and I experienced pain because it was past my jaw and mouth allow. So she still says ""you're not opening all the way you need to open all the way"" with a slight annoyed tone of voice. 

Then doctor left room for 20 seconds. Intern says to me ""I don't understand why you're not opening your mouth all the way you're making it difficult for me for no reason"" with an annoyed tone of voice. I said ""I'm opening as far as I can"" she says ""you need to open all the way"" again annoyed tone of voice.

Doctor comes back. Intern says open again then proceeds to tell me ""no open wider why aren't you opening all the way"" and then gives up finally talks about my throat issue with doc. Doc leaves says have a nice day. I say have a nice day to assistant she looks at me eyes to eyes and says nothing dead look in her eyes it was weird.


It's been 5 days now is that too late to call? The thing is the intern will be there on my next visit in 10 days so I'm really nervous about dealing with the woman again. I know she's inexperienced but she gave me an attitude and she kept telling me open wider after I did open as far as I could to the point my jaw hurt that day and now I still have scabs on the sides of my mouth since then because I opened past my mouth would allow.

Should I still call? Is it too late since it's 5 days ago? I was just going to tell her the intern made me uncomfortable and tell her what she said to me when she left the room but not sure if it's too late to call. Thanks so much"

On the other hand, I’ve read books and written few projects in the realm of systems programming in rust and cpp because any upcoming potential internships I have lined up are in something related to systems programming. 

My overall question is this:
My real interest and the interest of my mentor are in cloud architecture and cloud design. I thought initially full stack would be a good way to get in but I know also that working with vms in the cloud is something that can go hand in hand with systems development. Which of my two paths do you think would be best to invest in to take the next step towards cloud?"

I’m also minoring in PPE (politics, philosophy, and economics). Right now I’m on the hunt for a summer internship and I’m thankful that I’ve been able to have interviews with some companies.

The only problem is, all of these interviews have been for store manager roles at various grocery chains and retail stores. I feel like I can do more than be a store manager, also I feel as if anyone can be a store manger without a college degree if they really work towards that. 

Was anyone in this position while looking for a job after college or have advice on how to navigate my internship/job search? I don’t want to feel stuck in a store manger position working long hours for minimal pay.

If you were a store manager have you been able to move up through your company to higher paying positions?

Thank you for any advice and feedback!"

sq567v,0,2022-02-11,LOOKING FOR ADVICE,beast22mz,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sq567v/looking_for_advice/,"Hello guys. I am looking for advise, I am going to type my whole backstory now :

So basically I'm from South Africa (anyone from anywhere can reply but if b there are some SA people here it would be a tremendous help)

I did Information Technology in high school (small bit of Java) 
I was at a university and basically got excluded, at that university I did 1st year computer Science and we did c#

I then went to either university and I finally managed to complete the computer science bachelors degree last year (waiting for the papee now) and honestly because of the way the course was structured and it being a new university, I feel like I'm inadequate to go  into the working space... I've been applying to jobs though...

Basically from what I've seen is that at that university it seems like things that I did in my first 3rd year, the other university i was at prior did that in their second year so just to give you maybe an idea... We basically only did c++ and there were even things skipped due to covid and also lectures fighting students etc etc... Anyway... I do feel I'm inadequate and need advise... I've been looking at what the market seems to want and it seems Java is very popular, python and c# but also more so these frameworks such as react, node, angular etc etc which I'm not too sure what EXACTLY they are, I think its just a platform and frameworks used to make specific things but Id assume Java is Java etc... So I only can confidently say I know c++ and not the most advanced things that when you look on YouTube for help sometimes people would show things I don't know and if I'm being honest it makes me feel like shit.. I haven't done java in years and even so it was mostly the basics and also c# was not the most advanced things I would say, it was a lot of GUI work though, and I don't know python 

Anyway it also seems like html css and javascript are quite popular in the market and at the moment I'm trying to learn html(YouTube) ... It will take some time though.. I was thinking of doing  a java course but those things are super expensive just for the basics etc though i need a refresh so i will just use YouTube..


Next to the computer science major is a math major but I really dont see just as one because it was hell and i barley scraped through for maths... 
In terms of honours I don't think i want to do honours yet... 

After reading all that thank you that you took the time..  I need some advise... 

By the way I'm 23... I would say I'm still fairly young but I need to get a job, I don't want to be a burden on my mom as she is actually already 60... I do understand that starting out with an internship I'll probably only  get around 6k-10k which isnt much to probably live fully independently, it could be depending on where and how you live but nonetheless... 

Also I am not being allowed to look for jobs in gauteng even though that's where most of the jobs in the field is... Western cape is okay though... 


(I know right,I'm 23, but it is what it is) ..

From the Northern Cape.."

The HR asked me to send them the links to my projects. 

But my projects (web applications) are on localhost, as far as i think. I'm good at coding; not so much in other tech things. 
What i mean is that the web application can only be opened from my laptop. 

All i can think of is that if my project is in Netbeans, then i should upload it to Github.

I've been a software engineer intern since July 2021. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in August 2021 and I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree that I will finish in December of this year. I take 2 classes a semester so the workload for school is not bad at all, I've always worked around 40 hours a week plus taken much tougher courses during my undergrad while maintaining a decent gpa. I have a strong work ethic and working 40 hours a week while being a student does not phase me. 

I'm here looking for advice on my job situation. I've been an intern since July but my internship isn't your typical internship where I shadow another engineer, work 20 hours a week, ends in 12 weeks or some other timeline, sit around doing work that isn't all that important, etc. My internship is more along the lines of you have the responsibilities of a full time engineer, you work full time hours, you represent the company as an engineer, but you're labeled as an intern and get paid like one too. My days consists of development, emails, team meetings, field work, presentations, customer calls, meetings with other companies, you name it. 

I know I'm a very hard worker and I get shit done, my bosses like me and everyone tells me that they're impressed with my work. They've hinted at hiring me once I graduate with my Master's on many different occasions, but I don't think I can take this anymore. I work my ass off day in and day out, am the sole developer on a project that we're pushing, come home to do more work for school, and yet I'm getting paid $20 an hour while everyone at my company is getting paid more than me. I enjoy my job, I enjoy my team but I can't help but feel disrespected in terms of my pay compensation when I know how much work I do and my superiors know how much work I do as well. I guess the advice I'm looking for is should I confront my manager about this with no offer from another company in hand or should I apply to other places, wait to get an offer and then have a conversation? 

My boss is the type of guy to give me an $80,000 salary to stay if I showed him I got an offer for $70,000. I have applied to some positions elsewhere these past few weeks and have already spoken to many representatives from each company about setting up an interview. I guess I'm here to ask everyone, in my situation is it really necessary to go out of my way to get another position at a different company first to force my manager's hand? Or do you think this could come back to bite me in the ass in terms of my future with the company and the relationships I have with my superiors? 

Any help would greatly be appreciated, especially from those who have faced similar situations.


TL;DR
Software Engineer Intern with Bachelor's and in pursuit of Master's, full time hours, full time engineer responsibilities, still an ""intern"". Talk to my manager or get an offer from another company and then talk to my manager?"

sq9ku4,16,2022-02-11,The Ideal Employer and You,FirebirdWriter,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq9ku4/the_ideal_employer_and_you/,"This post originally was a comment in a thread where the OP was discriminated against for their PTSD and outed to the office. I found some of their comment and the replies reminding me of the best boss I had and some of what made me approach employment as I do. I am an employer via a contracting agency for a caregiver and I have taken these lessons to heart. To the point I am currently without care because the agency was being abusive to the caregivers and when I pushed back chose to be abusive to me. The comment does delve into PTSD as an experience but I had a request to make this it's own post. So any specifics for You are left in but this is the context for that reason. 


I am going to tell you how this is supposed to go. I have CPTSD so bad I cannot work but I did try. Got myself a law degree, criminal law because dumbass young me hoped it would help me live if I put bad people away. Not at all the reality of the system. Both because you need a certain amount of experience in private practice here and because your client is either guilty or an innocent person who's life is in jeopardy if you lose. 

My boss was one of the founding partners. The other original partner mostly didn't come in because they had health issues. I thought it odd how everyone was nice about that because I was raised by terrible people. CPTSD probably spoiled that. This man was amazing. In our internship interviews he was excited when I asked questions that most places would toss my application for like, ""In ten years you have taken 0 female internships. Before that it's sporadic at best. Why?"" He answered them. ""Most of your female classmates are relying on being pretty to get verdicts. I see if every day in court and in mock trials. This is a fast way to sabotage your career and your client."" Which is something I agree with. I am autistic so I never considered this an option. ""You guarantee a loss on appeal."" 

I got the internship. The firm accomodated my ridiculous allergies. I am allergic to entire food groups so this was something. The firm had a no parfume rule so clients with sensitivities didn't have to ask for us to allow them to breathe. We had a few long hour problems still because of the industry but if there was a way to accommodate needs vs industry they did it. Including a food stipend, company rides to and from home and court, and more. The billable pricing covered all of this btw. My pay was also above standard for the internship and later full job. 

I managed to mask my issues for a few years but some other stuff happened and I started having what I call social stress fractures. The end of my legal career was not what I dreamed. I wanted to be a supreme court justice tbh but would have settled for being a bad ass judge doing it right. Not meant to be. We had an accused serial rapist come in. He insisted on a female lawyer. The best. He tried a lot of intimidation tactics with me. After about half an hour I stood up and told the senior associate who oversaw me, ""This man is a monster and I refuse him as my client."" Dude grabbed my arm and I punched him in the face. He even told us he did it but sadly I couldn't do shit about that because of the laws protecting people. I agree these laws are necessary but oh I wanted more. 

I told the shocked senior I would be in the lounge. I expected to get fired. I had assaulted a client. I wasn't. My boss, the partner, came in and asked me to come to his office because it's more private. I had already packed my stuff so grabbed the box. He said nothing until we got to his office. 

""Firebird, are you alright?"" As soon as I sat in the chair across from his desk this was what he said. I had disclosed some ADA covered stuff but not my PTSD. ""I know you have to fire me. He put his hands on me and I couldn't think."" ""We refused him as a client and suggested (competitor with high loss rate)."" I went silent because I had no script for this. I am autistic and have scripts for speaking or cannot. I had practiced for firing not ""We don't want his unsafe ass."" 

The conversation is burned into my memory because it is one of the first examples of compassion I ever experienced. I admit I cry thinking about this and I am the stoic autistic. We talked for a while. Now our benefits were full. Including mental health. This is honestly not optional for me if I were to ever return to practice. Law is a horrible field for mental wellness. My boss knew that. ""I noticed some symptoms of PTSD with you lately. Ever since November. I am worried about you. You're not fired but I am suspending you with pay until you see a therapist. I see this woman. She specializes in PTSD."" My boss told me about his experiences with PTSD as a veteran and how he had noticed specific coping skills. The interviews were always recorded and he showed me how I looked punching this man. There was a moment where I wasn't stoic. I wasn't home as it were. Pupils fully dialated, long pause I don't remember between punch, some changes to body language. It was clearly a flashback my brain edited out. I have been filmed with them since so I didn't understand that then. 

Over the next few months I got treatment. For the first time. I wasn't focused on recovery at first because again raised by bad people. After six months I realized I couldn't be a lawyer. No field I was qualified for was safe. I went through another Novembers. This is one of my windows of debilitating PTSD. It's guaranteed. It also actually goes past November and begins in September but the true debilitation is then as is the primary incident. There's smaller ones in that window. I am not able to go out of my house and do things for November to optionally be okay. I went to my boss and asked him if I could work in the mailroom. He said no. He said he had been expecting this because he had been visiting me weekly. He would bring a meal and we would talk. His wife would sometimes cook and loved having me over. He saw me smile for the first time about a week before this. This was when he knew. 

So he talked to me about disability. For mental health its super hard to get but my therapist and I had also considered it. He told me I would be paid and keep my benefits for the next two months, then he would assist me as needed while I applied. He even wrote a letter describing the effect on me. This is a huge factor in my getting SSI. We stayed friends for a long time. Now I know he went what feels above and beyond but he didn't. He refused my gratitude because he didn't see workers as cogs in a machine but as important assets to be nurtured and people. All those benefits made this firm the absolutely best in the state. If you're in trouble? You want them. 

He died a while ago. His wife went a good five years after and that was when he retired. This man was everything a boss should be. None of my colleagues knew about my PTSD. They just knew I took personal time. HR knew because of the legal protections and my work did try to accommodate my needs. It was just my needs included somethings that conflict directly with work. When I got shot and my second brain injury and disappeared for a year because I was shot in the face and not okay he had spent time looking for me every week. He also helped me navigate my options for justice. We disagreed on my decision but there wasn't enough evidence because the cops and ambulance never came. We had a year old crime scene and what amounts to heresay with a few bad witnesses. Bad as in optics for court not bad people. 

Everyone deserves a boss like this. If they are violating your rights which if you're in the US did indeed occur (get a lawyer) they don't deserve you as a worker. When I tried working outside the law field to see if a less stressful job would be okay? He said ""Remember, the business needs you. You might need food and pay but don't settle for anything less than you deserve."" 

He was there for all of the workers like this. One of my colleagues had a miscarriage at work. She also had leave for as long as she needed. No end date given. Yes this was part of the policies but a business should defer to your needs. If you are good at your job and bringing in money? You absolutely should have dignity. My old boss was an idealistic man. As a realist this is hard to find but the revolution we are seeking depends on not settling."

Last year I've started my second year of education in IT, with my first year learning programming at collage without much success, Now I've found my passion with system administration, and I have been working an MSP internship for almost 6 months now where I work 32 hours a week. Its a L1 helpdesk. School only makes up 20% of this education that should take 3 years total to complete.

The internships consists of basic end user support with microsoft office or locked accounts in the active directory, most other issues i have to escalate to the L2 administrators. Occasionally I get an issue where I learn something new but they are not frequent.

I've been enjoying myself and learning alot, but there a couple things that have been on my mind. I have a passion for networking and Linux and spend most of my free time exploring these subjects. But my internship and school are Microsoft oriented, and probably wont touch any Linux systems there. I am hungry to learn more about networking and Linux.

There are networking classes at school but they only touch the basics for CCNA, where I do practical exercises in packet tracer but wont touch much of the theory, There is progress but its been going slow, where one day is enough to cover a weeks worth of homework. my internship is an official HP partner so if i want to do networking there, there is a high chance its going to be Aruba.

On the Linux side its basically just home projects where I've been daily driving Linux for the past year or 2 and experimenting with Prometheus and Grafana, or anything else that peaks my interest. But no progress towards formal education or certificates. At my job Linux administration is basically out of the question. The only scenario where I would encounter Linux in the future, is when there is an issues in a vmware eSXI environment.

I want to learn more, I understand that you need to start at the basics. I am only 19 years old and still have the world at my feet. I want to know what to aim for and where to focus my studies on. Is it worth my time looking for a job that offers more chances with networking and Linux? Are there any certificates I should pay attention to and work towards. I am scared of being stuck as an L1 for the next 2,5 years and not working towards my passions.

Thank you for taking your time to read all this,

TL:DR : recently started an education in system administration but internship doesn't give the opportunity to learn any networking and Linux skills. what options should I consider."
sqb9ww,137,2022-02-11,encouragement from a second semester senior,buprestibae,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/sqb9ww/encouragement_from_a_second_semester_senior/,"hi r/cornell, 

i just wanted to share my journey a little bit with y'all for folks to see it really does get better

\- came in from a tiny high school w/ virtually no stem preparation, never had AP classes or anything (majoring in bio) 

\- immediately felt out of my depth, panic attacks and major depression made me miss lots of class freshmen and sophomore year, 2070 made me quite literally suicidal and i had to withdraw or else i would've failed

\- slowly picked myself up, retook chem summer after sophomore year (1st COVID year for me lol) 

\- got involved in research, rediscovered my passion for my field, learned better time management (with lots of trial and error and tears) 

fast forward to now: i've submitted a paper to a journal, will be presenting at a conference, and just received an internship offer i was really gunning for. 

if you had told me two years ago i'd be in this position, i would have NEVER believed you

this is all to say: 

YOU GOT THIS!  YOU ARE SMART AND CAPABLE OF MORE THAN YOU KNOW! 

I BELIEVE IN YOU!"

I live and go to university in ohio and I just recently accepted an internship in Texas for the summer. 

I was thinking and realized that I’ve been getting my adderall prescription from the same pharmacy for 2 years but now I might have to switch. 

Has anyone ever dealt with something similar? Going away for awhile and having to get your prescription filled in another state? I understand there’s laws and stuff outlining this but it seems like there’s always gray areas in the rules and I just wanted to hear someone else’s experience w this. 

Lol I’m kinda expecting this to be a pain in my butt but that’s why I’m trying to address it now while I have some time. 

Stories / tips would be greatly appreciated!!!

Thank you:)"

I am looking forward to intern in the bay area and want to ask if you could recommend me any website where I can look up internship offers from company's, like LinkedIn, Craigslist, indeed... 

Happy to get some further sites as I couldn't find that much companies that offer J1 internships. 

I am studying cyber security in Germany will be for the fall semester in San Diego and would be happy to work for around 3 months from January 2023. If your company offers such positions I would also very happy if you could name your company.

NYU Tandon MFE vs Columbia University MFE,LucielSeven,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/sqeaus/help_nyu_tandon_mfe_vs_columbia_university_mfe/,"I got accepted into both NYU Tandon MFE (2 year program, they offered $5k scholarship per year) and Columbia University MFE (3 semester long program) for Fall 2022 and have trouble deciding. I am an international student who graduated from an undergraduate program from a non-target state university, with a double degree in Applied Mathematics and Corporate Finance, along with a statistics minor. 

My experience with programming is limited to introductory courses and online certifications (MIT intro to Python certification, Udacity Neural Network certifications, etc) and have 0 internship experience.

I want to work in NYC after I graduate, and would love to hear what you guys think would be the better school for my case (cost isn't an issue).

Thank you for all advice in advance!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. **Honors English 9/AP English Lang Teacher:** She's my favorite teacher of all time. She was my teacher for 9th grade and 11th grade, and she and I relate to each other a lot. She see's herself in me, and I in her so she was really really happy to write me recommendations for every school I applied to. She talked about my mental health and how I've been really passionate about helping out people since I first entered her class. (10/10)
2. **Honors Chemistry/AP Chemistry Teacher:** He's the teacher that helped me get mental support during Sophomore year. He has always tried to help me whether it's with school or my personal life. He and I have similar struggles, and since I'm in his AP class right now, we get to talk all the time and it makes the class super fun despite it being my least favorite class. He talked about my struggles for sure, but he told me he also mentioned how curious I always am about chemical properties and, well, everything. (10/10)
3. **School Counselor:** I was fortunate enough to be really close with my counselor, and he helped me with getting me out of a really abusive situation. He has always wanted me to go far, and has always encouraged me to continue challenging myself to prove to myself that I can always make it through regardless of if I think I can't. I'm pretty sure he talked about my mental health, but I'm not sure what else. (8/10)

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

JHU asked for one essay, and it was honestly terrifying, but it turned out to be the best essay I had ever written throughout the entire college application process. I'm not saying that just because I got in, but because I genuinely did so much research and revisions on it. It was truly my favorite essay. I spent 3 weeks working on it, 2-3 hours a day, and I wrote about why art history is so important to me and exactly how I would utilize every resource that JHU offers so that I can truly get the most out of the school. I also included additional information about my mental health (because I really wanted to stress how deeply it has affected me and how much I care about helping other people find resources like I did) and the context of my high school (low income so my school doesn't really offer a lot of extracurriculars like competitions or hackathons and stuff so I had to look for create opportunities for myself; I also wanted to stress that my EC's weren't done because I wanted to look good for a school, but because I genuinely do care about helping other people, despite how 'cliche' that might sound). 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Johns Hopkins University (ED II)

*Rejections:*

* Stanford University (REA)

**Additional Information:**

I honestly never thought I would apply to JHU this year because of how heavy it is with the Pre-Med track and I rlly wanted to avoid that (I'm there for the research opportunities). I applied to JHU because of some...drama, but it was always a dream when I was younger that I abandoned after some...childhood trauma...Anyways, I'm glad my dream was reignited, because I found passion in JHU that wasn't centered on Medicine, and I found myself loving the school and everything about it. I'm so incredibly happy about this opportunity. I still can't believe it. :)"

So I learnt how to code like general coding , like build a GPA Calculator or a Youtube Playlsit Downloader or a Guessing Game kinda stuff. I can use languages like [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) ( It was the language of my first computer science course ),  MATLAB ( I am an engineering student , It's a need to know issue ) and python ( Learnt that on my own ) . Now I'm faced with this problem; I've been learning web development for months now and I do not hate it , I like it but not with a burning passion or desire but I have a huuuggeee desire to learn Robotics with python plus I would like to once again point out I'm an engineering major and It'll be a huge boost to my career after graduation. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS , I NEEEEEED to get a job to support my family and coding is like my only Major skill . Should I continue learning Web Development So that I can help my family and myself ( There is a huge Job market for both frontend and backend , like alot of engineering and CS majors in my school have jobs as web developers ) ORRR I Should just learn Robotics with python. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its like I NEED Money but there is also Like PASSION for the thing I want to learn and NO There are no Robotics Internships Available Near ME .

Hopefully more are on the way, but I'm very glad to know the last year of effort is leading to the outcome I wanted.

This is a long one, sorry xD

I'm a senior UG Information Technology student and I have completed Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) (9/10.0) and Java (9/10.0) as a course requirement from my undergraduate. My main language in all my internships and in my projects has been Python. I even mentioned in my SOP that I helped build an open source python package as a part of my internship. I still got the following contingency form.

""We have noted in your application packet you do not have sufficient prior experience in Algorithms and Data Structures, as well as Java and Python programming... ... Because of this, you are required to take the following bridge courses before beginning the core courses of the program (lists 3 courses and equivalent online options)""

It is possible that they missed these courses in my official transcript / misconstrued the names since it's from an Indian university? I'm still waiting to hear back from other unis, but should i write to the grad adm office anyway?"

I haven’t had a real job at a company with a real salary, ever, since I have interned in my life, paid internships or worked for myself. However I’ve gone to 2 universities and gained a lot of experience working for myself, and freelancing.

Today they hired me on the spot and asked me “did you think about how much You want to be paid?” I said I didn’t think about it. He took the opportunity to say what he wanted to pay me and that if he’d give me a raise that he would come to tell me, implying I wouldn’t ask him.

Now that I’m home I see that it’s on the low end, they want to pay me lower than stated on the job posting on my school website.

The one skill I lack is photoshop, but I have everything else. Having been on the creative industry my whole life, I am used to doing a ton of free work and trade work.

I got my shit together and now planning to graduate in Fall 2022 by taking 5 courses each semester including Spring 2022. 

I applied for a TA/mentor for an upper division CS  elective and got accepted. For some reason, I thought that I can use this to complete the upper division elective requirement and I get paid for it. I can't because I am a TA and not a student.

As a TA/mentor, I will be teaching and assisting Python and basic computer networks to k-12 teachers in my city. This job seems interesting, I am working with a professor in a university, and I am actually *teaching* teachers. I might even get a good recommendation from the professor in the future for work or internships. 

On the flip side, I don't have CS work experience or internships. I am a grader for one the classes I took last semester. I currently work as a coding instructor at a virtual camp for children (2 hrs a week) for over a year. Prior to that, I was an English tutor in the college tutoring center. 

This new job is different from other experiences and actually has some unique responsibilities. On the other side, I will be doing the same tutoring job again. I don't want to be an instructor in the future. I don't know if this will impact my internship applications. 

Should I take this job or ignore it?"
sqk8cz,1,2022-02-12,Life fucking sucks.,GaryCUP,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/sqk8cz/life_fucking_sucks/,"You know what truly sucks? Life, and generational poverty.

I grew up in the ghetto. I did everything I was supposed to do to ""make it out"". I graduated high school and got my degree.

I surely thought that with my Computer Science degree, the offers would be pouring in ( such in demand, they say). I was fucking wrong. It's been almost 5 years, hundreds of applications, and not a single call back. Just about everyone I graduated university with is doing pretty well in life. Hell, most of the local drug dealers are doing better than I am.

The infinite loop of poverty never ends. You can't afford to move because you're broke, and have no car. Yet, no jobs around you pay enough for you to afford to move. Most people just ask relatives, but when your family is poor....

Maybe I should have done more side projects in college, or an internship. Maybe I shouldn't have racked up so much debt. Maybe no matter how much I try, I'll forever just be another statistic.

This game is rigged."

Letters of Recommendation 

Counselor (Class Teacher): 9/10
Okay, so we are allowed to see and edit the LORs that our teachers write. From the start the LOR was great but due to it being a new school all teachers know about us is through an online medium and not our actual personality. I had known this teacher quite. well and although she never taught us a subject she was a great guide and mentor and I used to participate in her classes like the assembly kind of thing in the morning. OG letter was a 7/10 which I changed and added some stuff making it a 9/10 

Chemistry teacher/Mentor 8/10: 
I had a good relationship with this teacher too since the start. During our 1 on 1 session, she was nice and knew the process cause her older students, our seniors, had gone out too so she helped quite a bit in the process. I've made sure to participate and kiss ass where I had to because of the new school. Also, best chemistry teacher with an infinite amount of patience. 

History/Civics teacher 9/10:
So this teacher had been teaching me the subject for 4 years from 7th to 10th and had helped me through tough times. She contributed a lot to who I am as a person today, her method of teaching was just so amazing and the effort she went into before each class made me have a large amount of respect for her. We've had many debates and discussions related to things in our history and I felt at ease with this person. She guided me throughout such that I didn't make the same mistakes as others and I may have been one of her favorite students(Haha) umm but yeah. Although people from my previous school never apply outside...me being an exception, it was her first-time ver writing a LOR and after a few edits from my end, it was quite good. 



Interviews 

Dartmouth 9/10
Went pretty awesome..had an alumnus interviewing me, we bonded together quickly and It felt like I was pushing all the right buttons. In the end, she said that I would be an excellent candidate for the class of 2026. 

University of Rochester 9/10
I had a neuroscience Ph.D. who is currently researching at Stanford. I vibed well with her and in the interview did a bit more talking than before. Talked about why the U of R would be the best fit for me, why research is important to me because I've learned science for so long without actually doing the real thing that I started to lose my interest in it but regained it after attending a paid lab workshop at the nearby Virology institute where we did things like PCR, electrogelporosis and BLAST sequence and knew that this is what I wanted a fond experience of. Again pushed all the right buttons and at the end she said and I quote,"" I am going to make sure the admissions committee knows about you in detail because based on the last 30 minutes I would only want you at Rochester"". To which I almost cried because I had never been given a compliment or appreciated like this by anyone so yeah, she pressed all the right buttons hahaha. (Indian/Asian Kids do yall relate?)

sqnqvs,3,2022-02-12,My life is in shambles,bubbahelt3,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/sqnqvs/my_life_is_in_shambles/,"My life has just gone to shit since Thanksgiving. A few days before, my gf of almost 11 months broke up with me. She said it was for reasons that I thought we had already gotten over about a month or two into us dating. I was heartbroken but asked if we could remain friends. She agreed at first but now she doesn’t even respond with more than one or two words begrudging responses. It just hurts. I thought I finally found someone who I could trust with everything and loved more than the world, and she left over petty shit. 
This was just the start of my bad luck though. Following the break up, I was kicked out of college. My grades weren’t the best but I thought I still had one chance. Later that week I was heading to a friends house (from college so a 2 hour drive) when my tire blew on the highway. I sat for 2 hours waiting for AAA to come change my tire for me cuz my jack was broke. 
I managed to get through to the new year and about a week before I went back out to college, (I have a house out there I stay at with friends that’s already paid for) I got back in touch with my ex best friend. He had turned into a toxic Christian (I’m non religious) and I had cut off ties. I was hoping to see he had changed and go back to our friendship but I just don’t feel the same connection. He seems to have moved on with life. I also had a friend I disc goofed with a lot back home but he is going to do an internship over the summer so I won’t get to see him. I’ve lost everything I had to keep me going with the exception of one good friend back home, but it’s just not enough. 
I don’t know what to do going forward. Every time I think about summer, I get really depressed and just think I should kill myself before I get there. I have some friends at college but they have started to work the night shift so I won’t get to see them. Those who haven’t usually would be hanging out with me for 3 hours and then go to bed cuz they have classes. I’ve had suicidal thoughts for most of my life, but never have I so strongly considered it. My life is in shambles and I really don’t think I can go on."

I am a final year Computer science student. I got internship through on campus. It is a 1 year internship. In that I get work on springboot java frameworks. Firstly I didn't know about the java. But I try hard to do my assigned work. I get difficulty many times understanding the basic flow of code. My mentor also told me that your basic is weak. Now assigned work deadline date I missed 3 times. I am getting pressure. I think my basic is not good. I want to give some time to learn Java. 


I should make my understanding of code good I should give time. But the full time as a intern I didn't get much time. I also want to prepare for a good opportunity role. I didn't get managed to complete my academics. In a pandemic 2 years I really read nothing. I just wasted my time. I didn't have enough clearity about the basic.

Now i think they will make me leave as I didn't perform good. It is paid internship. I already missed given time 3 times. Now this thing are involved with the HR. They told me to give final demo of work. I almost completed work but only the testing part is not according to their code requirement. 

Recently, I had break-up. I really feel messed my life. Cause I was a simple career goal oriented girl. I never want to get in a relationship. I did. I trusted most. From that time I didnt feel good. Also now my internship related matter is reached to the HR.

If they dismissed it will be good impression if I apply in for future company."

I'm currently an Applied Mathematics student in France, I'm in my 4th year of studies (1 year to go until I have my Masters). 

My goal is to become a semi-systematic/quant trader at a bank or trading firm. Those types of work are hard to get as my school is a semi-target. A lot of alumni of my Masters continue their studies in European targets to get those jobs, and that's also my plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to do a short (3 months) internship this summer, and I was wondering what kind of internship would help me become an attractive candidate in the future for those kinds of job.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I have those opportunities:

\- Software Engineering Intern at Atos, I would work in Java on the back-end of a defense software. I would optimize the code and make it run as fast as possible. It's a big team with a pretty cool environment.

\- Machine Learning research assistant in a lab. I am still not sure of the topic, but it's either Time Series or Computer Vision. It's a well respected lab and I find the topics interesting.

\- Developer at the national power grid agency, I would work in R to improve the analysis of data coming from the power markets in France and Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of internship would be the most appropriate for my career plans ?"

The company is small and is looking for the three skills I posted above plus c#,  and otherstuff. They are looking for new grads and intern positions.

I wamt to apply but I'm not sure if I should also include that I too would like an unpaid intern position if possible. Not sure how good of an idea that is.

sqtuck,187,2022-02-12,parents treating me like a child at 23 years old,gonpachiroro,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/sqtuck/parents_treating_me_like_a_child_at_23_years_old/,"tldr: im a 23F but im still being treated like a child by my parents. 

just a bit of context, bc of parents’ belief that getting a good job starts from getting good grades, my life was all about studying and tuition. since it’s only about acads, ive never had any form of part time jobs. however, bc of that my parents think im sheltered and too naive to deal w the real world (whose fault i wonder).

now at 23, im still treated like a sec sch kid:
- curfew at 1030pm
- not allowed to go for sleepover/ chalet even if they’re all girls 
- not allowed to go to bf house even during the day 
- cannot go out too many times a week 

bc im alr graduating from uni, coupled with the fact that covid robbed me of an exchange experience, i rly want to have a grad trip before i start work proper. 

so i asked my parents if i could go overseas in dec during my winter break to find my bf (we’re in ldr). took a lot of tries before they finally said yes. then they asked me how long im going for. me being dumb, said 6 weeks since that was how long my winter break was and i wasn’t going to do internships or part times. unfortunately they flew into a rage and asked me why i was so desperate and don’t know how to self love- they think all men want one thing only, and im just readily giving myself away. this is despite the fact that my bf and i have been together for 2 years at that point and spent one year doing non-ldr, so we’re pretty stable and it is definitely not a fling. 

so i asked them how long i can go for since we’re going by their standards anyway. they didn’t want to tell me bc i was supposed to feel for myself how long i can go for. they also scorned me for even raising up 6 weeks. in her words she said “if you’re an employee, you won’t ask your employer for two times promotion right”

in my mind i was just thinking wtf im supposed to read their mind? and she’s not my boss, we’re family, im not supposed to say what i rly want? in the end, i didn’t go but through shouting at each other the answer was 1-2 weeks. 

fast forward to now, i try again. this time round taking note of the 1-2 weeks limit. i didn’t even bother asking if i could find my bf. i just ask if i could travel to Canada by myself. 
- them: “no”
- me: “why”
- them: “why you want to go so badly”
- me: “just want to travel before i start work since i won’t have time once i start?”
- them: “you can use your annual leave”
- me: “then why not now? im not even going w my bf, there’s nothing to worry about alr”
- them: just shake head 
- me: “so im not supposed to go w bf. not supposed to go w all girls (bc unsafe in foreign country). not supposed to go w other guys. who am i supposed to go w if I can’t go alone?”
- them: “don’t ask these kind of questions. you haven’t showed us you’re able to think on your own”

just want to ask parents out there/ ppl who face similar situation, what am i supposed to do to be treated like an adult? 
i know that no matter how old we are, we will always be children in our parents eyes and they want to protect us. but i feel like my parents are just restricting me at this point and it’s not like they can control me forever (which they also agree).

i alr found a job once i grad and might be doing part time internship from now till then so idk how else im supposed to show my parents im trustworthy.

edit 1: im able to fund the trip myself. with regards to finding a travel buddy, im not sure who is the person i can travel w since they have deemed travelling w bf/ all girls/ all guys unsafe... i don’t have mixed gender grp that is close enough for grad trip. also most of my female friends are actually graduating one sem later

edit 2: thanks for all the replies everyone! there are really some good advice that ive never considered before. i will take time to reply/ read all :-)

edit 3: most of the replies all have similar ideas so  i do apologise if ive missed out your replies. but i definitely read through all! thanks for offering different perspectives and i hope whoever reads this next time has the right ammunition to deal with their own parents :-)!"
squ2o6,219,2022-02-12,Finally landed a Cloud Engineer position. Here is my story up to now. Warning: very long,PersonBehindAScreen,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/squ2o6/finally_landed_a_cloud_engineer_position_here_is/,"Just wanted to give thanks to this sub and share my experience achieving this milestone in my career

Last week I accepted an offer as a fully remote junior cloud engineer! From $8 an hour to 93k in 5 years

Just wanted to say thank you so much to this sub. I couldn't have done it without the great community here. 

I don't have many tips for those who are curious. I wont pretend it was easy. Listen to this community. There are many people with great advice. They know what they're talking about. Bust your ass, study for the job you want. I won't lie, I put off time with my kids and my SO to study in bursts over past 3 years after work to get here. Put in the work, be persistent, accept that you are running your own race, and you will be rewarded. I applied to only a few jobs for this job search and i landed it out of hundreds of applicants, so a heavy dose of luck. Stop reading here if you don't care for the rest of my background 

#Background:

I got my start in IT a few years ago at a local helpdesk while I was in university. Performed basic t1/t2 responsibilities and eventually even got to help coordinate a few large moves and roullouts here and there as the university expanded. This is also where I learned why documentation was extremely important. In my time there I authored many KB articles ranging from your routine fixes and troubleshooting scenarios to specific instutionalized subjects also. Also was typically the go to to entor newer people for their first 30 days. I made $8 an hour here in a VLCOL area. Rent on a 3 bedroom 2 bath was $700 for context. I really didn't struggle to pay rent here.

I left that position after about a year and a half and moved back to my home city and also finished my bachelors in IT about 3 months afterwards. My last semester was completely online so I just spent those 3 months chilling out while I finished. While I searched for a new job in the city after graduation, I worked at a retail store where I was a seasonal worker in between school breaks. 

I then landed a job as a desktop tech at a hospital for 21/hr. Here I performed tasks that would require in person help such as hardware refreshes, imaging, and other related projects and tickets. I and the rest of my desktop team would also function as a T2 to the helpdesk if they couldn't figure something out. Same story as last place. About a year and a half, coordinating projects, helping roll out EMR updates (EPIC). I also learned about SCCM and powershell here and created a few basic scripts. Nothing fancy, basically some windows commands strung together for windows specific tasks such as bulk changing names and other properties. I also got to touch a little bit on security remediation. Resolving incidents involving possibly compromised machines or users: Resetting passwords of those affected, reimaging devices, responding to tickets for blocked and or quarantined software. Roughly 47k made here after the overtime.

It was during this time I came across reddit and learned about r/itcareerquestions and related IT subs.... Holy shit I wish I knew sooner. I could have already been more than helpdesk if I did internships in college and did more than just screw around. I began studying on my own with an extra desktop I had lying around. I put Linux on it. Experimented with kali. I also discovered ""cloud"" too and started up with azure free tier.

I then took up a job as a SOC analyst for an MSSP and stayed here about a year and some change. Did your typical monitoring of EDR and SIEM solutions. ~~White or black listed~~ Allowed or block listed some things. Do the background research on IPs, websites, hashes. Look at some unusual powershell. Also advised clients on actions to take to remediate identified issues if it's something we couldn't remediate without their intervention. I got my CySA+ and some vendor specific security certs while I was here. I thought I'd go down the security path but I realized I actually wanted to stay closer to infrastructure and move towards cloud so I began seeking roles that would help in that aspect. I also got AWS CSAA and CSOA at this time. I still have an interest in security.. maybe I'll go back to it once I have more experience in infrastructure and cloud, but the SOC isn't my cup of tea. 50k salary here.

I landed a sysadmin job in a hybrid azure and windows environment, but still mainly on prem... I won't dwell on this one too much. It didn't work out. I know I just recently came here so I only applied to positions I really wanted because I need to commit to my next jump for a bit or I might scare away some employers if it doesn't work out either. I applied to a cloud infra engineer job. Made it through the final round. Unfortunately they really needed someone with migration experience so I lost out on that. Worked some more months. Dreaded going to work each day and at this point the 1 hr commute and traffic is crushing me. It takes 30 mins to get there with no traffic.  60k salary here. 

#The Cloud Job

I got a LinkedIn notification for a junior cloud engineer at an f500 company and it was just posted on a friday night minutes before my notification. I went to my resume, and tailored my resume to hit everything they were looking for in the job req: qualities fitting of a consultant, scripting, Windows or Linux experience, basic security, networking, and fundamental cloud knowledge. I added the cloud resume project I did as another ""job"" on my resume since there was no area in their ATS for projects:  https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/ 

I was able to overhaul all of my bullet points to my jobs in about 5 mins. Every notable thing I've done in each job so far is documented and backed up on my desktop and one drive. I've made sure to document all the things that can cover as many domains as possible for whatever specialty I'm applying to. If I'm applying to a security job, all of my jobs on the resume have only security descriptions, networking if it's a networking job etc and what ever else can get me close to what they have in the req

Submitted the app Friday night, got a call Monday morning from the recruiter. Very straight forward guy, right off the bat what they want in the job, salary requirements, what it will take to progress and lose the junior in my title which will take roughly a year assuming I'm doing fine. Interview one got scheduled for Wednesday, two days from the time of the call. I can't thank my Recruiter enough. He emphasized that they aren't looking for me to be some tech guru. They want to see that I have the soft skills and can ask the right questions. Being able to hold a conversation and elaborate on answers and show that you understand the human element and all of the challenges that brings to projects and consulting would be crucial because your clients are stakeholders of other companies.

Interview one goes well with the two interviewers. It's almost all ""tell me a time"" and it's almost all related to dealing with people and or projects. I answered it all in STAR format and always brought it back around to how I handled people or how my work with tech met or exceeded the requirements set by those people or made it easier to meet like with automation. Also demonstrating in the stories my ability to ask clarifying questions and in some cases what turns in to one request instead leads them down a better path for something that better suits their needs. 

Same day an hour after the interview Recruiter calls. They want another interview for the next day. So I attend. It's more technical questions this time centered around my comfortable OS(Windows) and some networking but again, the Recruiter reminds me it's not about the technical knowledge. So I do the interview. We go through the straight forward tech questions. Describe switches, routers, Mac, ip, firewalls, virtualization, IAAS, PAAS, FAAS, DNS, DHCP. They also asked if I do anything on my own time and how I learn. This was where I got to pitch my homelab,  cloud homelab, and discussed the cloud resume project. I also pitched Stephane Maareks, Jon Bonso's, Adrian Cantril's, and ACG content. I also explained that I always study for the job I want next. So then came the question ""well what's next?"". I told them cloud infrastructure and services has been the goal and if I got this, at this point, I'd like to grow in to an SME/Senior level and perhaps have the opportunity to mentor others (which was already backed up in my resume and stories). Now remember ive only been at jobs for 1 year at a time so i got ahead of this and I noted at the end that I have normally jumped jobs so I could learn more but this time I decided to target areas where I could meet a lot of clients and get varying work that would deliver those different learning opportunities to me while also allowing me to settle down and grow in one place. 

Recruiter calls a week later, final interview for next week. Back to similar content as the first interview. I think I knock it out of the park on the interviews on my end. All interviews were actually only 30 mins long despite one hour allotment, because they felt a lot of my answers and elaboration answered their other questions they would have had later in the interview. However I always made sure to do my research on the company and who my interviewers were via LinkedIn and I asked roughly 3 to 4 questions per interview that aligned with the work the company did and that aligned personally with the interviewers based on their job history, and the discussion stemming from those took about 30 mins each. 

#Interview stats:

I got the call and accepted the offer immediately. Stats for this recent job search over an exceedingly casual 6 month search. I also wanted to provide context in to what exactly i was targeting in a company here. Larger orgs than im used to with more revenue: 


7 job apps sent in 6 months

One offer for junior security engineer for a private org, 500M revenue. Declined due to insanely high insurance that would make me have less money despite the salary raise and being fully remote

One offer for the job I took and detailed in this post. F500 company

Full interview pipeline for public lender, hundreds of millions revenue. Rejected due to not enough migration experience

Cloud support Engineer at Amazon Web Services, did not pass the technical screen. My first interview 

Rejection, no interview or calls, for sysadmin at one of my old employers. Manager wanted me, HR enacted a policy of not bringing old employees back even if they left in good standing :(

Last job, applied, no interview or calls

Microsoft for support engineer. Did the initial recruiter call. I cancelled the interview as I realized I only applied for the big name but really don't want to be in support.

I'm happy to answer any questions!

Edit: I crossed out white and black list. It slips my mind occasionally that many places are doing away with those terms"

Undergrad at University of Toronto Computer science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence

GPA: 3.8
CS and math courses GPA: 3.96

I got fucked by these breadth courses in my first year wen I didn't care about grades in breadth courses.

1 year research experience but no publications. The research was more applied research and my supervising prof never talked to me haha. I created a CNN cascade for localizing facial landmarks on sheep faces. Yeah. Fucking sheep.

No GRE

3 internships each 4 months. First one was front end developer. Then backend developer at Scotiabank. Then data science at Scotiabank. My data science internship was the best and it's the reason I wanted to focus on ML. 

Letters of rec were eh. 2 professional and one prof. Remember that sheep prof from above? I asked him for a rec and he said nah. Which I think looks really bad on my application. 

MY STATEMENT OF PURPOSE WAS eh. I thought it was good but my friends say it was boring and bland. It's written like this structure :

https://github.com/vsitzmann/phd-master-application-docs

^^^PLEASE READ THAT LINK. it's wat a SOP should be in my opinion. 

Other than that I mean I study pretty hard for school. I get involved in leadership a lot like clubs and captaining intramural sports teams. 

Purdue was kind of a backup for me I mean not that I think my application is great it's just the profs at Purdue weren't in line with my research interests. 

Good luck everyone. U got this.

Also u guys think I'll get accepted to UC San Diego or UT Austin? Those r my top choices but I think that's a reach. LMK PLEASE"

I'm the one-man GIS/On-Site IT/Surveying operation. I'm overloaded and do not have time to create new agency-wide datasets. We have hundreds of miles of canals and pipelines mapped in GIS to varying degrees of accuracy. Management is about to purchase me a Trimble R2 at the centimeter configuration. Supposedly with the added RTN corrections, it will be accurate to less than 1 cm horizontal and 1.5 cm vertical.

What I want an intern for: I'll show them how to set up a simple map in Collector. I'll teach them how to sync the R2 to a tablet for field data collection. I would want the intern to travel to these canal sites and collect horizontal and vertical location of top of bank, high water line, flow line, and top of existing structures. This task would take several months to complete. Perhaps one of the days of the week will be an office day where they can use ArcGIS Pro to plot their survey points, edit location of structures, and create profiles of our channels and pipelines.

I anticipate this task being very boring and repetitive, but it could give experience in web GIS, desktop GIS, survey, and the basics of water resources engineering. Is this task worth an interns time?"

I have a question. I'm working as SEO intern in a digital marketing agency. A client chose to change his website without asking any suggestion from us. 

Now, the new site will be done in ASP classic on a IIS 8,5 server (or at least it's what I understand and what the developer told to us).

The new site is still in staging on the new developer server. From the Chrome console, in the Network tab I saw:

server:Microsoft-IIS/8,5

X-Powered-By: [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET)

The problem is that the URL of the new pages are reach in parameters and all like:

/details.asp?id=978

ecc

My question is: is there a way to do an URL rewrite to make the url form /details.asp?id=978 to product/example-978 ?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that ther's a native way to do the rewrite, but the developer said to me that is not available to ASP classic.

I asked to another developer who already done the rewriting on ASP classic and he suggest to me  Ionics Isapi Rewrite Filter or IIRF.

I passed the information to the developer of the new site but now he's asking for any example.

(I can't make the two developer interact between them 'cause they are competitors)

Can you help me?

Please ask me if you need any other information in order to help me. I'll try to answer. As you may see this is not my field.

Remember that your management isn't necessarily evil they are just 

1) absolutely clueless as to what it is like to be a worker

2) all of their incentives often run counter to worker health, wealth, and well-being

3) aware that sociopaths get promoted first

Advice: have something else lined up before you eject. I was struggling as an engineer with the same moral injury/injustice that many of you feel and did not have anything lined up when I was rif'd. Now I am looking at 50 with multiple degrees and I have not worked a job since that I was not desperate to have. Let me repeat: for the last 20+ years I have sat in the few interviews I could get, knowing that I punch above my weight and the manager sitting across from me would exploit me... and I was DESPERATE to have the job. Some white collar, most somewhere in between, all had me by the shorthair.

Teaching is hard and the pay makes it harder. Which used to be great for me, bc a desperate science teacher can get a job tomorrow... but they are still treated like an American teacher.

I loved teaching. Loved the great kids, loved the knuckleheads, honored to be a part of ""light bulb"" moments. Best, most rewarding job I ever had; also one of the most stressful and exhausting.

At the end, I worked for a ""good"" district that paid equivalent of other ""good"" districts, so above the state and national average. Despite that, 60-70% of my take-home pay went to day-care and health care(2 kids). I had about $800-1k left to provide food and housing. So I worked a second job and was blessed to be married to an amazing woman.

Planning on being a teacher? Here are your top 4 keys to success (#4 will shock you).

1) Get your degree on scholarship

2) Work multiple side jobs - exotic dancer is lucrative, but work out of district! Far, far out of district

3) Have an SO that earns more than you.

4) Be born wealthy, live with your parents, have multiple roommates.

GET ON WITH IT!

Last day of in-service always starts with another wonderful administrator led meeting in the cafeteria. Our head admin gets up and goes through their ""what did you do this summer to recharge"" speech which mostly entails what they did this summer.

I was in a foul mood, admin was giving me the run-around about my teaching schedule (kids on Monday btw) which I knew meant my favorite elective to teach was cancelled. I was also exhausted. I had been working at home depot the prior year and I picked up a breakfast server shift at a nice hotel over the summer. During in-service week I was closing HD (7p-12-ish) three nights a week and working Sat+Sun (5a-12p) as a server. It was a trial run for the school year.

I am sitting at the cafeteria table trying not fall asleep when the admin starts talking about his daughter. Read this in a folksy Tx accent: Well y'all \*\*\*\*\* is gonna graduate this fall and this summer she had to do her internship to get her credit. And you know \*\*\*\*\*, she had to intern at the best, so we went to New York City to find her a place to live. And do you know, those New Yorkers want 3 and $4,000 a month for a place! I was floored! I mean, wow that's a lot of money! Whelp, ya gotta pay it. 

Yeah, \~$1k take home is $12k for the year. This MF-er just blew that on off Central Park housing for his kid's summer internship. I got up and left. I went back to my room, sat in the dark, and fell apart. A grown fucking man stretched so thin that his ass-hat of a boss humble-bragging about his income shattered him. I dragged my ass through the rest of that year, found work in fine dining and have never gone back.

Times are far worse for teachers now. Go give your teacher some love. They are burnt out, unappreciated, and under assault from all sides. That one that was cool, demanded more of you, treated you with respect? Find them on the directory, send them some positive waves, they need it!"

Pretty strong on Object Oriented. 

  
Tech Stack They are Using: Java, Vertx, Springboot, Couchbase

I narrowed down options since i only have 10 days still I start.  


1) Follow Udemy Guide on more complicated subjects on Java ( eg : Concurrency, Java Input Output, Lambda Expressions , Debugging and Couchbase Database.  
2) Leetcode Using Java + Simple Java Udemy  
3) Create projects from the TechStack that they use?

But I want to preface by saying this is a community, we’re everybody helps everybody so we all succeed or put ourselves in a better spot as a result of interacting with others in this community. So although this  is ganna sound like a person bashing CS, I’m not but people need to broaden their horizon.

Yesterday in class kid to my right had tears down his face in the middle of lecture, just to be a good person I asked if he was alright and needed anything, he told me he didn’t get an offer from Meta which he was expecting. I told him shake it off, it’s not the end of the world, plus it’s Friday so after lecture you can hang with your friends and go out and stuff. After he hear those words come out of my mouth he just went silent and said he is solely focused on job searching and that non of that “irresponsible hooligan stuff matters”. I stopped talking to him because I got annoyed for a second. By the way we are only sophomores lol.

First of all there is more to life out there in computer science people. Finding friends, hobbies, or things that you enjoy doing is almost as important to a person then just some computer science internship. Go out with friends at night, meet new people, go enjoy life. Sitting inside until you land a VP job at Google is not healthy, I respect the grind but there is more out there. 

I also wanna say this, if your not an upperclassman, you should have zero expectations to get into these companies. Aim for small or mid companies just to get experience, it’s so early in our lives that it’s better to start building from small companies to get the experience to work at the big ones.  

If your in a place right now where u have things outside of computer science then your doing great, keep it up. For those who won’t rest until they work at a company with 500k TC, I respect the grind, but take a step back when you feel down and go do something fun, and will probably bring you more joy.

Just remember this, nobody on their death bed said “wait let me write one more line of code”."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a freshman in college. I've been programming for awhile and have a small hustle of programming for a game server of which I get compensated, nothing to make a living off though. I learn valuable info though for my boss who works at a big company in NYC though and working in a team with git. I applied to about 6 internships in about late November/early December. Pretty late from what my boss told me as usually its best to apply much earlier. 2 positions were canceled and the rest I was denied.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually a day later after the one internship position had been canceled, I had a contracted IT recruiting agency agent reach out and want to interview me for a full-time job at Comcast based off of my LinkedIn. He later saw that he misread my LinkedIn page and saw I was still in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I want to be as prepped as possible for next summer. When do most CS internship listings go out? About when would I hear back? Is the process like a normal job where they like your app, interview you through Zoom, and then bring you on for the 10 weeks? Also what if I score an internship on the other coast of the USA. How does housing and transportation work? I'd take any internship which offers the best value of information/experience and pay (and I mean that seriously. Its not just about pay).

I live in a 3rd world country. Due to certain circumstances I couldn't major in CS but I did my best to take as many CS courses as possible and I like to think that I'm as good as some of the CS grads from my university. Of course, my FYP wasn't CS related and that does put me at a disadvantage. 

I spent almost the next year and a half searching for a job but due to covid and also being a fresh grad with no experience it took a long time to land anything. Right now I'm doing an ""internship"" as a QA Automation Engineer that will lead to a job after a probation period. Which I am grateful for. 

However there is a culture in my country where people who are able to afford it go abroad for their masters as soon as possible, sometimes even right after graduating from university. Two of my friends went to Canada for their masters. One has graduated already and landed a job due to the co-op nature of his program (Data Science) and the other started his masters back in September of 2021 in a low-level CS related masters. 

The thing I want advice on is this: Should I pursue a masters like they did? I already applied for Waterloo and UBC, both in their co-op data science programs since they have internships built in and get you real-world experience which I have learnt the hard way is very important. People say as long as you have the money getting into these programs isn't hard and while I can afford it it's still a huge financial undertaking especially since my currency doesn't exchange well with CAD.  

I have received advice to not pursue a masters right now and first gain at least 2-3 years of experience. On the other hand I have also been told to take the opportunity while I have the money and the knowledge from my undergrad is still fresh in my mind. Also, I feel like if I become complacent and settle into a life here then I'll never try to pursue anything better and also just be stuck in a 3rd world country where life is very unpredictable and jobs don't pay that well (although living costs are cheap). 

Of course there's other issues as well such as going to a place I've never been and living there and interacting with people very different from what I'm used to. Although I understand that would be me getting out of my comfort zone and growing as a result so I look forward to that. But if you live in Canada, especially the Waterloo region, I would also appreciate some advice on the job market and what living alone is like for a young guy in CS/ Data Science.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be grateful for any advice and perspectives I can get. Thank you."

I’ve been lurking in this subreddit for a while and thought I’d share my story as the super bowl nears. 

We sold our business in 2013 and I needed to find a job. I was in my early 30’s and work in media and marketing which means I create or help create ads and then buy them on various platforms. Those ads can vary from a simple google ad to a super bowl commercial, hence the timing of my post. 

I put my resume on LinkedIn and a recruiter called me for a job that he thought would work. It was 2013 and the offer was for $48,000. I was like okay, let’s try it. The job itself was easy, most people didn’t know what they were doing but my boss SUCKED. He was a poor excuse for a human and was trying to date my intern. Put me in super awkward meetings and when she’d leave would ask me wildly inappropriate things. Worse yet he was a PARROT, if I said something, he’d repeat it as if it was his own, never giving me a nod or credit. 

After about 18 months I got an offer from another company that was slight competitor. My current company focused on digital media while the new company focused more on traditional TV. What I didn’t realize was when I was hired I ‘signed’ a non-compete. Now, I signed it not understanding what it was (my fault). I didn’t read it, etc, because it was with lots of other documents that you were signing in the onboarding process. 

I told my boss that I was putting in my two week notice. Over the time I was with them, they had promoted me, (give me nearly nothing in salary increase, just more title and responsibilities) told me they wanted to build a team around me, etc. they were shocked. The first conversation went fine. Then, my boss pulled me aside in the afternoon and said he wanted to meet with me and the CEO. I knew what it was going to be about. The CEO basically said I couldn’t work from the ‘competitor.’  I smiled and said, I’d like it in writing and then we could chat again once I have an attorney review it. 

I went to an employment attorney (that costs $300!!) and he looked at the non-compete and it was crazy. All industries. Covered the entire country, etc. the attorney was frank and said it’s likely unenforceable, however it costs money to fight them. 

I went back and told the CEO I was leaving and wasn’t backing down. I also informed the new company of the issue and they dismissed it like it was nothing. I was a ball of nerves and stress and the new company told me they weren’t worried. On top of that, my current employer was a 90 minute drive in a completely different metro area. Now I’d have a 5 minute drive. It was nearly double the pay and almost no commute. 

The CEO told me he’d think about it and let me know by the end of the day. At that point, I decided to record every conversation I had with anyone related to my exit. They are located in a one party state. So I could do so and if they didn’t like it, fire me. 

The CEO called me in to his office with my slimmy boss and said, okay you can go, but we want 40 HOURS of consulting work from you FOR FREE to compensate us for releasing you from the non-compete. I WAS ENRAGED. I stood up and told him I’d need to the end of the day. Called my attorney and he said, sign it!!!  How would it ever be enforced. And how would they measure the time. Get away and they have no power. ‘Work slow’ is what he said basically. 

I walked back in and signed it. I was DISGUSTED. I left without saying good bye to the leadership and told myself I’d never answer any of their calls for requests for work. 

The story has a wonderful and delicious ending in that while they never reached out to request work (which made no sense to me because why would they request that if they were going to exercise that option) I eventually moved to a job at one of the largest companies in the state. My role involved managing and allocating a massive budget of services which just so happened to include projects that my old employer could bid on. I graciously invited them to apply to bid on a few of the projects we had open. Literally millions of dollars in work. 

Did they get that work, I’ll let you guess the answer to that. I hope they spent more than 40 hours responding to the RFPs. 

In my spitefulness, I have a calendar reminder to leave them a nasty review on Glassdoor every year around when I left to alert others of their nasty culture. 

I’ve never signed another non-compete. 

I pay attention to how people leave and how companies and leaders react. 

I tell my team that I’ll celebrate your arrival and departure. You need to worry about you. 

Enjoy the super bowl!"

So, I was just diagnosed last June at 28 years old. I started on a low dose of meds and slowly worked my way up, but it was still fairly low (15 mg IR). Things were DRASTICALLY better. I'm finishing up my undergrad degree and I was actually able to handle my classes and not breakdown every week. My work at my internship was great. I was cleaning the house more than ever and managing the daily tasks, which had been an issue before in my relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the paranoia slowly started to creep in. Just in little ways at first, but it got out of hand a couple weeks ago. I would feel fits of rage over something that should've been nothing. I was crying for hours a day. I began to resent everything around me. The intrusive thoughts took over and I couldn't snap out of the spiral. Finally, my partner and I ended up in a huge fight that I picked because of the paranoia. We've been together 5 years and if you would've told me before that we would ever have a fight like that, I wouldn't have believed it.  So, I took a day off my meds because I was going to get fitted for my wedding dress (yup, it was shitty timing) and I didn't really need to be productive that day. In fact, I wanted to be able to eat a full meal and take a nap, I was close to completely breaking.

Then the next day I didn't take them either, because again I didn't have too much that I needed to do, and I had slept in way too late to take them anyways. I started to feel a little more human around the early evening on this day. The next day I skipped them because I had a theory. By the 4th day of not taking them I felt closer to human than I had in probably 3-4 months. Things that I hadn't realize had been wrong all of the sudden weren't.

But now I'm back to unmedicated until I can get into a new doctor (because that's also been an issue, again shit timing). And I'm struggling. Don't get me wrong, I'm so glad to feel sane again. I was worried about my relationship and even my life at one point. But dear god the static in my brain is so loud. I'm forgetting or losing everything. Everything requires 10x more effort than before.

sr30ld,22,2022-02-12,"Last year around Christmas, I got a pretty disgusted response from co-workers and middle management after refusing to chip in money for the department head's Christmas gift",Ir0nstag,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sr30ld/last_year_around_christmas_i_got_a_pretty/,"For context, I work at the in-house bank of a pretty successful local car dealership, and the department head in question runs two Buy-Here-Pay-Here lots along with the bank which I work for that finances all of the deals for said BHPH lots. 

Granted, he is a pretty nice guy. Easy to work with, pretty smart and practical, and I like working with him quite a bit. He's genuinely a good dude to work for, so I can understand people wanting to get him something nice come Christmas.

I was in a bit of a financial bind at the time, my wife was student teaching to finish her degree, which is an unpaid internship. We were able to borrow enough from a 3rd-party student loan company to cover her half of the bills while she worked almost 60 hours a week between meetings, lesson planning, grading, etc. literally for free, but the rest of the expenses including gas for our cars, groceries, food, etc. fell on me. Which was fine, we made it, but it was a struggle for sure. 

Cue early December when my boss comes in and announces that we're all chipping in to get the big boss a new phone for Christmas since his just broke. They were only asking for $20, but when I flat out said I couldn't afford it in front of everyone, half of them (including my boss) looked at me like I had set their beloved family dogs on fire in front of them. A couple co workers were in similar situations as me so they sympathized, but of course didn't say anything out loud like I did to avoid similar treatment. 

Look, it's only $20. Sure. I get it. But this is for our department head that I happen to know makes a hell of a lot more money than the rest of us. He invited me and a couple sales guys out to lunch over the summer when the stores were all well, and paid for our lunch, which was great. Super nice of him. During this lunch he revealed that between what he was making at the stores, what he had in savings, and his investments, I believe he's a LandChad for either a small apartment building or a couple duplexes, he's worth over a million dollars on paper. 

Over a million dollars. So needless to say, he's killing it financially. He's an older guy, maybe not super close to retirement, but he can sure as hell afford to buy his own new cell phone. I wasn't sure whether or not to post this here or on AITA, but why on earth should I be obligated to give this guy that has more money than I possibly might ever have in my life $20 when I am legitimately struggling to put food on my own table? 

It left a really sour taste in my mouth. Still with the company and my transgressions have since been swept under the rug, but I know to expect something similar next year. The year prior, we all pitched in and got him a brand new set of golf clubs. I had just recently started so I begrudgingly gave up the money without saying anything, but I'd become a little more tenured at the time of the refusal so I was more comfortable speaking my mind at that point. 

This also isn't the first time I've experienced something like an office pool to get the boss a nice gift. Why are the people who make way less obligated to get the person who makes way more a gift? Shouldn't it be the other way around?"

sr3vqw,306,2022-02-12,Unpopular opinion: why you’re not in EECS,emet18,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sr3vqw/unpopular_opinion_why_youre_not_in_eecs/,"This is gonna get some hate but it’s the truth some of y’all need to hear.

As a subreddit there’s a lot of complaints about being CS, being Data Science, or being CogSci. Have you ever considered that the ONLY commonality among all your experiences was YOU? There’s a lot of talented engineers at this school, and MAYBE you’re not one of them. Maybe you’re not interesting, funny, lively, cool, entertaining enough to pass 61A. Like, it is possible, right? And here at UCB, it’s not enough to just take one DeCal and then say you’re “interested in machine learning.” You gotta leetcode too. There’s tons of people here who are learning electrical engineering AND computer science. Why would a FAANG hire you over them? Companies have a limited time for recruiting season each year, so why should they make your boring life interesting, when there’s already tons of smarter people to interact with?

I bet this post hit a soft spot or exposed many of your insecurities. But don’t take this personally; see the positive within it. Transfer. Learn a language. Do an actual fucking coding competition. Cultivate some hobbies. Learn a new skill. Go and do shit, whether in Palo Alto or SOMA. Don’t just sit on your ass and complain about not being in EECS, or not having a summer internship, or not getting into a club. This shit doesn’t just happen, and if you’re not worthy of deserving it, you best believe it’s not gonna happen. You gotta take life by the balls, and make it your own.

Get off Reddit and do something new. And please, for the love of god, stop posting here as if it’s gonna solve anything."
sr62jw,0,2022-02-12,A little lost on what to do,Brightlylitcloud,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sr62jw/a_little_lost_on_what_to_do/,"I recently graduated with a CS degree and live in San Diego. Since I started learning CS in college, I've basically just jumped from course to course using whatever language, IDE, or other tech that was needed in order to complete my degree. C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and etc. Used virtual machines like to create a basic company server with OpenBSD, CentOS, and such. I've always managed to pick up whatever was needed to finish a course with an A or B in the class.

The problem is that I've never really stuck to any particular thing. Which basically made me feel like I don't know much about any at all beside being somewhat familiar with them. I've done some class projects and had an internship, but I still don't feel like I'm up to any sort of technical interviews since I can't even choose a particular programming language to go with.

I've also gotten some offers from defense industry that varied from 72k-87k at different companies in the area. I know it's pretty low since friends I know said I should be able to get 90k easily from other places, but defense industry has no technical interviews. Behavioral interviews are about the only portions of any interviews that I've ever been comfortable with and pass with almost near certainty, which is why all offers I've gotten are all from defense.

I'm primarily interested in WLB but I also want to get paid a bit more and work that will allow me to develop and learn. Should I just spend my time to work on LeetCoding questions, study DS and Algorithms, and maybe try The Odin Project for a few months to find better places rather than jumping on defense work?"

There was the dot com crash in the early 2000s and I know tons of people lost jobs then and regretted ever studying computer science. I don't want to find myself in that situation so which specialty will probably have the most job security for the next decade or 2? Database administration, cybersecurity, machine learning, front-end, back-end, embedded systems? 

I had an internship where I did some .NET development for front-end but I doubt the skills I acquired there will provide me much job security. Everyone is saying cybersecurity is the future but is this a bit exaggerated? I suppose one thing that's great about it is that I imagine a lot of cybersecurity jobs will require US citizenship. 

What about machine learning if I'm someone with very strong math skills? I also have an engineering degree so perhaps I would seem like an attractive candidate for embedded systems or control systems given that I'm highly knowledgeable in circuit analysis and a little bit of mechanics and signal processing?"

I'm also a musician that write songs and i'm good at writing but i feel like i'm lacking in conversation skills while i'm still really good at understanding what people feel in subtle things they express.

So to begin with in how i want help in self-improvement, i recently noticed since i started an internship in an IT departement where i need to often interact with clients that my mentor feel like i'm not listening what he say when i actually do listen but i struggle looking directly in the eyes so it might not help. Also when i have questions about cases i face while working i tend to express midway in my thoughts and i often need to repeat myself in a different way so my question is understood altough my problem is quite clear in my head. It really annoy me and i wish i could more clearly express my thoughts. But sometimes also my brain bug and it don't help altough i don't think i'm dumb or anything, it's just that i tend to get overloaded by informations at time and i noticed i really do learn fast, usually, just need 1 or 2 coaching interactions for the things i must learn

Also, that's not the only social problem i have, i tend to get clumsy and/or uncertain when i'm observed while doing a task i normally do without any problem and i don't know if people notice but it make me afraid to look stupid,for example it happen when i must interact directly with a client, when i'm trying to explain my question or at a friend house for example when i eat there and there's thing like their parents or anything, i start overthinking every normal as fuck manual task instead of doing them automatic like normal. 

I just wish i could be normal like everyone and it tends to hurt my self-esteem even if i know i have friends, stuff and great musical skill. I'm just always feeling like a weirdo and i would like it to stop.

I want him to have complete control over my body for just one night. I want him to control my breath. I want him to control my position. I want him to have my body.

After all that, we’d hold each others naked bodies and talk about anything. I’d tell him about my parents, my childhood, my traumas, and he’d listen with kind intent. He’d whisper stories of his childhood into my ear while I nuzzle my head into his chest.

In the morning, I would wake up jet lagged, with the sun shining in my face. I’d quietly put on my clothes, and take a picture of him sleeping. I’d lightly scratch his back until he’s awake enough to realize I was leaving, and I would plant a kiss on his forehead and thank him before I go back to America.

I came out of school full of potential, but pretty low self worth. I developed a chronic condition and had to reinvent my life. I struggled through my first degree, I was actually succesful, but it took a toll on my health as I powered through to flee from life.

I then became better, fought my depression as well. I started to become happy and did some passion stuff, I was good at my internships and have great friends and family. I was developing a new path to a career I actually liked. Learned meditation and started to like myself.

COVID came. 

I was unorganized and thought: Hey, just get a GTD pro and you got it. Time to fulfill your potential. Of course, this led to 100 unfinished things and to very much despair. Also I suffered emotional abuse in a group setting.

I then abandoned the project of a new career path (""I wont make it"") and stuck to a degree I dont like, but is familiar and structured.

It worked as okay as it could. WFH was a bummer definitely, but I had a positive vision for the future.

High pressure and a failed relationship which I couldnt handle (my adhd and her bpd, wow..) then crushed me. Quit everything, moved, no more job or savings

I am at ""zero"". My degree is f'ed up. My option B has sunk. But my ADHD is still there. And trauma and depression now are on top.

I was always giving 200%. I have good social circle, intelligent etc. Still I fail with myself. How the hell will I manage life once it gets serious (fulltime job, family, old parents)??? I feel like I had it all and now won't have the energy to get back there ever again. Like I lost the game.

After the first interview they gave me some topics to ""study"" on which the questions will be asked. The topics are:   
1) sorting algorithms   
2) graphs   
3) intervals   
4) recursion   
5) strings   

I had some days to prepare but I feel like I just scratched the surface, I don't feel confident at all about them.
So I wanted to ask: what kind of question could they ask for a front-end internship (JavaScript and Vue) based on those topics? 
I mean, could they ask me something like: ""implement the quick sort algorithm in this problem""?"
sric6x,5,2022-02-13,CP3209 or SIP?,watermonky,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/sric6x/cp3209_or_sip/,"Hello all, Y2 CS here. I am currently facing a dilemma on whether I want to pursue research or apply for an internship for the summer. I've recently made a post about wanting to pursue a career in academia and thus take on research modules (CS2309, CP3209) as well as the FYP (CP4101), but I am struggling to make that decision because of the industrial experience requirement. There are two options I am now considering:

1. Apply for UROP for this summer, take on the FYP on my final year and replace the industrial experience requirement.
2. Apply for a summer internship (SIP) and apply for the FYP after my third year.

Both options are easier said than done, but I'm mainly torn between these two because (1) should I actually take on the FYP, I want to have some prior research experience (CP3209) to better prepare myself for it, and (2) I need to fulfill the industrial experience requirement one way or another.

I've heard that SoC might allow some students to take SIP and UROP concurrently under exceptional circumstances, but I am nowhere near exceptional so let's not consider that possiblity for now.

Which option (can even be one that I haven't considered) do you think is more sensible? I would really love to take on the research modules, but I'm worried about my competence and risk of not being able to fulfill the industrial experience requirement.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

I'm currently 20 y/o and finishing up my A.S. IT degree at NOVA right now (it was in A.S. as I was planning on transferring but I did not want to go to school anymore and I already wasted 3 years at NOVA and I'm afraid of wasting more time and my parents support me anymore) and I've been reading up posts in this subreddit on whether or not I need a bachelor's degree to make it into companies. And right now, I'm currently conflicted if I should pursue in the bachelor's or just go straight to completing certs and getting a entry level job. 

I do not have much experience in IT. Only experience I have is building computers and no experience on the software side. I don't like coding at all and basically software as I find that to be confusing and hard to understand so I'm going for a IT job that's hardware and I don't know career name that is.

 So basically, do I need a bachelor's in order for me to live financially stable and is there a IT job where I'm working on the hardware side of IT? 

No experience in IT, no certs as of now and I have no done any internships yet."

Starting off, I came to know about this term in rbn as occasionally I had thoughts of suicide before, and maybe even still do.

Not strong enough to carry them out though, just general pros and cons of me committing suicide.

And not surprisingly, the pros outweigh the cons, like my family would be better off financially, emotionally, and physically over not having to care for my dumbass, nobody will really miss me as I have a handful of friends only who are on-off as they have their own things to do, and I don't really have much going on for me in terms of career/money (just an intern atm).

But I promised myself that I won't end it until I turn 30, if by then I cannot leave my household, or even better, the country, then I can call it quits.

Anybody else? Thanks for reading."

\- Grade 11 chem teacher, 9/10? pretty sure it was my strongest one

\- Grade 10 compsci teacher, 6/10. we're friends + have discussed life and her kids and stuff but i don't  think the letter was awesome

\- Internship boss, 8/10?

**Interviews**

\- only interviewed with Dartmouth and it went really well... we chatted for a while abt healthcare interests + stuff since she was from my city and had similar passions. replied to my follow up email saying she thinks I'll excel at Dartmouth so i guess she assumed i was getting in lmao 

**Essays**

\- common app essay \[8.5/10\] -&gt; pretty good i think, rewrote like 3 times, talked about my home country and realizing the differences in healthcare between it and Canada. at the end talked about my project + challenges so far + plan moving forward and how i generally want to leverage my privilege to make an impact on the world

\- uchicago supp (unit of measurement one) \[8/10\] -&gt; my unit of measurement was measuring success by the amount of regrets on your deathbed and not by money or status. did it the day it was due while dying in self isolating from covid! :) but pretty decent i think, talked about the life i wanna live and made it philosophical

\- why UChicago supp \[7/10\] -&gt; pretty basic but talked about finding community for my identity and what i would do there etc etc etc 

\- other supps -&gt; mostly reused the same 3 ideas: talked about the infinite monkey theorem and my fascination with how humans produce knowledge without experience, my love for alt/indie music + how I've found community through it, my experience watching still alice as a kid and wanting to understand the body at a molecular level. really liked all my other ones above my Chicago ones but oh well

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UChicago EDII w/ 80k yearly aid

*I guess I'm gonna have to withdraw :(((*:

* Brown
* Stanford
* Duke
* Columbia
* Northwestern
* Pomona
* USC
* Dartmouth
* Cornell

*Waiting on*:

\- a handful of Canadian schools

**Additional Information:**

\- wanted to go to brown or stanford most and UChicago third, but did ED2 there since everyone kept saying no one gets in RD. probabilistically wise wouldn't have gotten into brown or stanford anyway so its okay!

\- in my common app additional info section i talked about my favorite research papers/research articles I've written across high school abt biotech/global health, linked my personal website and blog, talked about online courses in immunology and ai and all that fun stuff I've done  

\- i guess my app shows stats aren't everything !! everyone told me i would have a super tough time without 7s across the board in IB or a perfect GPA. didn't do the hardest courses \[HL math/HL chem\] and didn't get the highest gpa and I'm still fine - prob cuz i wove a good story for myself"
srss1z,0,2022-02-13,Looking for advice on expressing Winter admission interest (UMich),anniepeachie,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/srss1z/looking_for_advice_on_expressing_winter_admission/,"Ok, so I’m going to be helping my son with his LOCI for UMich RD.  He’s an accomplished programmer and technical writer, but this type of communication stuff freaks him out, so I help with the bullet points to hit on.  In addition to expressing unbridled interest in attending the school as a Freshman, I am wondering if there’s something else we could include and if it would help or hurt his chances…

I verified in the common data set that they do accept Winter admissions in LSA only. He applied to LSA computer science for the fall. He’s graduating HS with an A.S. and 84 credits. We live 10 minutes from the stadium. Fall 2022 would be ideal, but what if he also expressed willingness to start in the Winter?  He has some internships on the back burner, lots of apps in development, and he could live at home both in fall and winter, if housing would be an issue.  

So with no imminent rush to secure housing and acquire credits, we all agree starting in winter is agreeable if the alternative is total rejection. His GPA is kinda sucky with a 3.56, but a lot of it was COVID and it’s well-explained in an essay. SAT is 1510, most ec’s are atypical with mostly app development and robotics competitions (non-traditional high school).  We’re obviously in state and not seeking aid, and I’m a grad. 

So do you think adding a willingness to be admitted for winter, but with a fall preference could increase his chances for either, or just discourage one or both? The acceptance rate from his high school was 38.5% pre-COVID and I know it’s quite a reach, so I’m just grasping while there’s still a chance left :)."

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

srynz1,42,2022-02-13,America has become a place to make money and once you made enough.. you GTFO to live in a country with a LCOLA.,Only_BlackTShirt_Guy,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/srynz1/america_has_become_a_place_to_make_money_and_once/,"I started work when I was 14 as dishwasher boy for family friends parents restaurant to now doing IT career at 30. I have been recently let go, though the job was paying me well, it was a toxic environment. I got into my IT career at 21 doing non paid internship. At age 24, I job hopped 6 times because I hated working for my bosses. 

I had to find a way out and realized I would kill and hate myself working until I am 62 or something. 

I was let go two weeks ago, but I already had an exit plan way before. LUCKILY, Being Japanese and Filipino has many pros. I am able to leave this country. I have saved and invested well and can finally retire at age 30 with my wife outside America.

Every day I worked, I felt like I wasn’t really living. I realized that being in America, this place is good for making money and after that you leave if you can. If any of you can somehow retire early, I highly suggest leaving the country to much lower cost of living countries like Bali or Philippines. $1500 a month goes very far and can live a luxurious life.

I am in the process to moving to japan. Health care is cheaper and provide better care. They pay you money back if you over pay to make sure you don’t go bankrupt. Japan is cheaper compared to NYC/NJ where I currently live. $3k a month for a single person can live comfortably. And if Japan doesn’t work then I will go to Philippines.. right next door. $2 -3k a month you can hire a chef or maid or driver.

Hopefully I didn’t offend anyone. I just been meaning to leave this place. (My mother brought me here thinking of better opportunities back in 2001, I have been meaning to go back to Japan now that I am 30 and raising a newborn daughter and japan would be a perfect place to raise her.)"

I am not confident that I can get an entry-level job after graduation, so I was thinking to extend my education with a certificate in database development where I can learn both c# and SQL/oracle stuff. The thing is IDK if this is a good idea. Will I be available for internships during this time? Are there repercussions?"

Throw away for reasons that will soon be obvious. A large part of this will be ranting because context is valuable and I need to say it but don't have anyone I can trust enough to say it to, I know I should say everything to my therapist, but I barely have to confidence to type this out anonymously on the internet, and it's taken months to stop avoiding the truth of my past mistakes in the first place.

As for where I am at right now, I think I'm out of the red. I pretty sure I have figured out how to avoid becoming a massive failure, it's just a matter of figuring out the normal stuff now.

Anyway, this is the story of the absolute roller-coaster of a life these last three years. I have gone from being the top student athlete at my(relatively small) high school and being accepted to the computer science program at a pretty friggin respectable university to placing myself in dead end work at a job I don't care for, rapidly gaining weight and coming in and out of drug abuse. It's a fun one.

&amp;#x200B;

Troubles started when university started. I had coasted by in earlier school by doing all my homework in class/at lunch and never needing to study for tests because I would dedicate all my attention to lectures, working as hard as I could as to avoid needing to do anything outside of school. I was also a competent athlete in high school. I wasn't good enough to qualify for state/high level tournaments, but I worked hard enough that people knew my name around school. Compare this to university, where often the majority of learning is done outside the classroom, and there are no repercussions for doing poorly. Academic advisors don't care so long as you aren't getting F's, and when you parents ask about your grades, you can just lie. I did well in high school, what reason would they have to not trust me? I had no habits built up for doing anything of my own volition, so I struggled, I struggled bad. And there was no reputation I saw fit to maintain, either. As for athletics, the school was D1. I was good enough to practice, but was far from being good enough to compete. Sure, there are intermural teams, but that's not the same as competing against people your age who were doing the very best they could with the recourses they had. It didn't have the same thrill of competition, and competing was the main reason I suffered through practice. I was a leader on my sports teams, and I took satisfaction in knowing I worked harder than those around me. As for grades, people knew I did well, which I also took satisfaction in. Many also thought I was an insufferable teacher's pet, but why should I care what they think? Change scene back to college, a massive campus campus with a population in the tens of thousands, and no one gives a flying crap about how anyone else is doing or knows any student names outside of their friend groups. As for myself, suffice it to say I knew I was performing below average. And yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not motivate myself to form the habits I knew were needed for success. I used to work hard so I could go home and play video games without my parents getting on me about it, now I could play video games without anyone's approval. Also that insufferable teachers pet thing? I wasn't great at making friends.

&amp;#x200B;

First semester ends and I am scraping by. Halfway through the second semester, and I am attending half my classes. I am fully aware I am on the path to destruction. I deny that I may be suffering from depression, instead telling myself that I still enjoy life. (Which, to be fair, I did enjoy playing video games all day until I was reminded of my situation) I just told myself I was lazy and needed to ""do better"". Turns out telling yourself that doesn't actually achieve anything. If not for the covid shutdown swooping in to allow me not to count that semester's grades towards my GPA, it would have almost certainly marked the end of my academic career. And then, like the hand of the divine reaching out to me, an opportunity presented itself to me: a summer sales internship. The meetings I had with the recruiters were like a promise of everything I needed: focus on motivation and self improvement, of getting out of your comfort zone and creating life skills. I would be working with and learning from the recruiters - students like me who had found great success and made a decent chunk of change. When I called people who had worked for them previously I was given the confirmation I needed, a student who had previously been a stoner and an alcoholic, who after working for the company for a summer had become a productive student again, and was only not working for the company again because he had found a different internship in his field. Yeah.... it was a University approved MLM. (in the strictest technical terms, it wasn't an MLM because I didn't have to buy anything before I could work, but otherwise the ideas are the same) The saddest thing about it is that I think everyone, from the university(which allowed the company to operate in the business/internship building and recruit on campus) to the recruiters, was genuinely convinced that having students sell door to door for 70-80 hours a week was a good thing. It may have not been an entirely evil thing and I think I worked with people who have genuine good intentions, but now I have intense rejection dysphoria and have a very real understanding of the 80/20 principle. I'm still no better at detecting deception, I am trusting to a fault.

Anyway, I was told by someone two weeks into working that rumor had spread that I was a stalker/child predator. Also the police were looking for me so they could perform an arrest. (On a side note, please consider when relaying that kind of information that the person may be a victim and it is probably the first time they have heard about it. I know I bear responsibility for my actions and it was my imperative to see through what I was being fed as to not cause good people worry and concern, but I will never get the image out of my head of that woman telling me that I looked like a stalker because my face was blank and emotionless. This is normally my response when I go into shock). I know this may not be directly relating to my questions, but it is very much a part of who I am. Yay for trauma. I wept until no more tears came and quit the job that day. By the time my next semester came around, anything positive I may have taken from the program. It was even worse, by the first month I was attending none of my classes. I had picked up a part time job, but despite showing me how badly I wanted to stay in college rather than start working full time, it provided no motivation towards my academics. Outside of work and a party I went to where I smoked weed for the first time and got so crossfaded I didn't feel okay again for three days, I was simply rotting in my room. I played video games when I was awake, and at night I would lay awake, praying and wishing for some escape from my powerlessness. I called my Mom, told her I was suffering from depression, and withdrew from the university. 

I started a job search quickly and, to my surprise, got a decent enough job pretty much instantly through a high school acquaintance. In many ways, it may have been exactly what I needed. The job didn't pay a lot, but I didn't care. I was house sitting for my parents while they negotiated with a business to sell the property, and being that the business was taking their sweet time, for the foreseeable future my only expense was paying for food, gas, and utilities. The work was easy and I could distract myself with audiobooks so it wasn't so bad. I worked overtime when it was asked of me, and my work ethic and efficiency was recognized. I was told that, if I stuck with it, I could go anywhere I wanted to within the company. But something felt wrong. I wasn't interacting with anyone at work since I got through the day by dissociating, and I never really hung out with anyone. It was a very solitary existence. I was also eating out for every single lunch and couldn't motivate myself to work out or complete personal projects. My social anxiety, both from my earlier attempts at making organic friends and from my newfound rejection complex. Thus, I made little effort into making new friends. When offered new opportunities at work, I would try them but shrink away at the slightest resistance or anything that would require my mind to be present more than it had to be. I was drifting through life in complete stagnation.

 I made an appointment with my doctor to ask about getting treatment for depression, was told that yep, I had depression, and was prescribed some meds and sent to a therapist. At the time my understanding of what was wrong with me was very different, and I did not effectively communicate my issues. Also the meds made me feel like absolute crap, and the whole think about taking months or even years to find the right meds didn't exactly appeal to me. So, I stopped taking meds. Since I listened to books all day, I listened to one about depression. The book denounced the value placed on medication and instead promoted changing a person's life in order to absolve one's self of such suffering. There was probably great value in that book, especially in the realms of finding meaningful work, making friends, touching some grass, and a few other things I was failing to do. But motivating myself to up and do those things in my life was far from simple, as I had no support system. Instead I called up my only good friend from high school who was still in town, suffering from many of the same issues as me, and we got \*wasted\*. We would call up someone over 21 to buy us some cheap vodka and take shots until the bottle was empty. Gosh those nights were fun, made me feel like everything was going to be okay, if only for a little bit. I also tried smoking with him, but weed and I don't get along. Alcohol makes me forget that I am impaired, but weed makes my mind feel dull. This detail is important because of what happens next. I am sure many people have heard the term ""gateway drug"" before in reference to weed. With all the talk of legalization and medical applications, I think people have failed to realize what gateway drug means. It's not a gateway drug because it makes you do more drugs, but because it's illegal. People try this thing that's supposed to be dangerous but hey, it didn't seem so bad. At this point, legality is no longer a measure on what a person should or should not try. For me, it was alcohol. Something I oughtn't do under the age of 21, yet I felt fine, even better as I was now interacting with someone. Then came the perfect storm. The book I was reading spoke about recent treatment for depression looking into psychedelic drugs. Miraculous experiences that can reassign one's values and potentially help with depression. The same day I listened to the argument for treatment with them, a coworker I spoke with on break mentioned how micro dosing was having a positive impact on him. And then, that exact same day, I gained access to such drugs. I took LSD for the first time that weekend.

Now I do not to dissuade anyone from the medical applications of such substances, but I harshly caution against any form of self medication or recreational use. Drugs are for losers. In terms of wasted money, drugs have cost me more than anything with the exception of fast food, league of legends skins, and my unplayed steam games. Money which sure would be nice right about now. Not all by the cost of the substances I have taken, but the in the cost of drugs I have tossed in determination of never doing anything again, the cost of pissing on the carpet of a hotel room and abashedly explaining the situation to a very supportive and understanding receptionist, and the cost of an emergency room visit I made after not getting any reaction off of some mushrooms I had eaten and worrying that I had poisoned myself. (I hadn't. There is more to that last story, but suffice it to say me chasing a high landed me a $1k hospital bill). And none of that includes the costs of the bad trips I have suffered, the close calls with actions that quite possibly could have ruined my life, the self hate of the choices I have made, and the lies I still tell to this day. 

The first time on LSD wasn't so destructive by itself. I both enjoyed myself and had an experience that resolved me to better myself. I stopped drinking and trying weed, I worked harder at work, and even started working out... briefly. I was basically back to normal depresso mode after two weeks, but things were still headed in a positive direction, if slowly. That was until that friend I mentioned earlier got kicked out of his parents house when he came home smelling so intensely of weed his parents thought he had smoked it in the house. Who had a place for him to stay? me. I did. Oh the choices I would have made differently today if I knew now what I knew then. The things I would have tried in order to get us to turn our lives around. Resume drinking, especially when I turned 21, occasional social smoking, and the reintroduction of the drug that made my life so much easier for two weeks. Over the next month, I did LSD once, shrooms once, and LSD a second time. That second time I took a massive dose which sent me down a very unsafe line of thought because of the lack of a tripsitter. It is another trauma I will never forget. A deeply spiritual experience of self punishing thoughts that were ultimately meaningless. Basically, I resolved myself again to not take drugs while under the influence of LSD, but knew that I needed some way to prevent myself from doing them again. Being that I was not in a rational state of thought, I decided the problem was that I was enjoying them. I thought if I didn't like them, I wouldn't do them again. Well I got what I wished for. I had a lot of dangerous thoughts that night, and in the two days it took my mind to return to normal, all I could think about were the horrors I chose to imagine, and the profoundness of which they seemed to have.

And yet eventually even that horror faded, and the thoughts of euphoria I had experienced and dreams of experiences which would fix my inadequacies eventually won. I took LSD once more before he had to move out because the house needed to get ready for sale. Nothing profound happened, yet neither did nothing horrific. It was just kind of sorta fun I guess. My longing for profound experience and solutions persisted, which resulted in that emergency room incident, later followed by the carpet pissing incident a few months later. What confused me so much during this time was how I kept wanting to go back. Knowing the cost of the hospital visit was not enough to dissuade me, nor did my second bad trip when the carpet pissing ensued was enough to convince me to throw out the other mushrooms I had stashed. It was so bizarre, I knew my actions made no logical sense and yet they kept happening. Not too long after the carpet pissing did I start to watch breaking bad. Where as some people see a forbidden allure in some of that show, I saw the horror in which I was, in some small way, involving myself in. Especially with how Jesse's relationship with his brother reminded me of my oldest brother, who still smokes weed and occasionally does LSD, despite having kids of his own. I was horrified of the drugs that, at this point, I was hiding in my parents house as I lived with them. I wanted to throw them out, cast them away, but I kept finding an excuse to hang onto them. For the first time I tried a microdose while my parents were out. Even this tiny bit sent me spinning into an existential crisis and filled me with anxiety. I finally managed to convince myself to throw them out. I am not sure I could have made the same decision if I waited until I was fully sober.

I was having this massive individual struggle with what was developing into a kind of cycle of doing drugs, stopping everything, and then try again after a few months. Meanwhile, I appeared to be having a completely functional life on the outside. I was working 40+ hours a week, paying my bills, and chose to give college a second try when I had to chose between that and having to pay rent in the current housing market. School sounded cheaper, and perhaps offered change, though I was likely on a path to simply have history repeat itself.

My salvation came in the form of more drugs: joking. I was having really bad brain fog at work, especially when I took up some management responsibility and had to spend more time not zoned out. So I set up an appointment with my doctor. He wanted me to look into possible ADHD and referred me to a psychiatrist. I wasn't convinced, maybe thought I was pretty low on the scale if I did have it, I did well in primary/secondary school after all.

No, I have ADHD, big time. It just didn't manifest in the stereotypical ways. Common ways, just not the ones that are as easy to spot. It is no exaggeration to say my life has been turned upside down by proper treatment. It's quite ironic that taking speed(it's a joke, ADHD people on meds aren't high all the time, they react differently to the meds than a person with a normal brain would. Please do not abuse prescription medication.) has freed me from addiction. Rather than feeling the compulsion to play video games every waking moment, I have barely been playing them at all. It's not that I don't enjoy them, I just don't feel like I need to play them. As for the desire to take psychedelics, it's gone. Like completely. I don't need a powerful experience to fix me, it couldn't, I had a different problem. What was likely the more powerful motivator, the euphoria I had felt at certain points which high, no longer has the same appeal. Sure, I would feel nice, but it wouldn't actually achieve anything even in the best of circumstances. College is an absolute breeze, especially when a normal college's normal rigor degree is compared to a rigorous school's computer science program. I have been freed.

Not so say its all milk and honey, I still have rejection disphoria and other normal person problems. But now I feel like I can actually start.

Man typing that out was therapeutic. I didn't realize I needed that. Anyway, onto the reason I opened up this browser tab two and a half hours ago.

&amp;#x200B;

0.)I respond well to book recommendations

1.) how do I forgive myself for past actions, or what could have been? These past years have not been without learning, but I can't help but think about what could have been if I had gotten proper treatment sooner, of the trauma I could have avoided. And I know I still have my whole life left, but I feel as if I have stained myself, as if I am made unclean by my actions, or that they will still come back to haunt me, especially when some of the events I spoke of are quite recent. I do not wish to forget, but I am wasting time when I wade in such thoughts. I could just blame my ADHD for everything, but that would be evading responsibility and the fact that I still functioned at an above minimum function level for most of my life without treatment, I  know I could have done better.

2.) How to make friends? Real ones I mean. It's simple enough to meet with old acquaintances or find someone to hang out with. I don't know how to find and seek out the kind of relationships that will encourage me to become a stronger person and fulfil the human requirement of community and relationship.

3.) How to I build a concept of money? The aforementioned expenses made by my idiocy have evaporated my entire savings and made me painfully aware of how much I suck at money. If not those mistakes, I would have found another way. Money is no more than numbers and paper to me. I can try and think of something in terms of hours worked, but that also has no meaning to me. I cannot conceptualize it. If I did not have a sizeable excess of money in the last year, I don't think I could have made it even a month.

4.) How do I learn about building meaningful romantic relationships? Now that chasing dopamine is no longer the sole purpose for my existence, I have decided that I think I kinda might wanna get married some day. Maybe even have a kid or something like that. But I've done the math, and it shows that I have spent approximately 99.42% of my life as a single man. I do not have the first clue about anything in this realm. I am losing weight and trying to work towards the looks that once drew the attention of a few girls when I was younger, but that's about as far as I have planned for and know that looks are far from enough.

5.)What is the measure of a decent man? What example should I work towards if I want to create a fulfilling life for myself and those around me?

6.) So the friend I spoke about, I still care for him dearly. He does not have the same proactively destructive relationship with drugs that I did, but he is the picture perfect definition of a stoner. He works a dead end package pushing job, has no ambition, smokes all day, drinks when he gets the opportunity to party, does little but play video games in his free time, and takes psychedelic drugs explicitly for the high. He also has been single for roughly the same amount of his life as I have, despite actively trying unlike I have. When he isn't high, he is intelligent and a joy to be around. He was my polar opposite, the vulgar to my uptight, the funny to my serious, the actively immature to my I-think-I-am-mature-but-am-really-a-prick, the prom king to my teachers pet(literally, we both got elected these titles). Its a wonder that we ended up as friends. He has no desire other than to relax and enjoy life. It's like an anti-buddha.  Where as the spiritual guy freed himself from all desire and is admired, this friend wishes for hookups and uses substances to stimulate happiness. Is that an okay way to live? A lifestyle which will leave him with gratitude at his younger self and the contentment of a fulfilling life? If it is not, what can a do for him to make him desire something else?

7.)How to not be an ass? I am serious, I say some dumb, selfish things and want to leave a positive impact on people's lives, rather than a negative one. Especially with how many negative impacts I have created thus far...

&amp;#x200B;

As for anyone who wants to answer that God/Jesus/Allah/Buddah/Shiva/The One/Other spiritual caring being loves me and to seek him out, I am working on it. I understand the value a good community can bring to someone's life.  When I find a community which exemplifies their moral teachings and can lead me to becoming a right man, a ""good fruit"", then I will join them.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time!!!"

Even if I get many downvotes, hopefully the mods won't remove this because I want this to be a reminder to myself in the future.

I did a 9-month co-op at a tiny tiny company starting 2020. First 3 months I did very well and they loved me and gave me my own customer project as an intern, but then I fucked up big time on a customer project and they held that as a grudge and did not give me a full-time offer in August 2021. I was too embarrassed about not getting an offer, so I told everyone I know that this company is actually giving me an offer, but it is too low and I want to take a risk and apply for better offers.

I knew nothing about Leetcode in Aug 2021 and fell into deep depression, and succumbed to my ADHD until October 2021. I started applying in October for full time SWE positions.

My first OA was Twitter, which every applicant got one automatically. I did not get a single testcase correctly. I started leetcoding like once per week since my best friend was doing it.

The plan was to graduate in Dec 2021, but I was failing my classes so I had to extend my visa (I'm international std) and plan to grad in Spring 2022. 

From October to December 2021: failed Roblox OA, failed IMC OA, Twilio said I did great and kept sending me emails until now, but no interview. I got Goldman Sachs Hireview interview, which I prepared for so much but failed miserably nonetheless. I got Amazon OA, which had 2 questions, I got 1 and only passed one testcase for question 2. I did good on TikTok, Palantir, and SambaNova OAs.

Jamuary 2022: I got interviews for TikTok, Palantir, and SambaNova Systems. Sambanova actually passed me to the final round, but then the second interviewer asked what is a cache, and I had no idea what that is. He then asked how are local variables stored in C, I had no idea either. Failed my first final interview, felt pretty shit, and I was burnt out. I did well on Palantir's interview, but they rejected me anyway. I had an awful interview experience with TikTok and expected nothing, but they just gave me a second interview last week and I bombed it.

February 2022: somehow Amazon gave me final round with 3x45. I leetcoded for 5 days straight before the interview. First interviewer gave me a directory and asked me to write ""maintainable production code"" on a short question. I was confused AF and wrote some class and she said this is not maintainable. I had to pretend that my wifi connection is becoming weak and I could not hear her, but in reality, I did not know how tf to write ""maintainable production code"". At the end, I admitted I did terribly, and coasted through the next 2 interviews.

Meta recruiter reached out and gave me a LC interview. Auto rejected next day. At this point, I have made peace with the fact that I am going back home after graduation with no jobs. I was sad, but I had to convince myself that it is okay. I am too burnt out to keep applying. I made peace  with the fact that I didn't get into Ivy League in 2017, so why would why I get into FAANG now? My soul is tired. I probably need to go home and rest. Bc of the pandemic, I have not met my parents since 2019. 

I got an offer last week for FAANG. If you actually read my rant, you will know which one. It felt great, but I have a deep understanding for those who are still on the grind, especially those with ADHD. It is such a soul crushing process, and I was a lucky one. I sincerely hope those who are burnt out to find the strength to keep going. If you choose to give up, I hope you find peace and accept that it is okay, even though it is so hard to do so. 

In Vietnamese, there is a saying: Thua keo này, bày keo khác. It means if you lose this round, start planning for a different round, or something like that. Idk. Thanks for coming to my ted talk."
ss52mm,1,2022-02-14,Did I do the right thing?,anwrootbeer17,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ss52mm/did_i_do_the_right_thing/,"Me (27F) and my boyfriend (28M) had been together for 4 years. We met in vet school and graduated together. After graduating, I went on to do an internship at a university, and he went into private practice. He had the option of moving to the same area as me, but chose somewhere 7 hours away (it was his choice, I don't blame him for it. He really wanted to live in that part of the country). So for the past 8 months we've been long distance. 

I want to specialize, which will require another 1 year internship and a 3 year residency, minimum. It's something I've wanted my whole life. He knew about this when we started dating. But, as I'm applying for the next step, he continues to say passive aggressive things such as ""it's hard seeing my partner go through this stressful thing"" and ""I wish you would just go into practice"". I have mentioned on several occasions that I wish he would show more support, as this is stressful and it would be nice to have my partner backing me up. It still has not changed. 

There have also been incidents where he says very hurtful things to me. Once, he got very drunk and told me ""[he] was a better person without me"". Another time, he got mad at me about a difference in opinion and told me to ""go f myself"". He does have an anger problem and I have mentioned therapy, which he had promised to look into and has not. 

I guess the deciding reason was that he always seems to have a negative attitude, like the world is out to get him. Every inconvenience is a blow-up and suddenly the world is ending. I have tried to tell him that all the negativity really affects me and that I wish he could start looking at the positive sides of things. Again, nothing has changed. 

We have had multiple arguments that were almost the end of the relationship, the most recent being 3 weeks ago. I realized two days ago that I couldn't do this anymore and I was miserable in the relationship, so today I called him and officially ended it. He claimed he was blindsided, and the conversation included him calling me heartless and claiming I never cared about him. I get I probably deserved the anger, but I do feel some guilt about ending it. Overall I do feel it was the right choice, but did I go about this the wrong way? This is the worst I've ever felt after a breakup"

Am găsit după aceea ceva ce îmi place și anume JavaScript iar de 10/11 luni doar asta învat, totuși îmi place sa lucrez în React pentru ca mi se pare ca aceasta librărie face JavaScript sa fie mult mai ușor, bineînțeles am tot lucrat în JavaScript am luat-o usor nu m am dus direct sa învăț react. Acum eu cred ca sunt ok  și ma descurc , vreau sa fac niște proiecte mai mari sa le pun în portofoliu și poate sa îmi găsesc și un job. Intrebare e, cum sa fac asta? Nu știu unde sa o apuc , ma gândesc sa găsesc un internship dar nu știu unde sa ma uit și ce sa fac. Ar trebui sa am un cv ? Și dacă da, ce ar trebui sa pun în el? Am 23 de ani și nu am lucrat niciodată , deoarece ei bine sunt în scaun cu rotile iar asta ma cam împiedicat, nu m am putut duce la facultate din motive cred eu evidente deci am doar liceul asa ca nu știu ce sa fac sincer , dacă cineva îmi poate da niște informații as fi super recunoscător."

Will I be able to possibly grab an internship at Jane Street or Hudson River trading if I go to school there?

Would only going to a top 10-15 CS school qualify me?

Internships like that are sparse regardless and I am not counting on it, but I also really want a career as an SWE working on financial subjects. I am from the east coast so I plan on just getting a summer internship at a bank or hedge fund and trying to do well at Madison, is that a good plan, or should I reconsider my plan of action?"

Original Post:

**My Education:** I am currently in the 3rd year of a Higher Institute of Technical Education (Austrian specific) where I specialise in IT and Management and which I believe is roughly the equivalent of 5th year of Irelands secondary school in where you are around 17 years old.

**Now to the core of my question:** Do you guys have any recommendations for ways to look for a summer internship which only requires 3 years of secondary school CS classes and not an ongoing Bachelor's or Master's degree? I also once heard that ""non degree"" internships are not really a thing in Ireland, I wanted to ask if this is true.  
A friend of mine and I have been looking for these kinds of internships in Ireland for quite some time now, and we just couldn't find them on LinkedIn and other similar sites.  
We have to do an internship for school and also wanted to improve our English, so we found out that ErasmusPlus (our School has its own kind of connections) would sponsor us if we'd go to a country which is in the EU and then concluded, that we want to go to Ireland. Our goal is to find internships for both of us in the same city in order for us to share a room and also do stuff together on the weekends. Also we heard that the cost of living in Dublin is currently pretty high, so we have been looking for internships in the different not ""as big"" cities, like Limerick.

So I wanted to ask if you guys would maybe have some tips for us, where to start looking for internships and some accommodation recommendations.

Thank you all in advance :D"

I’ve been studying IT since high school, currently going into my Jr year of college. I finished an AA in network technologies this month and I’m moving into a bachelors in Cyber Sec. I have some experience doing desktop support for small companies, I did a couple internships, and I’m currently in a full time roll as a network technician for MFPs (printers…ugh) while I continue my education. This summer I’d like to do some independent study and grab my first certification. I went through the Cisco Netacad at my college and really loved CCNA, however that was almost a year ago and to take that test it’ll require some serious studying. Another option is Net+, which will require far less studying but I feel holds less weight. I’m stuck as to which one to focus on. Outside of this, I feel I should be moving into a broader helpdesk role to keep learning at work. Printers have about 3 functions and in the 9 months I’ve been doing it I feel like I’m plateauing. 
What did you guys do to land a higher paying job?"

ssf8oq,1,2022-02-14,Everyone's b*tch,Just1MoreSarah,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ssf8oq/everyones_btch/,"

I'm gonna start with some background. Sorry in advance for any spelling errors. English is my second language and I'm on mobile and long story.

I started studying civil Engineering in the Second half of 2020. An year later, I tried to sell a notebook I was not using anymore and this chick asked If I could Go to her Workplace for her Boss aprove the buy, since the Company was the one paying. Since It was near home, I agreed.
While I waited for them to decide If my notebook was good enough, the HR Guy started talking with me (small Company, the chick was sharing the room with him and some other emploees). He asked what I was studying and I answered. He said that maybe they'll open a internship position in my area and asked for my resumee.
Luckly I had a digital version on my phone, so I sent him right away.
A month later same HR Guy asks me If I could be there for an Interview. Almost Said ""hell yeah"", but an ""yes, sir"" came out. In the Interview (after 3h wainting past the apointment) they said I would be like an assistant to THE GUY of the Company (It was a construction Company). THE GUY was an old Man, who strugles with tecnology but was a genious in construction. I said I could do It and started right away even though I never looked for this job in the First place.

The sh*t went Crazy when, two weeks after THE GUY went on forced vacation (he had acumulated a Lot of vacation time and in Brazil it's against work laws). And that was my hell begining.
You see, I was like his personal assistant. When he was gone, I was no longer THE GUY's assistant. I became everyone's b*tch. Not only I was the New employee. I was the new INTERN employee. Needless to say that I became involved in almost every department. They also strongly advised me to assume the Billings department. An intern. With several responsabilities. Buying everything from toilet paper to trucks of sand and concrete.
Also, the Company decided to invest in a quality Seal. I was the one to do the heavy work. Digitalizing and cataloging every Bill and contract to the quality team. I was the first one in, last one out. Four people had the keys to the building and only 2 the alarm code. Now I had both. Until...
My Second paycheck came. Way bigger than the First, obviously. I was supose to work from 8am to 3pm. I had to leave at 5pm at least to complete the daily tasks. 3h of extra pay everyday does wonders right? Wrong.
My Boss was pissed because I was getting this amount of overtime and told me to leave on the time we initialy agreed. I tried to convince him otherwise, but he wouldn't budge.

The next day I was even a little relieved that I was leaving on time. It went away fast. THE GUY had returned from his vacation in all his glory.
He Saw me, I saw him, he pointed to his office (used to be our office before vacation). He calls every project chief and me to a Meeting. He says all the things he would implement while I was panicking. You see... I Just had my hours cut and needed to make 10 hour job fit into 6, combining billing, quality and some project supervision. Now I have assisting THE GUY back in the list. I rushed to my Boss office to beg him to reconsider the hours or remove some responsability. Told him It simply wasn't humanly possible. I got a big NO.
So I did what I was told. Rushed what I could, what I couldn't would be tomorrow problem.
They were furious I couldn't deliver anymore. When they tried to fire me, I pulled my resignation letter from my purse. Just wouldn't give them the satisfaction."

Initially I had planned on working as a SWE, and building on from my previous experience as a SWE intern.  

And for some context on how I got the job - I applied to a pretty big IT company, which offered a new grad program for CS students that funnelled them to different roles - SWE, QA, DevOps, etc. And I was lucky enough that my current team took me. Although I have no DevOps experience, the team took me despite knowing that.

And I took this role because, I thought it would put me in a unique position in my career:

1) I understand that the DevOps role is usually for people who have years of experience 
2) Having mostly development experience, I also wanted to have experience on the operations side

Where I need advice on is my focus on learning.
I am overwhelmed with the plethora of tools and concepts that are out there. And I understand that the tools we use will always change. 

So if we’re speaking of core concepts/knowledge/principles that will carry througout my career (irrespective of tools) what should I know? What should my foundation of knowledge be strong in? Would that be that be OS concepts, networking, sysadmin, etc.?

Many thanks for reading this post"

My excel sheet where I track applications is up to the 700th entry, with hundreds of X marks next to each one that goes back to 2020. Rarely do I get to the phone screen, but even more rare I finally make it to the final round, which actually happened recently. I made the fatal flaw of fantasizing about the offer I didn't get and imaging the years long losing streak ending with the first bullet point under ""work experience"" on my resume. 

Unfortunately, got the standard ""Thank you for your interest in career opportunities with..."" email back just now, which didn't really effect me until I browsed the CS career discord and saw that someone got the offer from the same exact company, the same day I got rejected. Seeing everyone snag great internships or even mediocre ones just makes me more spiteful towards the industry since I'm already pouring 6-8 hours every day into building bigger and better projects to impress recruiters who don't think I'm worth answering emails for. Some recruiter was laughing while he was demoing my website on Zoom, there wasn't even anything comedic about it bruh there was an entire paragraph about the bridge collapse in Meixco city that killed 20 people. 

At the end of the day I'm not dejected or low spirited, it just makes me more determined out of spite to land something this summer and refine my skills until they're the ones emailing me to apply. I'm already sacrificing the majority of my time every day on applying and programming, so I'm past the point of burning out. I'll do everything in my power to get something, so expect a post in 3 months that looks a lot like the top post right now bragging about failure. We'll make it bros.

I have work experience but only from retail and I have not had success with retail experience so I don't want it on my resume. What I am trying to ask is what are viable IT based projects I can add on my resume?  


I've created my own AD using VirtualBox,  
used PacketTracer to design and emulate a network in realtime,  
I also learned how to configure a cisco router and create VLANs while doing this,  
these are just somethings I've done at home while trying to find some sort of direction. I can't create a home server until I get my own place. It's not much but I don't know what else to put on my resume if I don't have that much experience in the field  


I have taken some college courses, like computer programming and networking. I know how to terminate a patch cable, create private networks with physical switches/routers  


In my internship, I setup anywhere from 10-400 devices(macbooks, chromebooks, printers, etc) and connect it to their network. I created a bash script for doing the setup on macbooks but not very impressive, sourced most of it online. That's basically it. Most of my work comes from unboxing boxes. Never really troubleshoot because my its not really encouraged by peers(really disappointing, I really want the experience good or bad).  


I don't want this to seem like a post of things I've done, I just want to know if I can talk about ANY of these topics to make my resume look good. I'm burned out from not hearing replies. I don't want to fail. I see everyone else succeeding, I even had people I tutored in IT topics get jobs but I am worried how things are going.   


TLDR; I need to fluff up my resume, what projects can I put on it besides creating a home server?"
ssi72j,18,2022-02-14,Advice for a struggling wannabe Dev?,The_Craican,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/ssi72j/advice_for_a_struggling_wannabe_dev/,"Gonna preface this in advance to warn I may get a bit rambley.

So basically I'm a 27 yo from the Independent Nation of Donegal, like most people on this board I imagine, I've had a passion for software, computers and anything related and am determined to make a career out of it as candidly speaking I feel like it's the only career path I have a natural aptitude for and interest in and can be proud of.

So the passion is there, however the education has been a bit of a challenge for me, my secondary school offered no computing or I.T related classes (despite having 3 fully equipped computer rooms) and there were none in the vacinity, this lead me a lot of self learning from a young age and developing a very ""figure it out as I go/ poke it and see what happens"" approach which I feel does have its upsides and down sides.

After school I didn't get the best L.C (lack of attention/interest more than ability) so went the YouthReach route and managed to get into NWRC in Derry but ended up dropping out due to building personal issues and the suicide of my best friend, I worked dead end jobs/Doled for a few years before getting back into I.T through ETB (SOLAS, FÁS, whatever their calling themselves for the next 5 years) on a Software Development course, the actual content of this course was surprisingly solid/diverse and gave me a good brush up and solid foundation with C#, Java, SQL, CSS/HTML and various other topics, this course actually ended with a very positive (from my perspective at least) months internship with Pramerica in Letterkenny, where I gained some experience with designing automated tests.

Unfortunately however this internship happened at the same time as Pramerica was being taken over and a hiring freeze was in place, at the time I wasn't too worried and thought I'd find work in the New Year, however the New Year only brought Covid and as I'm sure everyone remembers the shit kinda hit the fan.

I was unemployed for most of Covid and attempted to do a CompTIA+ course, while I found the course itself manageable enough my head and heart really just weren't in it trying to deal with life during the last couple of years and after dragging it out eventually let it fall by the wayside.

Recently took a turn of luck by landing a job at a local factory last August and finally got myself back on my feet, it's a basic minimum wage factory job but I'm honestly grateful and happy to have it and go into work with that attitude every day, however I also realise it's definitely not something I'll be happy doing for the rest of my life, I've gotten myself back on my feet but now it's time to start taking steps forward and building some momentum.

To this end I looked up Springboard courses after hearing about it on the radio, I found two offered by LYIT I liked the look of, Software Development and Cybersecurity (big personal interest and I see major oppertunies coming in the field both in short and long term in Ireland and abroad) however the application dates were long passed, I reached out anyway figuring ""dont ask, don't get"" for any help or guidance.

I received a reply today informing me that I likely wouldn't qualify regardless with my current qualifications, but pointed me towards the Full Stack Software Developer course offered by Code Institute, after looking at it however the cheapest payment plan is  basically €6k up front, or various payment plans, cheapest being €355 a month for 18 months.

That's a big commitment for minimum wage so was hoping to get some feedback/perspective on whether it's worth the investment or if there's possibly better options for me? Really any kind of advice would be appreciated, I know i want to have a career in some sort of computing/tech field as it's my only passion I can really make a career out of and all I can really see myself doing but I'm just struggling to get my foot in and get the door open so any advice from anyone who's gotten through a similar situation would be particularly helpful.

TLDR:
Rare endangered Nerd variety of Donegal culchie seeks to get started in I.T but has had a bunch of set backs, please help this beautiful endangered creature today by advising him on how best to develop his skills or get his foot in the door."

Currently, I am struggling to find many career opportunities because it seems like the majority of 'entry level' listings require both experience with specific technologies I did not learn in College as well as 2-5 years professional experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been courted by companies like Revature and Revolent which offer paid training (Salesforce Certificates) with the tradeoff that I must commit to at least two years of work with a client firm that I do not select, and additionally seem to (at least initially) pay less than the average starting salary - 45-55k depending on location for the former and 60k for the latter as examples. 

Does anyone have any insight as to whether these companies are the way to go? I'm vacillating between feeling like I'm either being greedy to turn down such a deal as paid training and thinking I would be utterly gullible for signing away two years blindly with such an allegedly powerful degree. A potentially important piece of context is that I lack any internships but I did get commercial experience porting an application from iOS to Android for a startup as part of a capstone course.   

  

Huge thanks to anyone who read, hoping someone will have some insight!"

See that several older people are starting to post, I thought I would too since I’m trying to use this as a good source of experiences and advice.

I’m over 55. Due to the fact that I suspected this and now that I’m out of a job (I’m a geek), everything finally came to a head when I tried to take some classes on line and couldn’t focus/concentrate. At the time I was seeing a therapist through the VA and was put on a waiting list for testing (they did it in-house with interns). Then she left and I was placed with an outside contractor that is pretty phenomenal. 

In the interim, I was trying to find out how to get tested. This was in the first year of the pandemic and of course I couldn’t get tested. When things finally were more open, the only option was to find a psychiatrist that would do the testing, would be required to give up my current therapist, which I wasn’t willing to do. 

So, after 14 months, the VA finally finds a psychiatrist that will test me (who he puts off to one of his interns) and I finally get the diagnosis. 

I’m seeing a Psychiatrist at the VA who is prescribing Amphetamine/Dextroampetamine and I’m not seeing anything other than it’s helping with my anxiety and sleep.

Shouldn’t there be like “oh my gosh” moment? I know that there are several medications out there, but I’m thinking I need a different medication.

Please note that the VA is very strict with how much they dispense. So moving to a different medication will probably be difficult, but not impossible.

Thanks for listening to my tale. That is if you read this far. :o)"

He doesn't seem to mind doing this, but he always starts by asking me to change specific stuff in the code without explaining why and most of the conversation ends up just being him telling very specific things to do to see if they work, when I what I wanted was just some overall guidance on what try next.  I feel like all the troubleshooting he has me do is a waste of time because he doesn't explain how he knew to do each thing, so I'm not actually learning how to do it myself.  Plus, I don't really even want to him to just tell me exactly what to do, even if he did explain it, because just giving me answers doesn't help me learn nearly as much as if he gave me more general guidance and then let me figure it out on my own.  Essentially, he gives me an hour long in depth session of him troubleshooting code through me by telling me exactly what to do, when what I wanted was a 10 minute conversation about what general steps I should take next to figure out the troubleshooting myself.  

I know I need to express this to him, but I don't know how to do it in a way that won't make me sound demanding or like I'm criticizing him, or otherwise risk alienating him.  He isn't my boss and we're technically on the same level of the company hierarchy in that we both report to the same manager, but I'm an engineering intern and he's a senior engineer in charge of the project and my manager told me he'd be the one assigning me tasks.  Plus, he's the one who wrote the base code I've been working with, so I really can't afford to alienate.  

And, to be clear, it's not that he's done anything to make me think he's easily offended, but that I just don't know him very well at all.  He works almost exclusively remotely, so all our interactions have been via messaging and calls on Teams.

Mostly because I found SWE roles at my previous internship to be hopelessly boring, though vague prestige chasing is probably a sizable factor as well. This internship application cycle, I got slaughtered on the final rounds of firms (Optiver, citsec, ts, akuna, etc.) for research/trading roles. This is likely due to insufficient preparation, which is entirely my fault.

I currently only have two swe internship offers that are fine but not exceptional, and a quant dev intern offer at a quant fund. Now, the latter firm is supposedly fairly reputable in the industry, but it isn't a trading or research role. From what I've heard, the culture and treatment of devs is good at the firm, and devs are supposed to 'work closely with researchers', but I am not convinced that it isn't just going to end up being infra work.

I would like to apply again for trading/research next year when I graduate. I realize that many firms only really take on return interns for their new grad positions, so I am slightly anxious about my prospects. Would the quant dev internship aid me for the applications next year? I was having some difficulty getting past the resume screen for research roles at top firms, and mostly got interviews for trading roles. Also, would it be possible/likely to transition between quant dev and trading/research? I've gotten very different answers from different firms when I asked the interviewers about this.

If the quant dev internship isn't going to help my chances next year, I might just pass on it.

ssprcs,0,2022-02-14,Should I leave a job I enjoy only for more money?,keyboardmassager,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ssprcs/should_i_leave_a_job_i_enjoy_only_for_more_money/,"I have an ideal gig as a software engineer in the public sector where I’m full remote, have autonomy, minimal meetings, and get to work on challenging and interesting problems supporting a mission that improves people’s lives. I enjoy working with all my colleagues, and get to spend near 100% of my time writing code. I also never have to work over 40 hours a week, no weekends, and no on-call. My pay has been increasing steadily beyond inflation with two 3%ish pay increases a year (more this year due to inflation). There’s no mandatory attrition or layoffs.

The only negative is I make way less than I could in commercial companies. Staying here, my pay ceiling is around 200-220k after 2 more promotions which could take years. I’m financially comfortable and all of my needs are met with enough left to save for retirement and spend on wants, but I don’t have enough to also save for a house down-payment quickly without sacrificing the other parts (although I’m not 100% sold on the idea of home ownership).

Reading posts on reddit and blind has really made me wonder if I can make significantly more money, so I’ve started interviewing mostly with companies that don’t LC (leetcode), but I’m not excited or passionate about any of the products or role descriptions for anything I’ve applied for. The for-profit motivations seem to distill the SWE role to a grunt building products I don’t care about and don’t use. I fear if I take one of these jobs I’ll be miserable since I won’t be motivated about the product I’ll work on.

Unfortunately, the more I read online threads, the more afraid I get about potentially leaving a good environment for a toxic one just because of the money. Stories about mandatory attrition, crazy work hours to meet unrealistic expectations, and bad managers scare me. I know most people who are happy with their job probably wouldn’t be posting about it on blind, but the negativity is getting to me. I’ve spent my entire full-time career so far in the public sector, but I have done internships at multiple commercial companies across different industries during college. I was mostly shielded from workplace politics during those, but my general feeling about them were pretty mediocre.

Am I making a mistake to consider leaving such an ideal work environment only for money? Should I take the risk for potentially live changing sums of money? How likely am I to find a position paying market rate in the private sector while maintaining a healthy work environment?

TL;DR Is it a mistake to leave an ideal work environment only for money?

I’m trying not to get kicked off.,Skel_Estus,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sspt7d/spouses_employer_doing_full_health_insurance/,"I get my health benefits through my wife and have been for the past six years (we actually got legally married the day after I turned 26 because I needed health insurance because my narcolepsy medication costs $300+ a month and I’ve had a few bouts of cancer).

It was announced last week at her place of employment that a group of auditors were going to come in to perform an audit and make sure that everyone on the health plan was eligible. I was not eligible for insurance when we got married as I was just an intern, but there’s a rule (not sure if it’s a new rule or existing one) for her workplace’s insurance that says, “If your spouse is eligible for insurance at his or her place of employment, they are ineligible for this plan.”

No only are they looking into my eligibility, but they want tax documents, mortgage statements, marriage certificates, the adoption papers from when I adopted her son, birth certificates for everyone, amongst other things.

She marked me as ineligible and now I have to  have my employer complete a counter document that basically wants them to confirm if I’m eligible for insurance under my employers plan.

I just got a new job at a small company and my boss said that he’s be ok with backing a “probationary period” of ineligibility until next year, but I wish there was a reason for ineligibility we could put down that’s both legitimate and not a huge red flag. I don’t want to get my employer in any hot water because this is dangerously close to fraud, but I don’t want to lose my spot on her plan. It’s a great plan and with my health concerns, it really helps us out.

Her employer also had a record revenue year, self insured, and came in well under their anticipated Covid losses.

Just sucks. One more reason to root for healthcare to not be tied to employment. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated, but I wanted to share my antiwork woes."

While I was there, a position opened up that my then-supervisor suggested I applied to. I did so, then the pandemic hit and I lost my internship + there was a hiring freeze.
Flash forward to 2022, I've been working full-time since I graduated college 2 years ago and have been comfortable. Last month the same position that I applied to in 2020 at the public agency was posted on their website and I applied to it once again. This time around, I was recently notified that my name was placed on an eligibility list.
I haven't spoken to my supervisor from the internship for about a 12-18 months. We had a good relationship while I was there, but since I had to leave it has essentially been non-existent outside of being connections on LinkedIn. I didn't list them as a reference on my application, but again we had a good working relationship while I was an intern and I did good work while I was there.
My question is - would it be appropriate for me to reach out to my old supervisor when I was an intern? Not sure what I would say in the event that I do, not sure what is appropriate to say. On one hand, I'm really interested in the position and would like to work there - on the other hand, I don't want to be that guy that comes from out of the blue now that it benefits my interests."

ssswpn,110,2022-02-14,Note on FAANG Recruitment (and CS in general),[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ssswpn/note_on_faang_recruitment_and_cs_in_general/,"Context: I'm currently 4th year finishing the application cycle for CS jobs. I've gotten into many companies including FAANG. My top choice and the future job will be at Google, entry-level.

I went to a T5 CS school, T5 USNews school, and was definitely way over-obsessed about prestige...mostly due to my high school/environment but that is beside the point.

Anyways, as everyone knows, FAANG takes A LOT of kids from the 'top schools,' but after actually going through the process and comparing to some of my friends who went to our state flagship school (ranked in the 40/50s), I can completely dismiss any notion that your school name alone actually gives you any tangible benefit.

And by that I mean, literally, every single one of my friends got the same exact results as me. We all had the same exact resumes (i.e. same internship types, 1 every summer, research, etc.) and although they were at different locations/companies, practically I would say our resumes were equal. We were all 'good' students and probably the same type of student metric-wise and academic-ability-wise; I was just lucky during college admissions. 

Effectively what I'm trying to say is literally the only reason you see these mass recruitments from top schools is simply because the best applicants aggregate there, by virtue of the admissions process. Probably 80% of Stanford CS students are just genuinely hard-working and intelligent CS students, but they'd be the same students if they were transferred to another school. Ergo, selection bias.

I firmly believe that if you can get anywhere from anywhere as long as you actually do your due diligence starting freshman year, and actually develop a competitive profile with real evidence to support your ability."

Will it be a hinderance that I haven’t taken too many classes? Or will I be good by the time the interviews roll around? If so, what steps and general guideline can I follow to put myself in a good position? Thanks"

I was just looking to gain some insight as to what my day to day might look like. In the interview, the guy and I really clicked. 

He mentioned they get swamped with new product setups, he said usually the purchasing department put in their own products. He said they have some complicated pricing, looking for someone to set products up the right way with pricing.

“New product setups. Products change all the time, vendors change, they come out with new products, they update their products. We’re constant setting up new product number, description, weights and units, assigning pricing records…assigning different types of units.

PC troubleshooting, that’s another one. Either something’s wrong with the wireless connection or they can’t, for some reason, get into our software, which is browser based. We use Google chrome to access our application, so sometimes the cache needs emptied or whatever.

On top of that, we have to do updates in pricing in the system. Sometimes the vendors send us update sheets in excel or txt or other formats, multiple formats. We have to get that data into a format that our system recognizes so we can update the pricing. 

We have an automated job that runs—so we have to put it in a certain format and then we schedule it and the system grabs it and updates the pricing. But sometimes there’s a lot of prep work getting it into that format. Mostly done in excel.”

Also, what are V-lookups? He asked me if I know how to do V lookups. Is this difficult to learn? 


I have a feeling I will be using excel a bunch also. Does anyone have a recommendation for relearning excel? Like Udemy or YouTube?

Anyways, I’m starting in 2 weeks. Just wondering what you all think of what my job will be like based on what my interviewer said. TIA!!"

sswcdw,0,2022-02-15,Summer SDE Internship MathWorks vs Amazon Offer Comparison,Financial_Reach_7104,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sswcdw/summer_sde_internship_mathworks_vs_amazon_offer/," Hello! I’m a junior student and currently I have two offers for the 2022 summer internship, MathWorks (EDG cs major) and Amazon (SDE).

The duration of the two internships is similar, while the salary from Amazon is higher (\~$50+/hr) than that of Mathworks ($35/hr). I know Amazon is a big tech company and is a very good option for a software engineer, but the reason I'm hesitating between these two offers is I have some engineering background, and I'd like to pursue an engineering-related path in the future. I know that MathWorks is quite good at math/physics/engineering/computation, so I think it might potentially help me with my future path (e.g. build connections with engineers).

So my questions are,

* If I work in MathWorks as a software engineer intern (probably in the ""Matlab features"" group or ""optimize computation"" group), can I improve my engineering skills by interacting with other people?
* If both positions are pure programming/developing (no difference between the daily task), which one do you suggest if I want to pursue an engineering path in the future?
* Will working in Amazon makes me look like a pure software engineer and not good for an engineering resume?

Thank you very much for reading this! Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!"

ssx0n6,0,2022-02-15,just discovered that I might be an Accidental American and that has put me into bit of a pickleish situation. Any advice would be appreciated :),Maybe_Im_Murican,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ssx0n6/just_discovered_that_i_might_be_an_accidental/,"Update: Yes, I am almost certainly American according to the US embassy. The embassy staff were quite quick and efficient. All I have to do now is to somehow get rid of it, without much trouble.

I (26F), was born in America as a surprise baby to my parents who were visiting America at the time. Both my parents are Indian citizens. My parents registered my birth in the consulate and therefore, I am an Indian citizen by registration. Both my parents are also Indian citizens.

I have never been to the USA since I was about 2 or 3 months old and I have continuously being living my life in India as an Indian citizen.

I have a US birth certificate issued by a town in Massachusetts, but I have never used it. In lieu of my US birth certificate, I have always been using my birth registration certificate issued by the Indian consulate in New York. I've never had to use my US birth certificate.

The main reason that I am in a bit of a pickle is that I have been invited to a research internship with a University in California and me and my boyfriend are planning to go there for the three year long internship.

The main problem is that in my Indian passport, my Place of Birth is listed as the town in Massachusetts where I was born. As I just found out that the USA uses birth right citizenship, I am wondering if that means that I would be an American citizen? My preliminary searching suggests so, but I could be wrong. As US law requires American citizens to enter the USA using an US passport, would I be in trouble in immigration?

Also, the government of India does not allow dual citizenship. I have been living my life in India, but I have never formally renounced any US citizenship. I am lucky to have a sufficient income to be taxed in the USA, due to a business I set up, but I have never opened such a taxable account, nor have I ever dealt with the IRS or even have what is called a social security number. I have been searching online about these issues, but I am confused about them.

When setting up all my financial and bank accounts here in India, I've been ticking that I am not a US citizen for taxation purposes as I genuinely didn't know. Even when setting up my personal taxation PAN number, or my TIN number, I stated that I am not a US citizen or resident for taxation purposes. That is also a mess that I would have to sort out. That means here in India, I have legally stated that I am not a US citizen for taxable purposes and have never dealt with anything regarding US tax.

As US citizens have to enter the country with a US passport, so if I actually turn out to be American I wouldn't be able to enter on the US passport.

Therefore, I was thinking of first checking with the US embassy here if I have citizenship and if so, renouncing it. I am prepared to go myself and do so and pay for the renunciation. My issue is with taxation, I have had an income high enough after most deductions to be taxed in a high income bracket in the USA (according to my rough calcs now), for the last two years. That means that if it turn out that I am a citizen, I would be owing the US IRS a lot of money. Would they allow me to renounce the citizenship without even paying the required amount to the IRS? Would I be liable to a US charge like tax evasion even though I was not aware? What solutions does the US IRS have, if it ends up that yes, I was an US citizen and I ended up owing a bunch of back taxes to the USA?

((Renouncing my Indian passport and taking US citizenship is not an option for me as India does not allow dual citizenship, I plan to live my life here in India and if I renounce Indian citizenship to go to the USA, it would take around 5 to 7 years for me to get it back. ))

I am also wondering if I should find an attorney here that specialises in such cases.

Sorry for the long post as English is not my first language and thanks in advance for any help. Also sorry for any repetitions.

Edit: As far as I know, India allows dual citizenship till that age of 18 and then you have to choose whether you will be an Indian citizen or if you will be of the other country. I never did anything as such, because I wasn't even aware of a potential American citizenship. I just continued living in India as an Indian."

Growing up I had to make my own system to try to understand people around me, and even to try to be understood. It has taken me all these years and I still don't understand what's wrong with me. 

The first attempt was because I felt worthless. To my parents, to my ""friends"" and that I had nothing to offer. Couldn't keep on my studies, couldn't get a job, I failed at every single thing I tried, sports, art, science, you name it. I called who I thought was my best friend at the time
I tried to cut my wrist but after not cutting deep enough I froze. I didn't feel fear, nor regret. I just froze. My body didn't listen to me. And that's something I regret to this day. I couldn't do it. Later that day my parents found out. My mother offered me to end it all with her. It's not what I wanted of course because I wanted them to be happy and I thought I was in the way of their happiness. My father told me that he would die without me and I asked him ""why? I'm not a good son. I'm nothing. Just making you waste time, effort and resources."" To what he answered ""because I love you more than anything my son"" and I replied again ""why? I haven't done anything worthy of that"" to what he said ""it's not your feeling. It's mine. No matter what you think""... To this day I still don't understand that..

After that I tried my best to keep on going. I started studying once again and keep on living.. but it was not the same in the least. I felt empty. Completely empty. Tried to hold on to anything and anyone for a reason or motivation to keep going because I felt like I was just living to keep my parents alive (of course, I don't blame them) but not for me. I got to therapy, medicines, psychiatrists, psychologists. Not once I had a clear answer of what was happening to me. I got to meet new people, made ""friends"" and had some ""relationship"" for a few years after that.. but I still felt the same emptiness.

4 years ago I was still trying to get a career. I was trying my very best and my hardest to live normally. Suddenly got sick and couldn't pay college anymore. I had a scholarship (when if you get good grades you don't have to pay. I think that's the word) and I lost it due to being unable to even go to classes. My mom had left to another country, my ""best"" friend wasn't even my friend anymore, my father was living in another city and the person I loved the most at the time couldn't be with me. I was all alone. I fell into despair once again. It seems my mom noticed, and went back right away. Once again I felt I was in the way of her and her happiness.

A few months after she went back to our country she wanted to take a quick vacation. Which I didn't want to be a part of. I was thinking of hanging myself once she left. She didn't. Instead she took the last of her savings and told me to leave to another country to see if a change of scenery would help me. Soon after I moved to the country in which I'm living now. Nothing came to a better.

I came with a ""friend"" who I also lended money to because he didn't have enough to leave. On the first day after we arrived he left me alone. I had no job, nowhere to stay and nobody to help me. I was all alone again. But the change of scenery worked as intended. I was thrilled about having a chance to become who I wanted, even if I didn't knew what I wanted. I found a job and had a long distance relationship with someone in my native country. Things then began to fall apart again.

I couldn't handle the distance. And neither could my partner. But I was obsessed with being a couple with her. She helped me grow and feel things I had never felt before. Sadly distance is quite ferocious when it comes to relationships. I got to meet to other people who were working with me. Both of them told me they didn't want anything serious but acted otherwise. I treated them as partners both. Then I couldn't handle the pressure of the job and everything collapsed. I broke up with the girl from my native country and the people in my work didn't want to be with me anymore. The ""friend"" who left me alone on the first day, who was working with me because I gave him the opportunity didn't help me at all. Didn't even pay back the money I lend him. I found myself crying in my breaks almost everyday at work. Finally I decided to quit since I was falling apart and couldn't handle it.

The next months I tried my best once again to find my way. I started training, and even bought a guitar. I took classes of every sort. From photography to music. I was trying to be happy for once with the things I liked. And I wanted to show that to my now ex-partner back in my country.

I couldn't find another job. My ex got someone else. I fractured both of my ankles. So I was left with nothing one again. It was around my birthday when all went down. I had been with antidepressants for a while after I lost my job. But the loneliness on my birthday was the last drop. I tried to commit suicide again by taking a bunch of medicines and alcohol and went to sleep. I woke up next day groggy as hell and had to call the cops to get me an ambulance. I spent the whole day in the hospital. The doctors wanted to intern(? Like hospitalize) me due to depression but I escaped. I don't know why. The next day I was kicked out of where I lived because of what I tried. So I became homeless.

During that time I enlisted in a college near where I lived. Trying to hold on to something again. There I met a girl. I like her a lot but she was way out of my league and I was to broken to try anything because I knew it'd end badly. For some reason still unknown to me, this girl helped me, as I was living on the streets, she invited me to live with her until I could find a job. She was broken as well and I tried to help her as I felt indebted with her, and after all I had been through I really didn't want anyone to feel the same way I did. 

I lived with her for a few days only. She had a sort of boyfriend and a job. I kept her company as a friend. But suddenly she started crumbling as well. And asked me to leave. I had to get loans so I could move somewhere else. I wasn't angry with her. I really understood what she was going through so I left. Time after, she didn't want to know anything about me anymore. And I was alone once again.

Getting to live somewhere else kept my mind busy. And looking for a job wasn't easy so I was all busy. I met an older woman (42) that had a child with Asperger's syndrome as well, we talked about it and decided that I could be his therapeutic assistant. But things took a weird turn. I ended up living with them and she became my partner. Needless to say, it didn't end well. She didn't want to pay me for being his kids assistant and wanted me to get a job to pay for expenses. I didn't like the way she put but I thought I had to. I mean, I did have to get another job, as the assistant thing was not appropriate with that relationship going on. 

I found a few jobs. But didn't last long in any of those. And the relationship started to degrade. I was able to get food and basic stuff. But she wanted more. I got robbed near her house and got the insurance for my phone. She told me to give the money to her so she could get me a better phone and I did. A few months later she said she was pregnant. So got her a test. She said it was positive but I didn't see it, I mean, why would she lie? Then I got a more stable job and she helped me get a credit card. I got her to the doctors to check on the embryo and all those things I had never thought I'd have to do. I thought I was going to be a father. 3 months after, none of the results which I took her to came back positive. I was starting to get tired. She didn't want to go to work, she didn't get me the phone she promised saying that it was the rent I had to pay to her (she owned the house) like a landlord, and she wanted to use my card, and the pregnant thing just puffed out of existence.

I saved every single cent I had to get another place to live and left. But as I didn't trust her anymore I got cops to help me take out my stuff from her house. She didn't let me take a single item. Not even my documents (passport, ID, titles, certified grades, etc.) And I was left with nothing but the clothes I had on and a backpack with a t-shirt.

She was trying to convince me to get back to her. But she wouldn't let me get my stuff. She even got my mom on her side. Which got me to stop talking to her (my mom). I blocked her (my now ex) from everywhere as she tried called me 5 of 6 times a day. I couldn't handle all of that and it affected my job. This time I didn't quit, I was fired. And so I was left with nothing, and no one again. Not even my mother. I attempted once again and found myself in the same hospital.

In the hospital, people from a church invited me to their congregation place. There they helped me get some clothes and food, and a place to stay for a while until I got a job. Finally one of them helped me get a job. Which lasted about a week because then they got me another job which was much better. I knew nothing about this job but I gave my very best as usual. Got some place to live and food on my fridge thanks to this job. But I was scarred, broken and alone. I didn't feel the spirit from the church as I have been an atheist for more than a decade. I tried but it just didn't work for me.

In this job I had to get through some thick skulls to prove that I wanted the job. It was really hard. But I had been beaten a freaking lot already so I learned a few things and got things my way. Sadly, there is always someone else trying to break you. Someone started spouting lies an rumors about things I never said. Like I was throwing my partners under the bus, or getting paid more for telling on people. Which is quite delicate when there are a few people in your workplace and you have to work as a team. Little by little, one by one started to believe it. And I was so isolated in my area that I couldn't even work. As I said, it was a team job, and there are things that you literally cannot do alone. Frustration started taking over me again... As I did nothing wrong... I was a little push away from quitting my job again and going through the same thing from a few years back on my first job. But I hanged in there, ironically thanks to that previous experience. But that didn't mean I wasn't feeling it. Finally I was able little by little, day by day able to dissipate most rumors. But everything just became brittle. A single word and everything would collapse again. And I started panicking at the thought. I started to miss work days and stopped leaving my house unless it was necessary. 

I have been like this for over a year. And tried to meet people but nothing works. I feel so alone... I tried to contact a person whom I had some sort of relationship back in my country, but it was in vain. I tried my hardest, my very best in everything and nothing works. I'm still on antidepressants and getting therapy but I don't feel any better, just a little less worse. These last few months I've been thinking about suicide a lot. And it makes me feel worse knowing that I'm so alone, that if I die, I'd take at least a week until someone finds out.. I don't know what to do anymore... And I want to stop feeling once and for all... 

If you got all the way through here.. thank you... I don't need to know, but I want you to know that I appreciate having someone to know about what I feel...

ssy7l9,2,2022-02-15,Chance/provide advice to an unaccomplished sophomore to improve my stats!,Randomaccount707,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ssy7l9/chanceprovide_advice_to_an_unaccomplished/,"FULL DISCLAIMER: I know my stats are laughable, but I want to change that. I've procrastinated long enough for school-related matters.

**Demographics:**

* Gender: female
* race/ethnicity: (east) Asian-Canadian
* state: I'm from Ontario (the Canada one, not the US one lol)
* current grade: 10
* type of school: regular high school but I'm in a specialized art program
* hooks: nothing unless the art program counts?

**Intended Major(s):** CS/CFM and possibly English or Art minor

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** We don't do that in Canada but I just took the SAT exam like 5 minutes ago on 4tests.com cold and got a 72% (which is a score of 1152/1600). Not too bad for a first try, I guess?

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** We don't do GPA or ranked so I'll give my averages

* Grade 9: 90.9%
* Grade 10 (first semester only): 89.5% :"")

**Coursework:** Nothing particular to note, except that I have taken a grade 11 course this year, and last year I took a grade 10 course. (I'm not sure how relevant this would be.)

**Awards:**

* RCM level 8 exam - First Class (? iirc. my score was probably 80-84) Honors
* Top Cadet (summer 2019 &lt;/3)

**Extracurriculars:**

* DECA/JOT participant. 2 years (grade 9: recieved some regional distinction) (grade 10: made it to nationals, competition is still ongoing)
* Cadets participant. 4 years (grade 9-present)
* Cadets band. 3 years (grade 9)
* Repetiore/school band. 1 year (grade 10-present)
* Computer science club member. 1 year (grade 10-present)
* Swim team member. 1 year (grade 10-present)
* Art influencer. 3 years (grade 9-present)

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Haven't begun working on essays yet. For LORs, I am thinking of asking my Computer Science teacher since I hang around to help them with organizational tasks sometimes. I'm not well aquainted enough with other teachers to be confident in asking for an LOR.

**Schools:** My dream school would be Waterloo, and the CS acceptance rate is apparently quite low.

**Notes from me:**

* To give more context to my shitty grades, I actually don't study at all. I actually barely paid attention in some classes, so personally I'm just surprised I'm not failing classes left and right. Obviously I am planning to make amends to that and this semester I'm actually going to do my work properly, haha.
* Unfortunately my school doesn't provide AP classes anymore, but dual credit is available, and I am planning to ask guidance about it ASAP.
* I'm most familiar with OpenProcessing, and I'm still pretty new to Python. I plan to pick up C++/C# soon.
* My practically non-existent awards really suck. However, I'm entering quite a few competitions soon (math, physics, JOT/buisness) so hopefully I can snag some awards from that (or at the very least gain experience). I'm planning on doing much more competitions (more math, some art competitions, possibly swimming and/or biathlons, and hackathons) in grade 11.
* Extracurriculars are pretty meh since I don't have any leadership roles :"") I'm planning to try for leadership positions next year, but I'm a mess in social situations so I'd rather not bet on my weak spots. I'm focusing more of my efforts in starting development for my own game, which I will probably do everything for (code, illustrations, script) except the music.
* I'm planning to either do volunteering or to get a job, but if I could intern or shadow a professional it would be more ideal. During the summer it's likely I'll participate in a summer program from Cadets (provided that COVID allows for it) and if I can't do it I'm looking into interning at a university.
* I'm working on being a more active student in class because if I'm being honest, I'm a huge loser. I don't have any friends and I don't speak up, ever.

Thanks for reading through all of that if you did! I'm not proud of my stats so in the ""Notes from me"" section I kind of wrote my general plan for the next 2-ish years. If anyone has feedback on these plans or can offer any advice, it'd be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

But they have asked a few applicants to apply for COE and the only relevant programs I can see for CS and based on my interest are Data Science and Robotics.

I am planning to pursue MS CS with focus (thesis) in Computer Vision or NLP. Some background info:

* I have a journal publication in Medical imaging
* I wish to pursue PhD in future (not 100% sure though)
* I have a couple of research Internships and some work-ex in AI/ML

Hence, I have applied to only MS CS programs as I wish to pursue a thesis in AI and hence never thought about programs like MSDS or MSR. But since NEU is giving a fee waiver I am thinking I might as well go for it (as a backup).

1. So which one would be better MS DS or MSR? From course work and employability perspective.

2. Also can I pursue a thesis or PhD if I take MS DS?


PS: I checked the courses they both offer and i feel both have the courses I would enjoy."

Hi everyone. I am pursuing a double major bachelor's degree in both CS and cybersecurity. I also already have an associates degree in Computer Information Systems. I graduate this year in December. Problem is I am highly doubting I'll be able to get an internship. Especially with my current job I don't think I can do an internship in the summer I would have to do it in the fall. By then I don't have a lot of time left to get an internship. I'm worried nobody will hire me with no experience.

 I have more responsibilities than the average young college student. I will be 31 when I graduate. I just hope I'm not pursuing a dream that is never going to happen. I am putting my heart and soul into this. I've been in school for a long time. I have a 4.0 GPA and I'm actually really interested in what I'm learning. I look forward to programming and learning new things. I've seen how hard it is to get a junior level job in the field because I've already tried and failed to even land an internship. I just really hope my efforts will pay off someday."

I am a German law student and I would like to do an internship in a law firm in Dublin in June and July this year. Does anyone from Ireland have any tips how I should approach the search or is it maybe even too late to find something?

I have written a few mails to law firms asking if they offer internships (I sent some mails with a Cover Letter and a CV and some without) and the few ones who answered me said they don't have any places or that the application process for the summer internships already ended. In most cases I just did not get any answer, so I am not sure whether to continue my search and how to do it. 

I would prefer a firm that works with international clients but as my grades are rather average, I guess it will be even more difficult to get a place there... I just really want to get to know the Irish legal system (as the common law system is quite different from the one I know from France and germany), to get an insight into the legal practice and to improve my language skills."

st60rm,1,2022-02-15,I suspect my friend is homosexual and in love with me and he is harassing me.,OperationIll892,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/st60rm/i_suspect_my_friend_is_homosexual_and_in_love/,"So I should give you some context. There is a guy I met 7 months ago at an internship. He has some medical problems and can't eat most of the food people eat. He always speaks about his family problems saying that he grow up with his sisters and his mother and he had no father figure to teach him how to act like a man and he has a girlfriend.

I was one of the few people being nice to him, and after the internship, we started to chat and become good friends. We live in different cities so I saw him twice after the internship but we talked via WhatsApp nearly every day. After some time he created a WhatsApp group with our friend in common, who is a girl and in my Uni. He started to write poems about me every week saying that I'm a great person, that he likes me etc. We didn't take him seriously thinking it was all a joke. He told us he was joking but the poems became more love-related. He started texting good morning every day and referring to me as ""my love"". Some day I ask him if he is a homosexual or not. He said he was only joking but didn't deny it. He said don't worry I have a girlfriend and I'm not in love with you. I said ok and moved on.

I started to hang out with this girl, and we talked about what we did in the WhatsApp group. He was jealous and said we didn't invite him to talk behind his back, we had fun while he was bored. We said ok and laughed. He was in a different city after all. This continued for a couple of weeks. One day he said in our WhatsApp group that she was hanging out with me only for my money, that she is a bitch and I should be careful out of nowhere. We were like wtf are you talking about, what happened? He didn't return to our calls for a couple of days. I texted if you want to talk I'm here, I'm not your father and I have my own life and no time to waste on this unnecessary stuff. He texted in our group saying that I'm incapable of love, Nobody loved me as a person ever, and that I don't know how to act when a person loves me. I asked him ""what do you want me to do?"" and he replied, ""show me some compassion, I need compassion and attention."" I said that this isn't healthy and that I can't commit my life to you. I already helped him when he needs help and helped him study for his exams etc. Yes, I'm not an emotional man but I helped him when he needed me. Our friend agreed with me and said that he is just different and do not know how normal relationships work.

On my birthday he sends me a package containing some gifts, a poem(of course) and an apology note. I accepted and started talking normally with him. But I was being cold. He started calling me in the middle of the night just to chat, started texting good morning my love texts every morning again. I wasn't replying to those texts. One day I had a final exam and didn't sleep that night so I slept after the exam. He called me, I said I'm sleeping. He talked to my friends, my family, nearly everyone saying that he was concerned about my health, saying that I'm sick and should be taken care of. I didn't talk to him for weeks after that. He send a text saying that he was concerned, that I'm selfish for not talking to him. Anyway, I talked to him last week saying that I won't speak to him if he continues this behavior. He said that he is not acting this way willingly, that he doesn't want to annoy me etc.

On valentines day he send me hearth shaped candies, flowers containing a poem, and a note, saying that he didn't want me to be alone and sad on the valentines day.

So my question is: What should I do?"
st6egw,115,2022-02-15,How to become better self taught programmer,Araashio,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/st6egw/how_to_become_better_self_taught_programmer/,"So before anyone suggests studying at college/university, I tried it and gotta say that's not my thing and I basically dropped out. I've started learning myself about 3 weeks ago during my free time from work and it just feels different. While I was studying I feel like I was losing my motivation since I couldn't even force myself to open up my laptop sometimes, even if I did I'd end up getting bored/demotivated very quicly. But learning by myself feels like my interest and enjoyment of coding jumps from 0 to 100. I don't know why it is like that for me, just what I am I guess. So yeah, just throwing it out there to say that I want to become self taught. 

I managed to learn some basics of SQL, js, php, css and html, mostly from nowadays popular hours long youtube tutorials. I take my time to try and understand every bit of content I watch, writing some little ideas myself to test my knowledge, playing around with different commands etc. so I could take 100% from every piece of content I watch. The problem is I feel like I got some decent begginer knowledge, but how do I go further? The end goal from learning perspective is being able to create something whether it would be a website, app or some piece of software. (From life perspective - find a job in IT someday lol). But then I think about how much do I know now and basically how do I get from ""this"" to ""that"". Is it just improvising and using imagination to slowly work up  to that point gathering information bit by bit or maybe taking some online courses or reading books. I was thinking about maybe doing some internship if I manage to find something, but I have no idea if it's viable only knowing some begginer stuff. 

So to sum up I guess what I want to ask is how do self taught programmers get from begginer to pro and what suggestions you may have to a fired up begginer like me.

P.S. sorry if english is bad, not native language.

Tldr: self taught begginer, what path do I take to get from zero to hero.

Edit: Wow I honestly didn't expect so much feedback. Thank you everyone for great tips and advices!!!"

I'm in fourth year and I'm currently searching for internships for this summer before grad school. However, I'm not sure I'll get the jobs I want for the summer and I was wondering how to approach becoming a TA for this summer if I don't.

I was wondering if there's any current or former TAs on here with advice on how to approach these opportunities. I know that there will be TA job postings later in March and April but I've also heard it's best to try to get in contact with instructors.

How competitive are these positions?
Should I email faculties directly to try to get in contact with summer instructors or is it best to apply through the job postings?

For reference, I am in a Math specialist with a CS and Econ minor. I have very good grades, and some tutor experience, so I feel like I could be competitive for a TA position in any first year MAT, CSC, ECO or STA classes."

A background of my current skills:

* **C**:  Basic stuff like  creating simple console apps, file handling, pointers, structs, etc. Its been a while since i actually used it. 
* **C++:** This is my second most used language. I'm familiar with the basic concepts and data structures. I can use it to recreate almost anything i can do with C# (except for desktop apps).
* **C#** : I use this most frequently. Probably my favorite language so far. I'm familiar with the basic concepts, common libraries and data structures. I can make console apps and desktop apps using WPF.
* Basic knowledge of database concepts and SQL.
* I'm familiar enough with HTML and CSS to understand some of what's going on when i see an HTML script but i can't do anything impressive with them.

What I'm currently doing/planning:

* I'm learning python
* I plan on learning Java.(From the Java code I've seen it seems pretty similar to C# though I'm not sure. Is it?)
* I've been working on creating a desktop app that downloads web-novels and saves them as epub files.(&lt;- This isn't illegal right?) So far I can get the chapters as text files but i don't know how to convert those into an epub file.  I got to know about asynchronous programming because of this project.
* I also plan on doing at least one internship before i graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

That's pretty much everything. I'd appreciate any advice on what else i should do/ learn before  I graduate."
st82aw,6,2022-02-15,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (2/14/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/st82aw/weekly_job_qa_thread_2142022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 111th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

st83ju,2,2022-02-15,Job interview,Trick_Run2910,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/st83ju/job_interview/,"Hi guys.

Would like to hear some opinions and maybe advice as I really would like to het this job. Today I had a job interview for Bugatti Rimac. It's a student job for position project purchasing intern and very well paid. In my past I sent them a lot of applications and finally they asked me for the interview. As I said I'd really like to get this internship so I prepared myself at maximum. I really had a lot to answer to any question as even the job is very similar to what I work already for a few years now. On the interview there were recruitment partner, head of supply chain from the UK and head of purchasing from the UK too. So I prepared for a 1+ hour of speech. When the interview started, they all introduced themself very shortly, but told me they need a lot people for positions as a company is going through big development and It's a good time I applied. In conclusion, introducing individually went very shortly but I got the impression that company is growing and developing. Then they asked me to introduce myself which I did and then they wanted me to know better, like personally. For example what I do in my free time, what I like about my friends, what is my circle of people etc. Just personal questions. At the end, they did not give me any info on position or to ask me what do I know about the position. Did not ask me situational questions or questions like ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"" type. At the end,  if they asked me what I do in my free time, I asked them what they and other employees do in their free time. I got short answers. However, everything went through fun time and jokes aside from us all and I got the feeling they understood my answers. This and last year I had a lot of job interviews but this time only, they did not tell me when I will hear back from them, just to message on e-mail do I have any questions If I remember somwthing.

Is this weird? Should I ask something? For example When will I hear back from them? Or maybe about job? 

Did not experience this type of interview so I don't know is this normal
If someone wants to answer and need more info, feel free to ask"

This means that I have to stay at home all boring and stuff without getting to explore a new building, new city, and new people, all aspects I very hoped to be able to experience. 

Last summer I interned remotely at home and it was just very boring. I felt demotivated not getting to go to an actual office meeting actual coworkers and fellow interns. As a rare extrovert in the CS major community, I yearn for group bonding, after work trips, and other activities that building meaningful connections.

The excitement of meeting new people and exploring a new city is part of the internship/full-time job experience, and I just don't want to be like last summer again. Sure seeing family is nice but I want it to be adventurous where I get to meet cool local people and bond with fellow interns. Without the on-site aspect of the internship, it would also be kind of hard or awkward for my manager to write recommendation letters for me for grad school since there's little to no bonding events online.

What do I do? Should I start looking for other internships? I got rejected by Amazon and pretty much stopped looking for other big companies as soon as I landed my IBM offer. Thanks!"

After a couple years my role became more specific and I was changed to desktop support and I focused on phones. Due to a less than satisfactory raise this year I started looking for employment elsewhere at which point I applied for a system administrator position that had a lot of requirements I didn't meet. 2 interviews later I get the job. I was honest on my resume and during the interviews, I only have a surface level understanding of the technologies and my net+ cert is years expired but I am a quick study and I work well with a team.

Format

1. 20 mins of Behavioral, LP etc.
2. 30 minutes of technical (1 leetcode easy, 1 OOP + algorithm, general DS&amp;A knowledge )

I was unable to solve the LC question in optimal time; however, I gave a naive and semi-optimized solution in O(nlogn) compared to O(n). My interview said, ""Don't worry about it the linear solution is a bit complicated"" and then we moved on. Interestingly, the next question was just OOP and deducing what a given function abstracted intended to return and accomplish. I did very well on this and basically was perfect in figuring things out. She also asked me general questions on allocation of memory for maps, array v. linkedlist etc. I feel like I answered them well.

We finished a bit overtime since we were chatting very well near the end with questions. She finished the interview ""Well, &lt;name&gt; it was really nice to interview you!"" It felt like talking to an old friend and it was super casual. I took it as a very positive sign.

I went to an expo last month and visited a large animal health company's booth to learn more about any co-ops or internships that they would be offering this year. Their hiring manager/talent acquisition person spoke to me about these opportunities and that I should keep an eye open on their LinkedIn and to apply any that interest me.

Well, they released a ton of these positions' applications in the past two weeks. I applied to 7 of them, only the ones I am actually qualified for and the ones I have an interest in. They are pretty competitive positions since many of the positions have a lot of applicants already. I spoke with a friend about it and they said I just ruined any chance I had in getting any of the positions since the the hiring managers could see that I applied to so many of them within the company. I should mention that the positions I applied for are spread across different locations except for two. 

I'm not sure what to think. In talking with one of the project directors who is hiring for two of the positions, he asked me which one I prefer and why. I answered truthfully and he said he would keep consideration open for both applications.

My goal here is to get quality industry experience and unfortunately, with a new potential threat in the  US industry, co-op and internship opportunities are being shut down. I just want to make sure I end up with something and I really like this company's co-op/internship programs."

stfu9l,6,2022-02-15,Does anyone have advice for an aspiring technical writer?,Sebz93,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/stfu9l/does_anyone_have_advice_for_an_aspiring_technical/,"To preface, this post may come across as a bit of a rant, but I want to provide some context regarding where I’m coming from. Also, I’m on mobile, so apologies in advance for potential formatting issues.

When I was a freshman in high school, I decided to pursue a career in technical writing, because I believed it would fit my skillset and interests. I wanted a relevant degree to support this goal, so I got my BS in communications from a local university.

To avoid going into debt, I worked for Apple at one of their retail stores during college. I couldn’t afford to leave my job for an internship, so after graduating, I didn’t have enough experience to land a technical writing job.

After months of job searching, I settled for a support position at a fairly large tech company that also has an in-house technical writing team. Some of the job openings were geared toward employees in my position, so my plan was to establish myself in my initial role, then gain some experience that would make me qualified for a future technical writer opening.

Within a couple months of starting, I was performing exceptionally well at my starting role, based on the company’s standards. Within a year and a half, my performance had me making approximately 17% more than the wage I started at. During this time, I felt like I was doing quite well, and I had the opportunity to participate in multiple projects with our technical writing team.

Roughly a year into my current role, I had the opportunity to apply for a technical writing opening. I got an interview, but didn’t have the desired experience, so I didn’t make the cut. Then, seven months later, another opportunity came up. 

Prior to the second opportunity, I had done some work to account for what I initially lacked. I made changes to my application and completed some self-led projects that were based on the feedback I received. To my surprise, I wasn’t offered an interview.

Because everything I had done was based on the feedback I previously received, I was confused and decided to reach out to the hiring manager for feedback. He was new, so I didn’t have any rapport with him, but the company I work for is typically open to feedback, and I expected he’d be willing to provide some.

Contrarily, he seemed reluctant to provide me with any specific information about why I was rejected. It almost seemed as if he was offended I would even ask. Admittedly, I was being quite direct, but I felt it would help to understand how this application was so much worse than the last one. The conversation wasn’t as friendly as I was expecting, based on my experience with other employees in the company, but the hiring manager still assured me it didn’t mean I shouldn’t try again. 

Two weeks ago, another technical writer opening was finally posted. Based on all the feedback I received, I felt like I had done enough work and made enough adjustments to my application to finally get another interview. I put many hours into crafting my writing sample and cover letter, which my direct manager thought looked great. Cautiously optimistic that I would at least get an interview, I applied. Then, just yesterday, I received another rejection.

After speaking with my manager, I learned that my application materials were excellent. However, I also learned that the hiring manager I contacted after the last rejection decided I will never be allowed to work on the Content team, because the precedent I set with my communication style meant I’d never be a good fit. While I knew my conversation with the hiring manager hadn’t been ideal, I hadn’t realized he went so far as to tell the other Content managers that I couldn’t be hired. And because this wasn’t previously addressed with me, I didn’t realize that I was ultimately wasting the time I’d been investing into this company over the past year.

At this point, I can’t pursue what I want to do for a career with my current company. However, everything I’ve worked on has been in service of getting a technical writer role here, so I feel like I’ve ultimately wasted the last 2.5 years of my life. I still want to become a technical writer, but I feel like I’m no closer to it than I was when I graduated college. If any of you have been in a similar situation, or have experience with getting into technical writing, I’d greatly appreciate your advice and/or any thoughts you may have.

TL;DR

I can no longer pursue technical writing as a career at the company I work for because of a decision made by a Content team manager, so I feel like I’ve wasted the last 2.5 years of my life. I’m looking for advice regarding how to move forward with a career in technical writing, because I feel like I’m back where I started when I graduated college.

Thanks to everyone who has responded to my post. You all have provided some thoughtful suggestions and kind words.

I’ll start applying to some new roles this weekend, and hopefully I’ll be in a better spot soon."
sth90p,109,2022-02-15,i feel lied to,kiiiiiwiiiii,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/sth90p/i_feel_lied_to/,"i remember when i first came to this school, i had my dreams crushed just like every other pre sci hopeful; i wanted to do cs but my grades werent even close to good enough. i've come to terms with that fact now, and in fact i find info is a much better fit for me than cs was. i just find it ridiculous that people think once you get into a capacity contrained major things get easy, because it doesnt.

i pay for my own shit, whether that be rent food or tuition, and as such i have to work as much as i can to stay afloat. ive been working 20 hour weeks since sophomore year just to make enough money to stay afloat, and i was hoping that i would be able to find a paid internship during the summer to start making decent money and saving it so i was financially stable until i got a real job (obviously i also want the experience and career opportunities that come from an internship too, but being paid would help me immensley in the short term). i was told by so many around me that once you're in an in demand major internship opportunities will tend to respond to you more, but that really feels like a lie.

ive applied to so much stuff in the past 4 months and only gotten like one interview, which i ended up bombing really bad because i had so little practice. i have no idea what to do at this point, all i think about constantly is the upcoming financial crisis ill hit when i graduate with no real experience in my career, just to be rejected by everything. i know this is probably a common sentiment, first world problems, im not the only one dealing with this, ect, but its so fucking demoralizing to try to keep going when it feels like everything i want to do hits an impassable obstacle. 

idk, this is just another pointless rant in a sea of depressed stem students, but i just feel i needed to vent for a bit to get it off my chest. if you got this far thanks for reading."
sth9vu,1,2022-02-15,"Physics undergrad in Germany, thinking about doing bachelors in CS as well",Pristine_Use970,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/sth9vu/physics_undergrad_in_germany_thinking_about_doing/,"Hey everyone,

I am currently a first year physics undergrad at a university in Germany. I have been programming throughout most of high school, mostly just for hobby projects (web, app and some embedded development). I have done a few SE internships at smaller companies during that time and am currently a working student at a research institute working on Deep Learning applications. 

I enjoy physics and definitely want to finish my bachelors degree but I also think that I will probably want to work in CS later. How important would a CS degree be for future applications? Would it be worth the time and effort to try to pursue it alongside my physics studies? The curriculums have some overlap (Maths) but adding multiple CS lectures to a semester would still mean a substantial increase in required work and I am wondering if I could spend this time in a better way.

I have a three month SE internship at a larger German company coming up (also in ML/DL field) and recently started doing problems on LC. I am currently lacking a long-term personal project and I am not actively involved in any open-source libraries. The ones I am mostly using (JAX, PyTorch) still seem a bit too technical for me to get involved in at the moment.

Thank you for any advice."

I didn't have any previous high level programming skills before starting this class so everything I know is mostly from CS1, OOP, and Intro to C, would I be ready to get an internship once I'm done with CS1 or should I wait until I'm done with CS2?"
stieo9,1,2022-02-15,Advice on job career,ChaoticElle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/stieo9/advice_on_job_career/,"So I took a degree in Marketing, Public Relations, and Publicity last year where I had to do an internship for a company, at the end of it they claimed they wanted me to remain with them and prolong the internship and then I would sign a contract.

Honestly, it's the job of my dreams, it's a sustainable company, the coworkers are friendly, the environment amazing, and full of creativity since I would be working on producing video and photo content for their social media. They said it would take some time to arrange paperwork for the internship, I'm a patient person so I didn't mind.

But 3/4 months have passed, I did multiple jobs for them thinking I would have that contract soon but I was mistaken and naive. Between calls of me persisting to know about the supposed ""paperwork process"". He (the boss from my company) would tell me he would call me soon to give me updates, always changing the subject. 

Between all this, I had to stay in quarantine for two weeks because one of my family members I live with got covid and in the middle of all that the dog that I had since I was 8 years old passed away and that really left me in a bad state.

I still have no news of said contract even tho he told me he would give me updates some weeks ago and still hasn't contacted me. ( Like he always do, and my coworkers say his like this with everyone.)  


Between all of this, i have already been looking for multiple job offers to find a job but what should a really do? Should i just say i don't want that internship anymore? This is taking a lot of time and it's upsetting me and lack of work ethic makes don't want to do it anymore."
stja44,0,2022-02-15,Doctor in a shitty place,Sad_Exit_1030,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/stja44/doctor_in_a_shitty_place/,"Im a doctor in a shit country.
Before i can get my license to work, by law i have to do an internship in a rural town, a shitty shitty, underdeveloped town in an underdeveloped country.

My life is hell. 

I have to stay in the clinic and its falling apart. Half of it doesn't have light, the fridge doesnt work properly so i have to go 4 miles to a supermarket to eat disgusting supermarket food everyday. Ive gotten sick twice in 4 months, ive lost about 5kg. 

There's no running water, there's no electricity generator and sometimes lights go out for hours.

The kitchen sink is broken so if you try to use it, water spills everywhere.

There's supposed to be 2 other doctors with me but when i got here there was only one and she left for medical reasons so im alone with the responsibilities of 3 people.

On top of it all There's to businesses literally next to the clinic blasting music from 4pm to 11pm everyday. I can't rest or read much less study because the whole room im in vibrates. 
And the nail in the coffin is that patients complain when i don't attend their ""emergencies"" I've tried explaining to them that i cannot hear when they call and they should tell the next door pieces of shit to turn down their fucking music. In vain, everyone in this town is inbred (at least its what i think because every single patient i have has the same exact last name) so they don't listen to reason.

At first i thought that was law for every clinic in this city but when i talked to my colleagues they told me that im basically in the shittiest part of town and nobody stays here. 

I've tried asking my bosses to change me to another clinic but they won't because they can't/won't leave this clinic alone so i have to wait for another doctor to take my place, the problem is they're waiting for a male doctor because they're sexist and won't send a woman to this godforsaken town. You can imagine my indignation when I learned that there are about 3 clinics i could go but they won't let me because they're saving those for women.

Its been 3 months since i told them i want the change and no news. As a last resort I told them that I want to quit if they don't change me from this place by next month. The process is long and tedious but its preferable to living in hell.

Only a month left of this torture.
Wish me luck."
stjt7s,0,2022-02-15,What could cause a C++ implementation of I2C to successfully send data one time and then fail every other time?,dcfan105,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/stjt7s/what_could_cause_a_c_implementation_of_i2c_to/,"Background: I'm a firmware testing engineering intern and this is the first time I've worked on a project involving serial communication protocols.  

Edit: 
This is the master device I'm using:https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DS_FT4222H.pdf
And this is the slave: https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lis3dh.html

Edit: I'm using a logic analyzer to check the results of the code.  The code itself isn't setup to output information about the read/write cycles, so all my conclusions below are based on the results of the logic analyzer when I run the code.

It was kind of odd that it worked even once actually, because it turned out the register I'd tried to write to was read only, and the read cycle showed it reading the default value of that register, which made sense. Hence, I then changed the register address to one that was read and write enabled and that time the logic analyzer showed it not successfully sending anything. Confused, I changed the register value back and it still showed it not successfully sending the data. I've gone through the code multiple times, changing various things and then changing them back, and checked every version of my branch since before I made any changes today, and I couldn't replicate the results of it successfully sending the data.

The thing is that it should be successfully sending the data as far as I can tell — I've gone over and over the data sheets, gone through the code and debugged with breakpoints several times, and reviewed the I2C write sequence protocol and couldn't figure out why it's not doing it. From debugging with breakpoints and using the logic analyzer, I did manage to narrow down the location of the bug to where I call a function from the manufacturer (of the master device) provided library, called FT4222_I2CMaster_WriteEx. I put a breakpoint right after that line and ran the code, and the logic analyzer shows it getting a NAK when it tries to initiate the write sequence, so there's the problem, but I can't figure out what's causing it or why the code actually seemed to work the one time.

I've checked and double and triple checked that the parameters I put into the function based on the definitions of the function parameters in the library documentation and that the slave and slave register addresses are correct based on the slave device documentation. I don't know where else to put a breakpoint to continue debugging, since the issue seems to occur when it implements the library function, which I don't have the source code for, as it's proprietary. I doubt the issue is with the definition of the function itself though anyway — more likely something somewhere else in the code is messing with it, but I don't know where. I figured it was probably an issue with using the wrong register values, but I checked those multiple times and, unless the documentation is wrong (which is unlikely), they're correct.

One other odd thing is that, in one of my several debug sessions, the device number variable (which should always be zero since I currently only have one master device connected and the devices are numbered 0, 1, 2, etc) changed to some strange number (don't remember what it was) after going through the function, but it only did it that one time. Every other time I stepped through that part of the code, it stayed at zero. That, and the fact that the code worked that one time makes me think there's something going on with race conditions, but I don't know what it could be. I only have one master and one slave device connected at present, so I don't know what could be competing to access the same resource at once.

The only other thing I can think of is that there's undefined behavior somewhere, though I doubt it, because even if there was undefined behavior, I wouldn't expect the results to change unless I changed compilers/devices/etc or if there was a software update or something, which I didn't and there wasn't.

Any suggestions for things I could check or debugging strategies I haven't considered? I'd share the code, but I don't think I'm supposed to share it with people outside the company."

I decided to pursue a bachelors in CS and I honestly find it very intriguing and it’s something I have developed a passion for. However I just started taking my first CS course and honestly i have learned more from code academy then from the profesor who I try not to punch because of his lack of respect. With my backstory to the side, I honestly would really like an internship for summer 22 to help me understand CS more and expand my knowledge, but I don’t know where to start looking or where to search for more connections that can guide me in the right direction.

1. I just finished my first year at Melbourne Uni and feel like a massive idiot. I got good marks and all but I certainly don't know how to make anything practical or useful for 'real life', I don't even know the definitions of 90% of the technical words people on the popular cs subreddits use. Apart from my degree, what else can I be doing to supplement my learning? I'm currently self learning Java but I still feel like all I can do is game AIs and puzzle solvers
2. When are you supposed to be applying for internships? I know most do it in the second year, but I feel like I wouldn't be able to keep up. Also, I only started programming last year and I don't know how my introductory grasp of Python and my C checkers engine and other beginner projects is going to make any company want to take me.
3. How male-dominated is CS, especially amongst people in their 20s/30s? I don't know anybody in the field personally except my dad and am curious if it's as bad as statistics say &gt;.&lt;

stomi1,1,2022-02-16,When do you usually get offer letters for a summer internship? (International student needing CPT),krustything,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/stomi1/when_do_you_usually_get_offer_letters_for_a/,"Previously posted this in r/cscareerquestions but did not get that many responses. I'm hoping I can get some advice here.

Some time in January, I received an email from my interviewer saying they would like to work with me for a summer internship - that is, if I was still interested (I am more than interested). He said I should hear back soon from the company with more details.

For some context, I met a recruiter from the company at a cybersecurity conference, and had an interview some time in December. I was waiting for a response, but later learned that the recruiter had moved to another company during my application process. I was able to get in touch with the interviewer, and he told me that they would like to have an internship with me during the summer and that someone (probably someone from HR/recruiting) should contact me soon.

However, it's almost been a month and I have not heard back yet. I'm an international student in the US, so I will need to apply for CPT sponsorship before the internship starts. I am getting more and more anxious as the semester goes by, and not having received an official offer letter is making it hard for my mind to be at peace.

If I need to apply for a CPT sponsorship, when is the absolute latest date that I can receive an offer letter? Should I email him back to check in? Or is it too early? Am I stressing over nothing?"

stux6z,177,2022-02-16,Clinical trials of a new drug have some pretty terrifying results,Mundane_Plastic_8024,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/stux6z/clinical_trials_of_a_new_drug_have_some_pretty/,"
I'm a medical doctor and a member at large of an FDA advisory committee for a new drug that's still going through trials, known as Omefranol. A few weeks ago, I was checking my email when I saw a message from a colleague. I was very disturbed after reading the email, and I hope you see why. I've attached the email below.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Dr. Pierce,

As you requested, what follows is the full, unabridged account of the incident that occurred at Pulaski Hospital Center during the phase III trials of Omefranol. The case concerns Patient #2365786, hereafter known pseudonymously as ‘Mr. John Wade.’ My name is Dr. Evelyn Shoto, M.D., a clinical psychiatrist, and principal investigator during the section of the study involving Mr. Wade. I am no longer affiliated with NeuroCorp as I resigned immediately following the incident I am about to detail.

Mr. Wade is a 43 y.o. white male who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia since he was 17 years old. Mr. Wade suffers from classic positive symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, including extremely vivid auditory and visual hallucinations. Since his diagnosis, he’s had over a dozen major hospitalizations and several overdoses. He has been on numerous major antipsychotics including Thioridazine and Chlorpromazine, but none seem to have even a minor effect on his hallucinations. For over a year before his admission to the Pulaski Hospital Center, a maximum-security forensic psychiatric facility. 

Before his admission, Wade had worked on and off at his brother’s lawn care business as an office aid. However, his employment came to an abrupt end when he allegedly doused a fellow employee in gasoline before lighting the man on fire and stood there while the victim burned. The man died at the scene of his wounds and Mr. Wade was committed to Pulaski to await his evaluation to find if he was fit to stand trial for first-degree murder. According to Mr. Wade’s brother, he had not been taking his medication for over a year. 

We approached Mr. Wade and his brother about an experimental treatment using a novel antipsychotic, Omefranol. The drug at the time was still in the testing phases developed by NeuroCorp, a pharmaceutical industrial concern specializing in innovative treatments for mental illnesses. In phase I and II studies conducted in Barbados, Omefranol showed promising improvements in individuals with Schizophrenia whose symptoms failed to be treated with other antipsychotics. 

Mr. Wade agreed to participate in the double-blind study, and we scheduled him for an intake interview with our team of mental health professionals. There, in the small sterile interrogation room, he sat in a straight jacket as we began to record. We asked him to describe what he saw and heard. He reported that he would constantly hear a high-pitch, collective screaming, like a “burning bus full of children,” sometimes of “something else.” When we asked him to elaborate, he was terse except to say, “the ‘Watchers.’” 

He reports that these screams would persist, day and night. Sometimes, Mr. Wade reported seeing visual hallucinations of the entities he referred to as the ‘Watchers.’ When asked repeatedly to detail what exactly he meant by that, Mr. Wade simply repeated cryptically, as if my recitation, “His works were with the watchers, and with the holy ones were his days.” 

When asked why he doused the man in gasoline, he smiled. “Rejoice! The man was wicked, and the Watchers did instruct me to smite him for his sins, for his sins were great and perverted the innocents.”

We also interviewed his brother, ‘Frank,’ his only living relative. 

“John and I, our parents were drug addicts in Boston. They practically abandoned us on the street when we were both really young, and we were taken up by this boy’s home—St. Eusebius.’ It was tough growing up in that home. The sisters were strict and sometimes sadistic, and they constantly forced us to recite passages from the Bible since we were five years old. If we got one word wrong, it was a smack to the cheek with a wooden paddle, and those nuns could give Ted Williams a run for his money if you know what I mean.  

However, John was special. He did really well on those recitations, and he impressed the sisters when he could commit the entire Book of Isaiah to memory, just in a week.

Frank had brought John’s Bible from the orphanage, a shabby Gideon International that had stained pages.

“This was John’s most valued possession in the world. He asked me to bring it to him in prison.”

He flipped through the pages, and we could see drawings and writings feverishly scrawled into the margins. When we opened to the Book of Ezekiel, the entire page was darkened with so much ink scribbling, page after page, you could barely make out the text.

“Oh yeah, Ezekiel was his favorite for some reason. He would spend all his free time, day and night, reading the same passage over and over, even into adulthood.”

We then asked Frank to describe to us when John began to experience symptoms.

“When John turned 17, he suddenly dropped out of school. He was a wicked smart kid, even if he was a bit of the social outcast type. However, one day, he just suddenly didn’t show up to class. By then I was already out of school and starting a job in New Haven, and I got a call from the school. John hadn’t shown up in over two weeks, and the school was concerned that he was truant. I drove over back to Boston to the apartment I helped him pay for, and he wouldn’t answer the door. I had an extra key and I was able to get in.

I called his name over and over, and there was no answer. When I reached his room, I noticed it was locked. I could smell something foul, and I feared for the worst. I busted in the door and I saw him, standing there, naked. In a corner was where he went to the bathroom—that was what I smelled. And then I looked around the room, and everything—the walls, the ceilings, the floors—was scrawled in what appeared to be blood. His blood, I later found out. He had been collecting it in bowls and then painting these weird, bizarre symbols with circles and other shapes in them, all over the room. I was so scared.

‘John,’ I remembered saying, ‘John... what the fuck...”

He turned around, and I remember seeing that he was smiling and his eyes, his eyes were so big.

He told me that he had been hearing voices in his head. They told him that they came from above and they told him the secrets of the universe or something. Anyways, that’s when I knew I had to call the police. They strapped him to a gurney and took him away to Massachusetts State for several months. He came out, was normal for a while, but then stopped taking his medication. When I asked him why he told me that they “quieted the voices” so he couldn’t hear. I told him that was the whole point: to not hear voices because that wasn’t normal. Thus the cycle began: he would take his medication, be relatively normal for several months, stop taking his medication, start hearing voices again that tell him to do some pretty terrible shit, then back to the hospital.”

“Tell me about the incident involving the client at your lawn care business.”

Frank took a minute and stared deeply into mid-air. He continued.

“Well,” he cleared his throat, looking uneasy. “You see, with his condition, John couldn’t keep a job for more than a few weeks. He’s my brother, so I had to take him under my wing at my lawn care business. Shawn was good with the paperwork, so that was what he did. One day, one of our hedge trimmers, Kyle, came in. John didn’t know Kyle and that was the first day that they met. I was in my office when I suddenly heard screaming. I ran into the front of the shop, and I saw that Kyle was on the floor, burning and writhing and screaming. It was horrible. I noticed that John was standing there, smiling with a container of gasoline in his hand.

I screamed at him, ‘What the fuck did you do??’

He later told the police that some voice in his head told him that Kyle was ‘impure’ or something, that he did stuff to kids. That he needed to be ‘purified.’ I’m telling you, my brother’s not alright in the head. What was weird though, was that I was watching the news coverage about John killing Kyle later in the day. The media had discovered that Kyle was a pervert, and he had been sexually abusing kids as young as five for years in the trailer park.”

We started Mr. Wade initially on 50mg of the treatment, twice a day orally starting on June 3rd. After a month of gradual improvement, we decided to increase the dosage to 100mg. Mr. Wade showed an impressive almost-immediate improvement in his positive and negative symptoms with a startling 80% improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PNSS). On the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH), which rates Schizophrenia from least severe (1) to most severe (7), Mr. Wade scored a ‘7’ on June 3rd and a ‘2’ on July 2nd. Additionally, Mr. Wade’s blood dopamine levels increased dramatically almost as soon as we administered the treatment. Mr. Wade’s hallucinations, what he called ‘visions,’ persisted, but he reported that the ‘screaming had stopped.’ When we asked him what he heard now, he responded, ‘singing. I hear singing, not screaming.’

There was also a noticeable increase in the religiosity of Mr. Wade; he would spend almost all hours of the day reading his Bible and appeared to pray. I conducted weekly mental health evaluations to track his progress. Mr. Wade continued to make significant neurophysiological improvements while on the treatment regimen. However, Mr. Wade continued to talk about his visions involving the “Watchers.” During one interview, I asked inquired him about his visions.

“What do you mean by ‘Watchers,’ John?”

John smiled cryptically. “They’re here.”

“What do you mean by that, John?

Mr. Wade sat in his chair confined by the straight jacket, and he raised his head. He was looking in my direction but did not look me in the eye. It was like he was staring through me—no, behind me.

“Do you not see it? There’s one, standing right behind you.”

I instinctively turned around. Nothing.

“How often do you see these ‘Watchers?’”

“All the time. They follow me.”

Despite all his improvements, Mr. Wade’s auditory and visual hallucinations persisted.

While hospitalized, we encouraged Mr. Wade to take up painting as a relaxing activity, but also it provided us a qualitative analysis of his mental wellbeing. His paintings were interesting, to say the least. The hospital had an old television set with some Bob Ross VHS tapes. We supplied Mr. Wade with the supplies—including oil paint, brushes, canvases, and linseed oil—and left him alone in the room with the guard outside for him to unwind and paint. An hour later, we came back into the room.

“John, I believe you’ve been working on some pretty pictures for us,”

“Yes, Dr. Shoto,” John said, grinning. He turned the canvas around. 

“Jesus Christ,” the guard behind me let out.

It took me a moment to register what he had painted.

“What...is that...John?”

John paused, tilting his head in confusion, his smile turning into a frown. “You don’t like it, Dr. Shoto?”

“Umm, John, maybe we call it a day.”

After John was ushered back into his room by the guard, I picked up the canvas. On the canvas, Mr. Wade had painted what I can only describe as these bizarre beings with circular bodies covered with numerous wings and eyes, like some eldritch, nightmarish abomination. 

Father Caulkin was the hospital chaplain, an old man in his eighties who ministers to the religious needs of the patients at Pulaski. Father Caulkin also held weekly mass services to Catholic patients, and Mr. Wade was known to regularly attend. A week after our last evaluation, Mr. Wade attended mass. It started as a routine mass service; there was only one other person in the room, a fellow patient, as the guard, being an observant Jew, chose to remain outside of the chapel. As Father Caulkin’s back was turned to the room in the blessing of the bread and wine, Mr. Wade quietly got up from the pew and walked towards Father Caulkin. 

According to the witness, Mr. Wade began to take out a metal container hidden in his hospital robes. We later found at the scene that this was a container of the linseed oil Mr. Wade had smuggled from his painting session. In one swift motion, even before Father Caulkin could realize what was about to incur, Mr. Wade splashed the entire container of linseed oil on the priest’s chasuble, grabbed the candle on the altar, and set the priest on fire. 

Father Caulkin fully combusted in less than a second. The witness reported Father Caulkin screaming in pain for a few seconds before his body collapsed to the ground, still burning. The guard heard the commotion and rushed in—but it was too late. When the fire and paramedics arrived, Father Caulkin had expired at the scene. 

Wade was promptly sedated, straight-jacketed, and sent to his room. I remember having arrived at the chapel, seeing the black char marks where Father Caulkin’s body had laid before the coroners arrived, and thinking, how could a human being do this?

I later questioned Mr. Wade about this.

“Why did you kill Father Caulkin?”

He slowly smiled. In a calm voice, he responded, slowly sounding out his words syllable by syllable.

“Father Caulkin was wicked. The Watchers told me to do it, to purify him of his sins. He needed to be made pure through fire.”

“What sins are you talking about?”

“His laptop, Dr. Shoto. The Watchers know about what the Father sees and does. They saw him. They illuminated him. His actions are impure. He was so bright when he did mass, he was practically shining. Burning.” He began to quietly cackle to himself before continuing. 

“I serve the Watchers, and they commanded me to purify him. 'Rejoice with him, O heavens, bow down to him, all gods for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries.'""

Later that night as I finished some emails, I decided to do a bit of research on fire, particularly the religious meaning behind it, given Mr. Wade’s inclinations. I wasn't raised religious growing up, so religion was not a strong suit. Admittedly, I was fascinated by what I found. Evidently, fire as a symbol of purity is present in almost every major religion. 

In Zoroastrianism, the ancient faith of the Persians, fire was revered as a symbol of truth and purity as fire cannot be polluted. In Hinduism, fire is used in various religious rituals as a mediator between humans and gods. The ancient Romans had a sacred fire dedicated to the goddess Vesta with chaste virgins tending to it to prevent the hearth from going out. In the Hebrew Bible, God often spoke through fire: first in a burning bush, then in a pillar of fire. 

Fire was used as a symbol of purity, but also divine wrath: fire was described as coming out of the “presence of the Lord,” which consumed those that invoked divine judgment; Sodom and Gomorrah were consumed by fire and brimstone. In the New Testament, Christ is said to arrive to baptize by the Holy Spirit and fire, and in the Book of Hebrews, God is described as “a consuming fire.” 

Then I realized it. Whatever Mr. Wade sees in his visions, he views fire as a vehicle of purity. Somehow, the voices in his head and the figures in his visions tell him that his two victims were ‘impure,’ perhaps having committed transgressions of some kind. In this developing pyromania, Mr. Wade thought he was helping them by lighting them on fire to purify them. I understood why Mr. Wade thought lighting Kyle on fire was logical in his twisted mental calculus, but why did he kill an old priest?

Suddenly, I received a text. A colleague of mine notified me that the police uncovered fifty gigabytes of child pornography in Father Caulkin’s laptop. There were dozens of reports of abuse by Caulkin in parishes he ministered to previously in Boston, and he was transferred to the hospital after the fact by the archdiocese. 

The question lingered in my psyche to this day: how did Mr. Wade know about Father Caulkin?

A week later, as I was getting to evaluate Mr. Wade, the guard took me aside at the door and let me know that he’s been hearing things coming from Mr. Wade’s room late at night.

“He’s been... Just facing the corner of the room, chanting and bowing. It’s disturbing. I don’t know, but some of the words sound like...like what they taught us to recite in the Kiddush in Hebrew school. I don’t know how, but I think he knows Hebrew.”

“Hebrew? What do you think he was saying?”

The guard chuckled. “I’m not fluent. We only learned what we need to say the prayers. It’s like, the prayers he’s saying are almost similar.”

“Mr. Wade isn’t Jewish, is he? It doesn’t indicate on his file.”

“Oh, definitely not. I don’t know much of what he’s saying, but one thing I do know for sure.  Whatever he’s addressing, it’s not ha-Shem...It’s definitely not what we would call God.”

I immediately headed to the CCTV monitoring room and reviewed the camera footage of Mr. Wade’s room.

In the playback, Mr. Wade would sit still on his bed, staring blankly at the corner of the room. After three hours, he would suddenly get up, walk towards the corner, and kneel. I turned on the audio. It was some kind of ritual. As he was chanting, his body would begin to sway, forward and backward. He would fold his hands, then raise them, palms forward. It was difficult to hear with all the white noise, but I could make out a quiet whispering. I strained to hear. Over time, whispers became more emphatic, more feverish, but it wasn’t English. The words sounded harsh with uvular consonants.

Almost immediately, I picked up the phone and called Frank.

“No...? No. As far as I know, he only speaks English.”

On the camera in real-time, Mr. Wade suddenly stopped, stood up, stepped back, and turned his head up to the ceiling. What happened next I could not explain empirically to this day.

“I’ll call you back, Frank, something’s happening with Wade.”

I ran down the hallway through the hospital to get to the wing where Mr. Wade was located. When I arrived, the guard quickly waved me over to the window on the door. There he was, just as I saw him on the camera. How I perceived the scene was this: Mr. Wade appeared to be floating, his feet six inches above the ground. His head was tilted upwards. I nudged the guard.

“Are you seeing...that...?”

The guard nodded. 

I knocked on the door. 

“Mr. Wade? Mr. Wade! What are you doing?”

But he did not answer. His eyes remained closed and his head tilted back. 

I looked to the guard. “Open this door immediately.”

“I can’t, Dr. Shoto. We weren’t expecting you this late so I left my key with my partner who’s on a smoke break right now.”

“I need to get into the room. Do you understand?”

The guard lifted his walkie-talkie and messaged his partner.

“10-33, 10-33, requesting immediate assistance to room 31A, block B. 10-33. Mike, get your ass over here.”

“Hey,” I said to the guard, “Something is happening.” 

Mr. Wade, still floating, abruptly lifted his head and began to shout, as though in a trance.

“I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU REQUIRED. I HAVE SERVED YOU LOYALLY. PLEASE, LET ME SEE YOU. LET ME UNDERSTAND ALL. LET ME BEHOLD YOUR SPLENDOR.”

Coincidentally, at that precise moment, we felt an earthquake. The lights began to flicker.

Mr. Wade’s body began to shake and his eyes rolled back. His face grimaced, then turned into a smile.

“I SEE THEM...I SEE THEM...” Mr. Wade began to laugh maniacally, raising his voice to a feverish pitch. The room continued to shake violently

“IT’S BEAUTIFUL...I SEE THEM...I SEE THE BURNING ONES...THE BURNING ONES—”

At that moment, we heard Mr. Wade scream. The lights suddenly went out for a few seconds before the backup generator started. When the lights turned back on, Mr. Wade was lying face down on the floor, still. The room had a sickly sweet odor of burning metal, which we thought at first was due to damage in the electric wiring due to the earthquake.

By then, the other guard was running down the hall. We unlocked the door and I immediately rushed over to Mr. Wade’s side to check on him. He was unresponsive, and when I checked his carotid artery, I realized he no longer had a pulse. One of the guards phoned the paramedics. I turned Mr. Wade’s body around and then stepped back in horror. 

Where Mr. Wade’s eyes should be, there were only remains of charred tissue. Almost nothing was left. I touched his hollow eye socket and instantly recoiled as it was still burning hot. There wasn’t any blood. His eyes combusted so spontaneously that all the blood had evidently evaporated instantly: that was the metallic odor we noticed. I could hear one of the guards begin to vomit outside. 

“Dr. Shoto...” Mike, the second guard asked. He was a large, muscular man, but he was trembling like a leaf. “What the hell could’ve done this?”

“I don’t know...”

I need to note a particularly disturbing phenomenon that the coroner's report revealed several months after. The autopsy revealed that Mr. Wade’s occipital lobe, particularly in the area of the primary visual cortex, hadn’t simply become inflamed, but had practically dissolved. A case where an entire lobe simply dissolved to this extent has never been recorded.

Later that evening, we were all called into an emergency research faculty meeting. I immediately began to brief the team on the fate of Mr. Wade, how his eyes had apparently spontaneously combusted at such high heat. I stated that considering the severe side effects  Mr. Wade was experiencing in the weeks that led to his death, it would be in no way ethical for us to possibly continue the Omefranol study. I made the case that the drug was too dangerous for the safety of the patients in the study and we needed to halt all trials immediately.

Dr. Franklin, the chief of the investigation, paused and took off his glasses. 

“Dr. Shoto, we concluded Mr. Wade’s treatment three months ago, so we can tell you this now since it wouldn’t affect the double-blind nature of this experiment. When we assigned the patients to the treatment groups, Mr. Wade was put in the control group for the entire duration of the treatment. We decided to allow you to continue your psychiatric evaluation of the patient without telling you so that you could better detail his mental condition without bias.”

“He was given the placebo this entire time?” I asked, hearing my heart pounding. 

“Yes, Mr. Wade wasn’t on Omefranol when the incident occurred. He never was.”

When I returned home after one in the morning, I couldn’t sleep, so I decided to do some late-night file work. There were stacks of MRI brain scans of the study participants. One caught my eye. You see, normally in patients with Schizophrenia, we would see a smaller brain volume and reduction in cortical volume and thickness, most noticeably in the frontal and temporal lobes. Most notably, we would see atrophy of the hippocampus and thalamus. We noticed these symptoms to varying degrees in all patients in the study. 

However, this particular brain scan showed a perfectly healthy brain—no shrinkage, no atrophy, no visible markings of pathology at all, no schizophrenia or any other identifiable mental illness for that matter. This brain was the only one in the pile that didn’t exhibit those tell-tale signs of a patient with schizophrenia, so I assumed it was a clerical error on the part of the intern. I then glanced at the name of the patient on the scan.

WADE, JOHN

I sent in my resignation letter to NeuroCorp the following day. "

Maybe you haven't received any admits yet, or haven't heard back from any university altogether. 

It is fine.

The decision is going to come. Whatever happens, is bigger than just an admit or a reject. It is more about what path you are going to lead in your life. Not everyone can prosper on an Ivy League path; we only prosper on OUR OPTIMAL path. Regardless of how much of a believer you are in God, things always work out in the end.

If you get an admit, great! If you get an admit late for you to apply for a study permit, defer the application, work on yourself and enjoy in the meantime. If you get all rejects, take a gap year. Intern at someplace full time, develop skills, apply again if you feel that it is absolutely necessary still one year down the road.

Everything is going to be fine. You are going to be the person you work and wish to be, regardless of the path you choose to take, somehow one way or the other.

Sending all of you courage, patience and serenity out there!"

styzbh,0,2022-02-16,Should I bother applying?,Maximum_Perspective3,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/styzbh/should_i_bother_applying/,"Hi guys, I am a final year undergrad AI student at a UK university. I got my first internship in my first year and I have worked for that company since then, changing roles and getting experience in pretty much all key areas (total experience right now stands at 1 year full time and 2.5 more part-time).

I got a distinction during my first year, but I got the worst overall mark possible during second year…. and failed one class, which I passed. This was due to mental health issues.

Since then, I have gone through a successful year in industry (which counts 10% toward my final degree), and I am currently getting excellent marks in all my modules, never dropping below 70%. I am confident that I have already secured a high GPA.

That in combination with my experience and references should help me to get in the ML specialisation program.

However, I checked my transcript and it only includes years 1 &amp; 2…. So there will be no record of my current progress if I apply before graduation. 

1. Do you think it is worth it applying now and explaining all that? Or should I just wait until graduation and apply for next spring entry?

2. Can I apply now to see what happens, and if rejected apply immediately after again?

3. In how long can the fastest possible completion of the program be done?"

I'm also currently working full-time, and do not have a STEM background or much coding experience prior to the program. I have hobbies outside of work, but no children or other major responsibilities.

I want to arrange my schedule to maximize summer 2023 internship opportunities at a different company (ideally FAANG or another competitive company). It seems like this recruiting cycle will start this summer and bleed into early 2023.

So I'd like to squeeze-in the most relevant course work for landing internships if possible. But starting this program in winter makes this a bit tricky.

My tentative plan to take only 162 in spring quarter, while working on LeetCode and perhaps some side projects (maybe also doing some Udemy web dev prep). Then, potentially quit my current full-time job at the beginning of July (I can't afford to quit earlier than this) and take 290 (web dev) and 261 (data structures) over the summer. In fall, my rough plan is to take 325 (algorithms), 340 (databases), and 271 (arch/assembly).

**Would love any general feedback, but a few specific questions:**

* Would you do anything differently in my shoes?
* Would 290 and 261 be possible to complete over summer term while working full-time? If not working full-time? I would be interested in building up more savings through the summer, but seems like the work load would be too intense on top of interview prep.
* Does delaying taking 271 until fall put me at any sort of disadvantage? Does it make sense to prioritize interview prep and side projects for spring quarter?

Thanks!!!"

I got into a 2 year computer system diploma program in Sept at a polytechnic school that had a good reputation locally. The thing is I hate it, the quality of teaching and the problems we work on is not comparable to the cs courses that I took in uni. I am heavily burnt out from being in post secondary for 6 years without a break. Both of these factors makes me super unmotivated and tired of doing the thing I love, which is coding.

I had a part time job through the entire time I was in this program (1.5 terms), and for the first term it was fine. But this term I am really struggling to keep up due to the inflexible nature of the program, which forces you to take 6 courses and be present for every class. During this term I was juggling applying and interviewing for a summer internship and working part time on top of my classes. Currently my part time role is in software dev at a startup and I couldn’t pass up on the opportunity. Most people that graduate from this program starts off as QA or mainly work for smaller companies, but I want to work for a big N company.

I have already landed a 8 month SDE at a mid size company internship for the summer, but I am wondering if I should drop out right now and concentrate on specific topics that will be related to what I will be working on and put more hours into my current work? So I can hopefully be really good at what I am doing and land a full time offer. I’m pretty disciplined, so I was hoping to do TOP and supplement it with ossu to become more well rounded and deepen my understand of cs? Or I contemplating applying to Mcit or HES for a masters instead?

I will need to drop out in May since the project course overlap with internship. If I do want to continue I would need to take 4 courses over the summer and winter in order to continue to the next term.

How much does a degree in cs matter? If you have relevant experience and a stem degree? I am just scared that I won’t be able to land anything after Dec without school. I only have a couple internships ( I have 4 within software and 2 in software development), idk if that is enough to apply for full time roles or enough knowledge to land and do well in a jr role.

Also to add, would you recommend taking a role as a QE at a F100 company better than SDE role at a mid size company? How important is recognition?

TLDR; Have part time dev job rn, and an SDE internship lined up. Debating to dropping 2 year CS diploma since I am miserable in school and would rather get paid to learn.

Any insight would greatly be appreciated! Thank you so much :)."

Not sure where to go from here.,Bigbuckrocks,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/su8248/its_been_almost_a_year_since_i_went_no_contact_on/,"Despite cutting off contact with her in April, I spent most of last year detoxing myself from her by removing all conversations, blocking her on social media, and removing her name and comments wherever possible on my posts. I avoided dating for a while after this because I wasn’t having much luck with dating apps to the point where I ended up unintentionally using another person (who was actually interested) as my first girlfriend despite having platonic feelings for her because she was the safest bet. I now realize that this was very selfish of me and unfair to her.

We met in the summer of 2020, but after that, in the fall of that year, this dynamic was an absolute mess and I only wish that back then I had the self-respect that I do now to cut her off sooner. After I cut off contact, I got vaccinated against COVID, I finished college, I got an internship which turned into a job, and I started living on my own for the first time. Despite all of this though, my brain didn’t want to move on and was stuck in the past for a while.

I’m approaching the anniversary of the day I ended things with her once and for all, and I feel like my quality of life has improved. Maybe not dramatically, but it’s definitely been better since I kicked her out of my life. I’m still not sure if I’m ready to date, but I’m making an effort to work out more frequently, and I want to improve my personality as well. The next time I get into a relationship, I don’t want it to be out of desperation or “because everyone else is doing it,” or “because nobody else is giving me attention.”

Whatever happens in the future for me dating-wise, I’m going to be much more careful in choosing who I share personal things with. I do know that I haven’t been devoting as much energy to thinking about her as before, and I believe that work is distracting me from doing so.

I did also start a self-esteem workbook last night, hopefully this will get me to a point where I can truly love myself."

Currently I'm in my 3rd year of the degree which is a 12 months Internship. I'm working at a Company called '99x' which comes under the Top 5 in Sri Lanka. After completing my Internship this July, I'll be starting my Final year at my University where hopefully I'll be graduating in September 2023.

After Graduating I'm planning to go to UK and do the MSc in Big Data at University of Westminster. I chose University of Westminster as it is the Affiliated University of the degree which I'm following now so that I get course fee reductions and stuff. Also according to the research I did, University of Westminster seems more affordable comparing to other Universities in UK and Australia.

I have read about the Visa structure in UK that soon after I complete the 1 year MSc, I'll be getting the PSW Visa for 2 years where during that I will have to hunt for a Sponsored Job so that I can Convert the PSW Visa to a Tier-2 Visa and stay for another 5 years which will count towards the ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain). So my ultimate goal is to get the ILR and become a UK Citizen.

Many people have complains about UK's weather and climate where I have no complains at all regarding that because I consider myself as a Pluviophile who shows love towards rain and gloomy cold weather. 

So what I have to get to know is, How difficult is it to find a Sponsored Software Engineering Job during the PSW visa period in the UK. I'm good at English and I'm confident in attending Interviews. But I want to know that is Software Engineering a demand in the UK and is it a sure thing whether I will get to become a Citizen of the UK, so that I can invest the money on it.

I'd love to have advices too! 

Thanks alot in Advance :)"

sudimq,12,2022-02-16,Abusing Worker's Love for Animals to Underpay and Overwork Them (Animal Industry Jobs),Creepyredditadmin,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sudimq/abusing_workers_love_for_animals_to_underpay_and/,"**(NOTE: Please do not share your opinion about zoos/aquariums in this post. We are entitled to our own opinions regarding the institutions, but this post is about the treatment of the workers specifically and not pertaining to the animals themselves.)**

So, I'm a zookeeper. I went to school for it, did internships (all unpaid, see title of post for reasoning), and have since struggled to find employment in the field (if you saw my COVID/government post on here). I have two personal accounts of how companies take advantage of their worker's love for animals and how there will likely not be much done to change that

When I was in college, I interned first at a zoo and next an aquarium 5 days a week (40hrs+) unpaid during the summer. I did this for two summers because it was the only way to get into the industry. You need to know people and have experience doing the job before they pay you for it. So for two summers, I made zero income and worked my ass off taking care of various zoo animals and doing exactly what my mentors were doing, the only difference between them and myself is I wasn't paid for it. In a way, to be a zookeeper you kind of have to bank on the fact you have parents to financially support you during your intern period when you're unpaid. Some places even make you pay *them* for the opportunity to intern. I had to pay *$500* to intern one time. Some of you may read that and say ""just walk away and find somewhere else!"" But it's either that or I don't intern at all. And there are not very many aquariums and zoos to have a solid pick. I either got the experience and paid the money or I didn't intern and made it much harder for myself to find a job in that field in the future. They will only hire you if you have experience.

At lunch one day, the keepers I was working with were talking about how it was best to marry someone with a well paying job so that us as keepers would always be financially stable. To put it into perspective, entry-level zookeepers (fresh out of college) at most places pay \~$2-5 above minimum wage. Ex) minimum wage is $13, entry-level keepers made $16-18. The most senior level keepers, although I can't give a specific hourly, make \~55k/year. This changes based on location and company, but it's a general rule of thumb.

Basically, when I was getting into this industry they told us to accept the fact we would never be making enough money to live comfortably without extra assistance (spouse, family, second job, etc.) Many zoos and aquariums will explain that they cannot pay their keepers more because a lot of their income goes to the care of these animals and being able to work with animals everyday and doing something you love is to them a very fair trade off for not being paid well. Meanwhile, they continue to pay their CEOs and other office staff a fair wage. I've spoken to multiple trainers, many who have a second job they work on their off days to make ends meet. Others are fortunate to have spouses with better jobs.

My point is, we are all being taken advantage of for our love of animals and working with animals. Everyone wants to work with animals, who wouldn't love to spend every day interacting with sloths and elephants? These companies know that those who are serious about working with animals will do anything to work with them. Like take an unpaid internship, accept low pay, etc. Keepers always worked overtime and would sometimes have to be at work all night or as early as 4:30am to fulfill the needs of an animal. Zookeepers are some of the most selfless people I have met and put the animals before themselves. Yet they are compensated poorly for their passion.

My other story involves the pet health industry (veterinary services) and how vet offices will do the same to their staff as well, especially those considered low on the totem pole such as vet techs and front desk receptionists. I never had a first day at this vet office because I pretty much walked out during my interview. This also was a specific experience I had with a specific company that owned multiple vet offices. I cannot say the same for small run vet offices and hope they are better than what I witnessed. I'll explain what I noticed while there as to why I left:

I got a call from a recruiter for a large veterinary company that had multiple locations in the city I live. They wanted me to apply to be a ""front-desk receptionist"" someone who answered calls, booked appointments, helped customers pay their bills, etc. Basically the first person that someone sees when they bring in their pet. I had been struggling to get into the zoo-keeping field and was looking to work with animals in anyway possible. So I applied and was interviewed by the same recruiter over the phone. I was told I would be making anywhere between $18-20/hr based on experience and it was a job where I would have to multitask a lot. She forwarded my resume to the vet office, who later reached out to have another interview with their HR department.

I went to the interview and was asked pretty much the same questions as the recruiter did. It was going normally, no red-flags yet. The first red-flag was actually when she explained the job to me, saying that front-desk receptionists would often have to take on the roles of vet techs and would be trained partly as a vet tech. This meant that I would fill in for vet techs if needed with any of their responsibilities. So on top of running a busy front desk where phones had been ringing off the hook since I first walked in, I would also be helping with blood draws or anything needed of me. I asked more about it and was explained that they were often short-staffed and everyone who worked with the animals needed to be adaptable to all positions. Ok...

When it was my turn to ask questions, I mentioned an estimated salary as the job post did not mention one and the recruiter had given me a pretty broad range on the phone. She asked me how much the recruiter had told me and said ""oh no, receptionists make $14-16 an hour based on experience. Because you haven't worked in a vet office before you would probably start with $14."" I was shocked to hear that, $14 is the minimum wage here and in the job requirements it lists that they are looking for someone with a Bachelor's degree in biology. I just did four years of college to work minimum wage at a vet office? AND they wanted me to take on the responsibilities of a vet tech? I would've been more onboard with doing that if I was compensated for that, but it seems they were also only paying their vet tech staff at most $18. I shut the interview down pretty quickly after and left... their reasoning was also that because we are working with animals, we should be ok with the pay.

This is a bit of a rant but the animal industry isn't really the most popular one out there, so many might not know of how much they truly try to gaslight and coerce you into thinking you're being ridiculous for asking for better pay when you get to work with animals everyday ffs!"

suezut,6,2022-02-16,"I got fired from PwC’s Scholarship Program due to various factors, should I keep them on my resume when applying to other big 4s?",dmn661,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/suezut/i_got_fired_from_pwcs_scholarship_program_due_to/," 

I got a college PwC Scholarship with the expectation that I would work for them after 4 years of college where I did internships every summer of college. Unfortunately, I messed things up during the pandemic as online school was terrible for me given my loud, toxic and dysfunctional household. My GPA dropped below the required amount and I had to change my degree from Accounting to Finance (long story, my school was very strict and I got some Cs and got kicked out of the program) making me in violation of my contract. Since I switched to Finance I was short 6 credits to be CPA exam eligible and did them at my local community college. The firm was aware of all of this and said it was okay initially as I would simply start as an Associate in January 2022. 

I wanted to start full time as just regular staff however, T=they said I could not start full time since I was not “CPA eligible” (even though there are a lot of persons who work there that aren’t qualified and are studying part time). I practically had to beg them for an internship that was $10 an hour because I really needed the money to pay off a tuition debt and they told me I am ineligible to be an intern. They accepted and I started 1 month after my graduation in May 2021 in assurance.. Things were going well or so I thought… my “buddy” gave me a bad review and sent it directly to HR instead of telling me in real-time. The review said stuff like since my bullet points and formatting of a rep letter was “off” and a lot of other negative stuff. 

They then extended my contract and I switched to tax. I felt very uncomfortable on the team as a lot of making fun of and even racist comments were said in a private group chat. My manager was terrible at explaining and my anxiety felt that I would be annoying if I continuously misunderstood and asked questions. I attempted the extremely hard task myself and did the entire thing wrong the whole time. My manager told me to stop working on it and I never heard from her again. Once she explained it to me, I was willing to stay up all night to fix it. The next week I got a call from HR wanting to meet with my manager where she basically called my dumb in a nice way. Her review gave me 1/5 for everything and she didn’t even comment on the good work that I had previously done for her. She even rated me 1/5 on something that was not even applicable. I then told HR that this does not reflect the hard work that I did before this and would like more reviews. Another manager did the same thing as my assurance manager and said that I didn’t do the tasks she assigned when I did them… I believe this was the other tax manager telling her to write those things. I felt gaslit and embarrassed. I worked closely with an associate who always commended the hard work I would do despite it being foreign to me. He was unfortunately on vacation and I never got his review. 

A temporary job opportunity that was paying 5x more and would allow me to pay my tuition debt AND have money left over arose. It was perfect, I would start in November and finish in January 2022, just in time to start as an Associate and sit my exams. The position was posted on Tuesday, I interviewed on Thursday and was hired on Friday and expected to start on Monday. My intern PwC contract was coming to an end and I had verbally agreed to continue until December 2021 despite them initially saying there was no space and I was ineligible. I was contemplating very hard on the decision to leave money vs continued building connections at PwC. I told my PwC manger that I had a family emergency on Monday as my mom and I sat down and tried to figure it out together. We decided that the best option that would bring me closer to my goal of being a CPA would be the one that helped me receive my transcript to apply for my NTS. I do not know employment etiquette and thought it would be rude to explain that I got another job. I told them that I would not be contenting my internship due to personal circumstances. 1 week later I got a letter stating that the firm will not be hiring me due to “GPA” and “resignation”. On the Zoom meeting with a partner and the HR lady, they had found out where I went to work (never told them this) and said that I was supposed to immediately tell them that I applied to this job. They also said that it was unfair to other scholarship recipients and that other PwC staff felt that way too. They also said that I messed up my departments plans because they were expecting an intern (despite them saying that they don’t hire interns in the winter and that I was initially ineligible) They said I was disloyal to the company and that my GPA was too risky when in reality It was because I took this temp job as the firm KNEW of my low GPA from the start. I also think that my “bad” reviews played a part. My official contract also never started so why would they use the term resign? I was heartbroken and crying about their decision because had it really been about my GPA (despite getting 3.8 and above all the previous years), this decision would have been made from then.

I now have to self fund my CPA journey. I have fallen into a state of depression and feel worthless. I have now decided that I will apply to other firms who accept persons without CPAs as “ staff accountant” but I am worried about my resume. Should I take the 4 years of experience in a big 4 firm off? Should I keep it on an explain this in a cover letter? How would I do this in such a way that doesn’t let me look bad? I really don’t know what to do.

TLDR; I got fired from PwC’s Scholarship Program due to various factors, should I keep them on my resume when applying to other big 4s?"

Just to provide a little bit of background, I’m a High School Senior from the Northeast planning to go to either my state flagship school or head out to one of the NY Tech Schools (RPI, RIT, Stony Brook, etc.). I’d prefer going to my state flagship, even though it’s not really up there wrt CS prestige, mainly because it’s closer to my family, offers good in-state tuition, and is around a place I’ve been familiar with. While prestige and the like isn’t the first thing on my mind, I’m likely going to work towards transferring to some more notable college (Georgia Tech/UIUC/UCSD, schools like UCB/UCLA are the dream but require significant of work to be competitive) to be in a better position to attain internships and connections. 


I kinda slacked off the first three years of high school; I settled mostly for Bs in advanced classes where I could probably be attaining something higher say I put in the work in. I’ll admit that I was a lazy person. I still kinda am. Nowadays, I’m doing quite a bit better, more around the A/A- range on average, which I think will better set me up for my aforementioned transfer hopes. 


To finish up the background, I’ve pretty much known that I wanted to do something CS/Software related for the past 5-6 years. I already know an ok amount of Python, am doing a bit of Java for AP Computer Science, and I’m looking towards learning the full-stack trio. I think HTML / CSS / JS is ideal here as webdev to my knowledge has one of the lower barriers to entry, being something I can probably build up a resume with alongside Python in the next year or two. I took extra classes during my first semester since midyear grades are the last things that colleges really see and also because it lets me now have half my schedule be study halls. 


As for my questions, here are a few of them:

Any good courses/resources to use in learning these languages? I’ve been looking into Udemy Courses on full stack, but I’m unsure where to start. 

What guides are out there with regards to setting oneself up for success in internships and the job field? Any advice would be great.

Is there anything I should probably know going into this? I feel like I know a good amount of what I need to know in order to prepare myself for a career in Software Development, but there’s certainly more out there. I know that’s the mentality I need to have in this field, so again, any advice you can give me is greatly appreciated. 


As always, thank you for reading this. Have a nice day."

i want to just take the risk  with ibm but will also hate my life if i dont work on valuable coding  projects with supervisors that know what they are doing also. ideally,  it would be nice if someone that did the same ibm internship could give  input, but that is unlikely. im banking on the fact that since soft dev is in the name of the role, i will hopefully be writing code"
surfqj,5,2022-02-17,I (21M ) have gotten myself involved in a very complex social situation with my college friends and I don't know how to act with them now,natzelo,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/surfqj/i_21m_have_gotten_myself_involved_in_a_very/,"I'm finally writing down my first post about what has caused me immense pain over the last 3 years and now I am completely lost and don't know how I should act or even if I should act. I will divide this long post into Acts (because there is an extraordinary amount of drama involved).

&gt;Just read this a light soap-opera-like novel if you will.

ACT I

This all started when I went to my university for the first time in 2019. My classes were offline back then since there was no COVID. We were a group of 6 people who used to hang out all the time together. Let's call them Gail (F), Alex (M), Mary (F), AJ (M) and Kate (F). From the moment we got on together, the complications had started.

Firstly I became good friends with Alex (who had a crush on Gail ) and then we both became good friends with Kate. After we three started hanging out more often (we 6 as group where still hanging out) Kate and Alex started having feelings for each other (Kate had a bf back then too). This always made me feel like a third wheel among them. In the meanwhile I tried to befriend Gail (while keeping Alex's crush on her secret, which kinda made it awkward) and she was very reserved so our friendship never hit it off . I also became good friends with Mary.

    TLDR; Alex and Kate started having feelings for each other and I had to keep that a secret from everyone and I felt like a third wheel with them. 

ACT II

Me and Mary are day scholars at the campus and we weren't invited to the fest by the rest of the group. This made me kinda really sad and I questioned if they truly are my friends or not. I eventually chose to forget it .

I decided to not be the third wheel after this incident and Alex and Kate started hanging out without me. Meanwhile I cherished and enjoyed my friendship with Mary (I still tried to get to know Gail more but she wouldn't let her guard down maybe because I made a lil inappropriate joke when we met first).

Kate's bf started getting jealous about Alex (rightly so) and threatened Alex in many ways. Kate's bf wasn't exactly non violent and after a lot of turmoil, insults and arguments, ultimately Alex and Kate A stopped talking after this. Of course I had to keep this a secret from Mary and Gail. I was still friends with both Alex and Kate and when we 6 hung out together they never talked to each other. (Mary didn't like Kate much from the beginning). Alex started to pursue Gail romantically again.

    TLDR; Alex and Kate stopped talking after Kate's bf found out and I stayed friends with each of them separately while keeping the secret that were ever together from the rest of the group. 

ACT III

This is where I think I fucked up the most. As petty revenge for not inviting me to the fest , I didn't invite Alex to a seminar out of town and went there with Gail and Kate. He was super angry at me but decided to forget about it after I apologized (but I think he never forgave me for it). Despite all this drama going on in the background, we 6 still hung out together.

Alex's pursuit of Gail started bearing fruits and they started going out. Me and Mary also developed feelings for each other and enjoyed each other's company. See, neither Gail nor Mary wanted that our relationships go public but me and Alex told each other everything. So at this point, I pretend Gail and Alex are just friends and Alex pretends that me and Mary are just friends whenever we 6 all hangout together.

**COVID has now started and we are playing this little game from our homes by texting each other.**

Above arrangement went on for a while before it all came crashing down. Alex felt that although he and Gail like each other, he couldn't see their future together so they very very slowly started drifting away. Meanwhile, Mary and Alex became really good friends. At first I didn't had a problem with it but then they started spending more time together and I barely got to talk to Mary. *I felt like a third wheel 'again' in my own relationship and it was because of Alex, again.* So I got jealous, very jealous. **Whenever I would text Mary, she would already be texting Alex. And whenever we would be texting each other, she would stop texting me whenever Alex came online.** They both claimed that their feelings towards each other is completely platonic (I believed it too) but I still couldn't talk to her as much now.

After some reconciliation, we decided to just remain friends. This was too painful for me so I stopped texting her for a while. When I texted her after a month, she said the friendship was dead now too.

    TLDR; Alex got together with Gail and I got together with Mary. Alex and Mary became good friends and she started spending more with him than with me. My jealousy caused our relationship to fail. 

ACT IV

I still had Alex and we still talked often. At this point I was in good terms with him AJ and Kate (Gail was reserved as always and didn't reciprocate much ). Then I did an internship together with AJ and didn't mention this to Alex. Which made him upset and he stopped talking to me.

I must have called him a 100 times to apologize but he never picked up. After a few months he decided he has forgiven me. So after this, since COVID was still there, I called him every 14 days to talk and catch up. (Just like how Gail never called me, he also never did) and gave me dry replies. It sometimes felt as if I was talking to a wall. Then came the final nail to our friendship's coffin.

There was an interview like group viva exam with our professor and me and Alex were in a group together with other people. When one of the guy who doesn't study much couldn't give an answer, I raised my hand to answer it. This made Alex very upset and he argued,

""How could you raise your hand for multiple answers, when you see your fellow batchmate struggling to give a single one!? You are making him look worse just so you look better""

And we haven't talked to each other since then.

    TLDR; Alex got upset because I didn't tell him I have gotten an internship, and he got upset because I raised my hand to answer questions. Our friendship died. 

ACT V

So presently, Kate and AJ have become the bestest of friends. I still try to be on good terms with both of them. Obviously, I m not talking to Alex and Mary who both now hate Kate along with me. Gail is ever mysterious for me and has never reciprocated (And I don't even know why), I talked to her yesterday. Today, I found out through Kate that she is coming to my town to stay with her. (she didn't even tell me that as if she doesn't wanna meet).

I don't know if Gail talks to Alex or not. I don't know if Alex and Mary talk to each other or not. I don't know who is spilling what secrets to whom. I don't know which two people still genuinely like each other.

    TLDR; Kate and AJ are friends and  I'm in good terms with both of them. Gail deliberately tries not to tell me stuff. I'm haven't talked  to  Alex and Mary.  

I'm devastated and confused.

Should I keep trying to talk to Gail like I have been trying for the last past three years?  
How much should I talk to Kate and AJ (with whom I'm still in good terms with ) given that Kate is friends with Gail and AJ is friends with Alex?

How will I ever face these people when the university reopens offline?

What should I do?"

I'm a sophomore in college(international) and I kinda wanna transfer to a top college.

Also I have a H4 US visa. Should I apply with that, or should I apply for an F1 visa. I don't plan on working right out of college, I will do my Masters after undergrad most prolly.

High school: 97/100 SAT:1570 TOEFL:111

Intended major: Computer Science or Mathematics

ECs in High School: Honestly not a lot, choreographed stuff for the dance team and won a few science competitions. I didn't have a great time in HS. I was top 5 in my year tho.

ECs in college: \* research intern in an IIT(Machine Learning) 

\*Worked with a prof on a national project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(used python and ML for speech recognition.)

\*Assistant-head of coding club in college,  founded a club on ML and robotics in the past winter.

\*Upcoming research intern in a t15 college in the USA this summer.(not Harvard)

\*Maybe(just maybe), I might simultaneously work remotely with a prof. in Europe in the summer, depends on if I'll be able to manage 2 internships simultaneously.\[It's an unpaid position tho\]

\*Diploma in classical dance(basically equivalent to a B.A. degree) 

\*ongoing AI research assistant in my university

\*Associate Editor in the Journal of Young Investigators\[since nov '21\]

\*Will be publishing a paper\[not first-author\] on my work in my prev ML internship

Awards in college: 

\*Medal for highest grade at the end of freshman year.(cumulative GPA till now is 9.79/10) 

\*Won one national level hackathons and runner up in another.

The only con is that I'm not from a top college in my country. It is well known in my state tho. How bad will it affect my application.

LOR: a solid 10/10( I believe at least lol) Haven't started with essays yet."

But their tone of voice and faces just came across as annoyed (even though it might not have been to someone else or maybe they were just a bit tired).

But that gut feeling of ""they are annoyed by me"" or ""they don't like me"" just won't leave for hours sometimes. Now putting it out here in text it's getting better but I would like some tips on how to calm myself.

Does anyone have any good advice on how to do this? Like maybe a mental exercise?"

I'm not a particularly good software developer, neither on paper nor by aptitude. I was very forthright during the interviews of my limitations, ostensibly to communicate to them to not waste their time, but I think the CEO took it as a ""Wowie wow! This boy's got gumption!""   
This time last year I was long-term unemployed having graduated right before Covid, with no internships, fat, and making chocolates as a hobby (Which is how I got fat; for those building a mental image of me, I am no longer fat (Pinky promise)). I then spent about six months at a janky start up (Where issues with my performance *had* been mentioned), which I learned a *lot* in thanks to a great mentor, but after which I was furloughed due to funding difficulties. I've spent the past few months unemployed but much less depressed. 


The prospect of raking in ~$500 a day pre-tax, fully remote, with various perks is obviously too good to pass off but I'm nervous as hell. I guess I can take a head start and take a few Udemy courses before I plunge in the deep end but I still feel like at some point I'm going to reach my competency ceiling. I can write neat code, but at the startup I was given the task of integrating AWS and was absolutely overwhelmed until they brought in a dedicated AWS guy.

Just to provide a little bit of background, I’m a High School Senior from the Northeast planning to go to either my state flagship school or head out to one of the NY Tech Schools (RPI, RIT, Stony Brook, etc.). I’d prefer going to my state flagship, even though it’s not really up there wrt CS prestige, mainly because it’s closer to my family, offers good in-state tuition, and is around a place I’ve been familiar with. While prestige and the like isn’t the first thing on my mind, I’m likely going to work towards transferring to some more notable college (Georgia Tech/UIUC/UCSD, schools like UCB/UCLA are the dream but require significant of work to be competitive) to be in a better position to attain internships and connections. 

I kinda slacked off the first three years of high school; I settled mostly for Bs in advanced classes where I could probably be attaining something higher say I put in the work in. I’ll admit that I was a lazy person. I still kinda am. Nowadays, I’m doing quite a bit better, more around the A/A- range on average, which I think will better set me up for my aforementioned transfer hopes. 

To finish up the background, I’ve pretty much known that I wanted to do something CS/Software related for the past 5-6 years. I already know an ok amount of Python, am doing a bit of Java for AP Computer Science, and I’m looking towards learning the full-stack trio. I think HTML / CSS / JS is ideal here as webdev to my knowledge has one of the lower barriers to entry, being something I can probably build up a resume with alongside Python in the next year or two. I took extra classes during my first semester since midyear grades are the last things that colleges really see and also because it lets me now have half my schedule be study halls. 

As for my questions, here are a few of them:
Any good courses/resources to use in learning these languages? I’ve been looking into Udemy Courses on full stack, but I’m unsure where to start. 
What guides are out there with regards to setting oneself up for success in internships and the job field? Any advice would be great.
Is there anything I should probably know going into this? I feel like I know a good amount of what I need to know in order to prepare myself for a career in Software Development, but there’s certainly more out there. I know that’s the mentality I need to have in this field, so again, any advice you can give me is greatly appreciated. 

As always, thank you for reading this. Have a nice day."

I love coding but admittedly I didn't do much outside of school in my spare time to improve myself so I'm lacking compared to other students (no internships and my only project on my resume is my senior capstone) so I'm not too surprised I'm finding it hard to get a good job. I know a lot of people say working at Infosys isn't great, but I can handle a bad job for one or two years if I'm getting paid and it helps me break into the industry. I'm starting grad school in fall anyways so it might be better not having a demanding job for two years while completing my masters, and I can use the time I'm benched to get better at coding and cs in general. My main concern left is that some people say it will affect your career overall, and I don't want to take the job if it will hurt my chances down the road of landing something better. Money isn't that important so I don't necessarily need to work at a FAANG company but I obviously don't want to stay at Infosys for too long, I'd like to actually work at a real software company and not a consultancy. I'm mainly wondering if that'll still be achievable if I spend a year or two with Infosys and if it'll give me something I can put on my resume so I'm not wasting two years like I wasted time during undergrad.

TL;DR: Will working at Infosys actually hinder me from getting a better job in the future, and also will I gain anything during my time there?"

So I recently started doing an internship in a company as required by my university. At the side I made a deal to stay 1 month extra working informally at this place.

Now, I finished the 3 months and apparently, it seems I was being told that I would be here 4 months, and I honestly remember being told 3 months (it wasn't written anywhere because of how informal the deal was). 

But anyway the problem is that I expected to at least finish my 3 months and be hired full time with a decent salary and to have at least the required stuff by law. But now, with 3 days left until my 3 months are over, they told me that they expected me to stay the 4 months, and that the original conditions of me being here would apply (the same payment and same hours), and I don't know what to do. I fully expected to be hired and haven't even searched for anything else. I will talk to them in a moment and don't know what to tell them, the only thing I'm planning right now is asking for at least more payment. But at the same time, I don't like this deal of being paid under the table (which seems that would remain even if they do hire me), and I was planning of searching for something else because of it, but I don't really have anything else at the moment.

Let me give you some background... Before November, I couldn't even explain to you what a hash map was, stg. I wasn't able to pass any OA's so I just stopped applying to companies. Over winter break, I realized I needed to get serious if I wanted to do somethin crazy. So, I hit leetcode, (explore cards), learned  the data structures in depth. Got CTCI book, read through a couple chapters. Really spent time understanding the basic concepts. After winterbreak had ended, I had finished about 35 LCs and was able to get most easy problems and explain my thought process while doing them. Now was the time to start sending out applications and takin OAs.

Btw I go to a t15 CS school.

Jan 12 - applied to amazon sde internship

Jan 19 - sent OA 1 (8/15 test cases passed for 1, 15/15 for 2)

I've also checked a few websites such as Major League Hacking and DevPost, to no avail. I've also tried asking the student support at my school, but the CS program is very new, and very few resources have been implemented as of yet.

A little bit of background about my situation. I'm in my late twenties, have been working an unrelated career for 10 years, and am working towards a career change to SWE. I've been learning to code for 2 years, and have been enrolled in WGU's Bs of CS, and am about 60% finished. For those who don't know, this in an accredited university CS program that is fully online. I went this route because I cannot afford to stop working for 4 years. WGU allows students to take courses at their own pace, and year-round with no breaks, so I have been hustling, and plan to graduate in December 2022. 

I have started looking for summer internships (it's late I know, but it seems many companies are just starting to hire interns still). I have had very little success applying to dev roles, with only one company giving me a phone screen, still waiting on a potential interview with them. I am applying at literally every company that has SWE internships in my city or remote. My portfolio isn't great, I have a basic Flask web app that is deployed on a VPS and displays live stock prices and stuff, and a JavaFX (lol) school project. I am working on some other stuff, but I work full time and am in university so it's difficult.

I started applying to QA internships because I ran out of dev ones to apply to, and have been getting more responses. I've got 2 interviews scheduled this week. But I don't particularly want to do QA, especially since these roles sound like lots of manual testing. And I have a well-paying job although I hate it, so I would be taking a massive pay cut for 4 months to do an internship. So I only want to do an internship if it is gonna help me land a SWE job in the future. I can most likely resume working at my current company after the internship if needed.

So I guess TLDR is having a QA internship on my resume better than no internship when I apply to junior dev roles? Enough to be worth struggling financially for a few months?"

I went to a top 50 CS school, good GPA. Been hunting for an internship since Sophomore year (50+ apps). No luck then. In junior year, I probably applied to 150+ different internships. Other than Amazon, I didn't get any interviews. I did get some OAs, most of which I did well on, but not one single interview after. With school going on and having a life, I basically only had 2 weeks to start leetcoding and getting my shit together. Luckily, your boy clutched up and was able to secure that Amazon internship.

My senior year I got the return offer from Amazon so I'm chilling, only applying to places that offer better pay and are remote or near my location. Got some OAs, no responses until Google decides that they'll take a chance on me. The timeline gets tricky here, as my Amazon offer deadline is really soon. Basically, I had one week before the interview if I wanted to get this done before that deadline. And so, I leetcoded for a week and, would ya know it, I aced that Google interview, and that's where I am now.

So here I am now, wondering wtf is wrong with this process for new grads. Seriously, it was borderline impossible to get an internship. I applied local, online, career fair, you name it. If Amazon hadn't offered me that internship, who knows where the fuck I'd be. Admittedly, my resume was complete dogshit (seriously, I had some projects but I had so little content I listed hobbies lmao), but damn man 1 response out of 150 apps is stupid.

It feels nice to be 2/2 in my interviews! It isn't much experience, but if you're interested in hearing my thoughts on how to pass them let me know I guess. And thanks for reading this far into my flex. I just wanted to share with some people that actually know how stupid this grind can be."

Trying to review my options and come up with a plan of what might be the best play for me long term. Currently, I am from Canada and 1.5-2 years out from graduating with a CS degree. I was pretty late to the intern game (have 0) and will be aiming to try for the 2023 year.

I would like to work in the US after graduation and I am currently trying to decide between going straight into a master's program at a well-known graduate school (Illinois, Carnegie Mellon, etc) or trying to get into a US Fang and somewhere down the line getting my masters. For my master's, I would like to specialize in AI/Machine Learning so Carnegie Mellon seems like a good fit if I can get in.

My question then is given that I foresee my chances in trying to land a decently paying SWE job in the US right off the bat as slim to none, should I just bite the bullet and prioritize the masters all the while grinding out leetcode, more projects, etc. (Masters would also allow me to get an OPT visa which would make landing a job a bit easier, I imagine).

Any advice is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!"

* TOEFL 105
* No research papers
* No internships
* No job experience
* I had made an android app for my undergrad college consisting of the ERP system, so I think this added weightage to my profile.
* A lot of volunteer experience in student chapters and student council in my undergrad

Moreover, she also told me that the work given to interns are of the same level as a normal SWE. I have some intermediate knowledge of Java (up till OOP) though I have not used Spring at all. The manager also informed me that I can only spend 20% of my time on this project and the remaining 80% on solving bug issues. Moreover, the pay is essentially minimum wage.

For the past 3 weeks, I have been looking through documentations and I still do not understanding the codebase. I have always have the feeling of anxiety because there are days when I can just stare at the documentation mindlessly, or simply browse through tons of reddit posts, and in turn no work gets done. This has led to me dreading to go to work every morning. I do acknowledge the benefit of toughing it out during the internship, which is to add ur work experience on your resume that serves as a stepping stone for better internships. However, I just feel that this is going to be the norm for the remaining two months and I don’t think I can persevere any longer. 

So I have been wondering...is it ok to resign/quit from this internship or not? I do not mind looking for other SWE related opportunities and focus my time on preparing for future interviews (e.g. LeetCode, projects ... etc) as I would be free for the next few months."

However, I got an offer to start an academy in ServiceNow (SoftServe) a very well-known company in Europe, which will last for 3 months. They have to choose 8 out of 60 people to assemble a group for this academy. If I do good during the academy, they will offer me internship position which will pay 3x less than what I mentioned beforehand. The duration of this internship is 4 months and next step, they say, is be employed for a junior position.

Would you take a loan to live off these 4 months of internship (academy duration is fine since I do not have to leave my current job) in order to embark on this journey or not?  
Do you know someone or do you know more about this company and perhaps some opinions of it?  
Or would you decline the offer and keep grinding with self-study and 1 year later try to become a junior web dev in another company (skipping the internship and loan part)?

1)UTSG Faculty of Arts and Science (Victoria College): Life Science

2)UTSC : Co-Op Life Science (Biological Science and Neuroscience)

3)UTM : Life Science

My plan is to pursue Medicine after Undergrad and I am awaiting for some decisions from US Universities. I want to choose a course which will support me in my endeavours.   


DILEMMA: UTSG's Vic One appeals to me and I really received positive feedback from my cousin brother about his Computer Science Course at UTSG. But I dont want to miss an opportunity to Work/Study at the same time and participate in internships during the summer by getting the work-permit for UTSC's Co-op Course. Will choosing UTSG hinder me in anyway from availing these opportunities? Which is the best option for me?

All advices and suggestions will help me in making a decision and I will be very grateful for the help!"

svowtb,327,2022-02-18,Do not join Texas DSP (Delta Sigma Pi),maamwiththepizza,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/svowtb/do_not_join_texas_dsp_delta_sigma_pi/,"Hi, this post is for anyone who is considering joining a business fraternity. I don’t know much about AKPsi or PCT, I am just here to warn about DSP. In the past year alone:

- Dozens of members defended a sexual assaulter and attempted to silence the victim
- Regular problems with sexual assault at parties
- They don’t value you and outcast you if you’re not into banking or consulting 
- Bullied pledges into dropping 
- Multiple racist comments and jokes, harassing people in front of the whole organization to the point of tears 

They have tons of problems with: 
- Racism: KKK jokes, alienating Hispanic and Black members
- Homophobia: bullying and excluding gay members, demeaning language  
- Fatphobia: shaming people for different body sizes
- Sexism: slut shaming, calling people whores, double standards against female members
- Members are extremely rude to one another, won’t hesitate to spread rumors 

Overall, TX DSP is an organization that values image over the safety and well-being of its members. They preach diversity and inclusion, but say and do things that make anyone that is not a straight male in finance uncomfortable. 

They lure you in with this illusion of “helping you with professionalism” and getting you your dream job, but in reality it’s just a group of people who make you feel so bad if you don’t have an internship that you get one and then feel like you got it because of them. If you want a hyper-competitive toxic culture of people who keep you on your toes, Delta Sigma Pi is for you but otherwise, don’t do it. You will do just fine recruitment-wise with the resources Mccombs/Internet offers. 

Members have been dropping left and right, don’t waste your time. Also, they haze pretty hard and bully their pledges to force them to trauma-bond with the organization. 

UPDATE on hazing examples:
- Making you put pledging above grades, then putting you down for not having a 4.0 during pledging
- Sleep deprivation
- Constant belittling and older members taking advantage of pledges and making them do things
- Forced alcohol consumption
- “Grooming” the pledges who older members thought were attractive (not grooming in the traditional sense, but still an abuse of power)
- Inappropriate comments / sexual harassment of pledges
- Huge one was forcing you to tell the entire organization your traumas (things like sexual assault stories, substance abuse, sickness, etc) so that you can “raise money better” for “community service” 
- Pitting pledges against each other, spreading rumors about them
- “Pimping” female pledges who are typically young freshman out on Sixth street to sell water bottles to drunk men, putting them at risk of assault. Male pledges were even told to “stand by” in case someone was assaulted.

Final Update: 
The environment of DSP is a constant cycle of suffering and bullying. People feel like they can’t leave because they’ve been through so much (trauma bonding) and isolated themselves from other support systems because the process of pledging is so time consuming and taxing on your mental and physical health. It’s common for people to lose their relationships and friendships outside of DSP, get sick, and have breakdowns while pledging. Then they take out all this anger on their peers or the next pledge class and the cycle repeats. I have heard many times things like “I want them to go through what we went through” or silencing the pledges when they speak up by saying “I had it worse.”

Also I want to emphasize that this is meant to be a warning and help students who want to join a business fraternity weigh their options. A lot of people who join these organizations are young, impressionable freshman who are very easy to exploit. As soon as we join, our entire life becomes this organization until we graduate and we think that being bullied and harassed by our peers regularly is normal. I wish that someone had warned me before I joined, and I hope this post can be that warning for others.

This is not to say that there are no benefits to joining. Some good things are having a large network of people to reach out to, knowing people in your classes, knowing people who have worked at certain companies, and its definitely possible to make genuine friendships. But once again, these are also things you can get from other resources without your mental health tanking for four years. If you are still interested in being a part of this, I recommend really doing your research and keeping your relationships outside of DSP strong. Prioritize your other interests and your health. Try not to let people who treat the organization like life or death sweep you into their drama and turn a business frat into your entire personality. Best of luck with your college experience!"

As a toddler, I was happy. The world had this magic that I simply cannot describe. Literally everything piqued my curiosity. Existence was special, interesting and important. Because even as a little child I was baffled with the idea that I exist. That we all had a place in a universe way bigger than us. I had this enthusiasm. Going around sharing new things I learned with everyone who would listen. I miss being that person. I miss waking up in the morning with curiosity and openness to what happens next.

Because as I got older and started to interact with other people more, getting to know my peers and gaining responsibilities, everything just went down the drain. At first, I’d be having a happy time playing with my peers when out of nowhere they’d get mad at me. Tell me I was being rude, too hyperactive, too talkative, annoying. I’d try to change, be more like they wanted me to, but it didn’t work. Then eventually, my parents were getting mad at me constantly too. I’d forget my chores, get a lower grade than expected, had to act a certain way and didn’t live up to their expectations. All I did was wrong.

I didn’t understand what was happening to me. Everyone hated me while all this time I was trying my hardest to be nice and accepted. I’d try to ask for help. Explain to my parents that I’m being bullied, that people hate me and I don’t know why, that I forget things, get overwhelmed quickly, that I was bored so often it started affecting my mood. I can’t count the amount of times I cried because of this. Only to be told I’m too sensitive and making things up. So I stopped asking for help. In the meantime it was all getting worse.

Eventually I thought I had it all figured out. I think I was around 9 years old. I didn’t have any friends except for some girls at school who seemed to tolerate my existence. My parents were always mad at me for one thing or another. I cried myself to sleep every night. I didn’t understand why people would treat me like that for no reason. So I thought I was being smart when I concluded it was all my own fault. That the only reason I didn’t have any single person in my life I could connect with and be myself with, was because I deserved to be treated like this. I hated myself. I realize this is fucked up, but I was already suicidal back then. A 9 year old kid and I was already convinced I’d be better off dead. But for some reason, I still had hope that things could get better. I just had to keep going.

But, for the next years things would only get worse. My parents would develop some mental health problems. My home situation was hectic. I’d see my mom beg on her knees for drugs. Or my stepdad crossing every single boundary humanly possible. My parents anger towards me only got worse. I didn’t do the dishes? That must be because you hate your parents and you like seeing us suffer. You want your mom to be depressed, don’t you? You want me to get mad at you, don’t you?

Eventually I began starving myself and self-harming. Other people crossed my boundaries constantly but I didn’t even realize I was allowed to even have them. I was a shell of a person. Everything I did was to prevent getting hurt more, but also to prevent myself from hurting other people. I felt like I was merely observing others. Watching them live while all I could do was watch. But even then I’d still have hope.

Then, at some point, things started to turn around. I somehow stumbled throughout high school with good grades, made meaningful friendships, left home and by sheer luck I finally got a psychologist who actually listened to me. I managed to get rid of my eating disorder, slowly stop self-harming and work through some stuff related to my parents. I began to realize I mattered. That I wouldn’t cause pain and destruction wherever I went. That it was okay for me to exist.

I got accepted into a university to study psychology and I wanted to do everything in my power to use my life experience for something good. My dream was to become the person I needed when I was struggling most, so I could help others going through the same. Help them get the tools they need to live happily. For the first time, I could see light at the end of the tunnel. I wasn’t there yet but I felt like I was close to finally feeling normal.

And then my internships happened. To be able to graduate, I needed 10 months of working experience in the psychology field. So I got an internship at a place that had been begging me to come work there. I thought it’d be an interesting experience. My first chance to put everything I learned to the test. But then the shit started happening again. My internship supervisor was mad at me constantly. I tried my best to communicate. To do the work the way she wanted me to. But it was always wrong somehow. Eventually I even got blamed for things I didn’t do. So I stopped after a month. And then I tried again, another internship this time. But it goes wrong, again. I could see my supervisors standing at the other side of the room whispering about me. I felt watched wherever I went. I tried to talk to them, ask if anything was wrong, if they had any feedback, if I was doing the job the way I was supposed to. But they would act like everything was fine, only to completely obliterate my self-esteem by saying all nasty shit they had been thinking all this time in one single meeting. I cried. They fired me for not “being ready” for an internship. A year later I tried again. This time it was successful, with lots of positive feedback. It didn’t feel the same anymore though. Everything related to university, internships and my dream of becoming a psychologist to help people like me just became sour.

Anyway, I don’t feel like a shell of a person anymore. I have thoughts, feelings, needs, wants. I’m not trying to power through life anymore with sheer willpower. I have a personality again. And all I feel is how I’m tired, bored and unmotivated to do anything. I thought working through my trauma, depression and getting a degree so I’d be able to support myself was all I needed. But I was wrong. I put in all this work and I still feel like shit. Which, in my opinion, feels even worse.

I realized I’m probably autistic and/or have ADHD. Since November I’ve been trying to get a referral to get tested. I’m deeply unhappy and I know this could be the solution. It’d mean I’d have an answer for the things that happened to me. And it means I’d finally be able to get the help I eventually stopped asking for as a little child. Like how I forget things and fuck shit up. Or how I procrastinate everything. Or how I can’t keep a hobby for longer than a few weeks.

But it keeps getting pushed away. First my general practitioner refused to refer me and pretty much dropped me as a patient. Then I had to find a new practitioner, explain my life story all over again, only to have them tell me my autism/adhd symptoms are probably just a result of trauma. Even though I’m pretty sure the trauma got CAUSED by autism/adhd, and autism/adhd already runs in my family. At least he still wanted to refer me...

But circumstances happened, meaning it's been 4 months and I still haven’t gotten the referral yet. After that I’ll still have to deal with waiting lists. And even then it’s still unsure whether I’ll get the help I need because the welfare system is fucked and I’m a woman with a history of trauma, so I’m afraid I’ll just get misdiagnosed with a personality disorder. It could take months, if not years to get the answers I need and until then I’m left on my own. I’m scared about this process and I’ve been reaching out to friends. But I’m noticing they’re slowly getting fed up with me constantly talking about this though. So I’m pretty sure I need to shut up about this soon or they’ll grow tired of me.

But at the same time, I’m tired too. I’ve spent my entire fucking life working on myself. But what’s the fucking point? It’s been more than 20 years and I’m still unhappy. And I wonder whether I’ll ever be. I’ve been treated like shit wherever I go no matter how hard I try to be nice. I’ve been screaming for help only to feel like no one’s listening. Sometimes it really feels like there’s a place in this world for everyone but me. I’m tired of constantly having to fight for my own right to exist. I’m tired of feeling like I can’t depend on anyone but myself. I’m tired of being unable to gain any satisfaction out of my own life and accomplishments. I’m tired of surviving. I miss the child I used to be.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I was never meant to exist. I wish I never existed."

But I feel like it’s gotten worse. I hate my body, my face, and I feel like I’m bad at everything. I’m trying to get through my work in college, and I often get distracted thinking about my inadequacy. I’m trying to get an internship and other experience for my career, but I keep getting rejected from everything and everyone around me already has plans for what they’re planning to do in the summer. I’ve been going to the gym and losing some weight so far, but there are still parts of the way I look that working out won’t fix (my nose, forehead). It sucks even more thinking about how everyone else around me had a glow up, yet I didn’t. I even feel embarrassed to go out in public. What do you all think would be the best thing for me to do now?"
svwekf,1,2022-02-18,How do you organize code into several layers of abstraction without having excessive dependencies between the layers?,dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/svwekf/how_do_you_organize_code_into_several_layers_of/,"I'm a firmware intern and my project lead sent me a chart that recommended 4 layers of abstraction for my current project: hardware, drivers, hardware abstraction layer, interface. That makes sense conceptually, but how do I decide where to draw the line between each layer?

In particular, because, for this particular project (implementing the I2C protocol between multiple devices) the driver functions have to be called for each major operation (open and initialize, close and uninitialize, determine number of devices, get device information, read, and write), what I ended up doing the first time was creating enough wrapper functions to completely obscure all the driver functions from the top layer. In principle, that sounds good, but the problem was that I ended up with too many layers of functions. It didn't help that the original code my lead wrote and told me to continue with already already had wrapper functions which still took ftHandle as an input, so I wrote more wrapper functions to further hide ftHandle.

What I tried to do last night to start fixing it was remove one of those layers by allowing ftHandle (a vector that the driver functions use to store needed information about the particular devices and which I was attempting to keep at a lower layer of abstraction) to show up in more places instead of trying way too hard to hide it. After talking to one of my colleagues, I think that was the wrong approach, since the handles are a lower layer of abstraction and probably shouldn't show up in the interface. His suggestion was, instead of having a bunch of smaller functions that don't have much content in their bodies, make fewer functions that each do more stuff. I'm not sure that'll actually help though, because I could still end up with too many dependencies within the functions themselves.

I'm gonna just start fresh with a new clone of the code I started with, but I think the larger issue is that I just don't even know the right way to approach this type of problem. My thought is to make a tree diagram that shows the main things the code needs to do, which library functions are needed for each main thing, and the order in which each task should be done. Basically the same way I'd make an outline for an essay, but in graph form. But that doesn't seem to follow from the idea of multiple layers of abstraction — ftHandle would probably show up on almost every branch and each task would have elements from all 4 layers. But I can't think of a way to actually organize all the functions in layers like that, except for what I already did, which is a mess of needless complexity.

Any advice?"

svzykn,1,2022-02-18,Would it be beneficial to start my career working from home?,detta-way,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/svzykn/would_it_be_beneficial_to_start_my_career_working/,"My whole life I knew I wanted to go into embedded systems. But I have gone through various phases in my life which made me feel I couldn’t make it in this career, but luckily I got an internship in Embedded Systems. I’m most grateful for that and feel this would help me go into a field I’ve loved so much. 

My question is would starting out WFH impact me negatively? I am comfortable working with oscilloscopes, multimeters,function generators and other equipment. But I feel working from home would be cheaper and would help me pay off my loans faster and start off my adult life. However, I feel like I would lack greatly since I wouldn’t be able to interact with other engineers and learn certain tricks and tips from them especially regarding the hands-on testing in the lab. 

What are your thoughts?"

For a personal project I'd just sign into my GitHub account in VS, but my company has a GitHub enterprise account we're using, but hasn't set up integration with VS and GitHub enterprise, so I can't do it that way.

Now I need to reclone the original version of the repository and set it up in VS as a separate project (I know I could just make a new branch with the oldest version of the file, but I'd prefer a whole separate project; plus I'll need to learn this at some point anyway) added to source control.  How do I do that?  I do remember my lead had me use an application called Git Extensions to get it set up in VS, and I still have that installed, but I find it really unintuitive to use -- almost worse than the command line -- and I haven't been able to find any tutorials for it online, so I've got no idea how to use it; I was only able to the one time because I was told exactly what to at each step."

Maybe, I know I didn't get in because of my stats and hooks lol.

&amp;#x200B;

“Welcome, Strangefellow.”

I furrowed my brow in confusion, wondering what the hag meant. To my surprise, Francesca answered.

“How do you know me?”

The hag’s voice grated, sending chills down my spine with every syllable. “I’ve been around a long time, child. Any time a plan goes to rot, there’s like as not a Strangefellow involved.”

The hag grinned, her mouth stretching until it threatened to split her face.

“But I’ve got a deal for you. I’ll let you and your little friend leave this place without harm, never looking back.”

“You’d just keep kidnapping people.” Francesca was stoic, as though speaking to an ancient monster was something she did every day. “Things like you, you’re never satisfied.”

The hag shrugged, her twig-like hands spreading in a helpless gesture. “It is my nature. Do you judge the wolf when he ravages the lamb?”

“You’re not meant to be here.” Francesca raised the crystal, its light shining golden on her face. “If you agree to return to your own world, I’ll spare you.”

“Bartering now, are we?” The hag bent over us, and I’d never felt so small. I clung tightly to Francesca’s hand, trying not to hyperventilate. “Well, I have an offer for you, Strangefellow. Leave this place, and allow me my humble scraps . . .

“ . . . and I will tell you how to break your family’s curse.”

For a few moments, silence lay thick in the cavern. I felt like a mere observer, like the audience in a movie theater, unsure what was about to happen and helpless to intervene.

“What would you know about a family curse?” Francesca’s tone was dismissive and just as in control as ever. But her hand trembled slightly in mine.

“I know you’re desperate to end it.” The hag tilted her head, and tilted, and tilted, until she was looking at us upside-down. “I know you’ve searched for centuries, and found nothing. But I have the answer you seek.”

“How on earth would you find that?”

“I have my ways. Didn’t you say I’m not of this world?”

Francesca was silent. A part of me feared she’d take the bargain. I didn’t know anything about this “family curse,” but it had to be bad, right? It had to be the reason Francesca left such a seemingly loving family.

“Well?” said the hag, twisting over us, her eyes like bottomless pools. “Will you damn your family for eternity? Or will you let me and mine be?”

When Francesca answered, her voice was strained. “I’m not much for justice. Maybe at one time, I would’ve let you be.” She raised her head, and her eyes blazed. She radiated power, and the sight sent a thrill through me. “But you had the *gall* to hurt the person I love most in the world. I offered you one chance at mercy, and you spat it back in my face. Now, you’ll face my wrath!”

Francesca held the citrine high, the light blazing white in the desolate cavern.

The hag hissed, withdrawing into her nest. “You’ve chosen poorly, little Strangefellow,” she said. All around us, the darkness closed in, so deep it seemed to have physical weight. “You have no idea what true wrath is!”

The darkness writhed, forming faces that twisted in horrendous ways, mouths elongated. The faces flickered around us, moving too quickly to see clearly, and though there was no sound, I swear I heard a chorus of screams echoing in the back of my mind.

“Kate.” Francesca adjusted her grip on my hand. “It’s now or never. Think of something happy!”

I tried. I really did. I started with coffee, like Francesca had suggested. I already had the image in my mind, and I tried to make it feel *real*. But something was off—the memories were distant, like I was watching a movie. I moved to pastries, trying to recreate the texture of warm croissants, the buttery flavor with a hint of bitter chocolate. But I couldn’t keep hold of the taste.

Frantic, I tried to think of other little things, bright spots in the gray expanse of life in Blessed—drinking lemonade on a hot summer day, the pure blue of the sky as winter gave way to spring, the softness of my pillow and sheets that smelled like lavender fabric softener—but every memory seemed to fade, leaving me feeling empty.

The darkness grew closer, slowly consuming our circle of light. The faces grew more detailed, lingering longer—and I began to recognize them. Greg stared at me, eyes accusing. Barbara wailed, bleeding into branches of blackness.

“Come on, Kate!” Francesca was breathing heavily, her brow soaked in sweat. Her body trembled next to mine. “It’s just messing with your head! *Fight* it!”

I just wasn’t strong enough. If I was, I wouldn’t have been taken in the first place. The light began to dim around us, until the citrine was no bright than a candle. This was it, I realized.

We were going to die.

The thought filled me with a strange sense of . . . calm. I know it seems insane, but after believing I was damned for so long, being faced with my death, and knowing that it was all lies, I felt relief. Francesca and I were going to die, and I didn’t know what awaited us. For most people, I guess the unknown is terrifying. I think it would be for me, too, if I hadn’t known one thing, a certainty I felt in the very marrow of my bones:

Whatever waits in the afterlife, Francesca and I would face it together.

At that thought, the crystal in Francesca’s hand flickered . . . then grew brighter.

Francesca laced her fingers with mine, her palm damp. “It’s gonna be OK, Kate. We’re gonna get out of this.” She raised our joined hands and kissed my fingers. My heart gave a little flutter—faint, but unmistakable. “When this is all over, we’ll leave Blessed, we’ll start someplace new. We’ll visit my family—I want you to meet them. I want us to have a life together. It can be whatever we want it to be. All that matters is that we’re together.”

I could picture it. Driving away, leaving Blessed in the dust. Francesca at the wheel, nodding her head to the song on the radio. Talking about her dads, her sister—recounting stories of her childhood. Knowing that at the end of the road was home.

The citrine glowed brighter, growing from dull orange to warm gold. The shadows shrank back, holes peppering the distorted faces as they recoiled.

I thought of the photos I’d seen on Francesca’s phone, of how happy we looked together. I envisioned us a year from now, dressed to the nines, dancing the night away at our favorite bar, two young women with their whole lives in front of them.

“Fools!” The hag’s voice rang through the cavern, sending the bones of her nest rattling. “What good will it do to destroy me? Another will only take my place! There will always be greed and pain in the world! Why risk so much to fight it?”

“Because you don’t deserve this place.” I was just as surprised as Francesca to hear myself answer, but it was the truth. “Because there are so many kind, wonderful people, and they don’t deserve what you put them through. Maybe someone else will try this again, or maybe somebody out there already is. But that’s just another reason to fight. Because there *is* more happiness in this world than misery. And we’re willing to protect it.”

The crystal blazed, its light glowing white. The darkness spasmed around us, the faces bubbling like burning plastic before vanishing into smoke. The hag screeched and threw up her arms, but there was no defending against it. The light burned through her, stripping the flesh from her bones, then obliterating the bones into dust. The giant nest collapsed, only a pile of powder remaining.

When all was done, the crystal’s light faded to a comfortable yellow glow, like sunshine in spring. It was just Francesca and I, still holding hands, alone in the chamber.

“Wow,” said Francesca. She looked at the carnage around us, then laughed. “That was . . . dramatic.”

“Yeah,” I said. Everything was disorienting. It felt like the ground was moving under my feet. “I’m just gonna—I think I need to sit down for a minute—”

“Kate?”

I hit the ground, everything still moving around me. I could still hear Francesca calling my name, but it sounded distant. My mind was racing a mile a minute, and I couldn’t concentrate on her words because I was overwhelmed with . . . memories. Memories of my mom and dad. Of my brothers, Tyler, Brendan, and Charlie. Playing ice hockey as a kid. Arguing over whether the new *Star Wars* movies were any good. My dad taking me for my driver’s test. My mom helping my awkward, gangling self pick out a prom dress. Getting into college, partying at my friends’ house, running my ass off as an intern.

Meeting Francesca.

Seeing her at the coffee shop that day, her confident smile as she took my order. Showing up day after day, hoping to catch a glimpse of her, unsure what was driving me, but unable to let it go. Francesca sitting down at my table two weeks later, ignoring my shocked expression and asking if I planned to ask her out or just waste money on shitty coffee forever.

Getting that first drink together, my hands so sweaty I dropped my glass. Our first goodnight, when I went in for an awkward hug, and Francesca threw caution to the wind and kissed me.

Francesca staying over and making blueberry pancakes in the morning. Meeting my parents. Celebrating our first anniversary. Moving in together. Accidentally adopting the stray cat who came to our kitchen door. Spending Christmas at my parents’ house, watching Francesca laugh like she’d always been part of our family.

The fight. The feelings of betrayal, even though I knew that wasn’t what she meant. Wanting to know *more*. Wanting to *have* more. Feeling guilty because I wanted *all* of her, and knowing she couldn’t give it.

Regretting all of it as the car rolled, desperate to turn back time and take everything back. To let my last words to her be the ones I meant most.

“Kate?”

I opened my eyes.

Kate crouched in front of me, eyes wide with fear. “Kate, are you OK? Can you stand up? Did the hag—”

She fell silent as my fingertips brushed her cheeks, drinking in her features for what felt like the first, and yet hundredth time. Hers was the last face I saw at night and the first I saw each morning. How many times had I stared at her, trying to etch every detail in my memory? How had my heart not burst from joy the first time I was allowed to touch her?

Francesca watched with confusion as I leaned forward, and finally—*finally*—pressed my lips to hers.

It felt like coming home.

Francesca’s arms encircled me, pulling me close, holding me like she never wanted to let go. I felt tears streaming down my face, and even as we kissed, I laughed. I was *me* again. Everything the hag and HOA had taken from me was there, at last.

It was only when I pulled back that I realized I wasn’t the only one crying. I wiped away Francesca’s tears and she caught my hand, kissing my palm.

“I really missed this,” she said, smiling and sniffling. “More than you know. But we need to get back to the surface. There’s still a lot to do.”

I sighed. I knew she was right, and I hated it. “Fine. But when we leave Blessed, we’re heading for the nearest—”

In the distance, something crashed. The floor shook, throwing Francesca and I against each other. Dust fell from the ceiling, sending us into coughing fits.

“What’s happening?” I yelled as another crash thundered in the distance.

“It’s the tunnels,” Francesca said, face pale. “They’re collapsing.”

sw2e40,13,2022-02-19,Manager expecting me to do the job of three people,frozendakotan,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sw2e40/manager_expecting_me_to_do_the_job_of_three_people/,"TLDR: Manager has me working alone with a brand new employee while we are insanely busy; even when both Saturday workers are trained-in, we can barely run the store. 

Not sure where else to post this, but my story is certainly an example of why antiwork is necessary.

I work part-time at an eye clinic, and mostly sell glasses, although I do have other obligations as well. Honestly, I don't mind the actual work I do. I get paid what would be a living wage if I wasn't in school, and generally speaking the job itself is pretty rewarding. I've had issues with management before, but not in the past year or so (I've been at the clinic for over two years now). In the fall, I accepted an internship offer at a local law firm, so now I only work at the clinic on weekends and the occasional weekday if too many part-timers request that day off. On weekends, there are only two part-time employees, since we don't have any doctors in. Still, we have to do every order that comes in, prepare all of the patient info charts for Monday, and deep clean the whole store. 

We hired a new part-timer at the beginning of the month. The clinic had always required that all employees be college-age, largely because the training period is so long and it is difficult to be trained in smoothly if you're only working a handful of hours each week. Because the new hire's mom is friends with the doctor/owner, that requirement was forgone. Since she was hired, she has only worked about twenty hours. Understandably, she can't do much yet. It took me probably 200 hours to be able to sell a pair of glasses smoothly without any help, including going through the insurance authorization/calculations process. 

You could imagine my surprise when I look at the schedule for March and notice that the new hire is scheduled with only one other person for two Saturdays. Even worse, she was scheduled with the seventy year old, who I will call M. M helps us out by working every other Saturday (M can't do a whole range of things and, understandably, works rather slowly). I am pretty close with M, so when I came to work today I talked to her about it, and she said she had told off our manager about it. I then look at the updated schedule, and realize that the new hire's weekends had switched; she was now working alone with me, starting in the first weekend of March. 

For context, our Saturdays are pretty busy. We probably average ten glasses orders, ten contact orders, and management recently re-activated the phone lines. I worked last weekend, and the phones were ringing non-stop; we were only able to pick up maybe 20% of the calls, since we prioritize the customers in-store. I legitimately had twenty minutes within my six hour shift where I was not actively helping a customer or on the phone with one. Keep in mind, this was with a co-worker who has been working there for almost five years. 

Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've been used to doing the job of a person and a half. My pay was adjusted as a result, and honestly it has been doable. But I cannot do every single order (glasses and contacts), put together all of the patient info for Monday, answer every single phone call, do every adjustment and pick-up, and do the cleaning. This is not to mention the fact that I'm also supposed to be helping train in the new hire. I don't even get paid commission (which, in a vacuum, I actually like; I feel like I'm able to be more honest with customers), so my pay will be the exact same as if I was working a regular weekend.  

I'm unsure how to proceed. Honestly, I know I have leverage here. When I started my internship, I made it clear that I while I wanted to continue working at the clinic occasionally, it was not my priority. When M met with my manager, she reminded her that she could just stop working Saturdays whenever she wants, and I might do the same. While the extra income is nice, I could pick up hours at my internship or start doing food delivery if needed, but I don't think my manager is in any position to stand her ground if I ask for her to fix this anyway. There is quite literally no other person who would/could take my Saturday shifts."

sw4d0b,7,2022-02-19,I hate the CS entry level job market.,ImpostorSyndrome239,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sw4d0b/i_hate_the_cs_entry_level_job_market/,"Junior in college with a CS major here. For background, I find myself feeling pressure from multiple sides to get an internship because thats supposed to make me more employable. Thing is I don't really WANT to do an internship, period.

They sound nice, really. I could work remotely and make decent money for the Summer. (Some offers actually pay less than retail and food service now but I disregard those.) However I just don't feel like sacrificing a whole Summer break that I could be using to visit family, travel to a few places on my bucket list, and generally just get a break from coding I'm already burnt out on. It's not like I won't have 40 years to gain experience afterwards so I'm in no rush. 

But no, apparently not interning makes me unemployable. In fact, I should actually spend countless hours of my free time ""coding for fun"" so I can have a nice github porfolio to flash at prospective employers just so they can grace me with an entry level job offer. Nobody cares about a degree I spent thousands of dollars on saying I'm qualified.

Its all just BS to me at this point, and I'm willing to take the risk associated there in not interning more out of spite than anything at this point."

I will then need only 20 for a BS in CS at a brick mortar school. This is my second year as a student. Ive been able to finish up fast by coming in with lots of credits from HS and doin 20 creds / semester.

I feel very confident in networking and IT and i am debating like as i think it would look strange to graduate in 2.5 years as i only have 20 left without internships or what not for CS as CS seems very competitive. I also know lots of people in the CS program who are much better programmers than me. I figure to take a gap year or reduce down credits and become part time, meanwhile working at a NOC position? In the year i can also brush up on cs a little more like learn new stuff thats not taught in school.

**Whats your opinion? finish up in 2.5 years total or take a break and work a year as a NOC** and take like 1 or 2 class a semester stalling it to nearly 4 years, but it will only cost reduce amount, i will not incur full tuition cost but only like 400$/credit which is the standard rate. I havent yet applied for noc type jobs as if it were to work i wouldnt be able to start right away, it would have to be a few months from now after this semester ends. Because its my second year, i am not that good with the whole resume and interview and applying for jobs process.

Additionally, i think one of my parents may not think its a good idea and suggest minoring in math which i dont want to do as thats extra work like calc3,4,diff eq, which i am too tired to deal with.

Opinions??? I know the CS field pays much more than IT, idk. I dont really like leetcode, but i assume idk... I mean its funny i think kids whose parents are programmers will excel well at programming. my dad is in networking so it seems im better or more confident networking versus programming. although i do like writing python scripts and been scraping stock data and what not."

I study in a not so reputable university (honestly, it's viewed as a meh uni). However, I can teach myself well enough to compensate for the school's lack of guidance. My parents work in Dubai (their salary isn't that big but fairly good for Filipino standards). 

The thing is, they offered me to work there while getting my degree in a Philippine-accredited distance learning college there. That degree is AB in Information Technology. However, that program seems like shady to me.

I weighed to pros and cons and for easy comparison, this is what I'll get:

If I continue studying here in the PH:
-They pay for my uni.
-More time improving my skills.
-mediocre uni reputation
-no companies to do internships (like seriously)
-I'll still go to Dubai after my graduation and look for entry level jobs there.


If I go to Dubai
-I'll study in a flexible distance learning degree (still Filipino College, only based in Dubai).
-I can start working right away. (My parents have some connections but not in IT though)
-More job opportunities (entry level salary there equals to entry-mid salary here in PH honestly)
-I think there are more internships there.

Apart from INSEAD , I have had interviews with 6 other US  schools ( a T10, 2 T15’s, 1 T20 and 2 T25). Still Hoping for invites from MIT and GSB.

Although INSEAD is a great program, scholarship is important to me .  Although I have been offered 20% , I would want to see what other schools will offer me before committing my deposit. INSEAD deposit is 11,000 Euros (approx $13,000 and its non-refundable). I have been working to get an extension but only got 2 weeks which will ending next week.

I am so confused as to what to do. I am working on asking for more money but I don’t have any other offer to leverage . Should I make the deposit or take a chance on myself to see what other offers may come through from the 6 schools I have interviewed with. Decisions for R2 won’t start rolling until March and my deadline is expiring end of February. Taking a chance means letting INSEAD go but am afraid .

Has anyone had same issues? If you are in my shoes what you do? Below are my stats to give you more insight into my profile;

30+ Female from Africa
GRE 330
GPA: 3.58 (Studied IT and have an MSC)
IT Project Manager with 8 years work experience in Telecom 
Post- MBA goal: Product Manager with FAANG
An an entrepreneur with very strong EC’s 

Do I stand a chance of getting substantial scholarship (50-100%) from these other schools? Although a one year program is cheaper with faster ROI , I would love to work in the US because the opportunities in tech  and the internship gives me an opportunity to learn on the job and figure out if that is best for me.

I look forward to hearing from you

I’m doing it all solo, even tho this project will have a broader impact in the organization- like I believe, potentially, very large impact and some others who work on the same thing as me do realize that and are well aware of it. Note that they work on the same thing as me but still I don’t really have an official mentor. And I suck at asking for help. They are usually so busy and have different priorities than helping me out. And sometimes, I end up making stupid mistakes in my PRs and that embarasses me from asking more help. 

I have two one on ones with my manager every week and like, sometimes they talk to me in a very technical way (their area of expertise is networking and I’ve got nothing to do with networking in my project, so I cannot benefit from my manager anyway) and I feel completely lost in the conversation  - not all the time, but yeah.  

I just realized at a previous internship, my manager would ask for blockers and actually help me get over them. But here, I just update my manager on the things I’m working on, and they would just share advice or their insights. We never have talked about blockers. In fact, I have never heard of the word blocker since I joined this company. ( They do have a nice culture and are like one of the top rated companies to work for according to glassdoor)

Although I am happy with my offer now, sometimes I get FOMO/regret that I didn’t try. The interviewing prep is exhausting, and it nearly drove me to insanity last semester trying to juggle assignments, exams, and interviews. I don’t really wanna do that anymore for a while. My mental health was atrocious trying to do well on assignments and I was always behind on lectures as stuff like leetcode took importance.  I will need to do that again at some point, but for now I didn’t want to. One side of me goes, Damn, you coulda potentially got into Google (might set up my career etc) then another side of me is extremely content with Microsoft as they’re a great company to work for after graduation + chance of getting a graduate offer after the internship is really high compared to google where you have to reinterview for grad roles even if you did an internship most of the time. Microsoft pays really well too.

I applied to a graduate software engineer role at Facebook several months back and was turned down, but recently was contacted by a recruiter from Meta to talk about roles for PhD students in London. They seem broadly to be hiring ML and Systems &amp; Infrastructure, so I was wondering if anyone knew whether, for PhD grads, they expect a lot of domain-specific experience, or whether they're more interested in your potential? 

Despite having a good grounding in the theory of ML, and reading research papers, my hands-on experience is limited to messing around with PyTorch and scikit learn on a few datasets, but I haven't done any real ML projects, so I'm wondering whether it might be better to go for the Systems &amp; Infrastructure role?

&amp;#x200B;

My background, for context:

I study in the UK, did my bachelor's degree in electronic engineering, moved on a Masters+PhD programme and I'm now in the final year of my PhD. I did a summer internship as a software engineer and have also done a couple of hackathons and some hobbyist coding. 

My research focuses on the intersection of materials and computer science, looking at how to accelerate machine learning computations. As much as I enjoy research, I don't want to go into academia. A lot of companies publish ML research, and, as my work is tangentially related, I figured it wouldn't be huge jump to transition to ML research? One route I'm thinking is, getting a standard dev job then getting trained and/or put on projects using ML to beef up my experience before moving towards Research Scientist roles, so the Systems position might be a good step in this direction?"

* I will need to use CPT or OPT (I'm international)
* Honestly kind of scared of living in NYC alone
* Not really interested in the finance industry in the future

Both opportunities seem to be great experiences. Right now I'm leaning towards Google because I think I'll enjoy working on that project more. Welcome to any opinions! Also happy to answer any questions about the recruitment process. Thanks so much!!!

swe27f,1037,2022-02-19,"A talk I wish I could have with myself 6 years ago, for those who are blowing off their career and grades",Stunning-Tower-9175,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/swe27f/a_talk_i_wish_i_could_have_with_myself_6_years/,"I’m writing this because I wish I someone would’ve sat me down and told me this 6 years ago when I was a college freshman and I think this might help some people in the same position. 

I’m now 2 years into my career as a software developer at a decent no-name software company. I make a decent comfortable salary, I work with decently interesting tech, decently competent coworkers. I feel very privileged to be where I am, but simultaneously I know I could do much greater if I had applied myself in college.

1.	**CS theory does matter. It’s not useless**, and you will eventually enjoy it once you get enough of an understanding to not be intimidated by it. Theory knowledge will form the basis of your ability to find a job and solve interview problems to prove your knowledge. 
2.	**You are good enough and smart enough**. You may not know it yet, but you will build your confidence in your abilities and come to see you are much more capable than you think you are.
3.	Stop wasting so much time on video games and Reddit (both fine in moderation) and trying to save a doomed relationship. Every week dedicate a bit of time, even if it’s just an hour (but ideally a few hours) to working on side projects, an hour or two practicing Leetcode, etc. **Consistent habitual practice will go so much farther than last minute motivation and cramming before an exam or interview..**
4.	**Grades do matter, but not in the way you think**. The vast majority of companies do not care about your GPA, but they care about your knowledge and abilities. People with vast knowledge and strong abilities in CS tend to have good grades, because after all, if you know your material then you’ll be able to pass your exams.
5.	Get over your shyness. Nobody is going to think you’re weird or a loser. **Go mingle with classmates that are interesting and fun to be around**. You’ll have great conversations, maybe you’ll work on projects together, maybe they’ll end up referring you to a job, maybe you’ll learn about an interesting new Framework, or maybe you’ll just make a cool friend. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. If you don’t take the first step and try, you’ll never succeed. 
6.	**Talk to your professors outside of class.** They’re really knowledgeable, they’re often friendly and cool people despite how intimidating they may seem at a distance. Go to office hours and ask a clarifying question about a homework problem. You’re paying for these resources, so use them.
7.	**Apply to internships early.** Apply during your freshman year. Who cares if you look like an idiot who knows nothing, most people do at this point. By making yourself be that idiot who is underprepared freshman year, you learn about the process and now you won’t be that idiot sophomore or junior year. 
8.	**Go to career fairs**. It doesn’t matter that your resume sucks. It doesn’t matter that you aren’t good enough. Get over your shyness and go. This will teach you how to speak like a professional with a recruiter, and you might make a contact at a large company who can help you out. You might become friends with the nice person in like next to you. 
9.	**Go to hackathons**. No you don’t have to pull an all nighter. No you don’t have to abuse caffeine and eat greasy food. Go to a hackathon because you will make friends. You will build a cool project that you can put on your resume, and you’ll have a lot of fun. You might win a prize and you’ll almost certainly get some free swag.
10. **Join student clubs**. You’ll become good friends with these peers. The club might work on cool projects together or bring interesting speakers from companies, or help each other with mock interviews. 



**All of this mostly sums up to put yourself out there, don’t be afraid to fail, because if you don’t try and fail a few times you will definitely fail, and long term. You are capable of way more than you think you are.**

I’m two years into my career and I’ve learned a lot of important lessons and I’m now for the first time getting on the Leetcode grind, fixing up my resume, and trying to get into the FAANG companies. 

But even if I get into a FAANG company this year, there’s a few things I’ll never be able to go back and do. I’ll never be able to go back and have an internship. And I don’t regret it because I missed out on money and clout, I regret it because I missed on friendship and fun / interesting experiences. But I’ll find them in other ways.

_ A 2020 grad who wishes he could go back to freshman year with his current knowledge.


Quick edit: If you’re a freshman / sophomore and feel like you’re not on the right track, watch [this video ](https://youtu.be/YJZCUhxNCv8). It’s a classic, it’s a few years old, but it is still VERY relevant and he also made a 10 minute long update video in 2020 for the little that has changed. I wish I watched this video as a freshman."

Is there anything that can be done?,Particular-Worker530,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/swe2h7/ny_did_hr_handle_the_situation_correctly_is_there/,"I (F18) was sexually harassed by one of the workers (M36) at a previous internship. It was a summer internship that I did this past summer. On my last day of the internship, I was sexually harassed by him. He worked at a different unit than me and would come to my unit to flirt with me. He started blowing kisses at me, asking for my number, telling me how beautiful I was and that he wanted to go out with me. He told me he had a date set up and how he wanted to see me. He would leave when he had to complete an assignment and then come back and flirt with me. This continued until the day was over. I tried to ignore him or walk away, but he would follow me. I reported it to my supervisor, and she said that she knew the men were inappropriate and would also make her uncomfortable, so she reported it to his supervisor. His supervisors told me to report him to HR, and he would work with HR during their investigation and tell HR to fire him. I spoke to HR, and they told me they couldn't fire him because me walking away and ignoring him was in the ""gray area"" and was not as clear as me telling him to stop, so he only got a warning. I was not the only person he sexually harassed; he did this to another intern who left two weeks before I did. I was thinking about reporting it to the ny.gov sexual harassment complaint online. Do you think that anything can be done? Also, did HR handle the situation correctly?"

I would hate to accept the offer and end up as a liability during the summer, but I also don’t want to deny the position because other companies have not replied to my applications. 


So my questions are, how much coding would I have to know for the e-Discovery position? and should I go through with the offer?"

swgebm,109,2022-02-19,Just focus on yourself...,dolphinsbee,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/swgebm/just_focus_on_yourself/,"Hey all, I'm not sure if this will help people's mindsets out or not but it was important to me, and thought it might click with some people on here. I'm currently a 2nd year CS student at UMN and after 156 internship applications, I got both a research position and internship for this summer.

They sent out a mass email to the other interns about a requirement and I saw all the emails of the other students who got the internship...

Northwestern, UW, CMU, Berkeley, Harvard, Stanford, the whole nine yards.

I understand the drive to get into a prestigious college, I understand that want as I got denied to Georgia Tech and didn't even make the application for MIT as I couldn't get through the physics SAT.

My point is that although it does matter where you go to school, it doesn't matter nearly as much as the effort and energy you pour into your passion. Don't think about getting into a school, don't think about getting an A in a class, focus on the learning aspect of everything and if it truly is your passion, it will work out.

They say to do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, that's not just once you've gotten the job, not just once you've gotten into your school, but a constant. Getting into a school that's hard for the purpose of that on its own will not do you anywhere near as good as getting into any school and truly pursuing your passion. Joining clubs, taking time for yourself, working on personal projects that make you want to stay up day and night, making connections with those that want to be fuel for your drive.

Don't get too caught up in it, focusing on mental health, your love, your life, your passion, are much more important than can be thought, especially in such a stressful time period. Take a deep breath and make sure you're doing what you love, make sure you're focused on the right things, because if you are, everything will work out. Even if it doesn't feel like it, I promise you it will all work out.

Stay the course!"
swgta4,1,2022-02-19,Would it be possible to get a job abroad? US/Canada,No_Set_8609,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/swgta4/would_it_be_possible_to_get_a_job_abroad_uscanada/,"Hi guys,

I'm a 35yr old guy with 10 yrs experience in IT operations - sysadmin with automation skills from eastern Europe.

So a bit of background:

\- started with an internship as helpdesk (windows support) – 3 months

\- call center agent with english (windows/dialup support) – 3 months

\- sysadmin with linux, my first ""real"" job for a software development company, where i learnt a lot of stuff: linux, monitoring (mostly nagios), some basic DBA and SQL, basic networking, middleware: apache, jboss, IIS, scripting (bash, batch), iptables, virtual machines, took CCNA courses – 3 yrs

\- managed services for a middle sized telecom provider: mostly linux sysadmin level 3 with some light architecture design for external customers, worked with VMWare cloud infrastructure, monitoring: check\_mk, mysql, also learnt about load-balancing, disaster recovery – 3 yrs +

\- cloud infra engineer for a large telecom company, top employer: the project was supposed to handle infra migration to the cloud (mostly AWS) but it didn’t work out because of external factors.

Anyways they provided some basic AWS training (AWS essentials and Architecting on AWS), I played with free tier and a bit of terraform but no real production experience, also worked on producing high level design documentation about migration plan. - 8 months

\- cloud engineer in operational team level 3 for another telco company, also top employer: worked with openstack, kubernetes, docker, ansible, git, rabbitmq, mysql, galera, ceph storage. A lot of troubleshooting.

The product is a private cloud solution based on openstack running inside a k8s cluster that ‘dev team’ put toghether with opensource stuff. ‘Dev Team’ are not software developers, mostly we use ansible/helm charts to deploy our cloud solution and provide extra functionality according to internal customer needs.

Did some internal trainings on k8s, terraform, learned more on resiliency, HA solutions since the product is built with that in mind.

Also worked on writing/executing test cases mostly for operations and maintenance and resiliency.

At some point my title changed to ‘senior’

Recently I got more involved into the ‘dev’ side of things, mostly working with ansible and hopefully other stuff to come- 3 yrs

I don’t have a bachelor degree, been to university but hated it, most of the stuff they teached me is totally useless for my career and I left it.

I know some basic python but I’m not strong on development side or OOP. I've done mostly scripting (bash)

Regarding CI/CD, we have CI environment and jenkins pipelines but I haven’t worked with that myself too much since there is not much changing in there and there is no ‘need’

Recently have been thinking on searching for a job in another country (english speaking). I understand that for US/Canada I would need some kind of employer ‘sponsorship’

The way I see it I have some devops skills but I might not have ‘all’ skills.

So would it be possible to get a job as devops or something similar to what I currently do?

If so what is the approach to take to start applying for such jobs? Could I just simply apply through linkedin? (sorry for the long post)"

* Residence: Maryland
* Income Bracket: Upper Middle Class
* Type of School: Private Catholic
* Hooks: Feeder School?

**Intended Major(s)**: Pre-med majoring in Neuroscience/Neurobiology. Possibly double-majoring or minoring in Public Health or Sociology.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.99UW/4.41W
* Rank (or percentile): My school doesn't rank but I'm in the top 20% of my class
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 7 APs, 6 honors

* AP: AP Calculus AB (5), AP Chemistry (5), AP Spanish Language (4)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. **Shadowed Undergraduate Research**. I didn't have time to participate in actual research, but I got to be an assistant to undergrad students completing biomedical summer research. I was only in the lab for two weeks, but it was really cool exposure and the PI answered all of my questions. I also got a letter of rec out of this! This role is definitely not that impressive though because I didn't conduct any research or write any papers.
2. **Worked as a caring partner in a nursing home**. I worked at a nursing home over the summer for 8 weeks. I helped at the nursing stations and activities department, assisting both nurses and residents. I also gained a lot of clinical experience by helping the residents with small tasks. This was a really cool experience and exposed me to the healthcare field and the workings of nursing homes. This role took up most of my senior year summer.
3. **Volunteer teaching position**. In this role, I worked with eight fellow seniors in orienting the freshman class to our school's volunteering program. Twice a month, we teach the freshman about social justice topics around the world. This role is also one of the highest honors one can have in my school, and is definitely a huge time commitment. Made me interested in pursuing Public Health or Sociology as a minor.
4. **Asian diversity club leader** (leadership position). I wrote about this role in many of my supplementals, talking about how this club mainly catered to East Asians, so I brought South Asian representation by applying for leadership. We have a couple of meetings per year and we have all-school presentations. This role is a medium time commitment.
5. **Co-founder/leader of a healthcare club** (leadership position). In meetings that happen twice or thrice a month, we educate a small group of students about healthcare in the United States and around the world. We also talk about current events in the medical field such as COVID-19.  This role also made me interested in pursuing Public Health or Sociology as a minor. This role is a huge time commitment.
6. generic leadership position in my school. Not very significant but looks good on my resume
7. generic leadership position in my school. Not very significant but looks good on my resume.
8. **School Literary/Arts Magazine Staffer** for three years.
9. **JV Cross country** for three years (skipped junior year b/c of Covid)
10. **Head lightboard operator for school theatrical productions**. All four years of high school.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Cum Laude Society (top 20% of my class)
2. Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish (school award given to those who take 4 years of language and get a 4 or 5 on the AP exam)
3. Stem Certificate (school award given to those who excel in the STEM classes and complete a related internship or job)
4. AP Scholar
5. generic school award I got during junior year

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor (8/10): I had to fill out a 3-page brag sheet, and my parents also had to fill out a 3-page brag sheet, so I know my counselor had a lot to write about. Additionally, I am pretty involved in the student body, so my counselor knew about me before I even met her.

AP Chem teacher (8.5/10): My AP Chem teacher was my advisor for four years and I did really well in her class, so I was hoping this would be my best letter. However, I know she finished my letter last minute, so I'm worried it wasn't written very well.

English teacher (7.5/10): I really loved my English teacher! She's so sweet and is definitely a great writer. I just wish I developed a closer relationship with her, but it was difficult with being virtual because of Covid-19. Even still, I conversed with her before every class so I think she got to know me pretty well!

**Interviews**

Georgetown (8/10): This interview was only 20 minutes, and more than half of the time was spent asking him questions rather than him asking me questions. However, I think I showed great interest in the school through my questions and answers because Georgetown has been my dream school for many years. And I ended up getting in!

Duke (7/10): This interview lasted for 35 minutes, and he was grilling me with lots of follow-up questions and philosophical stuff. This interview was a little stressful, and I'm worried I may not have answered some of his questions well.

UPenn (9/10): I think this interview was my best! This interview lasted about 45 minutes. My interviewer was so friendly and put me at ease. The interview felt informal and we talked about our personal lives, but I still think I did a great job demonstrating interest in Penn and showing how I would fit in. At the end, my interviewer said he had a lot to write about me.

Harvard (7.5/10): This interview lasted almost an hour. My interviewer was very friendly and we had a good conversation. However, I was really tired, so I think I answered some of her questions really weirdly and she might have been thrown off. And I didn't do as good a job demonstrating interest in Harvard as I did for Penn. I also struggled to talk about my activities and classes in-depth for some reason (I guess I was really tired).

**Essays**

Personal Statement (7.5/10): I wrote about my love for photos and connected this to how I care about my community and self-discovery. My thought process with writing this was that AOs can already see my intelligence through my transcript and test scores, and I can demonstrate interest in my major/school through supplemental essays. My essay also went through many revisions with my tutor and I showed it to my family. A part of me wished I wrote my personal statement about my love for medicine/science, but I think this essay might have worked out because I was truly myself.

Supplementals (8/10): I had at least two revisions for each school. I also had a tutor who helped me with grammar and coherency. I definitely believe that the quality of my supplements increased by the time I was applying to my regular decision schools. However, I was rushing a lot of my RD supplementals towards the end since my dad forced me to apply to so many schools, so I feel like I couldn't spend as much time on them as I wanted to.

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* Georgetown! (REA)
* UVA oos (EA)
* Northeastern w/ dean's scholarship (EA)
* UMD honors college w/ dean's scholarship (EA)
* UPitt w/ scholarship (Rolling)

*Waitlists:*

* Johns Hopkins (RD)
* UNC Chapel Hill oos (EA)

swhf6b,2,2022-02-19,Where to find Fall 2022 Co-ops?,0_69314718056,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/swhf6b/where_to_find_fall_2022_coops/,"I couldn't find an answer for this so making my own post.

From my understanding, co-ops are more like temporary jobs during the semester, whereas you could do an internship while taking classes. My intention is to just work and not take classes this fall, so I'm looking for a co-op. However, I'm not really sure where to look. I've searched on google and haven't had much luck finding anything in my area. I know there's usually a github repo with a bunch of summer internship opportunities; I was wondering if there's anything like that for finding a fall co-op.

A bit more info, I'm a student in Florida so I'm looking to work somewhere in-state (not in south Florida though). I'm looking for a data science co-op."

swm0h0,0,2022-02-19,Career Objectives and Background Essay + Statement of Purpose,romRamHdd5,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/swm0h0/career_objectives_and_background_essay_statement/,"I'm applying for the Fall 2022 OMSCS program. I have pasted my background and statement of purpose essays here in hopes of insight. Any comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

**Career Objective**

To expand my knowledge of programming fundamentals and technological processes in the area of full-stack web development.

**Background**

After my B.S. degree, I found a college program that offered a springboard into the field of computer programming. What I liked about computer programming is that the outputs and events that happened on the screen can be directly influenced by what you typed. During my time in that program, I learned the in-and-outs of computer programming, by experimenting with different languages (C++, Java, Python), and understanding how to transform code into small software applications. I also had the pleasure of learning how to collaborate on small projects with fellow classmates, while also understanding the subtle art of peer programming.

In the spare time of earning my A.S. degree, using Android Studio, I learned to transfer object oriented principles of Java and combine it with design principles in the art of mobile app development. In an Android Udemy course, I’ve been taught how to build apps that utilize ads, use GPS data to pinpoint locations, and provide PDA functions such as task scheduling and managing contact lists. In an Udemy web development course, I learned the front end languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to generate simple portfolios and website templates, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js or PostgreSQL for handling server, API, and database connections. All of this contributed to a full-stack framework. 

Before finishing my A.S. degree, I took a course on data structures and algorithms. In that course, I learned how to store, read, manipulate, and visualize different data collection frameworks, such as hashmaps, stacks, lists, arrays, and queues. In the class, we also had small computer lab assignments that tested us on how familiar we were with different types of algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, AVL, or MST and how to program code dynamically.

**Statement of Purpose**

I am a recent graduate with an Associate of Science degree in Computer Science. In addition, I have an environmental Bachelor’s of Science degree. I seek to study in the OMSCS program because I want to deepen my knowledge of computer programming as well as take my current skill set to the next level. 

In Java courses, I picked up the fundamentals of Java as well as built some interesting software programs such as a Minesweeper clone and other tools to automate processes. I found gratification in designing and engineering software from the ground up. It forced me to think outside the box, in order to derive solutions for various problems. I also enjoyed the collaborative design process with other students. In C++ courses, I utilized my creative side, and built various graphical interfaces. Using Python, I built a platform game just from a story idea. For this task, I designed: game mechanics, game characters, character design, visual design of the game, as well as utilizing different libraries. I enjoyed the process of transferring ideas into code and watching it come into fruition. Data structures course work that I did, helped me understand the brick and mortar aspect of programming (data storage and algorithms). My previous bachelor’s degree taught me the scientific process of how to approach different problems (scientific method).

I have great interest in full-stack software development because I very much like the idea of problem solving, beginning to end design, and data pipeline. Not everything during my undergraduate studies was smooth sailing as I had subpar performance during my sophomore year. For this particular situation, I was juggling multiple physical science courses that all required a lot of my time. In this case, I took too much work that was able to be done within the allotted time. I underestimated the workload but was able to eventually pivot and not only allocate my time better, but drastically improve my GPA from below 2.0 to 3.0. The OMSCS degree can give me the building blocks to improve my problem solving skills, analytical approach, and specialized software development knowledge to further my professional career.

Upon acceptance to the OMSCS program, I will enroll in courses dedicated to the area of computer systems. The computer systems courses at Georgia Tech will add to my existing computer science knowledge. The classes I look forward to learning from are the ones that break down the complicated process of how operating systems turn computers into useful machines. The other courses that are interesting are dedicated to the creation of computer software, bringing ideas from paper to machine. Classes such as software design (CS 6310) or software development process (CS 6300) will provide me with insight that I will bring to my next job. Speaking of which, my career plans consist of a desire to participate in full-stack web development for any of the well-known technological companies, such as Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. Five years down the line at any one of those companies, I’d want to be continuing to provide my support and participate in helping them grow and improve their robust web application libraries/modules. Finally, I appreciate Georgia Tech’s affordability and scheduling flexibility, which will allow me to join meaningful internships."
swm9bo,19,2022-02-19,I really can't understand why I am not getting an internship,BetAltruistic6556,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/swm9bo/i_really_cant_understand_why_i_am_not_getting_an/,"I am a senior at an ivy league school, majoring in computer science. I've been writing code for more than half of my life, and I have various achievements in the field of computer science. I received dozens of awards from competitive programming contests, including some big ones, and I made a few websites from frontend to backend and turned them into a business model before I came to this school. I feel confident about my skills, and I know that I'm more than ready to start working professionally as a programmer.

For my internship background, I mostly worked with startup companies. And the only reason for that is that I couldn't even get an interview with bigger firms. I've been literally spamming my resume to all the big tech companies, but I haven't even got an interview with any. One of them said they have a position that suits my background perfectly, so they'd like to schedule an interview with me, and their tech team would contact me personally. But then, they never did. So I emailed them back to ask about it again, and they never replied.

Everyone around me says it'd be easy for me to get a well-paying stable job. But it doesn't work like that. I don't understand. Because I'm an international student? That's literally the only reason I could think of. What else could it be? I have a solid programming background + a solid academic background. Why?

I postponed my graduation to have a bit more time to find a job.

And I feel totally lost and clueless."
swn9ch,2,2022-02-19,"Is a Technical Program Manager, Program Manager, or a Product Manager the next step in the career of a Technical Implementation Manager or someone with my background?",Caseacinator,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/swn9ch/is_a_technical_program_manager_program_manager_or/,"Hi everyone,

## Background 
I have a degree in civil engineering but I started working as a Helpdesk and Desktop Support Technician while I was in college.

I got promoted at that job to a Support Analyst that was in charge of onboarding private practices into my hospital's tech infrastructure as well as providing support. I loved working at that job however the pay wasn't great and I had just graduated from college a year before I got promoted. 

A year into that role, I decided to leave and get a job in what I majored in college, Civil Engineering. I worked in the field for 3 years and ultimately decided that I hated it. I knew that I didn't like it in college through my schoolwork and internships but it took me until that job to finally leave it.

I learned to code and over the course of 3 years I held 3 freelance Front End Developer roles. I got offered a full time role at my current job which was the last time I was a freelancer front end developer. 

## Now 
A technical implementation manager role at my job opened up. The role responsibilities sounded like an amalgam of the two roles I held so far at my company, it offered more money, and it gave me more control of process and technology improvements that I felt were sorely needed in the role.

So far it has been very enlightening. I learned a lot about how I like to work and what I like to do.

Where I work has technologies that were made, had their prime in the early 2000s, or a combination of the two previous statements. The main form of communication is via email, and every new process has been introduced, managed, and maintained through GDocs, Office, and linking them together with JIRA, Confluence, or their PM software.

I'm responsible for architecting technical solutions, executions, and providing support for the biggest revenue product suites that we offer that are packaged into custom solutions for each client, and performing audits &amp; code reviews.

A byproduct of this role has been the discovery of workflow gaps, agile workflow gaps, process gaps, and the opportunity to solve these problems. I device solutions that bridge technical and non-technical stakeholders workflows and optimizes them. I've also custom built internal tooling. The tooling I use is made using JS, Python, or a Doc suite's API like App Scripts.

I love doing this. Along with custom tooling that I've coded myself, I've introduced tooling like Airtable that has unified teams and fortified workflows. I've introduced Slack, Threads, and other means of better communicating and identifying issues and solving problems that we come across. My mind is always focused on optimization and improving execution and communication. If our programs are not performing well I investigate why and work towards how to fix those programs and make preventative measures to avoid these issues from reoccuring. 

## My question
Although I like what I'm doing, I'm not sure where my career goes from here in terms of what is the next step. I've looked into the role that I have and I don't see that it is as prevalent in the tech space. I wouldn't mind going back towards the path of a software engineer, but after doing some reading I found that what I do aligns more with either what a Technical Program Manager or could potentially lead towards what a Product Manager does if I shift my focus. 

I think Technical Program Manager is the closest but I'm not sure.

What do you feel would be the next path or potential paths for someone with my background so far?"

I had two gap years between w and college because it was hard to study and I seemed to be very bad but I also wasn’t applying to schools and whenever my siblings or parents asked if I had applied or studied I always felt paralysed. I felt like an embarrassment and a failure and very incredibly guilty. I feel very dumbo when I’m with my family and rarely talk when they have intellectual discussions. 

Now it’s the same problem but I’m a different way , Third year of college and I’ve only applied to 10-15 internships. I’m supposed to pay into my tuition monthly but I can barely keep jobs. So when my job was on a break for a whole month, I lied and pretended I was still working but now they are asking me how much I’ve paid and how many internships I’ve applied to and I’m scared all over. Even if the job isn’t my fault. Because I can barely keep them, telling the truth feels like an excuse.

Has anyone else has this feeling?"

swp2sn,144,2022-02-19,I graduated from college with a CS degree but no work experience in the software development field. What steps should I take?,M0istBread,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/swp2sn/i_graduated_from_college_with_a_cs_degree_but_no/,"Long story short I went through college never thinking I’d actually want to be a software engineer. I basically just scraped by to get my degree because of how much I struggled with my classes. In the end I was able to graduate and I decided I should at the very least give software development a shot before giving up on it, especially since I worked so hard for my degree. 

During my time at college I never got any internships, none even outside CS. Though since I graduated one year ago I’ve been working as tutor for beginner level CS classes and Math. I believe that this lack of work experience has really made me struggle to get interviews for jobs in the field even though I’ve been applying. In addition I have a couple projects listed in my resume but they’re not really eye catching whatsoever. 

My questions for anyone reading this is

1.)What should be my steps to improve my resume even though I have 0 work experience? What kinds of projects should I work on that would be eye catching to employers? 

2.) What is the best way for me to learn data structures and algorithms / study for the interviews if I do get them? 

I feel like I remember nothing at all from the classes I took. I think I actually need to just relearn all of it. I’ve tried leet code but I feel like I don’t even understand the concepts needed to actually even go about doing easy questions. I’m kind of terrible at learning through books so I really would appreciate it if someone has a good idea for this since I’m more of a visual learner. I feel like it really helps when I can see something being conceptually explained on a whiteboard but it also really helps to see coded examples of the material being taught."

I’m a second year computer engineering major looking to specialize in application development. 

For context, I have been applying to internships for four months now. However I hadn’t been getting any calls back. That was until a friend of mine who happened to be a campus rep for a bank, asked if I wanted a referral. Note: The internship positions at this bank are exactly what I want to do long term. Naturally, I said yes and thanked him profusely.

Soon after, I got an email from an early talent manager at the bank and we set up a chat. After which she said she was looking forward to helping me through the process. I followed up two days later, and got no response. At this point I gave up because I was very busy (Silly idea on my part but alas).

A month goes by, so I continue to apply to other jobs. I started to get responses and even got an interview at a big tech company, that is scheduled for this Thursday.

Last week Tuesday, I got a call from a team lead for the banking internship I applied to. she asked me a few behavioural questions, and then when I let her know that I have been interviewing elsewhere, she asked to set up a final interview later that week.

The interview happened yesterday morning, and two hours later the team lead give me a call back. her wording was not very clear, so that is what prompted the following answers.

first she asked if I was interested in proceeding, to which I replied yes because I was. Then she gave me a verbal offer that was $10,000 greater than what I was expecting for the position. After this she explained Covid procedures, etc. And asked if I was ready to proceed. at this point, my silly brain thought it was a good idea to bring up my other interview instead of simply excepting the offer.

She did not take kindly to this. She said that I should have disclosed this, but that she could understand why I wanted to get the verbal offer to consider my options or whatever. Which was not at all what I was trying to do. I was simply trying to let the conversation go the way she was leaving it.

She sounded so disappointed. I felt terrible and apologized profusely for any miscommunication. She did, however, leave the offer on the table and asked me to get back to her by Tuesday. I will be accepting this offer. 

tldr; i got a verbal offer for an internship that’s exactly what i want to do career wise at 10k over what i was expecting. there was some misunderstanding during the phone call where she offered the position and though i apologized a TON, I worry that she thinks i’m ungrateful or that i have rubbed her the wrong way. 


So, I have a few questions for you:

1. Is this as bad as I think it is?/should i care? (i think she has a bad taste in her mouth and regrets giving me this offer - but then again, i am as dramatic as they come)

2. When I reply to her on Tuesday, should I call her or send her an email?

3. When I am accepting the offer, should I apologize again, or should I pretend it never happened?"

Hello guys, I just wanted to know how far I could reach when applying to a cs masters program. Any advice would greatly help me. First I would like to talk about what situation I am in.
I’m a UC Berkeley student majoring in data science. I have 1 semester left til graduating, but Im currently doing my mandatory military service in Korea which started in 2021 June and ending this year October. It would be great if I can apply to masters program this year and start the 2023 fall masters program right away after graduating. Another option that I am considering is taking a gap year after graduating and build my application stronger during that one year timeframe. 

I previously did 3 interns and one research during my sophomore and junior year but this goes way back to 2020 December. Because of my mandatory military service, there seems to be a huge gap in my professional career. That is why I quite want to get back to school and maybe find a job and apply for fall 2024? Im just confused what can be a best option for me.

I have a 3.5 gpa and a descent resume. Is there a possibility that I can get in to top cs masters program by applying this year with ds degree?"

With WD, I’d get $31.80/hr  and housing given to me. I’d work with mainly firmware and hardware. The team is great and seems like they really want me. 

With HPE, I’d get 3k stipend and also $27/hr  but I have to find housing etc. I’d work with firmware and some hardware and web development. 
I also feel like since HPE is so big there is a lot of opportunities to network within the company and other larger. There is also a possiblity to do a fall coop with them

Keep in mind that both of these are in Colorado. HPR Fort Collins and WD in Longmont. 

I want to base this decision on what I’ll gain overall not just salary(bc I feel like that will come overtime ya dig). 

I’m not really sure what I wanna do in the future but classes I’ve taken that most interest me are with firmware but I don’t hate software or hardware. 

The opportunity of working with HPE is kinda a big step with the possibility of working with companies I dream to work at kinda like intel, ibm etc 

Uhhh so, I’m gonna make a poll and based on experiences or what you know about each company and from a POV of someone looking to get into the industry would you intern at HPE or WD.

- ~3 yrs industry experience as a Product Manager/Data Scientist.
- Applied to OMSCS last year, got rejected.
- Took on a postgraduate certificate in CS, and reapplying for OMSCS again.

The background essay part this time is very different. Now there's just a handful of fields with a 150-250 characters limit, which is tricky to work with.

Figured I'd post this here just to get some insight/feedback.

___

*Describe your CS-related academic experience.*

    - Enrolled in a Postgraduate Cert in Computing Foundations, sustaining 4.0/5.0 GPA, 
    finishing in May.
    - Verified MOOC certs including Stanford's Algorithms spec (coursera), HarvardX's CS50.

*If you have a non-CS/Computer Eng./Electrical Eng. Degree, list ALL (both undergrad &amp; grad, if applicable) CS course titles that you took for ACADEMIC credit.*

    - Took CM4043: Molecular Modelling: Principles &amp; Applications (BSc - Hons in Chemistry)
    - Software Development Fundamentals (Grade: A)
    - Computer Systems &amp; Applications (Grade: B-)
    - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms - enrolled

*Describe your CS-related internships, if any.*

    Data Intern
    - Wrote Python scripts automating key workflows
    - Built Power BI dashboards with DAX &amp; M languages
    - Optimized SQL queries made to a db

*Describe your CS-related post-undergraduate degree work experience.*

    - ~3 yrs exp as PM/Data Scientist
    - Led development of HCP portal, using React.js/Flask
    - Used functional programming knowledge to optimize Ruby Code.
    - Devised complex models in a relational DB, paving way for additional, efficient workflows.

My major wasn't in Chemistry so I ran out of things to write under the academic parts quickly. And the 250 char limit makes it super hard to talk in technical details about the software development aspect of my career. 

Is there anything I could be doing better?"

I’m trying to figure out what my next career goal should be after I’ve rose the ranks of my current position. I have genuinely no idea what to work towards next besides just advancing my new position then becoming a leader. I don’t know which would be more obtainable or if there’s a step in between as I didn’t plan to research this for many more years. 


The ceo of a company I did an internship at during college went help desk &gt; system admin &gt; cyber &gt; project manager &gt; CIO &gt; VP of IT &gt; pres of it &gt; President of the company &gt; CEO. 



He did this starting in the 90s so I don’t know if the process would look the same in the 20’s with so many more IT roles than 30 years ago. 


It may a Silly thing to be concerned about as I have many years until then but I can’t stand not having something to work towards so in a way this is like an extension of university to prepare myself to “graduate” from the employee grade to corpo grade. if there’s any feedback I can get on how to better prepare myself to make the move later on then I am all ears! 


Thanks in advance for any guidance offered"

I am an international student who has two years of remote undergrad research at CMU. Got published at NIPS workshop on one of the two papers we published. I have a high gpa of 3.85/4.00. I have made 3 internships one that relates to computer vision at a space agency, others at Oracle and Nokia.

Iwas awarded by numerous hackathons at UC Berkeley during myxchange years. 

Neither me nor the PhD that advised me in the past two years can believe that I got rejected from MSML, MSCV and MSR so far.

I am still hopeful for MSAII results however I have seen a post on reddit which says that if we have not received an acceptance so far It is guaranteed that we are rejected.

I would like to ask the currently admitted students about their applications and what they think that made them stand out.

I am about to lose my mind as I have been working almost every waking hour to get into MSCV at CMU. I do not know what went wrong with my app. Im kindof lost right now. Please help me."

* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?
* 14	Actuarial Science, exam prep, scope and experience in India
* 15	Future of academia in Mechanical Engineering. (Preferably from people who are just now completing their PhDs and looking to get into academia, the obstacles they're facing etc)

* 20	Courses for Power Engineering. PhD in the Energy industry. Options after undergoing a diploma course in the same industry. Job prospects, not necessary, but if indicated will be gold.
* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids
* 24	Alternatives to medical for PCB kids
* 25	Stuff/programmes to do in India as a gap year student
* 26	MSc in quant Econ Vs MBA in terms of ROI, job opportunity etc
* 27	MBBS from foreign country
* 28	How to prepare for SAT
* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india
* 34	Could we have people who are working in some xx field post a detailed guide on  1. how to find employment off campus in their field, and  2. what online courses/projects etc we could do while still in school to be more competitive
* 35	Detailed review of &lt;your college/university&gt;  1. Which course/year you are in  2. What are the Pros and Cons of your college, in academic, non-academic and placement scenarios
* 36	BCA vs B.Sc (Computer Science) vs B. Sc (Information Technology) vs B. Tech (Computer Science Engineering)
* 37	Which engineering branch is right for you? This is so that people don't blindly run after cse and actually choose the branch they would enjoy and can excel in it
* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!
* 43	The unequal relationship between Profs and students with no safety net for students
* 44	Syllabus needs to include real life topics like parenting, mental health, home maintenance, how to enjoy life, financial planning, etc
* 45	lesser-known professions or sector which the general public think aren't good enough, but surprisingly pays well or have some other advantage like good work-life balance.

First of all, I really thank you if you take the time to read and respond, and I appreciate any time you might spend here. TL;DR at the end of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22 year old guy seeking advise. I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and I have worked as an intern in Nestlé Waters and I'm currently an ExxonMobil Controller Analyst.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advise on what career path I should follow: Finance or E-Commerce

&amp;#x200B;

Finances: I used to be passionate about stock markets and other investments, the economy and the influence of political decisions on it. I also liked studying asset valuations and other finance-related stuff, but I have left this idea a while ago, as I thought I should move into a data science career (which I recently realized won't work as  I don't want to be a Data Scientist unless I'm analyzing product performance or something finance related, nor do I have the energy or the desire to learn everything needed to get a job as a data scientist).

&amp;#x200B;

E-Commerce: I know nothing of digital marketing and I'm certainly not the type of guy who would give you an strategy on how to allocate your marketing funds on social medias and your web platform. However, I would enjoy analyzing data related to users on your web.

I feel there's a lot of demand for e-commerce or marketing analysts right now, even more so than financial analysts. I also think that without experience but a good resume I can land a job in e-commerce easier than in finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Another factor to consider is that \*\*I really hate knowing the vast amount of people (friends and LinkedIn people) that are ahead of me on both career paths\*\*. I'm someone who desires to be special and that's why I started liking finance a few years ago - Noone I knew had dived like I did in that world - but all went down when I found tik tok teenager investors and when friends got jobs at JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs or EY.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Should I pursue a career in Finances or  in E-Commerce? I like being special and knowing more than others about a subject, and I'd like to be able to apply Data Science in whichever I choose, at least as a hobby. 

Edit: Salary is very important for me too. "

I am a recent grad from a basic Cal state university, I've been job hunting for the past 6 months and I finally landed a paid internship that rolls into a full time position (at least that is what the company has told me, but I think that could change). I haven't started yet but my orientation is the first week of march. I was super insecure about my ability to problem solve prior, but going into this job I have some new found motivation to really develop myself as a software engineer. I've laid out a general plan of where I want to be career wise in 10 years.

In my free time I am self teaching myself a lot of stuff, I am currently working on a couple Certifications to expand my knowledge of networks and how they work ( I am currently doing the Network+ cert and I took a class on CCNA for my degree prior and that will be the next one after the comptia), I am also trying to strengthen my math skills as well, I like the idea of being a hobbyist mathematician and would maybe some day like to go back to school to get a math degree cause I like math. At the same time I do still code regularly although I haven't done anything super complicated since school, but I still keep sharp.

I was wondering would teaching myself all this be good for my development as a software engineer? Is there something else I should be learning first? Or would pair greatly with software engineering that will really make me stand out as a software engineer?

I know this is a vague question because I'm sure a direct answer would rely on what I will end up developing software for, but I mean like what will really help develop my problem solving skills and critical thinking skills when it comes to universally developing software. Any advice would be great thank you:\]"

I am a junior transfer student at a T1 CS school, and I have my final interview for Amazon next Monday. I also have all of my midterms later that week. I am struggling with how to devote my time this week.

I haven't had a good tech internship yet, so I really want to land this Amazon internship.

For context, I have not been doing much leetcode aside from the past two weeks, as I thought I had been ghosted by all of the companies I applied to. So I've got one week to as many of the Amazon questions on LC as possible.

Is it worth prioritizing interview prep over midterm studying?

&amp;#x200B;

I am not considering a PhD, but might be interested in a master's at some point. I will also be taking a 5th semester, so could do an internship next summer too.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the reasonable answer is to split my time down the middle, but I feel like I won't have a shot at this internship unless I go full bore on interview prep this week."

I feel like everyone I come across has a good sense of confidence and who they are, and is good at presenting themselves in front of others and making connections naturally. They have friends. Though I like to think I’ve improved a bit since coming to college, I still am quite friendless and struggle to open up to even the people I live with. My few friends from high school have moved on and are living rich social lives, while I spend most of my days alone. It makes me feel small and that I’m not mature enough for my age. I’m struggling to find internships because my interviews don’t go very well. I feel that at this point, at this age, saying i have social anxiety is an excuse for having a simply unlikeable personality. (Even though ik that’s not necessarily true) And that I can’t share these feelings with anyone because no one will relate to my years of built in defense mechanisms and anxious thoughts. I am the worst there is when it comes to socializing, and it makes me feel alone and dumb."

I applied for DSC but didn't hear from them either.

Should I be applying for internships now? Although I feel a lot of peer pressure to apply I also don't feel ready at all. It seems like I'd be better off working on an Orbital project at Apollo or Artemis level to pick up the skills needed then apply before start of next sem.

If I go the latter path do y'all have any advice on what I can do over the break to increase my chances? Or if I should still try this sem how do I strategise applying?

I am a senior in college. I recently received an offer to be a technical cybersecurity intern at Fidelity. The rate is $30 an hour with 1.5x ($45) an hour for overtime. For some background, I am not a CS major. I am a political science/public policy major with a minor in CS (really interested in nonprofit work and cybersecurity). I have been a TA in the CS department at my university for the past year for an intro to computing course, and worked making around $10 an hour as an intern developing software for an educational nonprofit. Outside of this, I don’t really have any work experience on my resume, so I wasn’t expecting to get an offer from a big company. 

I feel like I should stick with the offer because coming from a non-traditional education background it can be really hard to get your foot in the door (I’ve had my resume not even be looked at before) but people have told me that if I can put Fidelity on my resume a lot of tech opportunities will probably open up for me. Is this actually the case? 

Also if anyone has an insight into any perks/what working at Fidelity is like I would greatly appreciate it!"

Given the fact I am still a student, I have little to no experience in a lot of areas such as networking, cyber security, etc. So I would preferably like a certification that would boost my chances of progression through multiple fields of work later down the road, rather than just one specific area.

I have looked into certs such as CompTIA A+, CCNA and MCSE which seem to be most popular but I do know these serve different purposes in different areas."

I have only 2 relatively unsubstantial personal projects, only about a year of volunteer experience, no technical certifications aside from MS Office, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro.  I also think my coursework in college so far has been pretty lackluster and I have worked to augment this by taking online courses in my free time (AWS cloud practitioner material, general networking, and currently an ethical hacking and Linux course). I can't make a homelab (to my knowledge) because I live on campus and do not have the capacity to make a server to tinker with switches and whatnot, so more courses has been my route instead.

I've read that it's a numbers game when looking for an internship, especially when applying close to the summer rather than in the fall. Ergo, I have applied to about 60 internships this past weekend and look forward to applying to a ton more. 

However, I have not been sending in cover letters and I recently read on this subreddit that a cover letter is helpful. Is this the case with internships as well? Should I be writing individual cover letters when I plan on applying to 100+ more positions? Should I use a cover letter to clarify why my background is weak and how I have been working to improve that?   
As always, thanks for taking the time to help. Cheers"

sxzlig,2,2022-02-21,EECS Advice For Rising Sophomore,thecooldudeyeah,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sxzlig/eecs_advice_for_rising_sophomore/,"I'm an engineering major who finished freshman year and took a leave of absence. I'm planning to return for sophomore year this fall. During my leave of absence, I realized I like cs after studying cs 61a on my own and would like to try it out. I would like to switch to eecs, but since I haven't taken any eecs courses, my schedule for future semesters would look like this: 

summer: eecs 16a

sophomore fall: 61a eecs 16b

sophomore spring: 61b 70 

junior fall: 61c 170 

My greatest concern is that since I'm starting late with cs classes and the general experience, I will have trouble finding internships later on. I would extremely like to have a faang internship by junior year and was unsure if I could get one despite starting cs late compared to others. I also have some time before school starts and was wondering on what kind of cs stuff I could do during this time that could really help me in the future? I'm willing to do really anything at this point to catch up with others and become a competitive applicant for internships. I know people do side projects, but I'm not sure if that is an option at this point with my minimal knowledge. I would really appreciate your time for advice."

I would really appreciate the advice I’ve been lurking and reading in this community for a while now, as well as watching helpful videos on YouTube. I have a BS in business and have been on datacamp, learning, currently doing the Google cert on coursera.I understand the importance of getting on GitHub and bolstering my portfolio but I wanted to know what are next steps so I can land a entry level job or internship. I’m currently doing SaaS sales but wanted to be more technical. I would like to go into Data Analytics and eventually Software Engineering with a concentration in Cloud. 

What would be the best plan of attack?
MBA in Business Analytics? 
MS in CS?
MS/MBA at a Traditional College or WGU?
Should I pursue nano degrees from Udacity?
Bootcamp: General Assembly? Flat Iron?

Thank you in advance for your advice!"

sy2kqu,7,2022-02-21,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (2/21/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/sy2kqu/weekly_job_qa_thread_2212022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 112th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

(Internship),Oyayebe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sy2oom/what_should_i_brush_up_on_for_my_technical_phone/,"As the title states, I have a technical interview with Motorola Solutions tomorrow for a software engineer intern position.

The technical part will be around 30 minutes with 2 senior engineers, and to be honest I don't know what to expect. They only require a camera so I don't think I will be required to code on the spot. What should I expect from this type of interview?

During the phone screening, they mentioned they're looking for someone familiar with OOP concepts, so I've been studying those off of youtube. They use C# but I've only ever used Java and C++, they said it's okay as Java is similar enough.

I used this video ( https://youtu.be/u99wAoBjDvQ ) to study and feel pretty comfortable with these 25 questions (both C# and Java equivalent).

What else do you think I should focus on studying?

Thank you so much!"

Had one quick question about coop. How do you guys find time for additional learning? Let's say your current internship is frontend, but you really wanna explore machine learning (or backend, Blockchain, etc). How do you squeeze in time for learning ML? During internships, I already feel exhausted after working 9-5. During school terms, school gets super hectic.  I have been wanting to do a ML course that I bought (\~30 hours of video content), but am finding it hard to consistently do it, or do enough to finish it in a reasonably short amount of time. I have been stuck with frontend for quite long, but I wanna explore the other fields before I settle on frontend.

I know several people who have worked there and it's a great company. Wonderful mentor. I thought for sure I wouldn't get it. But I did!

Now I'm a little over a month in and I feel completely stupid - like how did they hire me and think I could do this stuff? I don't know what I was expecting, but this isn't it. Maybe this is normal? I don't know enough about the frameworks and libraries they use to accomplish my tasks, but I have to use them. Asking questions, I feel like it's just not what I'm supposed to do. 

I understand I'm supposed to learn how to solve problems on my own - but most of the time I don't even know what questions to ask. I'm a total noob after all. This isn't anything close to what I'm learning in school. I have 4 classes and I have a kid so I feel like I literally don't have enough time to study job-related things on my own time and remain a functional person.

Anyway - what even are software/web internships supposed to be like? This one is basically ""here's your assignment - figure it out - let me or anyone else know if you need any help we're totally there for you!! (but you're actually on your own!)""

Is this just how it is for the whole career?"

Of recent, a lot of the people in my year who want to apply for postgrad have been scrambling to get their name on a research publication, any publication whatsoever because they believe it'll matter a lot for postgrad applications. 

My understanding is that a lot of publications that these undergrads are authors of, are of poor quality and ultimately not having a publication would not be a deal breaker for a lot of colleges. I personally have had a research internship(did not end with publication) and opted to do a corporate/industry internship this summer instead of another research internship. However, a lot of people seem to think that my profile would not be able to make the cut if i do not have any publications.

What do you guys think? I do plan on working in the industry, however I'd like to explore academia as well so i would most probably be going to apply to thesis based master's as opposed to coursework based master's. 

Should I try scrambling for a publication this year while i have the time? Or should I continue doing the corporate intern + whatever opportunity seems interesting (hackathons etc)

I should also mention I'd be able to get 3 LoRs(couple from internships + one from a prof who'll mentor my project next sem) so LoRs isn't too much of a concern"

syehpy,0,2022-02-21,MSc Civil Engineering at TUM or Bauhaus Weimar?,colinv_,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/syehpy/msc_civil_engineering_at_tum_or_bauhaus_weimar/,"Hello guys, I just got an admission letter for a master's program in Civil Engineering at TUM and Bauhaus Weimar. The latter is along with DAAD EPOS scholarship (DAAD Scholarship for developing countries) that gives stipend of 850euro/ month.

&amp;#x200B;

I am struggling to decide between these two choices. 

The program at TUM is broader in range. But since I have to choose a specialization, I would end up enrolling in similar set of courses as those at Bauhaus. TUM gives a bit more flexibity in case my interests shift though.

850 euros a month is quite a lot to turn down, especially for someone from a low-income country.  I am aware from reading this sub ( and the sidebar wiki) that generally the gap between the universities and others is not that big. More or less same quality of teaching can be expected. 

But I'm not sure if that still applies if I plan to do a Phd in the future. TUM is one of the top university in Civil Engineering in the world, especially in researches. Also, if I plan to do the Phd outside Germany, this seems to be the better choice because the reputation definitely will help.

Also, Munich is a bigger and more industrial city. It looks easier to get an intern, or even find a job here. 

&amp;#x200B;

But again, I'm not sure if all these benefits at TUM outweigh the DAAD EPOS scholarship. So, I want to hear some opinions from people in Germany as you might have a different view on this.

Any comment is appreciated!"

It will be 30min with a hiring manager and the technical part will be around 30 minutes with 2 senior engineers, and to be honest I don't know what to expect. They only require a camera so I don't think I will be required to code on the spot. What should I expect from this type of interview?

During the phone screening, they mentioned they're looking for someone familiar with OOP concepts, so I've been studying those off of youtube. They use C# but I've only ever used Java and C++, they said it's okay as Java is similar enough.

I used this video ( https://youtu.be/u99wAoBjDvQ ) to study and feel pretty comfortable with these 25 questions (both C# and Java equivalent).

What else do you think I should focus on studying?

Thank you so much!"

I'm currently in my first year of a CS degree. I've already completed a B.Sc in Biomedical Science/Neuroscience, which I got straight 90s all the way through, and I have a year of programming work experience (at a company unrelated to CS).

My first semester of my CS degree was, unfortunate. In summary, it started with me being homeless, then moving 500km away mid-semester to an apartment that was so damaging to my mental health that I broke the lease in 6 days. By damaging I mean I had a panic attack that turned into a seizure on my first night there (which was a first), and then I found out the unit was infested with roaches, which eventually led to the absolute worst mental breakdown I have ever experienced (I have a horrible bug phobia which I've had extensive and unsuccessful CBT for). Then I was homeless again but this time in the midst of a lawsuit for breaking the lease. Then I moved into a brand new 1 month old condo and ended up bringing roaches with me! And since I had literally spent $10k within a month on down payments and tuition, and was now paying rent for two properties (!!), I had to work 40+ hours a week just to pay rent and avoid eviction.

So, as a result, school was a bit hard to keep up with. 

I was in an accelerated 2-in-1 course (Intro CS I/II) and, by the time I got to the second half, I was seriously not mentally stable. It was a 12 week course condensed into 4 weeks and I was so far behind in my other courses that I just couldn't keep up. I wanted to drop it but I'd already gotten a 96 in the first half and I didn't want to lose that mark, so I stayed and ended up failing the second half because I was in the midst of attempting to \*\*\*\* myself during the final, which was needed to pass. I learned all the content but unfortunately you can't pass if you don't submit the final.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, with that in mind, I'm hoping to get some advice on applying to jobs. I got high 90s in the other 3 courses I was in, and I'm currently retaking the 12 week version of Intro CS II and have 100% right now. I wasn't planning to apply to jobs until I had that grade replaced, but I just found a paid internship that mixes biology, pharmacology, and CS that I am fully qualified for (a first). And the company's backend is fully written in Python, which I have the year of experience in. Basically, it's my dream job, I genuinely can't think of a more suitable job for my background.

**Main Question:** How/where can I convey the challenges I faced in a concise and professional way when applying to this job, or any job, before I get my mark fixed? Do I even need to, considering I had high 90s in my other courses, plus the 4 years of straight 90s from my other degree? Especially since my first degree is what would set me apart as an applicant for this role in particular? I need to submit my transcript to apply so I can't avoid it, but I feel like sharing that story will either scare employers off or entice them since it shows... resiliency I guess. But I'd rather not take that chance, you know?

Thanks so much for any advice, I really appreciate it!"

For example, I might leave that position for some reason and some other team might take it over. End of the day, that internship has not produced a research paper, not because the paper was rejected but because the project hasn't been completed yet.

My question was, does a research internship under these scenarios hold value in my master's applications for CS? Will a strong LOR from my research guide somewhat, if not fully make up for the lack of publications (I do not have any publications)?"

Here the 2 offers :

1st offer : M&amp;A Research Intern at a small boutique in paris in Smid - Mid cap. The doubts I have there is that the exposure seems to be low because I’ll mainly focus on the market and counterparts research and not directly on the execution of the deals. (But the opportunity will allow to work in M&amp;A and see what it looks like and learn)

2nd offer : Capital Markets and front office intern at a CAC40 company. Not m&amp;a related or else but seems interesting and I saw few people on LinkedIn who did this internship that are now working into IB or m&amp;a at big French banks.


My question here is how these experiences are valued : big company vs m&amp;a at not know boutique. what is the best for the resume and future opportunities ? Knowing that both experiences seems interesting.

sylogo,45,2022-02-22,[Uni] Math degree: Equipping you with the advanced mathematical skills to model and solve exciting real-world problems,math_dydx,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/sylogo/uni_math_degree_equipping_you_with_the_advanced/,"tl;dr: Many interesting real-world problems require very advanced mathematics to model and solve. A math degree prepares students with the deep knowledge of these advanced mathematics that non-math degrees don't. A math degree graduate holds a unique advantage of understanding and writing mathematical proofs. A Math degree graduate hence can model and solve real-world problems using first principles thinking, which is ""one of the most effective strategies you can employ for breaking down complicated problems and generating original solutions"" (Quoted from [https://jamesclear.com/first-principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles)).

Congratulations on completing your A-Levels!

Last year (2021), I have post the following (link below) Reddit post ""Enjoy Math? Considering Computer Science Degree? Why not consider Mathematical Sciences Degree?"". I am really glad that my post has sparked some to consider doing a math degree. Many have also dm me to ask me more about a math degree. And I am really happy to share with them what I know about a math degree.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lnbkr7/uni\_enjoy\_math\_considering\_computer\_science/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lnbkr7/uni_enjoy_math_considering_computer_science/)

This year (2022), I decided to write this post to give more concrete examples of exciting real-world problems that often require advanced mathematics to model and solve. I hope these interesting examples can spark interest in students to pursue a math degree, which will prepare students to use advanced mathematics to solve challenging real-world problems. We shall start with today's date: 22/02/2022.

**Palindromic Numbers** *(From Pure Math to Applied Math)*

22/02/2022. Wow. This is cool. So many 2 and 0. But wait. What if I reversed the digits of 22022022? It is still 22022022, OMG. it's a palindromic number!

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic\_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)

So, 22022022, 2, 22, 222, 22022 are all palindromic numbers.

Inquisitive you may start to think and ask:

You: How many Palindromic numbers are there?

*(1 minute later)*

You: What if I lengthen a palindromic number by putting an additional digit 1 at the front and also putting an additional digit 1 at the back? I will still get a palindromic number! Hence, there must be infinitely many Palindromic numbers!

You: Wait. Then, how many Palindromic numbers with one digit are there?

*(5 minutes later)*

You: Of course is 10. LOL. Reversing the digits of a single digit of course yields the same digit. Why did I think so long? It's so simple!

You: Wait. Then, how many Palindromic numbers with n digits are there, where n is a positive integer?

*(Frantically flipping JC PnC notes ... 10 minutes later)*

You: Wait. It depends on if n is odd or even right? Cuz if n is odd, then the centre digit will not change when I reversed the digits. Maybe I shall consider n is even first, then consider n is odd.

This can be a H2 Math PnC question:

(a) How many Palindromic numbers with n digits are there, where n is a positive even integer?

(b) How many Palindromic numbers with n digits are there, where n is a positive odd integer?

(Everyone is welcome to try. :) I will leave the answers in the comments section of this post)

You: Omg this is so cool. Are there any interesting facts about Palindromic numbers?

Yes. In fact, math researchers focus on finding patterns in our lives, such as the Fibonacci Sequence which is everywhere in nature (See link below). Specifically, pure math deals with studying math for the sake of its beauty.

[https://insteading.com/blog/fibonacci-sequence-in-nature/](https://insteading.com/blog/fibonacci-sequence-in-nature/)

So, what are some interesting facts about Palindromic numbers? A recent pure math research paper (link below) proves the theorem that ""Every positive integer is a sum of three palindromes"". It is a 40+ pages proof. Wow.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06208.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06208.pdf)

There is a youtube video that illustrates this cool Theorem using an example:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKhacWQ2fCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKhacWQ2fCs)

So you may ask, what's the point of studying this kind of pure mathematics? Well, a lot of pure math knowledge often found useful applications in the real world eventually. Quoted from the following research paper (link below): ""Palindrome recognition is important in computational biology. Palindromic structures can frequently be found in proteins and identifying them gives researchers hints about the structure of nucleic acids. For example, in nucleic acid secondary structure prediction, one is interested in complementary palindromes which are considered in the full version.""

**COVID-19 Vaccine: Second Dose Challenge** *(Applied Math / Stats: Mathematical Optimisation)*

I guess most people would have already taken at least 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Some would have already taken booster shots as well. During the start of the SG vaccination exercise in early 2021, it was crucial to utilise the limited stock of vaccines we have in SG to ensure the vulnerable and elderly get 1st 2 doses of the vaccine asap. But at the same time, we also want to quickly get the rest of the population to be vaccinated at least once to get some protection from the 1st dose and to slow the spread of the virus too. The problem is that we have a limited stock of vaccines and we cannot open too many 1st dose shot slots at one go, else we may run into the situation that those who need 2nd dose shots in 3 weeks have no vaccine available for them. This leads to the ""blocking phenomenon"". Quoted from a recent research paper ""Vaccine Appointment Scheduling: The Second Dose Challenge"" (link below):

""The feature of a two-dose regimen of most COVID-19 vaccines poses a unique operational challenge, the ""blocking phenomenon,"" where the need to reserve vaccines for the second-dose appointment may ""block"" the take-up rate for the first-dose appointment. Determining the appropriate volume of vaccines to be kept in reserve in case of disruption to the supply schedule is an important operational problem for vaccine rollout.""

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3909792](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3909792)

To find the maximum amount of first dose booking slots that can be opened while ensuring those who need the second dose are always able to have vaccines available for them, the team of researchers formulated a mathematical model (using conic programming and distributionally robust optimisation - advanced applied math and stats stuff) to find exactly that. Realised from the link above that the team of researchers is very interdisciplinary which includes those from the SMU/NUS Business/Math Departments. To solve many real-world business operations problems, advanced mathematics and computational tools are needed, as well as math proving skills are crucial to proving relevant theorems in the research paper. A math degree will train you in dealing with advanced mathematics. And from many of my peers' experiences in internships, they realised that a math degree makes them much more confident and efficient when dealing with advanced math, as compared to their friends without a math degree who took much more effort and find it very difficult to try to understand the sophisticated math.

**Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: Machine Learning Approach** *(Applied Math / Statistics / Compsci / Data Analytics / Business Analytics)*

""Predictive computer modelling developed by scientists from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) can propose strategies that could have reduced Covid-19 infections and deaths by 59 per cent to 89 per cent in countries studied."" - Quoted from September 2021 Straits Times news article below:

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntu-scientists-say-their-computer-modelling-can-help-cut-covid-19-infections-and-deaths-by](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntu-scientists-say-their-computer-modelling-can-help-cut-covid-19-infections-and-deaths-by)

Quoted from the conclusion of their research paper (link below): ""The practical value of our data-driven framework lies in two aspects. For one thing, it can well capture the transmission dynamics of the virus under consideration of environmental and social variables, resulting in an accurate prediction about the near future increase of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. For another, it can systematically analyze and optimize the relevant factors on the targeted two objectives. Therefore, policymakers can directly refer to these discovered pieces of critical knowledge to realize early warning, preparation, and prevention for crisis control.""

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721005308](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721005308)

Again, we see the team of researchers comes from different departments (including NTU Math/Engineering/Communications). NTU math degree curriculum will involve learning machine learning (ML) and AI, as well as math and stats concepts underpinning these concepts. Every year, there are also NTU math degree students taking on ML-related FYP projects. Introduced a few years ago, NTU Double Major in Math and Compsci will allow students to get deep training in these 2 complementing majors. Students will be able to appreciate compsci concepts more as many of its concepts rely on math ideas/concepts. The compsci major helps to give math major students much more understanding of the software side of compsci.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-science-in-mathematical-and-computer-sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-science-in-mathematical-and-computer-sciences)

Moreover, NTU Math also has a new 2nd major in Data Analytics, where students take modules from the compsci and engineering schools to learn more about databases, data mining, and database management. Typically, a 2nd major needs 10 modules. But because the NTU math curriculum already has 3 modules that double count to this 2nd major, NTU Math students only need to take 7 modules to fulfill this 2nd major requirement. It's super worth it in my opinion! To put into context, a minor in NTU is 5 modules. Just study 2 more modules, you can get a 2nd major! Furthermore, a math degree highly complements data analytics, as many data analytics concepts/ideas come from math/stats which you would have a strong foundation in from the math degree curriculum. This meant that math degree students hold a unique advantage when they take data analytics modules from the compsci and engineering schools, as math degree students can better appreciate the math-motivated data analytics concepts.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/mada-(matric-yr-2022)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics/undergrad/degree-programmes/mada-(matric-yr-2022))

Personally, I have taken NTU minor in finance (This NTU minor can only be taken by NTU Math degree students) where I took finance modules from NTU Business School. Because I have learned topics like Partial Differential Equations, which is an applied math module, I find that I can better appreciate and understand the Black Scholes Equation taught in the finance module, as compared to business school (finance specialisation) students. Because of the lack of advanced mathematics knowledge, business school (finance specialisation) students usually find it much more difficult than a math degree graduate to enter certain finance jobs that use much more advanced math, such as quantitative finance jobs. In fact, a math degree is one of the best degrees to prepare for quantitative finance jobs.

**COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: (Economics) Game Theory and Graph/Network Theory** *(Applied Math / Statistics / Economics / Compsci / Data Analytics)*

Hear from the Carnegie Mellon Math Professor, a 3 minutes introduction to ""NOVID: A New Approach to Beat COVID-19"":

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIU-6FvwikQ&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIU-6FvwikQ&amp;t=0s)

Quoting from another youtube video (link below) on what makes this app NOVID so special:

""The simple idea flips the incentives. Previous approaches were about controlling you, preemptively removing you from society if you were suspected of being infected. This new tool lets you see incoming disease to defend yourself just in time. This uniquely aligns incentives so that even if everyone in a democratic society does what is best for themselves, they end up doing what is best for the whole.""

The following 40 minutes video is a talk by this math professor showing how (Economics) Game Theory and Graph/Network Theory is used in developing NOVID.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Au08hbFyDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Au08hbFyDY)

As SG pushes smart nation and enhances our defense capabilities against threats including natural diseases, the applications in math in such areas (e.g. developing a better contact tracing app for public health) are of great importance. There are many interesting projects done by A\*STAR, DSTA, DSO, and other organisations that involve advanced math. Every year, there are math degree undergrads from both NTU/NUS who went to these organisations to do internships and full-time employment. And math degree graduates are favoured for their ability to take on projects that involve lots of advanced math.

**Mathematics in Economics: Optimal Exchange-Rate Policy** *(Math and Economics)*

How math can uni econs be? Well, take a look at the following paper by Prof Jamus Jerome Lim. Quoting from its abstract:  ""This paper discusses how special interests and government policymakers interact in the decisionmaking processes concerning the optimal level of the exchange rate, and how these interactions may lead to a disconnect between the exchange rate and economic fundamentals.""

[https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/64042/1/639581722.pdf](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/64042/1/639581722.pdf)

In the paper, he uses game theory concepts like ""subgame perfect Nash equilibrium"", which is a concept taught in the NTU math module: MH4320 Computational Economics. His paper proves various lemma/corollary/propositions using mathematical proof techniques. His propositions 3 and 4 prove the formulae for the exchange rate with legislative activity and electoral dynamics respectively.

If you are looking into doing the more math aspects of economics and/or perhaps writing your own theorems about economics like in the above paper, then NTU Double major in math and econs will be a good preparation to do that. The math degree will give you the strong training to do math proofs and can be applied to the economics concepts you learn in the econs major.

[https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-science-in-mathematical-sciences-and-economics](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-science-in-mathematical-sciences-and-economics)

**Math or Geography? Why not both?** *(A lesser-known area of Applied Math)*

If you are interested in physical geography and also math, then there is this area of math about numerical analysis/methods that finds its application in tectonics and earth imaging. An example is the following research paper (High-resolution seismic array imaging based on an SEM-FK hybrid method) link below:

[https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/197/1/369/683987](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/197/1/369/683987)

One of the authors is a prof of NTU Math. He is also a faculty in NTU Asian School of Environment. Based on the link below, his bachelor's and Ph.D. are both in Mathematics. Quoted from the link below ""Ping Tong’s research interests are in inverse problems, numerical methods, earthquake seismology, and exploration geophysics. His primary research goal is to develop advanced mathematical modelling methods and state-of-the-art inversion and imaging technology to better image the subsurface structures of the Earth’s interior at a variety of scales, ranging from the global to the engineering scales. Since 2017, Ping Tong’s research group has focused on seismic imaging of Southeast Asia.""

**Math in math degree VS Math in other math-related degrees**

A lot of students don't really know what's the difference between them. By other math-related degrees, I am referring to degrees like compsci/engineering/business degrees. And here I would like to point out the important difference so that you know what to expect when students choose a math degree.

A key difference in the math in a math degree compared to the math in other math-related degrees is that usually the other degrees only focus on differentiating, integrating, solving, and/or using equations. The final numerical answer is more important for them. But for a math degree, we often care less about final numerical answers. In fact, most math degree modules do not need to use even a scientific calculator. Because the focus of math in a math degree is about understanding how the equations come about, formulating your own equations/models to model real-world scenarios, and importantly doing math proofs to prove an equation is correct. Math proofs are the bread and butter of a math degree, and in a math degree, you would be trained to do math proofs in almost every single math module starting from year 1 semester 1. Whereas engineering math modules or any other business/accountancy math-related modules do not care about math proofs of equations. They focus on using these equations and for business/accountancy, come up with business insights to present in business reports/presentations.

The deep training in math, as well as the ability to read/comprehend/write math proofs, gives a math degree graduate a unique advantage to take on careers involving advanced mathematics. This includes quantitative finance, cryptography, machine learning, data science, and many more. This advantage puts graduates into a very favourable position when applying for postgraduate studies in quantitative fields (such as Masters/Ph.D. in Math/Compsci/Econs/Finance etc.) which often involves advanced mathematics and/or math proving skills.

**How to gauge if you are suitable for a math degree?**

This is a common question as many prospective uni students might be afraid of doing a math degree, unsure of whether they are suitable or not.

Firstly, I would say for any degree, you need to have a certain level of interest and aptitude. Interest will motivate you to continue studying even if you faced setbacks in uni. Aptitude gives you the strong foundation that you can trust on that you can do well enough in the degree.

Secondly, specifically for a math degree, a math degree is about training our logical thinking and training us to solve real-world problems using different perspectives. There are a few ways to gauge your interest level for a math degree. You may want to read the Wikipedia page on Pythagoras' Theorem (link below). If you find the different perspectives/ways to prove Pythagoras' Theorem interesting, then you will probably also enjoy the math in a math degree.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)

Another way to gauge your interest level for a math degree is whether you find what I said in this post interesting. If you are excited by these applications of math, then pursuing a math degree will give you the opportunities to embark on these interesting projects that solve many exciting real-world problems. Apart from this post, I would also recommend watching the following video.

NTU Math Hybrid Tea Party 2021:

(Updated timing: 47:10) talks about how pure math in uni can have interesting applications. The example illustrates how fun a math major can be. And it gives a taste of what math proof is about when he shows how to prove there is always an odd number of doors. The technique used to prove is very elegant as he has shown.

(Updated timing: 1:00:15) talks about how math and comp sci are intrinsically linked and studying for a math degree is excellent preparation for a comp sci career. What differentiates an excellent computer scientist from a mediocre one lies in the math.

(Updated timing: 1:12:00) talks about how math is very important in coding theory and cryptography. Some graduates went to CSIT etc. to do cybersecurity-related work.

(Updated timing: 1:25:15) is recent alumni talk about why she chose NTU Math and how NTU Math develops her as a person and she obtains her first job after grad as Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs. She says in the video that she is NTU Math with a minor in finance. She graduated in 3.5 years under an accelerated bachelor program (ABP).

**Conclusion**

There are many more exciting real-world problems that use advanced math. I have picked some of them to illustrate the kind of advanced math stuff used, which is usually very difficult to do if you don't come from a degree that learns enough advanced mathematics. I hope this post will spark interest and encourage more people to study for a math degree, as well as its double major programs.

Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments or dm me any questions haha. I am more than willing to share my experience in NTU Math, as well as my understanding of university math.

**Pricing Strategy for Goods and Services** *(Applied Math / Statistics / Data Analytics / Business Analytics - Mathematical Optimisation)*

How to price an extra value meal (EVM) and a happy meal to maximise profits? A joint work by researchers from NTU Math, NUS Business, SUTD, and Hebei University of Technology, ""A Representative Consumer Model in Data-Driven Multi-Product Pricing Optimization"" (link below). This research paper above uses a data-driven approach for multi-product pricing problems.

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2832385](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2832385)

Pricing of goods and services in different settings is a very challenging problem because we don't know the actual demand for the goods and services as price changes. This is especially difficult when there are many more products that a company is selling. And let's say you want to package a few products together to sell at a more appealing price. What is this price? And what products should you package together that results in more people buying this package? As can be seen from the research paper, lots of advanced math is involved to do pricing models. And in the world of big data now, which company doesn't want to increase profits by pricing their goods and services in the best way? They hire pricing analysts to do just that, and most of these jobs require strong mathematical skills."

sypqx1,173,2022-02-22,[Serious] Please Avoid NUS Architecture despite it being the official dumping ground of NUS,warmhuey94,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/sypqx1/serious_please_avoid_nus_architecture_despite_it/,"TL;DR:
1. NUS Architecture is a hefty/costly life decisions to make at 18 years old. Especially without fully knowing the realities of working for Architecture firms. It is a decision that can be IRREVERSIBLE, as it leaves you with few alternative careers or postgraduate program even, should you change your mind later on.

2. Students fall victim to 'sunk cost fallacy' and bite the bullet even going so far as to get a architecture license with more 5 years of schooling. There is little to no rewards for this extensive and grueling education. Many get burnt out. SIA's own survey (listed below) states a mere 7 percent of Architects want to continue being architect, unable to tolerate the working life conditions and poor remuneration.

______________
I'm writing this post to strongly caution and discourage, anyone who has received their A Levels grades, received mediocre grades but keen on entering NUS (due to brand value?) by applying for NUS Architecture.

NUS Architecture over the years especially with the popularity of social media and forums like reddit has gained a deservingly bad reputation in Singapore. It is notorious for its high dropout rate, its own alumni (and Faculty even!) repeatedly discouraging prospective students from embarking on this course.

You can google and read several forum posts from salary.sg, to NUS Confessions, Reddit and read what people have said about the course and its complete lack of prospects, despite all the grind the students are put through (for 5 Years!)

You can even personally get in touch with NUS Architecture alumni through Linkedin or Facebook and personally inquire for yourself. Remember to ask how many hours OT they have to do in an Architecture firm and their unjust remuneration etc.

Apart from all that is already known about NUS Architecture and its perpetual notoriety. I'd like to offer few recent updates about the course itself:

1) NUS Architecture has the lowest entry IGP for all the courses in NUS. This is a result of its poor reputation over the years and the school is desperate hoping to deceive vulnerable prospective students with mediocre grades.

2) The recent GES 2021 survey published shows NUS Architecture with a footnote [6] annotation saying: 

""Data on architecture graduates is obtained from a follow-up survey on 2018 architecture graduates after they have completed their practical training.""

This would mean the median salary shown ($4000) is of students who graduated in 2018 with an additional 2-3 years of working experience. Meaning that after - 2-3 years + 5 years of education  resulting (in a sham ""Masters"") - the graduates earn a measly $4000.

3) Also note, there is conveniently no data on NUS Architecture graduates who only did a Bachelors and finished the first 3 years. There's a good reason why this is - a 3 Years Nus Architecture Bachelors is worthless. It is worthless in the job market and further worthless should the student decide to pursue a different Postgraduate degree such as an MBA etc.

Please avoid NUS Architecture at all costs. Do your research. Go on Linkedin and look up alumni, so many of whom are stagnant, work 12 hours per day (including Saturdays)  and out of options - because of choosing NUS Architecture.

_________

Edit: Alot of you have messaged me, asking me what are the other career options with an Architecture degree. -- I would like to repeat with an Architecture degree, there are NO other options apart from working in Architecture/Interior Design firms. I cannot emphasize this point enough.

NUS Architecture itself knows this. You can ask the school for evidence of alumni who have branched out to other fields, and you wouldn't get any. You could work in different companies within the construction industry, but the conditions and the work that you do will still be the same ~ i.e long hours with poor pay and benefits.

Going into NUS Architecture, in this sense is almost like a life sentence. 

The cost and duration of school, the prolonged period during which you are essentially an indentured servant, and the oligarchic nature of the industry create a toxic and exploitative working culture. Several people feel trapped, with such a useless degree. An architecture degree is not viewed highly by other industries.

The school is setup in a way to benefit the Faculty and its cronies whom are local Architecture firm bosses. In this way, the school does not prioritize education per se, but more keen on ""conditioning"" and ""indoctrinating"" you to be a productive employees for its crony bosses of local Architecture firms. NUS Architecture is in the business of training and providing ""foot soldiers"" for Architecture firm bosses, plain and simple.

Both NUS Architecture Faculty (and its crony Employers) will then wield “PASSION” as a cudgel to compel students (future employees) to work uncompensated overtime and low wages. And this is the harsh truth behind NUS Architecture and why it has become the dumping ground that it is today.

An additional minor point to make for any prospective students -  is that current NUS Architecture students are not the best source to fully understand the risks of choosing this course. Some are ""brainwashed"" already. Other current NUS Architecture such as those who have commented below - are in full agreement on the toxic nature of the school, its weak curriculum etc. but fall short in fully comprehending what really awaits them in terms of career opportunities and the terrible working conditions of architecture firms. The extent to which they have received an ""impoverished"" education from NUS Architecture will only be made apparent after they graduate.

FYI - Exiting the programme with a B.Arch is far worse, be it 3 or 4 years. Your career opportunities really plummet as even Architecture firms will ""red flag"" such graduates as ""incomplete graduates"". A B.Arch degree will then only allow you to be intern at Architecture firms or get horribly lowballed as it indicates that you are ""incomplete"" or ""inadequate"" not to have the whole 5 years.

https://www.facebook.com/sporeinstituteofarchitects/videos/-architecture-industry-survey-what-would-singapore-be-like-without-architectshow/696428701690556/

SIA - Singapore Institute of Architects above survey states only --  7 percent -- of Architects are keen to stay in the profession! Imagine that 5 years of school and toiling away and only -7 percent- want to continue in the Architect profession...

Reasons given as per the survey: (1) Low Wages and Long Hours (2) Lack of work life balance (3) High Stress and Poor Work Culture (4) Lack of Career Progression

All of these are pointed out in my posts and reaffirm the points I have made as well as others have made. But make no mistake SIA, has known this for decades and this survey is simply lip service.

However this survey doesn't even capture the true despair and lack of alternatives for Architecture graduates.

https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/101735

This NUS whispers post by an architect, accurately captures the sorrow, regret and despair of Architecture graduates who are TRAPPED and can't find any alternative careers with their Architecture degrees."
sypzez,0,2022-02-22,Choosing between where to study in Germany,CrazsomeLizard,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/sypzez/choosing_between_where_to_study_in_germany/,"Hello all,

I have the opportunity this summer to do an internship in Germany (through my university). We have the options of going to Munich, Brunswick, or Oldenberg.

After this summer I will be studying abroad In baden wurtemberg, so this won't be my final excursion into Germany, but it will be my first.

Can I have some help deciding where to go? I know the latter two are smaller towns in northern Germany, and so I am wondering how different the culture is between Bavaria. Mostly looking for the vibes of these regions; how does Munich feel? Is it too big of a big city? How are the people? What is the culture like? 

Same for the latter two choices as well. I'm not the biggest socialite, but I would like to meet some people during my studies this summer.

It's also the question of, would it be more beneficial for me to study this summer in Northern Germany, since I'll already be in southern Germany for study abroad?

Any and all comments are appreciated.

NOTE: I have been studying German for several years now and have no doubt that I will be able to navigate rather well with my current language knowledge, and that I will learn a lot more while abroad, so that isn't a big issue for me."

Now that i think about it, i just got lucky, they wouldve taken just anyone. I only had a live blog and a half assed ecommerce website with django, no problem solving skills what so ever. 

10 days in, unfamiliar with the tech stack, i somehow managed to make an api in springboot, and raised a pr. 
And Believe me when i say it, it just felt magical.


With a little more time in they asked to me to work on the frontend using flutter, again i had no clue. Did a youtube course by netninja, then started reading the code base bit by bit, and after about a month and a half, today i finally finished the whole feature, i mean a whole screen, theres a lotta stuff going on in there. 

I've written about 4k+ lines(thanks flutter) of code in the span of 2 and a half months. It just feels good.

Now i wouldn't say I'll be able join a good company soon and i probably consumed my good karma with this post. Everytime i feel like I'm happy something bad happens. They haven't paid me yet, and its literally nothing tbh, but i had to start. Its a really hard route ahead of me i know. But i made my bed and I'm gonna lay in it.

The only reason i made this post was because I've been very miserable, depressed, and a nobody all my life but today, I smiled.

And the journey so far is alright, started doing Django, and frontend one since reactjs, Django and Postgresql appeared a lot on job posts. For front end, I started doing the Odin project. 

I'm from a SEA country, and without certificate or degree, it'd almost impossible, and even if I do have them, economy is messed up here and I don't wanna slave away my labour for just food, (pay here doesn't even cover an apartment rent of a major city, and I'm talking about almost the cheapest apartment). 

I'm willing to move to Europe, especially Germany, or France or UK, but anything would do really. 

My main question is, for a dropout student with no degree or money to get certificates, is it even realistic for me to apply the jobs there once I feel confident with my portfolio and my personal projects? ( I'm assuming I'll be ready by August ). I have no experience and can't really do internship here. ( internet cuts and electricity cuts ) plus there's almost no tech companies in my town, or even if there's one or two in major cities, they wouldn't hire someone without degree.

On to the situation:

I’m working on an internship application right now, and I need a UF professor as a reference.

I’m thinking my two options to email are: 

1) a professor I had last semester for a class relevant to the internship. I didn’t talk in class often, but I know she noticed that I was usually leading the group work and she said to my friend that she was impressed with my statistical analysis in my final project. However, again we weren’t close and I’m afraid it would be weird to ask.

2) professor who I have this semester, is the advisor for my major, and teaching a class slightly relevant to the internship. He is a nice guy and would definitely say yes. However, I have talked to him maybe twice so far this semester and he doesn’t know me at all.

I guess I’m just asking advice on is ok to email them, and if yes, how do I ask if I can put their name down. I am very nervous so thank you for any advice!"

I'm studying CS in college, but because of family/financial circumstances I'm still in my second year and on an indefinite break from school. I plan to go back when I'm financially able, but I'm looking into getting an internship or entry-level developer position to see if maybe I can jumpstart my career. 

A little info about me: I went to a private highschool that lets you choose a career focus and I chose mechanical/computer engineering. Since it was mainly robotics (Arduino IDE) I know it's not the same, but I have school projects and volunteer work from then if that would make me look any more attractive to employers. Otherwise, I have no proof of my coding knowledge. My skillset isn't perfect. I can easily solve FizzBuzz and simple questions like that, but I know nothing about frameworks/libraries. I just know Java, Python, C#, JavaScript and HTML/CSS to the extent that my highschool and CodeCademy/FreeCodeCamp taught me. I realize this is a huge step considering my education level, but I'm a fast learner and if I can get one company to give me a chance I know I can learn what I have to. I know competing against people with degrees will be hard, but if there's a chance, I want to try.

I've been doing research on how to get my first job in CS and I feel like building some personal projects to put on Github might help with the lack of work experience. I just don't want to waste a ton of time I could spend focusing my efforts elsewhere. I know there's tons of lists of project ideas on the internet, but what things should I be showcasing on there? Are simple projects like web scraper and calculators good enough, or should I focus on a more complex project? Are there languages or frameworks I should be including? I know it depends on the position, but I just want to give the best impression possible to the most amount of recruiters.

Any advice on this would be really appreciated, and I'm sorry if I sound ignorant- I want to be as efficient as possible and I figured advice would help me narrow down my research. Thank you!"

I always like Economics related subject and tried to do them as electives in my college. I also did an internship with a thinktank and another professor that sort of made me reorient my direction. 

I am planning to prepare for MA Economics entrances in India and then try for PhD for abroad since I don't have finances to pay for masters abroad . I'm primarily looking for DSE/IGIDR. 

The think that's been troubling me is the fact that I would be 24 soon and by the time I get a PhD i would be 33 atleast. I also must say my grades very average and I had a 7.6 CGPA

Is it too foolish on my side to give up the job and future career prospects and go after something that I myself haven't studied properly at bachelor's level.

I’m 24 years old, trying to be the best person I can be, and I feel lost and anxious, due to feeling insecure about my life path and where I am at in my life, success wise. 

I majored in communications in college. It’s what I felt I was passionate about and most excited to learn. But because of sports and injuries and transferring to a second school, I lost time being able to intern and get the experience most creative positions require after school. I had to work at McDonalds during school to pay my rent.

After graduating, I moved to another city with my girlfriend (who I love with every fiber of my being) where we worked together, but initially I had to work at a Chipotle, and then her mom offered me a job, which I worked at for almost two years, but there was always that lowkey feeling of nepotism (or wanting her daughter to be with someone who had a job)

We moved back to my home state and I took a job in staffing, and after 6 months I had to quit because it was a bad environment and then I took a job selling freight, but I was fired because I couldn’t make margin, no matter how many hundreds of calls I’m making.

While working, I tried pursuing acting (couldn’t afford LA), comedy (never tried to perform) and bodybuilding (still working at, but I have years to go) on the side to try and make something happen. I wanted to dip my feet in like they say and try thing, but because I couldn’t make anything happen, I feel like I am wishy washy. 

As of recently, I took the LSAT, and I am studying for a second one in three weeks to try and go to law school to further my education. While I am extremely excited and eager to go make a realistic goal happen, I am still nervous about not getting a good score and waiting an extra year. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is I feel like shit that I haven’t had any major successes like I see a lot of of people I know have. I feel like I’m not good enough, and that my choices in life have led me to being limited to jobs that I’m not good at or I’m not qualified for unless I go back to school.

Heyy redditors, I’m 18yo and I recently moved to EU to study abroad for a bachelors degree. But i feel a bit lost, when i moved abroad I thought it was going to be like the movies where i meet bunch of people &amp; make lots of friends &amp; have bunch of opportunities, but i just find myself doing literally so little in life. I just feel like everyone around me is thriving in life and getting opportunities that I could never get. 

I want to do an internship at companies in my interested field (fashion/business) but most of them requires a lot of experience and I literally dont even know where to start because I have no experience. Plus im really young and most internships look for people at their 3rd year in university etc.

I just want to start doing something that is productive and get me familiarized with the field that i want to work in in the future (which is tech and/or fashion) but I dont know where to even start. I just really want to expand my experiences.

Basically I have the idea but no steps. I have no idea how to get there either. I’m just lost and I feel like everyone else is succeeding. Literally feels shitty.

I dont know if what I’m saying makes sense… I’m looking to maybe do some summer interships/programs in US because i have distant families in new york but I dont know where to start looking. Arghh so frustrating.

I know im young and I have a full life infront of me and I should just enjoy the moment etc. But i cant help but feel like I’m failing in life? I dont know if that makes sense.

I spent 3 years there. I honestly love the place and love the people there. But at the same time, my time there caused me so much anxiety and depression. I was about to be kicked out TWICE from there due to my low grades. Some of the classes there was just too difficult. Still, I managed to pass all of them by dedicating all of my time to homework and exams. Dedicating all of my time to classes didn't left too much room for me to look for internships. 

When I got out and tried to find a job, I noticed that all of the job descriptions out there require me to not only have some job experience, but also that I need to have knowledge and skill in frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue.JS, and AWS. Furthermore, I am realizing that all the classes in UCI that were super hard and nearly caused me to get kicked out from there, are useless in the real world and none of the companies require me to have them.

Back in 2021, I finally managed to land a well paying job through a hiring agency. It was a super chill job that I loved very much. But that job was basically quality assurance, and funny enough, the job description required a HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA at the minimum. 

I eventually lost that job too, so I am back in the square one with at most 1 year of experience.

The reason that I posted all of this was that I wanted to know you guys' opinion on all of this. Where did I go wrong? Was the university right all along? In what frameworks and technologies should I invest my time and energy to learn them?"

Although I haven't gone through the background check yet, I see two possible discrepancies showing up based on a university research position listed on my resume. My situation is a bit complicated so I will try my best to explain. 

The first discrepancy would be employment duration at my research lab. At the lab, I worked as a student worker from May 2020 to March 2021, but from August 2020 to May 2021 I participated in an undergraduate research program that paid via two lump-sum stipends which counted as pay towards my original position. However, before I could complete this program, I transferred to another university in the spring starting January 2021, and only received my stipend for the fall 2020 semester (August 2020 to December 2020). Despite transferring, I continued to work as an unpaid researcher at the lab until May 2021 because I needed to finish the project I started in August 2020 as part of the research program. Because of this, I listed August 2020 - May 2021 as the employment duration on my resume, because that is the length of time I worked on my research project for, when in reality I was ""officially"" on the payroll from May 2020 to March 2021, despite not actually being paid after January 2021 (not sure why I wasn't automatically booted from the system after I transferred universities). 

The second discrepancy would be job title. Now the official title I held from May 2020 to March 2021 was ""Research Aide,"" but on my resume I put ""Team Lead"" because that was what I was designated as by both my professor and PhD mentor for the research project I worked on. In any case, I would be able to provide their contact information and I am sure they would confirm this. 

I did not do any of this with the intention of putting myself ""ahead"" of other candidates, and would consider them honest mistakes. Would any of the above cause me to lose my offer? I was planning on reaching out to the recruiter to explain my situation but I thought I'd run this by the subreddit first.

Thanks!"

For context, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in '08, working for a number over years in school at a computer lab, eventually as a SysAdmin, and then took an internship doing mostly IT related tasks for a large corporation (racking servers, Linux system maintenance, small scripts, etc). Once I graduated I worked full time for a couple of years in DevOps/SysAdmin roles and then picked up Ruby on Rails in 2010 and have predominately been doing full stack web development since then. Currently, I have decided to take a bit of a semi-sabbatical working part time freelancing web development while I explore what my interests are since I have been getting slightly burnt out doing what I have been doing.

My question is around the possibility of shifting back in to more IT/SysAdmin roles given the fact that I haven't been directly working in that space for over a decade now. I find myself getting more interested in that area of tech again (tinkering with home lab setups, cloud computing, Linux administration, etc), but not quite sure what would be the best route if I wanted to actually start exploring jobs in that area again. Would it be a waste of time to do things like certifications, or might that help bridge my knowledge gap and demonstrate a competency without any direct work experience? Should I just start applying to lower level IT jobs given my technical background and work my way up? I fear that I wouldn't really pass initial screenings even with the experience I have.

Would love any feedback or suggestions you might have."

I always hated physics, but went into it anyway because I really want to study astronomy (which has a nearly identical degree plan at my college). My thought process was that I could withstand physics in order to get into the astronomy field. I did okay in the first intro physics course, horrible in the second, dropped the third last semester, and am now retaking it this semester. I'm having to put in a metric ton of effort just to barely keep up. It takes an absurd amount of time for me to even get a passing score. 

Tbh, I'd drop this major in a heartbeat if it weren't for astronomy (which I'm doing okay in). I also just started getting into astro research this semester and I really enjoying it. But as I look down a path of another 7-8 years of this (physics), I feel nothing but dread and terror. I think I could force/push myself through a physics/astronomy degree, but idk if I'll be able to come out the other side of it with my sanity. I'm struggling more than most of my peers and I'm starting to think this just isn't for me. Realistically I'll have to get a phd to get into the astro field, and while freshman me thought that sounded cool, it doesn't sound appealing at all to me now. From what I've heard many astro people burn out after their phd and end up just doing coding jobs. While employment wouldn't be an issue, I think getting a phd only to end up with a coding job I could've gotten straight out a bachelors would be something I'd be deeply unhappy with, as it would feel like I wasted 5-6 years to get my phd for nothing. I feel I might as well not go through the pain of a phd if that's the end result. 

With all these doubts for my current career path, I've been looking at alternates. The one thing I love more than astronomy is writing, and while previously I thought there were no decent paying, stable writing jobs, I found that technical writing/UX design might be a viable career choice if I really wanted to jump ship out of physics. I still have enough time to get a double major in Rhetoric and UX Design if I switch this semester and this path also wouldn't require me to get a phd. My only fear is that my job prospects wouldn't be as good with these two majors should tech writing not work out. I think I also would feel sad dropping astronomy just as I'm starting to really get into research for it. I'd also feel like I'm giving up on the physics/astro major just because I can't handle the challenge, which admittedly bruises my pride. 

I've asked countless professors, career counselors, and people in my profession of interest for advice on this to no avail. What they all ultimately say is that I have to just make a decision for myself. I understand the truth in this, but I also have been thinking in circles on this issue for about a year now and I'm nowhere closer to an answer. The clock is ticking for me because if I want to graduate in four years, I need to commit to either a physics/astronomy double major or a rhetoric/UX Design double major by next semester. This summer, I need to choose to either find a tech writing internship or apply to more astro research and prepare for the physics GRE. I'm running out of time to figure this out- not asking for someone to make the decision for me, but any advice?"
sz2bhk,2,2022-02-22,My roommate is driving me batshit,lostinthesauce910,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/sz2bhk/my_roommate_is_driving_me_batshit/,"This is literally the only place I can think to let this out because everyone I know is friends with at least one of my roommates and I don't know if they're close enough to tell them about it.

I'm beginning to realize that my one roommate is treating me like shit for no reason at all and two of them use me for shit and I'm starting to get even sicker of it now that I realized. The one is the real problem by constantly bothering me about doing chores and shit that they can do themselves three times as fast and that have nothing to do with me. They pulled me aside from my work and told me to two fucking times to get rid of some stuff on our kitchen table that wasn't mine just because they noticed it was there. They've done it a bunch with the dishes too, which I'm less mad about because they're communal but still, they stop me and what I'm doing to tell me several times to do something immediately and when I can't because I'm actively working on something or in an online class they get pissed. And I do chores, in fact I think I do more communal chores for the apartment than they do. The only thing that bothers me is washing dishes which everyone else knows and adapts to but otherwise I'm frequently the one unloading the dishwasher, cleaning the floors and wiping down surfaces. I only ever see them do it when they expect company. I'm also not against picking up others' chores when they need me to if they ask me to do it nicely like a normal fucking human being. They  also never pay for stuff for the apartment, only if the other roommates make them split a bill, they always just buy shit for themselves and insist we have to ask to use it, which is insanely annoying because they are regularly not in the apartment to ask them. The other three of us just buy stuff for the whole apartment, which they use too, and don't ask for repayment because yknow its for the good of the apartment. It's not like they have any special reasons or some shit, its not like its for allergy reasons or the stuff is expensive, they just refuse to let things like cleaning products and bread be communal. On top of that they just eat other people's food without asking, very hypocritical, I buy food for me and say its my food but they still eat it without ever asking me. They are also one of the only ones with a job and steady income in the apartment, we're all students and I have not been able to find a job due to my shitty schedule but they have one and are also about to go on a paid internship in a month and yet I'm still one of the only one's buying stuff for other people in the apartment to use and they rarely ever do. And they get pissed at me when I don't buy shit, sometimes I don't have enough cash to go and get something communal and they bitch and moan about how we don't have something and just don't buy it on their own. They treat me 100% differently from the other roommates too for no reason that I can come up with. They're happy and bubbly with everyone else but any time they talk to me they have an edge in their voice and say rude shit. They're constantly judgemental to all of us, they have a huge issue with hypocrisy in over-explaining stuff, they can do it all day to you and see no problem in it but as soon as you point it out that you already know something or they're over-explaining something, no matter how nice you say it, they turn and get pissed. They've harassed me and some of their other friends about it too. And they constantly judge for shit, you can't have something that makes you happy without them being a huge dick about it. No one in the apartment is allowed to be happy about something they think is stupid and they will make that entirely clear any time they talk to you. I bought a stuffed animal I liked because I thought it was cute and it wasn't that expensive and I did not hear the fucking end of it from them about how its stupid and childish and they think it's ugly etc. My other roommates and I can't enjoy a game without them talking about how dumb it is when they literally have other friends that play it and they never say anything to them. They judge me and my friends for how we use our money too. Once again, I have no job but a friend and I had a few extra bucks for ourselves and we decided to buy used books. Well, my roommate tore into my friend for buying books they liked and judged them for how they used their money I still don't know why. It's like they all expect we have more cash than them even though they have an income and therefore should be using it on stuff that betters them.  

At first I thought I was the problem in all this but in the past few months I've done everything I could to try and improve any areas where I may be falling short or bothering them but it still goes on. I do more chores, I try to be less messy in the communal spaces and leave my messes behind my closed bedroom door, I buy more shit for the apartment so they stop bothering me about it and nothing. They just fucking pick on me and I still don't know why. I don't know what the deal is and at this point its driving me insane because I still feel like it's a me thing somehow. The only other thing I can think of is some kind of jealousy, me and one of our mutual friends have been hanging out way more lately because I need to get the fuck out of this apartment sometimes and they were also getting picked on whenever they hung out with my roommate and we both think they got jealous of us hanging out more and are taking it out on me now more often. The friend agrees that every time they were over here for a party or something the other roommates are really hard on me. I would confront them about it but I'm almost positive its gonna make things worse. I've seen how they dealt with situations like this in the past and they have never once admitted they're in the wrong or change their ways. They just get worse or drop the person which really doesn't help me in this situation. I don't wanna drop the roommate as a friend cause something tells me that this kind of thing would bother me way less if I had more control over being around them and when I can leave. Getting out of the apartment in the fall (or maybe even summer if god is on my side) and getting to decide that I am done with them and can simply just go back to my room in a completely different apartment will probably help a lot. All this shit is ridiculous though and I'm getting really tired of it. Its enough to get me into starting therapy and honestly I think we both need it with how they keep treating me."

I'm having trouble deciding due to that main question I had above. I feel as if going for a more ""traditional engineering role"" now would benefit me more than going into software roles. 

I feel like going from a more ""traditional engineering role"" to a software role is much easier than going from a software role to a more ""tradition engineering role""

sz3wsk,3,2022-02-22,Leaving,Laser-teatime,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sz3wsk/leaving/,"I'm afraid, but I shouldn't be.

My company is a hilarious sinking ship. The ceiling is falling in right next to the server room. There are six (6!) drip buckets scattered around the hole. Three new employees will be joining my department because the best employee we have demanded a job title change. She'll be in her own office next month (good for her) but now I can see more ""holes""

My department is kind of ok, but the people in purchasing and accounting make waaayy more money than me.

BUT they're even more miserable than us.

That's a bad sign.

A guy in purchasing retired, and then his replacement quit after three months (due to stress)

Just today a woman that has been with the company for 13 years resigned. She is the only person that knows how to use fancy million function office printer behind me...and she's not willing to teach anyone how to use it. She cried with her office friends, but I think she's leaving due to stress as well. She must be somewhat bitter. She isn't willing to train her replacement. She already has another job lined up.

The receptionist retired too. That woman was perfect at her job. She was the most competent receptionist I have ever meet. Her paperwork was pretty and alphabetical. Her customer service voice was unbreakable, but she left and no one replaced her.

We just...don't have a receptionist. I have refused to ""cover the front"" since day one because that's ridiculous. This is not a small company. Without a receptionist mountains of shipping paperwork just doesn't get done. Most of it was forced onto the accounting department, but they have accounting to worry about. So the reception desk is naturally in ruins. 

We work with truck drivers, and the back is understaffed. I don't know much but two managers have quit, and the drivers are complaining about the same thing I am. Too much work and no raises. Just like me the drivers are being told to squeeze 10 hours of work into an eight hour days.

I've seen people skip breaks, and I refuse to ever do that.

The head of my department has been away for 9 months due to surgery. I think she should retire, because she's very frail, but that's none of my business. I thought my department would get better again after her return, but my workload keeps growing.

I've been doing Excel sheets and data entry for the ""new ordering system"" that was supposed to be implemented four years ago.

That's right.

You heard me.

Four years ago...and I've been entering data for 10ish months (I think? I don't know anymore???). The project was only supposed to last two months so I've put my foot down. The other members of my department now also have to enter data. Why? Well, I had a breakdown. My performance worsened and my customers complained about my ""mean"" attitude. I even got reprimanded, but my bosses damn well know why I'm overwhelmed. Finishing the data entry sheets takes MINIMUM three hours. Max five. There's only eight hours in the work day...you do the math.

I'm being babied now. The most experienced person in my department is now listening in on my phone calls like I'm in training, because of the complaint. Nobody wants to actually acknowledge the fact that  doing two jobs for almost a year wore me out. Everybody FINALLY knows how to do the sheets BUT my superiors keep joking about how slow my coworkers are compared to me.

(I am the most efficient person in my department. All of them have admitted it, but I totally don't deserve a raise. I look at my phone when the phones are dead. That means I'm lazy.)

I want to scream.

Of COURSE my coworkers don't know how to do the sheets. It's not their job. Building up website history data and bug testing is NOT THEIR JOB OR MINE. When I got the project I had very little experience. My internship four years ago involved a lot of computer stuff, but now it's been a half decade. I'm no expert. Neither are the others. Making us do this work is stupid, and it's a massive waste of time. We're supposed to be paying attention to customers, not a new computer program that we don't understand.

It's buggy by the way.

Insanely buggy. I toggled the screen and somehow WRECKED the demo program. It just...stopped working and froze. Even though it's four years old.

ITS FOUR YEARS OLD AND ITS STILL A DEMO!

AAAAAHHHH!

I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!

My family thinks I'm making the right choice. Boyfriend does too. My friends are supportive too, but I liked how stable this job was before covid. Now I can see that management was always bad. What kind of delusional clown expects SALES REPS to optimize a COMPUTER PROGRAM WORTH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

It's a joke.

I hope I don't jump into another trash fire that blames bad management on covid. I'm afraid of leaving, but I shouldn't be, because I have no patience left.

I refuse to sacrifice my breaks. I shouldn't have to cover empty, important positions that should have been filled a year ago. The managers have to stop making me pretend to be a computer programmer. They need to stop asking me computer questions. It's driving me bonkers.

I'm tired of watching my very likeable coworkers cry at their desks.

Things MIGHT get better again if covid ends, but I don't care.

I shouldn't.

I don't even think a raise would fix the problem. The manager will not stop asking everyone (not just me) to do things that aren't their job. Things they don't know how to do. Important things that they will most definitely mess up BECAUSE ITS NOT THEIR JOB.

I hope I find something half decent soon.

I have alot of days off piled up (this job does have good benefits. I've been taking four day weeks because I am too burned out to do five days. Yes, they are willing to pay me and let me take mental health days, but they aren't willing to fix the problem.

There has to be something better out there.

sz42h7,1,2022-02-22,Stellantis Summer Internship,catguacamole,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sz42h7/stellantis_summer_internship/," Hi there! I have an interview coming up for an software development internship position with Stellantis. I was referred to the position by one of my professors and was not told much about it or what specific programming skills they are looking for. I would like to be as prepared as possible for my interview. Has anyone here ever interviewed for an Internship position with Stellantis (or any other auto manufacturer)? Are there any particular topics I should brush up on in advance? What is it like working for Stellantis? I know they're pushing really hard for electrification and autonomous driving, but I'm not sure how that would translate to a summer internship."
sz455g,1,2022-02-22,Landing an internship in a different city?,TinkerCube,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sz455g/landing_an_internship_in_a_different_city/,"I (22M from Canada) have been trying to get a summer engineering internship outside of my home province. Long story short, but I've lived where I'm at my whole life and I just feel like I just need a change of scenery for a bit. Since January, I've applied to about 50 postings using Google, LinkedIn and Indeed. However, I would say that about 50% of these applications were done in the last 2-3 weeks, because I've started to stress out about not being able to secure something before the summer. I've only applied to 2 local positions, and I did them through my universities co-op job board.

Out of all my applications, so far I've only received one video interview, and it was just one where I had to record myself answering some common interview questions. In previous terms I would have had a much higher success rate by now. For my last summer work-term, I had 6 interviews in about 30 applications. When I applied for the winter term, I had 8 interview requests out of 14 applications. You would think that me graduating next year, looking for my final work-term and already having 3 internships under my belt would just make my application *more* competitive.

I'm trying to figure out what has been making this so difficult this time around. My resume/cover letter might not be perfect, but it's definitely not bad enough to be making this much of a difference. I have a few theories, and I am guessing that it is because of one or multiple of these factors:

\#1. Covid-19 is making it more challenging to find a job (although I applied for all of my co-ops during the pandemic, and it didn't seem to impact me too much back then).

\#2. The job market in my city is just not very competitive for engineering, and I am just now noticing how difficult it is to land a job in most other cities. This would make some sense because we only have one engineering school here and a seemingly high concentration of engineering jobs, whereas a place like Ontario would be flooded with students. I've also mainly been applying to jobs within an hour drive of the major cities (generally top 10 population areas) so naturally I would be looking at hundreds of applicants for most job postings.

\#3. The fact that the jobs I have been applying to are online, rather than on the university's designated co-op job board. I am assuming that many of the companies I had applied to on there had some sort of deal with the school or perhaps a quota of how many positions needed to be filled with students from my university. Maybe the jobs I am applying to right now have the same deal with other schools that are more local, so I actually have next-to zero chance with them. I have no idea how common this is, but I've heard that it is sometimes a thing with larger companies.

\#4. Companies simply aren't willing to hire students out of province right now. This could be because they are worried that we will have another Covid wave, they might think that I may want relocation assistance, they think I'm not actually serious about getting the job, or maybe they are saying, ""why would I consider someone far away when I have a good candidate pool here""?

Is it plausible that I am getting mass-rejected for internships for reasons other than my application? If so, do you think that #3 and #4 likely reasons for getting rejected in my situation?"

sz5r0k,11,2022-02-22,Frustrated about Internship Hunt as a First-Year CS Major. What should be my next steps?,dmkhara,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sz5r0k/frustrated_about_internship_hunt_as_a_firstyear/," I am a first-year CS student and tried my best (though could have been better) to apply for internships this summer. I followed all the tips for getting an internship. Made several projects, prepared a professional resume, etc. Got only rejections, not even an interview.

Except from one pretty big company. I was invited for a behavioral interview. Had it last week and I thought it went amazing. I talked about all my experiences, leadership skills, a company I opened, and what I learned from it. The interviewer and I really clicked and they seemed to be impressed. They also told me what the next steps in the hiring process were. But today I get an email stating that I was unsuccessful and there would be no technical interview.

I really do not know what to do at this point. I have tried to watch/read everything on getting an internship.

What should I do to increase my chances of getting an internship next summer?"
sz5s6h,1,2022-02-22,Checkr verification question for background check for CS Job,sad_boi_jazz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sz5s6h/checkr_verification_question_for_background_check/,"Hello all, 

To preface, this is not my account, I posted through my roommate. Wanted to mention that I definitely know that I  messed up and absolutely should not have done this.

I recently accepted a coding school grad web development internship position with a  large-sized company in Seattle and lied on my resume, specifically regarding my education. 

I stated that I had a bachelors in music from a school where in reality I  just attended there and received a lot of credits. I will mention that I also put my coding  bootcamp certification on the resume,  which I actually do have.  I am about 6 - 8 credits away from the music degree but ran out of money and loans unfortunately. 

They are using Checkr to verify education,  and the education part  states that you can ask to verify a degree OR certification. I will be putting my bootcamp certification for education and leaving  everything else as the exact same on my resume and hoping for the best.

Has anyone had experience with Checkr's verification process? Is it just a lost cause? Should I give up now? My thought is that they may try to cross check the resume and try  to verify the degree no matter what, even if it isn't relevant to the  position and even if I don't put it into Checkr's verification system directly.

But maybe not. Not sure. If they do ask for degree  verification, my thought is just to feign ignorance and tell them that I  thought I sent them the version of my resume which states ""attended""  instead of ""Bachelors of arts"", and that the version I sent them was one that I made while still in school.

Thanks in advance and, yes, I know I am an idiot."
sz5soq,2,2022-02-22,Help choosing between some internship offers? Having a really tough time deciding.,KamikazeOnThese,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sz5soq/help_choosing_between_some_internship_offers/,"I'm incredibly grateful to have two internship offers in hand (if you asked me if I'd be here a couple weeks ago I would have said no way lol, dealt with like 4-5 months straight of rejection after rejection). But now I'm having the [good] problem of deciding which one, since none of them stand out (obviously if I had a FAANG it would be no question). I have one for UnitedHealth/Optum, and one for a small, lesser known defense contractor (I won't name since they're pretty small).

Like I said I have those 2 in hand but I was also sort of expecting a 3rd (from Schwab) since the interview went great and my interviewer all but guaranteed I'd get one, but they sorta ghosted and haven't replied to my follow-up email. That said the deadline for Optum is tomorrow so I have to make a decision. I would appreciate any and all thoughts/advice! I put together some pros for each:

**Optum:** Fully remote, bigger company and more name recognition, probably higher salary if I were to get a return offer, pays $26/hr

**Defense Contractor:** Fairly interesting tech, proprietary stuff plus modern tech stack, would get a Secret clearance, hybrid role, pays $30/hr

**Schwab** (in the off chance they get back to me tomorrow lol): Likely higher pay if Glassdoor/levels is right (~$34?), but it's in person and I'd have to move. Also the team said I'd primarily be doing testing (they mentioned using software called Selenium) which doesn't seem *super* exciting but I'm certainly open to it.

Would def appreciate any thoughts!"

Hi everyone,  I am an international student currently in the second year of my master's in CS  at a Uni known for its theoretical CS in Germany and looking out for positions keeping in mind that a company can offer me a full-time role after completion of my studies. So far during my master's my sole focus has been on NLP and Deep Learning, I did an internship last summer using Transfomer models for neural search for specific domain use cases, where I both pre-trained and fine-tuned deep neural networks in Pytorch. So far I applied to 10+ data science working students roles and didn't get even called for an interview and got generic rejection emails given I only applied to 4 places last year and got the internship within a matter of a week. What am I missing in my resume? Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks!

PS:

All of the following is present on my github readme where I have done couple of research projects one where I reproduced Deep Neural Architecture from a paper and then compared it to an architecture that I came up with, second, where I completed as a class project creating some novel adversarial attacks on BERT classifiers pretrained in German language and devised two defenses inspired from the vision domain.  Also, I have made a few pull requests to a couple of NLP frameworks in Python, also, written around 5 medium blogs on novel ideas (not generic Kaggle datasets) that I discussed there. I'm really failing to understand what exactly am I missing? :(

Im a senior, and for what may be considered by some to be a high point in their lives is an extreme low point for mine. For all of my life I've been constantly alone, always felt slow in some areas of life than others too. My lack of social skills/experience didn't prepare me for college, and I'll likely remain that way for the rest of my life. I haven't been accepted in any internships, nor any position in my field. I'm doing ok academically, but I feel like this is all I have that stands me out. I barely have any intellectual drive or even street smarts. I see what my peers are doing, getting accepted into internships  and even higher level positions, and it  depresses me even more. I constantly battle suicidal thoughts, ik I'll never be a functioning member of society and will continue to be a disappointment to my parents for the next decade. I'm never going to have a social life, or any career, I don't want to give up but at times I feel like that's all I ever can do. I just feel extremely hopeless about my life."

Anyway I got my first interview. It felt like a prescreening interview but I think I did really well. If I land the position at the low end of the pay range it's a 40% pay bump from my teaching job and like 12 less hours per week due to no commute.

Here goes…

Disclaimer: gifted is in quotes, but I was actually placed in the Gifted program from elementary to middle school. I am very much burnt out. Even as I'm writing this post...

Another disclaimer: ""Okay"" is in quotes because in my school, I'm really below average. Considering the applicant pool and median stats too for Columbia, my stats were way below average.

**Demographics**

* Residence: NYC
* Income Bracket: \~30k for family of 5, was previously \~50k for family of 10 until junior year
* Type of School: VERY Competitive Public School

**Intended Major(s)**: I put Political Science, Music, Psychology, and Pre-Dental as interests.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 95.12 W, my school doesn’t do unweighted. However, I have multiple 70s and 80s on my transcript. My APs junior year carried my GPA. Before junior year, I had a 92.99 W.
* Rank (or percentile): Around 80/100, Bottom 20% (my school is super competitive, and everyone's GPA is like 0.1 apart from each other LMAO). My counselors were convinced that my grades wouldn’t make the cut, especially since my percentile was at the very bottom.
* Number of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: All of my classes are Honors Classes, but I took a total of 5 APs as recorded on my transcript: AP World, APUSH, AP English Language and Composition, AP Biology, and AP Psychology. My school has a program that allows me to Dual Enroll, so I have 2 College Courses from junior year (College Pre-Calculus and College Calculus).
* Senior Year Course Load: College Political Science/Microeconomics,  College Calculus II/III, Forensics/College Astronomy, Advanced Orchestra, College English, and AP Chinese.

**Standardized Testing**

* AP/IB: AP World (5), AP Psychology (5), AP English Language and Composition (4), APUSH (4), AP Biology (N/A, I skipped it because I knew I’d do terrible LMAO)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

I'll be a little vaguer because I don't want to completely doxx myself, but chances are, if you know me, you'd know from reading these alone... I got lazy near the end, so I just copy pasted my Common App descriptions.

3. International Music Competition #1 Grand Prize and 1st Place
4. International Music Competition #2 1st Place (judged by Grammy-nominated violinist)
5. International Music Competition #3 2nd Prize

**Letters of Recommendation**

I was able to get really close with my teachers and administration through my social media club and violin playing. I'd also always invite them to any of my concerts and update them on my life. I've also known all of my recommenders since freshman year. Because my school is really small, I think it was easier to get to know them and connect. Sorry for the very simple and choppy wording, I'm quite tired (but feel very motivated to finish this post).

Math Teacher and Club Advisor (8.5/10)

* I always overthink how well people like me, but to be fair, I knew this teacher since 9th grade. I had them for Geometry and Pre-Calculus, and they were also my club advisor for all four years. I think they were really able to see me shine in leadership positions and they could also testify to my passion for music and community. While I didn't do so hot in Geometry (I ended with like an 85), I did well in Pre-Calculus, and this teacher was really able to talk about my growth over the years.

Social Studies Teacher (8/10)

* I knew this teacher since freshman year as well, but I never had them officially until junior year. Because I play the violin (and because my school is really small), I've been able to connect with the faculty through that. This teacher knows me as a great academic writer, and I've gotten quite close to them throughout the years. They really supported me throughout the pandemic, when I was struggling the most, and they really believed in me through and through.

School Counselor (7.5/10)

* I only knew my school counselor for a few months, but we vibed REALLY well (despite them saying my grades weren't as high). I stopped by a lot in their office and chatted with them, sharing with them all the insider scoops on my life. Overall, I'm sure that they advocated for me nicely.

Assistant Principal (7/10)

* I also got really close with one of my assistant principals. We've developed a very playful relationship. I'd bring them some traditional foods I'd make at home, and we'd eat lunch together. I invited them to all of my concerts, and we really just vibed from freshman year to senior year. The only caveat is that they procrastinated on some of my recs and ended up using my resume/brag sheet as a template for some. Regardless, I think their willingness to write me a rec was good too (I used their rec as an additional one in Common App).

Principal (5/10)

* My principal actually stopped me in the halls to offer me a recommendation letter. I was a little taken aback, but was grateful regardless — I sent them my brag sheet, and they said that they would forward it to the admissions email address. I don't think it was amazing, since they probably used my resume. However, I've been very involved in school affairs and activities (such as presenting at Open House and information sessions), and they said that they would include that in their letter.

**Interviews**

Columbia (10/10): I LOVED my interviewer. I was SUPER-PREPARED for this interview (my brain is molding into a smooth orb right now so feel free to ask for clarification on any details, I just do not have a writing muscle at the moment). This was more than an hour long. At first I needed to warm up into the conversation, but after a few minutes, it was like we were old friends reuniting after a few years. This was one of the most pleasant interview experiences I have ever had.

Swarthmore (6/10): I actually attended Discover Swarthmore, so we had the opportunity to interview with a current student. Turns out, we had a mutual connection (this person was their ex...) so it got awkward after a while. Safe to say, it wasn't a really great interview, but we were able to laugh it off by the end. I gave pretty generic answers, but I still tried to be the most genuine I could. I was heavily considering Swarthmore at this point, but I hadn't done enough research just yet.

**Essays**

Personal Statement (10/10): I'll go out on a limb here and say that my Personal Statement was probably what carried me. While it wasn't perfect (I don't believe any essay can ever be perfect), I think that I showcased my passions, life aspirations, and struggles in a really vulnerable light. I was also in William The Reader's Pro Bono Program, and he always gave me high praises for my personal writing (and he would also go out of his way to email me more thoughts about my PS). My Columbia AO also wrote that she loved reading my PS, and that reading about the journey that shaped my world was very moving. (I wrote about a nickname I had growing up and my undiagnosed ADHD/journey with music being my voice).

Columbia Supplements (9/10): I definitely think I could've improved them, but I was proud of what they were! (Again, can definitely elaborate! But I am brain dead hahaha. T_T)

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*
I'll be doing the Columbia-Juilliard Exchange, which simply means that in addition to being a full-time undergrad student at Columbia, I'll be taking classes at Juilliard as well. 

* Columbia University (ED) COMMITTED!
* The Juilliard School (RD) COMMITTED!
* Fordham University (EA)
* Adelphi University (EA)
* SUNY Stony Brook (EA)
* SUNY Binghamton (EA)
* SUNY Onenota (EA)
* SUNY Polytechnic Institute (EA)
* SUNY Oswego (EA), with President's Scholarship
* SUNY Geneseo (EA)

*Waitlists:*

* None

*Rejections:*

* None

**Additional Information:**

I included this in my additional info: From my childhood until earlier this year, I had undiagnosed ADHD that was hidden behind high academic achievement in my youth. The adjustment period into high school annually was very difficult for me, contributing to some of my lower grades freshman and sophomore year. However, earlier in 2021, I was able to get diagnosed with ADHD combination (and consequent depression). This allowed me to take the proper steps to seek the healthcare I needed, and I am now adapting to the changes in my life; I’m thankful for finally having my struggles validated from years of hopelessness and confusion.

I also included the 35 word short answer questions from when I applied to QuestBridge! Spoiler, I didn't get either programs LMAO but the writing practice definitely paid off!

Final thoughts:

* I tried my best to present a cohesive narrative about my journey of self-acceptance and love, combining my passion for music, connecting with others, and finding myself.
* My commitments helped me the most. I committed to violin at a very young age, and I kept that steady all throughout high school.
* I was most worried about my grades, especially considering my school environment. I also never really learned to study, and my executive functioning is off the charts (it's not very good). Regardless, I think the ""holistic"" application perspective really helped me — all of my circumstances were factored into my narrative, and I'm glad it paid off.

I know that I probably wasn't very specific, but feel free to ask clarifying questions if you want!!"

CS is not for everyone and I know big tech is dystopian in its own way but these hourly jobs are killing you all and this is all I know. You are treated so shitty for so little thanks and such unfair compensation.

We will keep fighting to be treated and paid fairly, but in the meantime, pivoting to computer science or a desk job may help some of you. For the others, just disregard. I know many can't afford college (or have already gone), but there may be a path even without it.

Do you like puzzles? Decent at algebra? Do you like web stuff and visuals? CS may be for you and isn't as hard as you might think. You can pick it up in your spare time, and it is actually fun.

1. Do a few starter tutorials

2. Go to a software bootcamp (if you can afford it). This might be a few months of work.

3. Do a bunch of leetcode easy questions. They're basically just fun puzzles you can do every night.

4. Apply to internships at the big bank / insurance / whatever company in your area, or software consulting / contracting companies. They will hire anyone they think they can place somewhere, and are willing to help with training or education. There are many free resume help services online, and I'm sure Reddit will help as well - https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/

5. After the internship / consulting gig (a year or less), try to convert to a full-time employee at that company or elsewhere.

6. After this, switch jobs every 2 years, getting a 15%+ raise every time. Don't tell the new company what you make, and you may be surprised to see that you can get pretty huge jumps in salary up to and beyond 50%, as you get more experience. You can even apply to fully remote positions online.

Again, I know this isn't for everyone. But you all at least deserve a salaried desk job with healthcare so you can have a SECOND to fucking breathe, and not go home every night exhausted because of backbreaking labor. Feel free to message me if you have literally any other questions."

I decided to stop wasting my time with my old friends who love to drink and be lazy 24/7.

They are good friends but I hung out with them few times this year but I really felt it was literally 

wasting of my  time. I didn't get a job yet after my internship, and I think it's crucial to me to spend all 

of my energy on my body, career and mindset only.

don't get me wrong, I was a desperate and obnoxious guy before but I felt some urgency since I 

want to get better and better.

I started going to gym at least 5 days a week and on my no fap journey. Spending my whole day with

job hunting, improving ms-office skillset to increase my value in job market.

When things are too stressful or hard, I eat someting delicious food, take a nap or listen some good 

songs, hiking or brief walking

I feel lonely, yes, I do. But I figured out that If I keep just hanging out with them and not fully focus on

changing myself, I will be a guy who is unemployed (or employed by shitty company), out of shape 

because of alcohol parties, and desperate for women 24/7.

I also realized that I don't have to hang out with them every week because I know they will not be 

responsible with my failure, which I already experienced one time in the past. I think that experience

changed my mindset.

One main reason is that when I meet them, I go back to weak version of me who was talkative, des

perate and dependent.

Also, I stopped contacting my relatives who are insecure af.

because they saying s\*\*\* like ""oh, your parents spent million dollars to educate you in overseas

but you are unemployed lol, I and my son do better than you.""

Because I know that I know they just don't give a f about me but they want to boost thier ego 

by using me as an object.

Anyway, I struggled a lot in the society since I was so used to this role ""getting picked on"" from my old 

friends. They are good sometimes but now I feel I should not spend much time with them anymore.

Have any of you guys successfully transitioned yourself after you stayed away from your old friends

Hey everyone,

Back in the summer I interned for a company and everything was great. My team really liked me, I networked a lot with people in the company, and all around people wanted me to stick around. 

After my internship was finished (in August) my team wanted to extended me until end of year. I went with it and  was pretty happy - I thought this could only help me even more.

In October they started interviewing for the full time position. I had to interview for it (4 hours) and write a 500 word essay (which I thought was ridiculous). They said they would get back to us in November - they never did. I had to ask my manager and hear from other candidates that they were experiencing ""delays"".

Fast forward to January I notice that offers / rejections going out and I still don't hear back anything. I email the program manager asking for a update  respectfully and get no response. 

In January before I left my manager did try and talk to them and he told me that they said that they were still experiencing delays and to ""not put all my eggs in one basket""

At this point it really sucks. I recently graduated and am still applying / interviewing for other positions but I really thought I had landed this. I still have not heard back at all to this day and have no clue regarding my status. I really enjoyed working for the company and my team was great but the recruiters / program team are just horrible.

So is it just time to move on and forget about all this? Open to any feedback regarding this."

My son got admitted in BS Computer science(2+2 plan starting at Harrisburg and finishing at UP).  If you could provide some information on how is the job opportunities for international students after graduation at PSU. Is it easy to get internship / job.? He also got into Arizona State University, so just wanted to compare which one is better for job prospects. I heard that many companies including FAANG recruits ASU graduates but unaware of PSU.

szejts,1,2022-02-23,Worried about failing background check - what to do?,sad_boi_jazz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/szejts/worried_about_failing_background_check_what_to_do/,"Hello all,

To  preface, this is not my account, I posted through my roommate. Wanted  to mention that I definitely know that I  messed up and absolutely  should not have done this.

I  recently accepted a coding school grad web development internship  position with a  large-sized company in Seattle and lied on my resume,  specifically regarding my education.

I  stated that I had a bachelors in music from a school where in reality I just attended there and received a lot of credits. I will mention that  I also put my coding bootcamp certification on the resume,  which I  actually do have. I am about 6 - 8 credits away from the music degree but ran out of money and loans unfortunately.

They  are using Checkr to verify education,  and the education part  states  that you can ask to verify a degree OR certification. I will be putting  my bootcamp certification for education and leaving  everything else as  the exact same on my resume and hoping for the best.

Has  anyone had experience with Checkr's verification process? Is it just a  lost cause? Should I give up now? My thought is that they may try to  cross check the resume and try  to verify the degree no matter what,  even if it isn't relevant to the  position and even if I don't put it  into Checkr's verification system directly.

But  maybe not. Not sure. If they do ask for degree  verification, my thought is just to feign ignorance and tell them that I  thought I sent  them the version of my resume which states ""attended""  instead of  ""Bachelors of arts"", and that the version I accidentally sent them was one that I made while still in school and expecting the degree.

Thanks in advance and, yes, I know I am an idiot."

&amp;#x200B;

I have zero experience, the pay is very low for the research programme and its quite decent for the domestic internship.

My primary question is what would be a better opportunity to learn things and what would open more doors in the future? Do you consider the research programme prestigious and with real world application? I am fairly certain I am not interested in a future in research, maybe at most a Master's degree."

Until today I things were going smooth. I had secured a 3 month internship in IT with training and a job offer with good package after it. I had signed the offer letter and everything was set. Today the HR tells me there was a mistake in the recruitment process and they take only BTech graduates. The internship and the offer is now gone.

I had planned everything around that job. Now I'm confused. One of my uncle keeps telling me to go back to college and do BTech. Some are telling to do MCA which is another 3 years. Some are telling to do any job I can get my hands on no matter the pay. I want to get into IT.

I'm confused about what to do. What are your opinions. I don't find a lot of BCA graduates. People who did it, what did you guys do after BCA? 

Thank You"

I’ve got a summer software eng position at a household name bank and I’m super grateful but my pay is not very competitive when compared to more software focused places ( and Ofcourse FAANG).

Are there any industry guys who could think of some projects together with my internship that could help me land a better position in September?
I’ve done a lot of stuff before: mobile apps, web apps, backend (my favourite kind of work) which helped me land my job at the bank. But one thing the manager brought up is that I’ve never had anyone review my code (he asked at the beginning of my interview). Since all of my repos are private he couldn’t view them as well so that kind of got me worried for the future.

Should I work on some public open source stuff? And if so any ideas? Most of my experience is freelance work and this startup I built that needs to remain private.

Also, any students who have ideas and would like to team up This summer Ide love to!"

szjc4m,1,2022-02-23,Help a student make a decision - Service desk specialist or Data annnotation.,Dukoduko,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/szjc4m/help_a_student_make_a_decision_service_desk/,"So here it goes. (Just a little disclaimer, English isn't my native language)

I'm a CS student, currently on my 4th year (out of 5) and have actively been looking for a new job in the past month. Currently have the opportunity to work 3 jobs.   


Service desk specialist - includes night shifts, best pay (immediately), possibility of advancing in the field.

Data annotator - completely entry level position but the company has intern job opportunities for people who want to get into development/data analysis etc. 

Help desk - least attractive one, just a general help desk for a government company, handle e mails/calls etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in a pretty big dilemma, mainly concerning the first two jobs, in the long run they're 2 completely different careers and I just simply don't know enough about any of those 2 for me to know exactly which one suits me or not. 

So let's go over the pros and cons:  
Service desk - PROS: very good pay (immediately), smaller company (I think people just tend to learn more in smaller companies unlike massive ones where companies have huge IT departments where every single person has their repetitive small chores that they do, becoming a one trick pony basically), the company says you can advance which results in higher position and money

CONS: NIGHT SHIFTS, working with people which might have very stupid inquiries

&amp;#x200B;

Data annotation - PROS: very flexible working hours, the company says they have a lot of internal job opportunities where they quite often look at their data team/students for possible talent after they graduate, this includes jobs in development, data science, NLP etc. 

CONS:  the pay is worse (currently), monotonous as fuck, I am not so sure about advancing because they hire a massive amount of students and I just simply can't stop thinking that it's kind of a trap, they basically employed a massive amount of students in the past year and intend to double it in the next year, I kind of have a hard time seeing me advance to a higher paying job or position in a sea of 300 students all wanting to prove themselves. So I just have a feeling it might be a trap so they get a huge influx of data annotators to better their systems and AI.  


I myself really have no idea which career I would prefer out of those two. So if anyone here has a tip/advice, basically anything to try and help and solve my dilemma, please do tell!"

# Information about me 

23 M from Algeria.

recently, I've got my master’s degree in electrical engineering.

I have good grades, third in my class, good theoretical knowledge.

I have ZERO practical experiences when it comes to working in my field of studies.

I did two short internships (one month each because of Covid19).

I am an Arabic native speaker, I've never tested my French nor tested my English but I think I can score a B2 or even C1 in both of them.

I am not afraid of learning a new language. Actually, I am learning German. (it's been like 15 days since I started, I am constantly hearing about opportunities in Germany)

Weather doesn’t bother me, I got bored with the culture here and I want to see other's cultures and widen my perspectives in life.

I signed up for USA Diversity Visa Lottery. This is my second time trying.

I have couple relatives in France, Canada, UK and USA. Some are willing to partially sponsor me(maybe a month or two of rent, that's it). and other can't.

# Problems

In Algeria, Every healthy male have to spend one whole year in the military with just above  minimum wage (about 125$/month) (min wage is 90$/month)  and I really don't want that, but I believe they send convocations to those who have reached 25 yo, which for me is in a year and half maybe. and If you don't respond to those convocations, a **wanted** poster will be issued, which means you can't leave the country, and if they find you, they will take you forcefully without even saying goodbye to your loved ones. the only exception is if you reached 30 yo, they will give you a forgiveness card (that's the true name of the card).

My dreams can't be achieved here; I love the concept of Artificial General Intelligence and Algeria doesn't support researches that don't have an immediate impact, (what am I saying !! Algeria doesn't value research at all). and I would love to participate in the reduction of CO2 equivalents in the atmosphere, that's why I chose this field in the first place. but Algeria doesn't even want to have electrical cars !! 

I don't have money, and I can't rely on my family. I worked during my master's thesis and I am currently saving about 500$ right now, I am thinking about taking the IELTS test and start applying to international scholarships, idk ?.

I can't work in government's companies because they will demand the military card or the forgiveness one.  

I can program, and I am trying to put in a portfolio (mainly web and software development) and start applying to jobs or take a shot at online freelancing to get the money needed.

I can only get a small loan, like 1000 $, maximum of 2000 $ . 

# What I want to know :

I want a **cheap and fast** way to leave Algeria to a county that value research so that I can at least network with likeminded people and participate in the achievement of my dreams. preferably Europe.

I am willing to work part time, seek a job there with my degree, study there then start jobseeking, or even prepare my PhD there.

&amp;#x200B;

 thank you for reading this."
szkahf,0,2022-02-23,In my opinion the college you go to dosnt matter.,Ethan71155,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/szkahf/in_my_opinion_the_college_you_go_to_dosnt_matter/,"I’ll begin by saying I’ve already went to college. I could go to any college in my state and I went to the cheapest one which had a 100% acceptance rate. The school was trash and I went there to study computer science which ranks nationally in the bottom 10% of all computer science programs.

I finished in 3 years(6 semesters), 3.9GPA, no internship, no debt, and a software engineer job lined up. It was the first and only job I applied for in my field. I’ve been working for that job the last 18 months. When I started that job I had about $500 in my bank now I have a house and around $30,000 in stocks and cash and I’m only 23.

Now for my theory. For arguments sake let’s say I’m in the top 4% of successful people my age and will end up top 2% of people when I’m 40. I believe that I’m in the the top 3% of my college class, I also think if I went to an elite college I would of been in the top 15% of that group, and if I only got a high school diploma I would be in the top 1% of that group. Regardless which path I take I would end up in the top 4% of 23 year olds and will be in the top 2% of people when I’m 40. It’s not about what path you take it’s about you. Your IQ, parents wealth, work ethic, ambition, health, social skills, willing to sacrifice current pleasure for future successful, etc. 

TLDR It doesn’t matter what college you go to. If you go to a great college and be average at it. Or you could of gone to a bad college and be great their. The end result is the same level of success which is why college choice doesn’t matter."

szkp1h,159,2022-02-23,"👋 Hey Juniors (&amp; sophomores &amp; even freshmen!), This is post is for you – I know it's Wednesday, but it’s not a shitpost! Ever feel like you’re stuck on the Extracurricular Hamster Wheel? Well, here’s your guide for stepping off &amp; finding your star-shaped self! ...(🔗 to chat more about ECs too)",admissionsmom,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/szkp1h/hey_juniors_sophomores_even_freshmen_this_is_post/,"# ❓“How good are my extracurriculars?” 

It's one of the most common questions we get here on A2C. Then I receive tons more about how many extracurriculars are necessary and whether a kid’s chances will be hurt because they haven’t performed at Carnegie Hall, been speaking Mandarin since they were five years old, or cured cancer. I get it. It’s an important part of your application. It’s also a broad category, and as a result, there’s a lot of room for creativity and individuality. That also means that kids feel a lot of pressure to have the most impressive, superhuman extracurriculars possible.

I mean if you’re at any stage of the college admissions process, you already know the word “extracurriculars” is important. Colleges want you to not just be a great student and an amazing test taker, but also someone who spends their time doing meaningful activities.

JEEZ. As if you didn’t have enough on your plate.

# 😊THE GOOD NEWS

But think about it like this: there are lots of students who have grades and scores similar to yours, but none with the exact combination of interests that make you you. Here’s the good news: activities that are meaningful and important to you can actually improve your life and make you a better person while making you a stronger college applicant. Considering the opportunity that the Activities Section of the application affords you, be proud of your extracurriculars! Despite what you might have heard, you do not need to cure cancer, be a violin prodigy, have thousands of volunteer hours, be president of multiple clubs, or be in a sport to go to college. Those are all good activities, but they aren’t a requirement.

If you help out at your parents’ business or care for a grandparent, include that! Do you work as a cowboy, like a real, working, horse-riding, rounding-up cowboy? Definitely put that down. Are you a professional speedcuber? Let colleges know. Do you like to read a lot? Show them. Do you moderate a subreddit? Do you spend a substantial amount of time running a meme page? Do you spend hours conducting your own Internet research about a topic you love? They want to know that, too.

The bad news? There is no magic formula or combination of “best” extracurricular activities that will guarantee you get admitted to your favorite colleges. If so, everyone would be doing those.

# 🏫 SO, WHAT DO COLLEGES REALLY WANT?

Ask yourself: Does it seem interesting to you? Is it something that you can get behind and feel like what you are doing is worthwhile or meaningful to you or others? If so, yes, it can be good for your application. If not, then no. If you’re worried about the amazing specialness of an activity or opportunity, it means you’re really not that into it. The lack of interest is what makes that particular EC nothing special for you, and you’d be better off finding something else. As an admissions counselor from U Chicago shared at an info session, “As soon as you figure out what you think we’re looking for, we’re gonna change our minds.” Colleges want to see the reflection of who you are and what interests you, not what you’re trying to guess that they want you to do.

In a statement made in Summer 2020 from over 300 College Admissions Deans about what they care about, they said: “We have never had specific expectations for any one⁠ type of extracurricular activity or summer experience and realize that each student’s circumstances allow for different opportunities. We have always considered⁠ work or family responsibilities as valuable ways of spending one’s time, and this is especially true at this time.”⁠ (I summarized the entire statement in an Instagram post linked[ here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCGi7lpBP2-/) and in a blog post linked[ here](https://admissionsmom.college/activities/more-than-300-college-admissions-deans-respond-to-covid-19-my-thoughts/) if you’d like to read the entire document — which you should.)

And, here’s what[ MIT Admissions says about Extracurricular activities](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/)**:**

“Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right — down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you — not what you think is right for us.

Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy — whether it feels right for you.

*College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.***”** (emphasis mine)

Remember it’s not exactly about the type of ECs you do — it’s more about your involvement. If you are enthusiastic, interested, and involved, then any activity is a good EC. They don’t have to be unique. In fact, I’m not so sure there is such a thing as a “unique” activity anymore. If it has added value to your life and helps paint a picture of high school you, include it in your application.

In the end, you gotta realize that extracurriculars are merely one part of your whole application. Do they guarantee admission to any particular school or set of schools? Are they the deciding factor between acceptance and rejection? No and no, because colleges that consider your ECs are looking at your entire application package and also at their own institutional needs, so there’s no guessing what’s going to appeal to any one school for any one year. If anything, learning about your activities provides admissions counselors an opportunity to get to know you better. That means you just have to keep doing you!

So while the following tips aren’t a cheat sheet, I hope they offer some wisdom and guidance that you might find helpful on your college admissions journey.

# 📤 THINK OUTSIDE THE EC BOX

Keep in mind that basically anything that you do outside of classwork, homework, and test prep is considered an activity. That includes jobs, family and home responsibilities, elderly or child care, personal projects, interests, and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to the more typical research, internships, and in and out of school community service, clubs, and sports.

That’s right. ANYTHING. If you worked in a coffee shop, that counts. If you maintain a blog, that counts too. Even playing video games can count in the right context (like if you’re interested in a related field).

Colleges want to see that you have a life beyond school work and test prep. So don’t be afraid to mix it up. Also, keep in mind that colleges understand when you have home and family responsibilities, and these also belong on the Activities list on your application. If you spend your afternoon taking care of your siblings or your grandparents or you have to help your parents in their business, list it. That counts.

# 🌟 BE STAR-SHAPED

Look, colleges don’t want you obsessing over the most impressive, superhuman extracurriculars possible. They aren’t looking for you to have any particular kind of ECs. They want to know what gets you interested and involved. High school is a time for you to learn about yourself and what intrigues, interests, and excites you. You’re a teenager; you should be exploring and checking out a variety of interests and experiences.

Don’t box yourself in, thinking that there are only a few things you should be doing. As such — and I acknowledge I’m going against the grain here — my philosophy for helping kids with extracurriculars is all about being star-shaped. I don’t actually recommend having one big “spike,” meaning a single extracurricular you devote all your time to, though I recognize that’s the trendy advice these days, nor do I recommend trying to pursue every single extracurricular you can because you feel like you need to check off a laundry list of activities for the “resume booster club” so you can be “well-rounded.” Instead, shoot for being kinda well-rounded with some spikes — like a star — by pursuing four or five activities that interest and excite you. But honestly, you do you. Be who you are. *That’s what colleges want.* And if being you means having one big spike or being a perfectly round ball, then that’s perfectly fine, too.

# 😎 GET INVOLVED

**Get involved with your life**: Read, read, and read some more. Get a real teenager job. Take care of yourself. Exercise. Walk — a lot. Practice mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. Learn stuff that helps brain development, like an instrument and a language. Take up a hobby like knitting, origami, historical research, or whatever strikes your fancy. Do more than schoolwork, social media, video games, and Netflix binging — not that there’s anything wrong with any of that, there just needs to be a balance. Take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally.

**Get involved with your family:** Be a leader in your family. Organize game night. Cook dinner for your family. Wash dishes. Babysit your siblings. Help with grandparent care. *A note about family responsibilities:* Some teens have to be at home every day after school to watch siblings while parents work or help with elderly relatives. There’s no way they can participate fully in other extended ECs. Not only do your family responsibilities preclude “normal” ECs, but they also show your dedication, commitment, and responsibility. Colleges want to know about this. Colleges know family obligations take precedence over more conventional extracurriculars. If your family relies on you to care for a relative, let colleges know. You can address this in the Activities section and then explain in more detail in the Additional Info section if you feel it needs to be addressed more fully in order for them to more fully evaluate your application.

**Get involved with your school:** Join a club or two, or start one. Or not. Just do something independently, like make a point to sit with someone new at lunch once a week, especially looking for the kids who are alone. You can figure out what your school needs and what skills and talents you have to contribute.

**Get involved with your community:** There are multitudes of ways to be involved. Even just taking the time to answer questions for your fellow applicants on A2C can be helpful. Here’s some mom advice: “If you’re ever at a loss with what to do with yourself, do something for somebody else.” Look around your community and figure out what the needs are, then begin to work on one. (Maybe check out[ www.volunteercrowd.com](http://www.volunteercrowd.com/) for some ideas). Here are a few suggestions:

* Help out at a retirement home or homeless shelter. Play games or music. My kids interviewed senior citizens about their lives at our local retirement home and then turned the responses into songs that they performed for the senior citizens a few weeks later. You could also write poems about them or make a story for them to share with their families.
* Make comfort bags for people who don’t currently have housing. In my family, we call these “Judy Bags’’ after my mom, who would always drop off food. Include water, granola bars, handy wipes, and anything else you feel could brighten their day and let them know someone is thinking about them.
* Walk dogs and play with kittens at your local animal shelter.
* Volunteer for an after-school program.
* Make sandwiches at your local food bank.
* Coach a kids’ sports team.
* Tutor for the SAT or ACT.

If you don’t feel called to volunteer, don’t worry about it. Use the time you would have spent volunteering to cultivate the activities that interest you. After all, community service is not about college applications, and it’s also not an absolute requirement for your apps. Do it because it makes others feel good, and it can also bring about some of those warm fuzzies inside you.

# 😹MAKE TIME FOR FUN

Filling your schedule with back-to-back extracurriculars just to pad your résumé is fun for exactly no one. You only get to be a teenager once. You should enjoy yourself and find activities that make you happy. And then you can figure out how to turn those into an extracurricular activity.

If there’s no club at your school that specializes in what you love, start one. “Club Founder” looks pretty good on an application. Look, you can also only list 10 activities on the Common App. Most students list fewer. So keep that in mind too. Don’t overload yourself needlessly.

If it feels like a waste of time, it probably is. Enjoy yourself and find the activities you enjoy. And that will also be valuable to your life regardless of what school you get into.[ Katie Mattlie from Georgia Tech](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) says “To be competitive, you should choose activities that make you **happy**.”

# ☕️ WORK IT, BABY

You’d be surprised at how far a good old-fashioned[ teenage job](https://admissionsmom.college/summer/summertime-vibes/) can go. There aren’t many students who work. And the ones who do often think it doesn’t count as an EC, but it does, and colleges love to see real job experience on your application. It shows you’re responsible and gives you real-world skills that a lot of students entering college just don’t have.

If you feel you’re lacking in your extracurriculars, I think getting a job is your best bet.

From scooping ice cream to chasing kids around at daycare to working unpaid (or paid) at your family’s business, jobs can only strengthen your application. By having a job, you are demonstrating initiative, responsibility, leadership, the ability to work with others, and a willingness to get out of your comfort zone. A job can be anything. You could work at a restaurant, a retail shop, an office, a gym, a bookstore, a public pool, a preschool, a summer camp, or an artisanal vegan cashew cheesery — the possibilities are endless. When filling out your activities list and resumes for applications, be straightforward and honest about what your job entails. Simply say what you do. If you work at a pizza place, include the hours each week you work and your job duties. Do you work at the cash register? Do you deliver pizzas? Do you make the pizzas? How do you interact with customers? Or if you work at a daycare, do you organize activities? Monitor children during playtime? Interact with parents? Facilitate the teachers with their lesson plans? Organize materials? Encourage literacy by reading books? Encourage problem-solving by playing with blocks? Encourage creativity by introducing open-ended art projects? A job might seem like nothing special to you, especially when you go to it all the time, but it’s often much more special than you might assume.

# 💖 BE A GOOD PERSON

Colleges are looking for applicants who care about themselves, others, their school, community and the world around them.[ In his blog, Jeff Schiffman, former Admissions Director from Tulane](http://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2018/01/this-will-look-great-on-my-application.html) writes, “I love reading recommendation letters about students who treat the cafeteria people with kindness and respect. Or the compassion some students show to kids outside of their friend group. These are the important things you do when you think no one, and no college, is looking.”

# 💫 CHANGE IT UP

What you do in your free time doesn’t have to be what you want to do forever. You’re allowed (and dare I say encouraged) to be interested in different things. That’s healthy. Just because you want to be a doctor doesn’t mean you have to spend *all* of your time doing “doctor” things. If you love hiking, great. Follow your interests wherever they are and don’t limit yourself because it doesn’t feel like a storyline cohesive to your goals.

# ✅ MORE SUGGESTED ECS — GLOBAL PANDEMIC STYLE

While there’s certainly some light at the end of this Covid-19 tunnel (fingers crossed), you might be wondering what to do if you’re still enmeshed in physical distancing and possibly even still working and schooling away from home. It’s ok at times to feel like you just have to “get by.” I mean it’s been a tough couple of years, and if you need to play video games, catch up on movies, while away the hours on Twitch or YouTube or TikTok for hours on end, do so, but then but I also encourage you to get out there and interact with your family, friends, school, and community, while taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally.

Eventually, you might even find yourself getting a little bored. Boredom can lead to great discoveries so allow it. And if you start looking for something else to do, I suggest a personal project. ***SUMMER TIP:*** *I always suggest to my juniors that they use the summer before senior year to get a job and work on a personal project so this is an opportunity for you to take the time to learn about and do some of the things that you just don’t have time to do during your busy life.*

**Read, Read, Read:** Reread your favorite books (Percy Jackson calling your name?) Read books you haven’t had a chance to read before (Tess of the D’urbervilles, Rebecca, Fahrenheit 451, Anything by William Faulkner, Ta Nahhisi Coates, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut, Ralph Ellison, Maya Angelo, or Jane Austen, or so many other amazing writers out there. I know my kids loved Robert Jordan when they were your age.) Added bonus: the best way to become a strong writer is to read — a lot. Reading will improve your standardized test scores and help you in every class —  believe it or not.

**Family Time:** *Family History Project* — Collect family stories, photos, and documents to create a scrapbook for your family to keep. *Become a Chef* — Learn to follow recipes and create homemade meals. *Chilling with Chores* — Do dishes and laundry ***without*** your parents asking you. These are the kind of tasks you can do with mindfulness by focusing on the task, or you can stick on some headphones or turn up the speakers and have a big ole Chore Dance Party. *Connecting with The Elderly* — Call and FaceTime with grandparents and the elderly in your life. They will be lonely and disconnected right now and will need you more than ever. We’ve been setting up family video chat times so everyone can catch up and the grandparents don’t have to be so isolated. *Family Game Night* — Bond your family and learn new games or bring out the old favorites

**New Hobbies and Projects:** *Pursue a hobby* you haven’t had time to explore before: Teach yourself Italian or another language that piques your interest, Learn an instrument like guitar and ukulele, Learn about Astronomy, Martial Arts, Gardening, or Chess. This is your chance to explore areas you haven’t given yourself time to explore or you can fine-tune some skills you’ve been working on all along. *Take an Online Class*:[ Ed X](https://www.edx.org/?fbclid=IwAR3t7rzEKkm_IQhQIyzdxRThcXSUMNvz1JVh3e5p_21VpCpJcX_odD_VijQ), YouTube tutorials, MOOCS, Coursera. *Learn Marketable skills:* Learn to code through[ Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree?utm_source=gsem_brand&amp;utm_medium=ads_r&amp;utm_campaign=747168229_c&amp;utm_term=39458666392_sa&amp;utm_keyword=udacity_e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6sHzBRCbARIsAF8FMpV80ldk0Xx7SKE3o3tkiWgjODAa9HFjZXgrxPrEtFDozeTYGFF_PVsaAmRJEALw_wcB) or Harvard CS 150.  Learn Excel — if you can help someone with an Excel Spreadsheet, you will forever be on their good side.

**Get Creative:** Find your artistic side: Draw, Sing, Cartoon, Dance, Paint, Collage, Write plays, Play and Write Music, Stories, or Operas

**Be Outside (Sunshine and Green Bathing are both great ways to stay healthy!)** Wear a mask if you need to, sit in the sun, take walks, bike rides, go for jogs

**Community Service and Volunteer:** *You will need to talk to your parents about these and remember to keep your health and safety a priority. Some ideas:* Childcare, Errands for the Elderly — make grocery store and pharmacy runs for those who can’t easily get out and about, Help out at food banks for those who are newly unemployed and need back up food, Hand out food or comfort bags, See if animal shelters need assistance

**Get a Job:** Amazon and Grocery Stores are both hiring if your parents and you are comfortable with your being in that setting. Fast food restaurants are still hiring. Or work from home and find someone who can use your skills.

**Journal/Diary:** Write. Write. Write. And write some more. I encourage you to find your voice and practice with it while keeping a record of what’s happening in our world right now. These are truly historic times and your children and grandchildren will treasure your thoughts and reflections about what it was like to experience this event as a teen. Also, bonus — these diaries and journals will help you find your voice and give you reflections and thoughts to turn to when you begin to write those essays.

**Learn:** Learn more about the history of our country and the human rights uprising that’s happening. I have a[ list filled with youtube videos, books, and movies here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trsRyrFX6s9iCLApbIYNWf6tzcm6L8pM/view?usp=sharing) if you’re interested. I’ve also written[ about it (briefly) here](https://medium.com/@admissionsmom/juneteenth-black-lives-matter-and-college-admissions-4ccf98f87959).

**Photos:** Make a photo journal of our changed scenery. As you walk around town, snap up photos of empty spaces, signs posted up, long lines at stores, empty shelves, masks, whatever you see around you. This will be a great way to document for yourself, your family, and others.

And remember it’s ok to just be. Sit still. Think. Chill and relax. These are historical times, and sometimes we need to just be with ourselves to process and understand what’s happening to us and our families and our friends and our schools and our neighbors and our cities and towns. Sometimes we just need to sit and breathe.

# 🤍 JUST KEEP BEING YOU

Mostly, remember it’s not exactly about the type of ECs you do — it’s more about your involvement. If you are enthusiastic, interested, and involved, then any activity is a good EC.

In the end, you gotta realize that extracurriculars are merely one part of your whole application. Do they guarantee admission to any particular school or set of schools? Are they the deciding factor between acceptance and rejection? No and no, because colleges that consider your ECs are looking at your entire application package and also at their own institutional needs, so there’s no guessing what’s going to appeal to any one school for any one year. If anything, learning about your activities provides admissions counselors an opportunity to get to know you better. That means you just have to keep doing you!

# 🐹 STEPPING OFF THE EC HAMSTER WHEEL

Most of all, enjoy high school! Explore and try stuff and take risks and change your mind if you don’t really like doing something. This is the time for you to learn about yourself and what intrigues, interests, and excites you. Don’t pin yourself into a box, thinking that there are only a few things you should be doing so that you — as a teenager — will become the expert. At the same time, don’t feel like you have to be Captain Every Club or President High School or have to join a whole bunch of activities to create a crazy long list for college apps. As frustrating and scary as it might seem to figure out what you want to do outside of school right now, it can also be an amazing opportunity for reflection, self-growth, and learning if approached with the right mindset.

You might have noticed that I don’t use that P-word here in this post. That’s because I think telling 14 and 15-year-olds, and even 17 and 18-year-olds, to “follow their passions” adds unintentional pressure. What if they’re not feeling any passions yet? What if they’re doing stuff that simply interests them? Or if they don’t even know what interests them yet? That’s why I encourage you to explore. Try new stuff. It’s ok to learn what you like and don’t like to do. There’s no shame in starting something and then dropping it when you find something that’s more interesting or exciting to you. Plus, I don’t think colleges are looking so much for that P-word in the way you guys imagine it anyway. They are just looking for authenticity — for you to portray who you genuinely are. Be your authentic self and try to lose the idea of who colleges “want you to be.” You, the real you, are enough.

# 🎙Let's talk about it!

Bring your questions and come talk about Extracurriculars and Activities with me and Ben Bousquet, the Assistant Admissions Director at Vanderbilt University! I'll be streaming with him TONIGHT, Wednesday, February 23rd at 6pm CST on my YouTube channel, Badass College Apps w/AdmissionsMom. ***You can find the link to it*** [***here***](https://youtu.be/o6vFzy_M_gk)***.*** Hope to see you there! (If you can't make it tonight, you can watch the recording at that link!)

# Tl;dr:

* Think star-shaped for your activities: kinda well-rounded with a few points or spikes for special interests you might have.
* A job counts as an EC, as well as some other stuff you might not normally consider like family obligations, independent research, and hobbies.
* Those Olympians, spelling bee champs, violin prodigies, computer whizzes, and cancer researchers are actually few and far between
* Figure out what interests you. Try new stuff. Explore. And then dive in when something sparks you.
* Be your authentic self. As Jeff Schiffman, former Admissions Director at Tulane says, “Do whatcha wanna.”

\*\*Stay tuned for posts in the next month or so about summer plans! Also, be on the lookout later in the summer or fall for a post about filling out the Activities Sections. (All those posts will be much shorter — I promise!)"

Apple has now reached out to me 5 months later saying there’s a team interested in me for an internship. But, I have full-time offers. Would it be possible to ask them to interview for full-time instead or should I just interview with them for internship and let them know if I get an offer? I’m kinda stuck on what to do here bc I also don’t wanna lose the opportunity of interviewing with Apple."

szmojx,1,2022-02-23,"Halfway thru bio major, considering CS switch- looking for advice",plantymcplants,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/szmojx/halfway_thru_bio_major_considering_cs_switch/,"Edit: I realize this is a lot of text, added a tl;dr at the very bottom!

Hi all,

Basically the title. I am currently doing a major in biology (plant-focused) and I am five classes away from graduating because I came in with a ton of AP credits. Right now, I am a sophomore in my second semester. Last summer, I scored an internship at a (somewhat prestigious) technological agricultural company. The first thing they told me to do (like, literally right after a tour of the facilities) was have me learn to code, specifically in R and Python. And- I loved it! My high school offered no CS classes, so I didn't really get the chance before then. The internship actually ended up being more data-science than plant science in the end, since I spent about 6-7 hours coding every day. I was still kinda bent on my PhD in plant science during the first half of my sophomore year, especially since my advisor told me I could definitely do it in about five years (assuming I started halfway through what would have been my junior year). I have a 3.9 right now, so that def helps.

But, I've been rethinking. I'd be 21 and essentially starting a PhD, which is kind young. Also, job opportunities (even with the PhD) require you to move around A LOT and they don't even pay super great- I'm not sure if that's the kind of life I want to live. I love plants, I'm good at plant stuff (lol), and I've really enjoyed coding and now I'm wondering what to do. I'm currently taking an intro to data science course (which mostly focuses on R), and I've been getting great feedback on my work from the TA and professor. I've also been involved in a research project here at school that has me analyzing things in R and using python programming. In addition, I have taken calc 1 and  2, which clears me of most math prereqs.

So here are the options I'm playing around with:

1. Double minor in data science and computer science: 10 classes total. Possibly use these as a foundation for a masters, giving me the leg-up I'd need to score a CS job.
2. Take a last-minute major in CompSci. Sixteen classes total BUT a lot of them require pre-reqs, so I may or may not graduate on time.

And to recap experience:

1. Internship with lots of coding (mainly R and Python)
2. Research project, little less coding, still decent
3. Data science class, strong feedback from TA/Professor

Questions:

1. Assuming I do go with this CS thing, what should I do?
2. Are there any online programs I should do to bolster my resume/chances?
3. Are clubs useful/helpful?
4. Am I dumb for even considering this?

I did try to talk to a couple CS majors at my school but I got (in order) 1. IDK 2. I've been coding since I was 9/12/blah and it is difficult for me so you would stand no chance 3. Ask reddit 4. Join a club, maybe? So here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I am halfway through a bio major and I'm wondering how best to pivot to CS with some experience "
szmsc6,15,2022-02-23,Internship pays minimum wage?,iScrubbed,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/szmsc6/internship_pays_minimum_wage/,"About to take on an internship for the coming summer, have one year left then to graduate with a masters in Computer Engineering.

Is it common to get minimum wage for an internship at this level? I expected a little more considering I had an internship with another company a while back which paid over.

Also, is it common in Ireland to see companies pay for masters?"
szn56n,1,2022-02-23,What is considered “entry-level”?,CulinaryGenius,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/szn56n/what_is_considered_entrylevel/,"I am a junior in CS set to graduate in May 2023 and I started an “internship” in November. I put that in quotations because it is more like a part-time role that will end either when i get promoted to a full-time salary employee or i quit/get fired. This means that upon graduation I will have worked there for about a year and a half.

Does this look better or worse than a traditional summer internship? If I apply to a job that wants 1-2 YOE would I technically qualify or would I still need to apply for entry-level positions (If I decide to leave my current company)?"

I’m fairly familiar with C based languages, JavaScript, HTML and SQL. I’ve heard a lot of what people do in the industry and various other things to do once I enter the workforce, but I don’t know how to get there. And so I figured I’d ask, how do I start? Do I just wait till fall to start learning in class? Do I need anything special to start? Anything free online I can read and do to start familiarizing myself with the actual practice as opposed to just general theory (extra emphasis on the do. Anything with feedback is helpful)? Is getting an internship while knowing absolutely nothing about cybersecurity viable or should I just focus on getting a general CS one? Is there a better place I should be asking these questions?"

La inceput faceam chestii simple, de inceput, iar de o luna si ceva am fost mutat pe un proiect nou, alt tech stack, unde echipa mea (frontend) e formata de mine si un senior, practic am responsabilitate mai mare decat ce faceam pana acum. 
La angajare am facut clasica greseala sa nu negociez, asa ca am salariul mic (un prieten cu internship are mult mai mult).
Cred ca e important sa mentionez ca nu se fac annual reviews in companie, marirea e pe logica ""nu ceri, nu primesti"".
Ce credeti, e prea devreme sa cer marire? In orice caz am cerut un performance review, sa stiu cum m-am descurcat.
P.S. Daca nu e impotriva regulior de pe sub, pot da detalii despre salariu in comentarii.

I was raised in section 8 housing because my parents were college dropouts and blue collar workers. I was also raised in a high cost of living area, so i always knew that college was necessary to survive, at least here. I don't know what i want to do when i grow up, never have. I know i enjoy some things, i know i enjoy learning, i know that i cant use my body to make money (i.e. physical labor in exchange for wages) forever. I graduated high school, went to community college, failed out because i didnt know what i wanted to do. worked really hard at every job i've ever had. Im not stupid, im not lazy. people tell me regularly ""wow youre smart"" for... i dont know what really. i impressed my coworkers at one of my first jobs with my work ethic and my speed of learning. my manager asked me to move with her when she started a new location of the company. (i now recognize, over 15 years later that) i ended up getting really depressed after failing out of cc because i knew that i didnt want to be in the cult but i didnt knwo what i wanted to do outside of the cult. i only knew work hard. i ended up quitting that job because of the depression, and i was just sick of ... life? I got a job at an airport. i loved it, i worked hard at it, i worked to learn every possible thing to do in that position. gained a friend because we had mutual respect for each other's work ethic and abilities. one of the managers called me ""my son"" because he liked the days i was there so much. i started getting depressed at that job because i cant do anything forever and i knew it. i got fired for failing a drug test (just cannabis) as a result of an accident that wasn't my fault got more depressed got a job at a restaurant for a while, hated it, thought i was bad at it, manager told me i wasnt but i didnt believe her. got a new job (thanks actual brother, and the only member of my direct family not actively part of the cult we were raised in) and have been there for 11 years. i love this job. i met my wife at this job. i was homeless during the end of the restaurant job and at the beginning of this last one due to my landlord missing mortgage payments and getting foreclosed. after a few years at the job i knew 1) i couldnt do it forever, 2) i'd need more money if i wanted to raise a kid to be better off than i was as a kid, 3) i'm smart enough to make it through a degree. I went back to community college, was good enough at that, so i transferred to a university. depression came back hard and i failed a few classes, almost one per semester, regardless of how many classes were happening. a different brother got fatally wounded in a car crash and died one year during finals and i couldnt go because i couldn't afford it. i still feel guilty about not going i felt like absolute shit every spring semester after that. i got so depressed fall ofmy senior year that i finally went to counseling and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. and adhd the following spring. then covid hit. school was basically cancelled. i never walked the stage. i have a degree but i still feel like I never finished because i never walked. i dont want much just a god damn internship i know im smart and capable enough to do it but i dont remember anything from my classes now, they were so long ago it took me like 6 years to get through the engineering degree. it was hard as hell. my gpa is less than 2.5 but honestly how much do you literally use from school in your every day work probaby nothing. somebody taught you how to do the job, and you did it. fuck this system of need a gpa to get an internship and you need an internship to get a job, and if you dont have an internship then you need a good gpa. well i couldnt' fucking get a good gpa you try doing that with depression and adhd and tell me how easy it is. all i need is a chance

please just give me a chance to prove myself and i will

im not stupid or lazy i jumped through enough hoops at the college level to get a degree just give me the chance to jump through some white collar hoops. i jumped through all the blue collar hoops, im wearing the 'golden handcuffs' at my job. i love the job for what its done for me but i... dont know man i've got a daughter now i need to do better becaue i dont want her to struggle like i did. its not fair. people in my same engineering program passed because they would get tests and homework answers from previous years students. i never got that shit. my groupmates in a lab discussed in front of me sharing a previous students lab work so they could get the lab done super quick, but didn't offer me a share why? if i had access to all the previous tests and homeworks, id have a 3.5 or some shit too. god dammit why is this so hard. sometimes i think my family would be better off if i just left them i dont want to do that to my wife or my daughter

I’m going through Big 4 recruiting and one of my recruiters reached out to ask me which practice I prefer and which city out of the two that I applied for would I want as my top choice.

I’m honestly not sure what I want to do. My concerns with Tax are getting locked into that practice for the rest of my professional career. Audit on the other hand could give me a chance to gain valuable skills that would offer a wider variety of career paths to choose from. 

I’m worried that audit is as bad as it is made out to be and that I’ll be miserable doing it and the pay is lower than other practice areas. 

I’d love to hear perspectives on both to help me decide. I’m usually a pretty decisive individual but for some reason I can’t decide."

I'm fairly new to the profession, and I was able to get signed onto a fairly well-known bank with high pay as an intern. It's been a few months, and everything is bureaucratic and slow... as an intern. I'm expected to be an intern for the next couple of months because there's a timeline of what to expect.

Because the work is very slow, I have been considering to apply to a second job at a local college to work at as a L1 help desk as full/part/temp whatever they give me.

Both jobs are remote, save for the bank one as they are beginning to push us into the office one day a week and then two in March.

I was thinking that because I don't have direct supervision whether I'm in the office or not -at all-, I've considered about investing in hotspot device to do second job whenever I am in the office. It'll be that I do second job on personal laptop while doing work on office desktop.

How honest should I be about my current job if this potential employer asks about my working hours and IT experience? How realistic do you think it would be working through my ""plan""?

I'm soon to be graduating with a degree I am realizing I no longer have any interest in and am looking to switch gears into CS, particularly cyber security which I have begun an interest for. 

As of now my plan for doing this is to get a low level certification that will hopefully get me into a entry level IT job and while working this job I will go for a master's degree in CS after taking whatever perquisites are needed to get in (I know this is likely easier said than done)

I'm curious if this is the best route to go or if there is another path I should take such as going for a second full bachelor's degree rather than a masters, earning more certs, or going to a boot camp and hoping to get an internship. 

I would like to avoid going for a second bachelor's if that is possible to due the cost and the time that it would take.

All advice is appreciated."

I also asked this question over at r/chipdesign, but I thought it might be a good idea to ask here because it's still relevant and I got good feedback on my last post. 

I'm a Junior Undergraduate EE student and I've recently become more interested in chip design. I have a few questions about getting into industry and what path I should take over the summer/moving forward. 

First, what should I seek to do over the summer? 

My first thought was to find an undergraduate internship with a company doing verification, design, or anything else related to the field. This is still what I think I should pursue, but I'm beginning to worry that I may have applied too late; I have seen a lot of information online about how you should start applying around November or earlier to tech companies, and I only started applying in late January/early February.

I may also have an opportunity to do undergraduate-level research with a professor who works in silicon photonics, so that's another potential opportunity that I haven't looked into much.

Second, I find a few of the Undergraduate Computer Engineering courses to be very interesting, such as a digital logic class, and a double major may not add any time to my degree if I do a masters degree (which I plan to do). I know that a masters degree is the entry-level degree for many areas of the field, so I was wondering how practical double majoring would be in the long run?

So my questions are:
1) in your opinion, should I look into other opportunities, or should I just be patient with my internship search? I really don't want to get stuck doing nothing over the summer. If you're interested, I don't mind sharing my resume via DMs. 

2) How valuable is a CE/EE double major vs. just an EE? Should I seriously consider that option, or should I just take the 1-2 courses I find most interesting?

Feel free to give me any other information about the field as well. 

I tried to keep this as brief as possible, so feel free to ask any questions if you feel like you need more information. Thanks!"

szwg3w,11,2022-02-23,Any Advice?,Dwight_sheute_attrm,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/szwg3w/any_advice/,"First a little background, I am a recent finance graduate with a strong resume with a bunch of job experience including an internship in real-estate, and a part-time gig throughout my whole college career with the Universitie's IT department. I graduated with honors in 3 years and consider myself to be well spoken and friendly.

I have made it to final interviews in consulting with KPMG, EY, and PWC which I thought all went well, but unfortunately got rejected from every single one. I am feeling a little discouraged at this point because I thought I have a stronger application then most and the partners/directors who I speak with tell me you're background is great and I get the impression that they will extend the offer but I still end up getting rejected. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I have applied to over 350 jobs and haven't gotten a single offer yet. I know you're not supposed to take rejections personally, but, I feel like at this point there has to be something wrong with me. I'm trying to keep my head up but honestly I'm extremley bummed out."

I have had a few interviews, all of them have gone extremely well and a couple offers have been made. But either they retract the offers when I tell them I can only work part time or the interview ends when I tell them I can only do part time. But if these companies are offering internships they must know that the applicants go to school. It makes very little sense to me. I have had a couple IT jobs and I'm trying to move up to something more challenging and I keep running into this problem. I'm seriously considering going part time as a student because I had one offer that paid very well and it got retracted. And ironically I told them up front I could only work part time and when I reminded them after the offer was made I lost the offer lol. Very frustrating."
szy5j4,9,2022-02-23,Amazon clout or relevant experience?,aj_Marcellus,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/szy5j4/amazon_clout_or_relevant_experience/,"I'm currently a 3rd year computing student, wanting to pursue a Product Management/Data Science role post-grad. I've been really lucky and extremely fortunate to receive 2 offers this summer, however, I've been really conflicted and have til the 28th to send in my final decision.

One is for AWS technical consulting intern and the other is for RBC (a Canadian bank) Amplify Data Science position. 

RBC is known for a really solid work-life balance, great return opportunity, and all-around stable work culture. The Amplify program is really entrepreneurial and structured like a 3 months hackathon for teams of 4. It'd be great to have a data science experience for a later PM opportunity, and just generally good to have more technical experience for an internship. However, RBC is not a tech company, and breaking into bigger tech firms later won't be as easy with RBC on resume compared to AWS.

AWS technical consulting intern is a relatively new role for the location I receive my offer. Each intern takes ownership of a small project under a team and works on both technical and management experience for the product. It's a great opportunity regardless, less technical and more people skills (which is what I really love), but the role might be less focused and more spread out to many disciplines. On the other hand, having AWS would be really great for networking later on!

Any thoughts would be really appreciated!"

I was recently extended an offer for Solutions Architecture Internship at a FAANG. I'm truly excited about the position but slightly worried as the role is not necessarily as technical as I was hoping for. I believe I want to start out as a Software Engineer full-time but unfortunately I recently switched degrees and am relatively late to the CS game. As such, if I was to get an SWE internship, it would most likely be with a small less known company. Is it feasible to get a full-time SWE position if my only CS-related internship would be Solutions Architecture? If I take the SA internship, I would plan to spend the next couple of months and the summer practicing leet code questions and building up a strong portfolio of projects to be ready for applying to full-time positions."

t01kio,22,2022-02-23,Creating a non-hierarchical counseling group within the hierarchical counseling profession,thestarlightcrystal,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/t01kio/creating_a_nonhierarchical_counseling_group/,"Context: I’m the owner of a private-practice counseling group that employs associate-licensed clinicians and interns. There are three fully-licensed clinical directors (myself included) who direct and supervise all activities. We are 100% private pay and offer low, income-based fees. This is a legal and common practice in my state. 

I worked in a similar organization when I was an LMSW. The director kept 80% of fees, made unilateral decisions, and was generally hated by all. I’m attempting to create a different design but am challenged by ethical concerns that have arisen from giving inexperienced interns power in the decision-making process. 

I only keep 20% of fees in addition to a flat rate that goes toward overhead. I desire to share power equally instead of those of us with clinical licenses being the “ruling class.”

Presuppositions: In the US we have very few examples (possibly none?) of large organizations that are not hierarchies. Power and wealth are held by the few while workers are exploited in the name of capitalism. There must be a better way that maintains our ethical duties and responsibilities without causing harm to one another. 

Inquiry: How do I move into a design that is a non-hierarchical “circle of support” and hold boundaries within the profession *without* just being another hierarchy with the facade of being inclusive?

Details and more context/ponderings:
I find myself so resistant to being the “overly-controlling parent” that I had, both in life and in my program, that I fear I may swing too far in the other direction (the permissive, “friend parent”).

My residency was directed by a fearful and distrustful supervisor who everyone perceived as “controlling father.” This created very sour energy and disempowered/exploited associate therapists. I want to be mindful not to become “friend parent” out of my own fear of that occurring and am doing shadow work with these parts. 

I’m also aware that we are embedded in a culture comprised of structures that tend toward grabbing and holding power, so my projection of “fat cat at the top” has been one I’ve tried incredibly hard to avoid, perhaps at times throwing out the proverbial baby (healthy, necessary structure) with the bathwater (centralized control/power).

I’m aware that not all power structures are “bad,” not all openness/transparency is “good,” and I haven’t seen many examples of a middle way that works well for entities comprised of individuals with differing levels of power/responsibility. Corporate America certainly isn’t modeling a middle way, and times when I’ve seen it work are within very small organizations (&lt;5). It worked for us when we were that size. As we continue to grow (currently 10, soon to be 12, plus me; two locations in a major city), I suspect we may have more issues with this. 

Maybe the answer is to stay small or franchise-like? Frankly, as we grow larger, our profit margins have become nonexistent and I’m currently bleeding some of my own income for the organization. I’m concerned the set up is not sustainable. 

We are also up against the overarching structures of our profession which are a hierarchical, caste-like system that is a nearly perfect mirror of the medieval guild system (credit to @stempsych for giving me this metaphor; hope I’m not butchering it). Apprentices (interns)had to work directly under masters (clinically licensed Ts) for no/measly pay before becoming journeymen (associate-licensed Ts) who could travel around working under the supervision of masters for who took a cut of their pay.

In my opinion, this entire system is flawed. I see the necessity for training and experience, yet can’t believe this is the best way. So, similar to how it’s hard to be a loving parent when up against unjust power structures that breed fear and its manifestations, it’s proving an incredibly difficult feat to design a non-hierarchical organization within a hierarchy. 

My gut is telling me we are going to need creative strategies outside the current paradigm that will require us to take some risks, be willing to make mistakes, start over and try again. My hope is that we can do so cautiously and slowly to minimize any potential impacts of such risks. 

I think our only chance of succeeding in our goal to shift these structures is to do so within a collective of trust, care and communication. Now, how to create that without being completely thrown off by the very natural, sometimes necessary, survival-based fear and judgment (the business must survive in order to serve).

Inner work for the win!

So, Reddit therapist think tank, I’m open to your feedback, challenges, ideas, concerns and perspectives. Thoughts? Is it even possible?"

I have heard the conversion interviews at google are pretty difficult.  


Also, from a career point of view is it better to work 4 months FT or 3 months Internship  


If I reject google right now, in the future will I have to go through the same process as well or will they take less interviews?  


Can I request google to offer me FTE directly based on the fact that I have FTE offer from another company

I have an unusual profile and wanted to hear your opinions. I’m applying to the following programs:

1. MIT Master of Business Analytics (had an interview but didn’t go too well)

2.) Harvard SM Data Science (rejected)

3.) ETH zurich Master of Data Science (rejected) 

4.) LSE Master of Data Science (rejected)

5.) Stanford Master of Statistics Data Science

6.) NYU Master of Data Science

7.) Columbia Master of Data Science




Here’s my profile: 

Age 24

BA Economics and Management - University of Oxford 2.ii (really poor gpa)

Bsc Computer Science Technical University of Munich (currently at 1.8 German scale, expected to graduate in August with something like a 3.7 gpa equivalent)

GMAT: 770

Work experience: 2 internships in the finance industry, 1 in data science consulting and one coming up in April in data science at Amazon. 

Extracurriculars: campus recruiting, admissions aid and Hackathon wins.

Having been rejected by harvard/eth/lse I’m really unsure on my chances at nyu/columbia. I also don’t think I performed well enough at interview to get into MIT, which was my dream school.

· Bachelor’s in CIS (with A+ Cert) and -4 years of combined IT experience (explained below)

· **8-month** IT Consultant Internship (Mostly just setup Office 365 email for mayor’s office and did some project planning for VoIP)

· **1 year** Student Help Desk (Worked for my alumni university \~2000 students. Our 12 person  IT department managed the entire university, so I did some of everything other than working directly with computer/network servers)

· **2.7 years** IT Help Desk (Current position. Our IT team consists of only 4 employees, so I’m pretty much the senior help desk guy. I mostly manage 4 computer labs and 2 classrooms (around 100 computers). I make sure computer software stays updated and license renewed each year. I also order IT supplies for the department. Otherwise, just standard help desk stuff. 

I'm currently studying to retake the Network+ and just started back studying Python, but that's it."

Due to my boss switching roles, a manager position has opened up and I am being offered the role. 

It is a significant pay bump from before (including bonus it can be up to $14000 Cad). With this pay raise the responsibility also goes up significantly. From almost none, to having the entire responsibility. 

I think I'm being lowballed due to my experience, even though the responsibility level is the same regardless of if I have 1 year or 5. 

If I don't accept the position they will need to look externally which will take time and then train up the new hire. In this time I will probably be responsible for these things anyway. 

Right now, all I'm asking them to do is come up on the base salary another few thousand dollars. Am I being greedy? 

I feel that if I accept the current offer I will be defeated, does this feeling pass? Has anyone else been in a similar situation?"

Most ppl I interviewed with never gave me any reason why I was declined, but I feel it was either:

\-They want ppl with University education?

\-They want ppl with several years of experience?

A few years later, a family friend offers to try and help me get a job in Web Design. I'm trying to refresh my memory on these concepts but I'm very rusty. Even when I was fresh out of school I felt I was very slow and not as good at coding as the others, but now it's so much worse.

On the other hand, I've been considering going back to school. Possibly for 3D modeling or animation. A fresh start, not so much baggage. A nice internship to get my foot in the door. And I really enjoy learning in a structured environment.

The company is a startup and has 10 people, looking to grow to 20. Their product has potential and will probably grow it a lot but I'm not sure about the scale the product can reach. They offer equity but I don't imagine they would sell or IPO so it is unlikely that the equity could be exercised (unless there are more methods?). 

Front-end is fun, and I think I will get to do some DevOps (probably small scale), but I don't know if taking this job will damage my trajectory -- sometimes engineers have a bit of a superiority complex and look down on front-end devs. I turned down an offer to do hardware design and this job is sort of the opposite end of the spectrum. I am getting a bit bored of waiting so feel inclined to take it, but I'm not sure if I should just wait a bit more. I don't have any internship experience and it has already been long since graduation (2021 summer) so maybe I should just go for it?

Sorry in advance for a long question. I figured for me to answer this question of mine, it is best to seek for help from engineers already in the field who have the experiences that I don't so here I am! **If you want to skip the story and go straight to the question I left the question on the last paragraph.**

I realized early on in my life the importance of what you aim for. What you desire further formulates your thoughts and actions and completely changes the trajectory of your life. I noticed that the disparity between the ""quality"" of students as learners and engineers are based on what they are aiming for. Some chase for grades while other chase for theoretical understanding. Though their results reflected in their GPA may end up being equal with 4.0, the quality and the difference in the depth of those students are astronomically different. Or at least that is what I have noticed. 

I'm currently working in a project based engineering team. While working with brilliant student engineers, I notice that there are few exceptional problem solvers that fundamentally approaches the problems differently and comes up with incredibly creative solutions and also able to visualize the system in their mind. I know that they got to that level not by mistake but its a result of their accumulation of certain approach to their life that led them to be able to be ""exceptional"" in this category which I greatly admire. I've learned that one of them has a incredibly deep understanding of physics which definetely is what contributed to his current ""status"". 

My goal in my life is to make an impact through engineering. I love being able to break down complex problems into simple solutions. I like following my heart and my heart is only greatly inspired by having grand vision and when I push my own boundaries. I would like to start a start up in area of electrified transportation few years after I graduate. Now I do not want this to be a naïve goal and end up as just a talk. I understand that for one to achieve those grand goals and ambitions, they have to have good foundations and be intentional with their approach that will allow them to be a person capable of reaching that goal. 

**(Question)** So here I am asking for guidance. Being in the industry and the experience engineer you are, what do you believe is the most important thing that a student in university can focus on that will provide them with the foundations to achieve the things that I aspire to achieve? I understand that now is a time for me to build the foundation. I want to be able to ask the right questions when I'm approaching academics, laboratory, internship during summer, and just all the experiences in my life that will allow myself to set myself up in the right trajectory. I'm willing to transform my lifestyle and everything for this system as this is my passion and I love learning. I know that depending on what you aim for, the viscosity of your time and how much you gain out of having the same experience will be drastically different. I would really love to hear some inputs on what you believe should be that thing that one should ""aim"" for after the experiences you have. I expect everyone to have different answers and just want to hear your perspective!

Thank you guys!"

TL;DR junior dev had a vision of him jumping off a building to end it all because of stress from a relatively small project. Decided to give up on career instead.


I gave up on programming after 1 year of getting a developer job. This is a long pure  rant, on how I gave up on myself after I had visions of me trying to self-harm for the first time in my life. 

I just freshly graduated in 2017. My final university project was a VR game made with unity. The project landed me a job at a company, and I was put to work on an unity app the company was contracted to do. This was a fringe project, nothing near their main projects, and most of it could be done in no more than 3-5 weeks but I spent 6 months on it because…well I had presented myself as a unity dev to my boss, and they had no other unity project, so I was just stuck there in limbo, maintaining and adding small features here and there for the client. Part of me was naive in waiting for one of my boss to come guide me, as I was still very new, but that part of me slowly understood. 

After 6 months, I felt extremely lost, lonely, deserted and felt like I have not learn anything coming to this company. My friend that had entered the company with me had moved on to another project. Before she moved on, she had done a back-office web for one of the company’s main project. Finally knowing that no senior is coming, I took the initiative to become the sole maintainer of this back-office after her to expand my skillsets and show that I am capable of learning and doing webdev. At this point, I have about 4 months of completely self taught frontend development from my previous internship in angularjs. I added features and maintained the back-office aimlessly for 2 months.

After 2 months of maintaining the back office, I took the initiative again, and this time I was given an important job on the main project. At this point, I was super happy, the project however created so much stress for me that it would become my last. 

The task was simple, there is already a main mobile app to this project, which is a chat-story / short story sharing platform. All of it is user generated content, and while the readers were having a great time reading it on their phone, the writers wanted a way to write their stories on their computers. So they tasked me with creating an text-editor on the web. All the apis were already all written, I just had to do the frontend, it sounded challenging but quite manageable.

At this point I had 4 months of front end experience + 2 months of nodejs / react from maintaining the back-office. The website was already up and running using .net core, with all the api already written, and some webpages using HTML engine. I figured the best thing to do is just  learn a bit of .net core, HTML rendering engine and get working on the frontend. 

I had initially projected to complete the project in 5-6 weeks, but I was deep 12 weeks into it and I was only 70-80% done. I don’t remember the details but I had spent a huge amount of time doing json parsing and trying to match the editor output from the web with the phone. I was completely stressed out, and remembered that one time the CTO came to me asking for my progress to speed things up and we had a small argument as I told him I couldn’t figure out one particular issue I was facing. He was basically asking why are you taking so long with this project. 

The pressure keeps piling up as I am super late based on my earlier estimate. Then one day, 12 weeks after I have started, the company brought in 4 web developers and I knew right away one of their first job is to finish this web editor. 

I was stressed, writing about this is giving me migraine, and I had reached a breaking point. It was the first time I experienced migraines while programming / staring at the screen as I was trying so hard to get things done and learn the project. I was under high stress for more than 10 weeks without realizing, and I didn’t know I was pushing my limit. One day, I wanted to finish the project so bad I pushed myself to think of what is left and try to plan it out before I go to sleep. That night, the feeling of being a failure, the stress and migraine all came crashing and I had a dream of trying to jump of a building so that it would all go away. 

I knew at that moment that was the end of this journey for me. The next morning, I gave my boss a 2 weeks notice, not having a job lined up, and not telling anyone except my girlfriend.

 I picked up coding again 1 month after that, writing a website with contentful and gatsby but I couldn’t finish. 

Then again trying to do react native app… about 1 month after that but not finished. 

All in all I have about 4 months a angular, 2 months of node/react, 3 months of vanilla js, 1 months of gatsby, and 2 weeks of react native.

To a total of almost 1 year of frontend development. And I barely remember any of it… and I have absolutely almost zero knowledge of any other stuff about webdev. Looking back, I never got project from start to finish and this is one of the worst things to repeat.

Always finish what you started, but also take care of your stress. Work is not stress. Work can be fun, exciting and full of meaning. Learning is also important. Fundamentals is also very important. A Very expensive lesson."

I keep getting emails about internships and job opportunities, but I ignore them doubting my abilities. I feel so lonely, and thinking about the future worries me. Sometimes I will think about ""death,"" other times, I overcome my social anxiety and become something in life.

Hi, I'd like some insight here. So I have the choice to either become an Electrical or Software Engineer. I already graduated with a Bachelors for Electrical and I might get an offer soon.

I am currentlyt studying Software though and just secured an internship for Software Engineering at a bank with the Director and she indicated that normally they hire their interns after graduation and at this point I think I enjoy Software Engineering more.

Would you or should I take the internship for Software that I'm positive will lead to a full-time position or should I take the full-time career Electrical Engineer position? Which do you think is more stable, offers more money , better quality of life etc."

I graduated in 2019 with a chemistry degree and in 2021 with a masters in physiology, all working towards medical school. Long story short, I’ve decided that a career in medicine is no longer for me.

**TLDR: Already have a BS in chemistry and MS in physiology and want to transition to be a SWE, get another BS in CS or a MS in CS?**

I’m now trying to figure out the best way for me to transition into tech. I’m most interested in working as a software engineer down the line, so at the moment I’m thinking about going back to my undergraduate university to get a CS degree. With the classes I’ve already taken there, it’ll take me 2-3 years to finish. On the other hand, I’ve read that a masters in CS could look better on a resume (and be quicker/cheaper) than another bachelors in my situation? I’m really unsure of this though and was hoping to hear some opinions on the best route. Also I’m in the US.

For what it’s worth, my ultimate goal would be to secure an internship during the summers while working on my degree - then get a SWE job working for a FAANG company after I graduate (easier said than done I know but hey shoot for the stars, right?). Also, I personally would rather get another degree than go the bootcamp route. My CS and programming experience is minimal at this point. I’ve been committing 2-3 hours a day over the past few months working through a web development and a Java course on Udemy and I did some python in one of my chemistry courses. I’ve always been interested in tech and have really enjoyed learning thus far, so I’m looking forward to throwing myself headfirst into this once I figure out my plan. Thanks for the input!"

My concern is that employers are going to value experience more than a postgrad degree. I don't really see the point of it, but my parents' arguments are that it'll be easier to move upward and people with masters degrees earn more (?).

t0r48f,1,2022-02-24,I've been trying to get diagnosed for years and I haven't been. I feel like nothing will ever get better.,IveGotIssues9918,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/t0r48f/ive_been_trying_to_get_diagnosed_for_years_and_i/,"I've had the symptoms of ADHD my entire life- so much so that, when I read about it in a pamphlet at the doctor's office when I was 8-9, I told my parents ""I think this is what I have"". Nothing was done about it, though, and I didn't hear about it again until a decade later even though I attended therapy all through high school and often came in near tears asking why I had missed yet another important assignment or let yet another opportunity pass me by. 

I started with another therapist when I was 19, the summer after my freshman year of college where I had to withdraw from one course and failed two others due to simply not turning in assignments or making it to class on time, and she was the one that said I might have ADHD. When I went back to school for my sophomore year, I started working with the counseling center on campus to get diagnosed (I remember they gave me a whole packet of in-depth questionnaires about my history that I had to fill out), but after something traumatic happened a week into the semester, getting diagnosed with ADHD stopped being a priority for me. My priority was surviving and getting good grades, and I was doing that, using the same maladaptive coping mechanisms I used to get through high school- distracting myself with my elaborate daydream world, procrastinating and then pulling off amazing feats at the last minute, and believing that if I just white-knuckled my way through this the next phase would be better. 

I did successfully white-knuckle my way through the semester, getting As in all of my classes, but the next phase was not better. I had a breakdown shortly after turning 20 and getting help for my ADHD became a priority again. I was again working with the resources on campus, and I was supposed to go for neuropsychological testing in April 2020, funded by the school. Of course, due to COVID, that didn't happen. I left campus for ""spring break"" and never returned. All my classes moved online, and with ADHD combined with the stress of living in the epicenter of the pandemic and losing my grandmother to it a few weeks in, I didn't attend any of my online classes and failed 4 out of my 5 courses (2 were ""incompletes"" that turned to failures when I failed to make up the work). I decided to go on a leave of absence rather than try to deal with online classes while being on academic probation, and I thought that, during that time off, I would be able to get diagnosed and treated. 

The nearly 2 years since then has just been a flurry of specialists that didn't work out for whatever reason- stopped taking my insurance, turned out to not be qualified to duagnose me, etc. etc. There was one facility that I saw two different specialists at for *over a year*, trying all kinds of medications that made no difference, while I kept pressing the issue of ADHD before finally being told that no one there was actually qualified to diagnose or treat ADHD in adults. I was supposed to go back to school last fall, but because I wasn't at all ready and hadn't done most of the things I actually needed to to go back to school, I asked for an extension and was granted it.

My current dilemma is that I've been searching for an ADHD specialist for the past couple of months and finally found a facility that claimed to do ""evaluations"" and took my insurance plan. I went to see them two weeks ago and the doctor barely even spoke to me. He just handed me a referral for neuropsych testing, and when I asked if they had a list of facilities I could call, told me that I could just find one myself. Well, I literally *cannot* find a facility that provides evaluations for ADHD and takes my insurance plan. There was one close to me that says on their website that they take my insurance, but when I tried to set up an appointment, they told me that they don't take my specific plan. I tried using my insurance company's ""Find Care"" tool and only found neuropsychologists that evaluate for things like TBIs, not ADHD. Literally everyone that evaluates for ADHD only takes out-of-network benefits (which I don't have) or is fee-for-service, and the fees are literally thousands of dollars. I was on a full need-based scholarship for college, so I obviously have nowhere near that kind of money.

I'm supposed to go back to school in six months, but I won't be able to attend school while not being treated, especially since I'm now fighting an uphill battle because of my failures (I would need to take 6-7 classes per semester to graduate in the 4 semesters I have left covered by financial aid). I can't get a job while untreated- I lost an internship because of my symptoms, and at my last job (as a political canvasser) I frequently had to call out due to waking up too late. I can't do that at any other job and not be fired. My dad said that I can't live here anymore if I'm not in school or working by the fall. He's basically saying that I just need to learn to live wirh my symptoms, but I *can't*. I *can't* white-knuckle my way through life the way I did through high school. The only way I got through high school was by thinking that the next phase would be better. I won't be able to do that when I'm 40 and living the same miserable life. I can't even do that now. If I don't get treated, I will never marry, never have children, and probably won't be able to have any kind of social relationship. I'll be alone forever, using fantasies to fill the void the same way I did when I was a teenager. I can't live my entire life that way. I would rather be dead than live like this forever.

Please help me."

But everything else is just detailed explanations of how to construct make files using various different software applications (at some point it'd be good to learn all that, but right now I just need to finish the specific task I've been assigned as part of my internship) or uses C#, which I'm not familiar with.

My project lead already has everything set up to use Unity, so, for right now, I just need to need to understand how to use ""TEST_GROUP"", ""TEST_GROUP_RUNNER"", ""TEST_TEAR_DOWN"", ""TEST_ASSERT"", AND ""TEST"" well enough that I can understand that section of his code well enough to make minor changes and write very similar code.

And yet, I can't seem to find anything that just explains how to use those specific Macros or _any_ of the Unity macros except for the few specific assert ones mentioned on throwtheswitch.org.  I'm guessing it's either buried somewhere in the detailed explanations of how to set everything up that I don't have time to wade through, or, more likely, I'm using the wrong search times.  I've used multiple variations of ""how to use Unity test framework with c/c++"", ""how to use test groups in Unity test framework"", ""Unity test groups explained"", and ""Unity test framework syntax"".

Edit: I also tried Googling ""list of Unity test framework macros"" and found [this](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity/blob/master/docs/UnityGettingStartedGuide.md), which is kind of helpful, but still doesn't actually explain how the correct syntax for specific macros or precisely what they do.  I guess basically, I'm looking for something similar to the entries on cppreference.com, but for the Unity macros instead of the standard library functions for C++."

Over the years of me working there many people have come and gone and while I was hired there were 3 people for triage and 3 people for lab. I am now doing both of those jobs plus sterilizing instruments plus getting consults together and many other little things no one else wants to do. Basically I am their scapegoat. I work hard and thought it would pay off but I get paid $10 an hour and I got a $200 bonus as my “thank you”for Christmas. I have worked full time ever since I graduated from college. 

Now to the problem I have been in ortho assistant school and am set to graduate in a month. I am at my breaking point at work I am juggling doing all 3 jobs no one else helps me with. My instructor told me we had a better chance of being hired elsewhere if we volunteer there. Initially I was going to do my hours at my job and I asked Dr. j if I could get more hands on at work he agreed and all was well. Except I never got pulled or showed anything. 3 weeks went by with nothing shown to me. I want to practice what I’m learning in class so since they weren’t giving me the practice I looked elsewhere. 

I got an internship and let my office know I would not be able to work Thursday morning due to my volunteering. At first they said it was completely fine but then the next day Dr. J was upset and furious I “had looked elsewhere and had options” I told him I didn’t have time at my job since I’m always so busy and no one had pulled me so I took matters into my own hands. Suddenly I was freed for my duties and would be volunteering at my job Thursday morning instead of elsewhere. Knowing I did not want to stay there I wanted to secretly still volunteer at the other office (S) when my office was closed. I went to volunteer at S and when asked where I worked I was honest. I told them I worked at J’s office and nothing was weird.  

Later on I see the manager get DrS and they pull me aside basically telling me that in order to avoid conflict they need to ask Dr J if he’s okay with me volunteering there. Dr J is now informed of the situation pulls me aside and said he was hoping to have dibs on me. He was visibly upset but basically pathetically gave me his permission to volunteer at S office but I know I won’t get offered a position there now given the situation. I am set to volunteer at another office (Dr H) next week but I’m scared the same thing will happen and everyone will get mad at me again but I am so tired of everything I am desperate to leave I am tired of being overworked and disrespected. 

What can I do? How do I make sure the same situation doesn’t happen at Dr H office? If I don’t get any positions offered to me what’s the best thing I can do?"

- Take the administrative side and develop the needing areas (HR, communication, marketing…) and support others managers 

Or

-  Continue at the finance area, work with her but I’ll have to do some courses to improve my knowledge

There will be no salary change, and it will increase because of my results

I have a strong interest in data analysis, and I see in the finance area more ways to apply data visualization, sql that is very required nowadays to any area… but I’m also very creative and can contribute a lot in this area as well

When we had this conversation I started to search for some MBA studies, and found the MBA in marketing very interesting because there are some strategic topics that requires analysis too

And now I have this big question in my mind, what should I go for? Because I see that even in some marketing roles there are some finance aspects like planning, forecasts, etc.

Should I accept the finance and do mba in marketing, and after I finish it try to transition internally?

Countertransference?

My mom died about a week ago and even though we knew it was coming, it still has been really difficult. I am struggling, and I miss her so much. 

I am in my last few semesters of my program and I am doing my internship in a program that works with older adults. I have taken some time off naturally but I’m definitely worried about how things may go upon my return. Especially from a countertransference standpoint. How do I continue showing up for my clients without a) projecting my shit all over them? b) not bawl my eyes out after every session? I made a mistake and called a client to let them know I would be out due to a family emergency, and nearly lost it just leaving a voicemail. 

I really do love working with this population, and can see myself doing this type of work going forward, so I don’t want to completely switch what I’m doing. 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you.

I got some great feedback. Which was helpful and thought provoking. 

UPDATE. Today was my first day back seeing clients. Whooo boy…that was really difficult and draining- both good and bad. Both sessions went well, but man I had a lump in my throat the whole time. One of my clients said to me that she “was proud of me as a student and baby therapist.” That hit me hard because I'll never hear, ""I'm proud of you"" from my mom again. 

I cried a little after both, and in supervision today. I am proud of myself that I kept my composure and stayed present with my clients, but acknowledged my feelings at the same time. 

Just had to get it out there. Thank you!"

t0vn6b,2,2022-02-25,First AI/ML job after university graduation didn't as expected,lacifuri,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t0vn6b/first_aiml_job_after_university_graduation_didnt/,"This will be a long post, read if you want to, and thanks for your time deciding to read this. 

TL; DR: I'm a fresh mathematicd grad with a strong math, logic and programming skill, but lacking working experience and designer skill. The job description is becoming more irrelevant of what I expected it to be after working for a few months. 

I'm a graduated student with a Bachelor in Mathematics, recently graduated from August last year. I have so much passion in Math and always wanted to use it in a more applicable places. So I think switching from pure math pursuasion to AI in industry suits my need (still respecting pure math academic researchers, I just couldn't bear with it under some personal reasons during college). I also gain some experiences during my internship in an AI related company. To give you more background, I have a very bad designer sense, my art is bad, and I always couldn't judge whether a design is good or bad. I just have a very robust math skills and wanted to use it in CS field. 

So now my first job is in an AI startup developing 3D fitting room applications. The reason I accept this job is because they initially are doing a landmarking model to calculate body measurements from an image. I'm totally into it since it could broaden my experience in computer vision, and until now I've already developed a model architecture for this purpose. I'm very proud of this particular landmarking project because it works very well!

The problem now is because of my bad designer sense, we are running into more and more design-related problem. One functionality of our application is to accept user-input image for inferencing. For example, we will receive a T-shirt design from Uniqlo, then unwrap the image into 3D editing software to view it in 3D-tshirt. We will expect to see a reconstruction of this particular T-shirt in the 3D viewport. I'm using my deep learning model to inference the landmarks of important features, such as the edge and corners of the T-shirt, then use it to unwrap to our desired pattern so it will show correctly in the 3D viewport. Since the image input are irregular, after the unwrapping there is often an issue of bending strips, distorted logo and other possible problems. Our solution is to keep adding more landmarks to solve these distortion problem. 

I'm becoming more frustrated after these, my model is working very well at predicting the landmarks, but we always need to try many times to find out the final version of it, because of my bad designer sense. My job now is more of dealing with these design-related issues and keep re-do things rather than doing some proper AI model training and research, which flatten my confidence and start to make me think do I did anything wrong? I feel like our procedure is extremely inefficient and will bite us back eventually, it is even worse when I know that, deep down, I don't know how to solve this inefficiency. Moreover, I also feel it is bad for my personal growth in this career path, I'm keep sticking with the same issues everyday and seems like there is no way out of this.

I'm starting to think about switching job, hoping another job will require less designer sense and really make me do more AI related or even frontend/backend/logic related problems. But I also feel bad to my coworkers and my bosses because they are really nice people to me. 

Do you encounter similar situation as me? How did you come up with a solution?"

t0wei3,4,2022-02-25,URGENT: Maintenance man insists on coming over and I'm feeling uncomfortable,StressedOut1998,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/t0wei3/urgent_maintenance_man_insists_on_coming_over_and/,"I don't know what to do. I'm scared and I'm feeling invaded and uncomfortable. 

I (24F) recently moved into an apartment. This is the first time I'm living in a complex like this. Upon moving in I realized there was issues with my stove so I reported it to the landlord and he said he'll notify maintenance and he'll come back to me.

I need to stress that I'm living alone in a country where crime against women (and crime generally) is very common. Often r*pe cases won't even be pursued by the police due to ""lack of resources"".

So after reporting my stove, I haven't heard anything for a week. No issues I have a portable stove and oven so it's not the end of the world. But then 7:30 pm I received a call from the maintenance man asking if he can come over to fix my stove. I told him that it's not a good time because I'm in my pajamas and it's late.

But he was really persistent... So I told him to just leave it and that I'm okay because of my portable stove. He then said ""But I have to come anyways to remove the nails in the walls. I'm aware of the nails, I moved in with them there. But I told the landlord I'm okay with it, and I can actually use it to hang up some lights and he said it's okay.

I told the maintenance man this, but he insisted he come over to remove it, because it's ""policy"". He said if he can't come by tonight he can come by tomorrow morning. I told him it won't work because I have to be at work. He finally gave up and said ""Okay I'll get back to you and we can agree on a time.""

As soon as I hung up I went into a complete panic. I phoned my parents and broke down, not knowing if this is normal and if I'm just over reacting. My parents told me that they'll send a text to the landlord explaining that I don't want someone to come over late at night or when I'm not there, since I live alone and they please have to wait for me to contact them. And that they can only expect me to contact them from March, since I'm busy with a mentally and physically taxing internship. I leave home at 6am and only come back at 5 or 6pm. But after my internship (First or second week of May) my hours will change and I'll be available for maintenence things. 

A week's gone by and yesterday while at work the maintenance man called me 3 or 4 times. I ignored all his calls, as seeing his number on my phone made my stomach turn. Last night he tried calling *again* after 7pm. But I was busy studying so I moved it out of my mind.

This morning 5:30 am I received a text from him saying that he needs to come over to fix my sliding door (I don't even have a sliding door) and to paint my walls? Which I just can't understand because my walls are newly painted already. I replied almost exactly that, and instead of replying..  he tried calling AGAIN. I freaked out and didn't pick up. After a while I texted him saying that I can't take calls because it's too early and I'm still getting ready for work.

I can't take it anymore. I'm so paranoid and it's freaking me out. I couldn't sleep last night because I swore I heard someone mess around with my door... but I don't know if it's just my anxiety talking.

Is this normal behavior for a maintenence man? Am I allowed to deny this man access to my apartment? Or are they allowed to enter the apartment regardless of my wishes? Because they work for the complex or something? 

Please PLEASE any advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm losing my mind or something. I'm exhausted and losing sleep. Am I over reacting? I'm going to my parents for the weekend because I need to sleep and feel safe. My boyfriend also said he'll come stay with me for a week or two when I come back.... But it still feels surreal.

I'm scared to be at my apartment and I've been hearing strange noises lately in my kitchen and living room. But like I said, don't know if it's valid or if it's just paranoia."
t0wi7q,7,2022-02-25,Recent college graduate feeling stuck. What do I do now?,Eternal_Nightshade98,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/t0wi7q/recent_college_graduate_feeling_stuck_what_do_i/,"I am a 23 year old that has just completed my communications degree and I think reality has just hit me right in the face. My overpriced degree is nearly worthless.

I've always had big dreams for myself. Through school, I was always overlooked and underestimated, so with the ""I'll show 'em"" mentality I took my big dreams and studied a niche and extremely competitive industry. I actually did fairly well in my degree. Graduated with a summa to my GPA, learned the trade, loved it for the most part, but by the end, I still had no idea what section of that career I wanted to work in. Each possibility requires connections I don't have or doing unpaid work for a chance to get a connection that could eventually lead to the connection that could be your big break. But the thing is, I live in a small state in a remote area where this kind of job is not common and the few companies that would have something similar to this job would severely underpay a new hire and I have bills and looming student loans to pay. Moving to another state is almost essential if I don't want a job in government work, finance, or marketing but the cities where this job would be prominent are incredibly expensive and competitive for a small-town dreamer with a mediocre resume and I've realized I really would hate living in these extremely expensive cities.

I can't find a job with my degree. Crap. I've made a fatal mistake.

But the thing is, I desperately want to move. For most of my life, I have been obsessed with moving out of this middle-of-nowhere type of state to a city. My family has never had a lot of money, so I had no choice but to pile up student loans and settle for going to a local school and living with my parents so I could both study and work to save money to move.

So now that I've graduated and thought my options through, there is one thing I know I love unconditionally and that's reading and writing. I thought to myself, why not a career change? And in my spare time, I can work on my art and maybe go back to the career I originally wanted. So for the last few months, I had my eyes set on editorial work in states I would like to relocate to. Most companies don't specify that you *have* to have an English degree and I thought a lot of skills from my coursework, most of which involved intensive writing, and office-based internship would still be transferrable. Two months have gone by, dozens of internships and entry-level editorial assistant jobs I've applied for and nothing. Crickets. To an embarrassing degree. The real kicker for me is when I applied to a very small-time publisher, which is probably the only one in my state, for a position as a glorified administrative assistant and was rejected the very next day. If I can't get an editorial job for a small company in my state, then I really don't have a chance to apply to all these big-time companies, do I?

Every job I have applied to in these other states I want to move to has yielded no results. I understand that a lot of jobs aren't too keen on hiring someone that needs to relocate, but then how the heck do I hear about so many people moving to other states all the time and working and having everything work out so well for them?

So I have looked at other jobs in the area. All finance or legal or something I really don't want to do. They all offer decent pay but of course, require an insane amount of experience for an entry-level job or a different degree. Every time I scroll through Indeed or LinkedIn, all I see are life-draining jobs that I would not enjoy or be good enough at. I don't want to settle for a random job in this area then become stuck to it for the money and think every day how badly I want to move.

It feels like I have hit rock bottom and I have no idea what to do or where to go. I am twenty-three years old and still live with my parents while everyone my age already has their own places, found love, started families and I live like a sad little recluse at my parents' house as a full adult. On top of that my expensive student loan bills are breathing down my neck and all I have to pay for them is my minimum-wage retail job where half my check will go to paying my private student loans--and this is before the federal student loan repayment kicks in! My biggest nightmare is that I am going to end up wasting my twenties and my life doing minimum-wage work to pay my student loans and end up stuck in this state forever.

I need advice. I need a lot of it. I wish I had crushed my own dreams before I got myself into this but now all I can do is try to salvage the time I have left. Are there any careers that can be easily switched into that aren't difficult like engineering or finance? At one point in my life, I said I would never have a math-based career but now I am beginning to wonder if I can provide for myself, move to a city, and not have to worry about money so much in a career like pharmacy. Will I have to go back to school? Is there anything someone with broken dreams and only a little bit of savings can do? Please give me the honest, brutal truth. I've been living off those spoon-fed lies of 'you can be anything when you grow up!' and 'if you work hard, you can do anything you want!' I've worked hard. Very hard. And look where I am now."

Now by the needs of the company I had a call with the VP and she offered me two positions to choose:

- Take the administrative side and develop the needing areas (HR, communication, marketing…) and support others managers 

Or

-  Continue at the finance area, work with her but I’ll have to do some courses to improve my knowledge

There will be no salary change, and it will increase because of my results

I have a strong interest in data analysis, and I see in the finance area more ways to apply data visualization, sql that is very required nowadays to any area… but I’m also very creative and can contribute a lot in administrative area as well

When we had this conversation I started to search for some MBA studies, and found the MBA in marketing very interesting because there are some strategic topics that requires analysis too

And now I have this big question in my mind, what should I go for? Because I see that even in some marketing roles there are some finance aspects like planning, forecasts, etc.

Should I accept the finance and do mba in marketing, and after I finish it try to transition internally?

What are your advice?

I’ll be very appreciate for your help."
t125qa,63,2022-02-25,Four months on Methylphenidate. I am on my way to becoming whom I was supposed to be.,njoe159,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/t125qa/four_months_on_methylphenidate_i_am_on_my_way_to/,"I was undiagnosed until the age of 28. Ever since middle school, I have been barely scraping by the skin on my teeth to complete my education. As a 9-13 year old, I was transferred through multiple classrooms, given the competitive academic demands of my country's education system. No teacher wanted to tarnish their academic records because of my grades. Somehow I completed High-school with slightly above average grades and then finished college a year later than my peers.

I've had an impressive portfolio of jobs across fields which I discontuned within months. I got dissatisfied easily and took decisions to quit over minor incongruencies. It sure felt like I had been handed every opportunity that Regular people work hard towards achieving and I just let them slip by without a second look.

One amongst these opportunities was my Master's degree program. I struggled and took my sweet time with it, but managed to earn my degree eventually.

'NOW WHAT?', I think to myself as I contemplate an impending sense of doom. I had a weak portfolio, bad grades and gave up on phenomenal internship opportunities. I knew that if I continue this way, I might end up homeless, jobless, and an addict. So I took it upon myself to try and solve the most important problem in my life that I had been putting off for years.

It was difficult understanding ADHD, unlearning and relearning my identity, getting help through therapy, psychiatric appointments and getting my prescriptions filled. Yet, soon the work that my counselors and I put in started to pay off.

I could feel my behaviour changing. My definition of normalcy started to change and ultimately, I started to gradually become a more focused and productive individual. It was as though I was picking up a whole clutter of information in my mind and organizing them into labled folders.

It was hard work and required all of my emotional and mental energy but things started to fall into place. In these three months, I have managed to secure a well paying job, finish a few courses that would advance my career and started writing a paper.

I still don't know what the future holds for me but I can say with certainty that I'm not stuck in the past anymore. My present is filled with opportunities for greatness and my future looks promising. Perhaps someone else in my position would find my life mundane and burdened with responsibilities but for me, the ability to take up challenges and come through with them has become a driving force.

Take your pills, guys. They will show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes."

&amp;#x200B;

These two departments both have admin access to the entire system/network but cyber security falls under the security department and whereas we handle IT issues not related to security.

One of the many things that Cyber Security handles is password recovery and password resets. Namely if you forget your password you have to march yourself down to cyber security's office and face them in person to get your password reset.

&amp;#x200B;

The upside to this is that any issue related to passwords *isn't my problem*.

""He got logged in just fine, it's just me""

""Well Karen I think you're going to have to walk down to cyber Security to get your password reset"" I explain.

&amp;#x200B;

""BUT I ALREADY CALLED YOU! WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT FOR ME?"" she shrieks. I swear I can hear her across the building.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry Karen, Cyber Security handles password recovery, don't forget to take your company ID when you walk down to cyber security"" I explain.

&amp;#x200B;

""At MORON Corp. the IT department handled password recovery over the phone, Why can't you DO IT?""

""Well Karen, here at stupid industries only cyber security can recover passwords"" I explain.

&amp;#x200B;

""But they said they would write me up if came in another time to get a new password, Can you please do it for me?""

""Well Karen I don't know what to say, But you're just going to have to go down to cyber security""

&amp;#x200B;

""I""ll have your job for this you pimple faced nerd!""

She proceeded to use some naughty words before hanging up on me. I wrote it up as a ticket in the ticket system and closed the ticket out, making notes of the time she called in and her abusive language.

That afternoon my boss calls me into his office.

""Karen in the Bean Counting department?"" I ask.

""Uh huh"" he mutters. He looks it up on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

""OK let's listen to the call log"" he tells me.

&amp;#x200B;

7-8 minutes later we are having a laugh about it and he emails the head of the bean counting department the call log from the IT-line.

We also had a call into HR about her abusive language over the phone.

t17j1i,4,2022-02-25,"Goldman Sachs vs ARM for Summer Internship, which one is better? How has your experience been?",liberty_financebro,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/t17j1i/goldman_sachs_vs_arm_for_summer_internship_which/,"Hello everyone, I received an offer from Goldman Sachs for their Summer 2022 analyst program at their Dallas (Texas) office last week. I was also interviewing with ARM for a summer internship (finished the final round) at their Austin (Texas) office, so I told them that I've got an offer deadline from a competing offer. However, ARM said that the hiring manager is on leave and I will hopefully get to know the decision only about 2 days before the deadline that I've got for my Goldman Sachs offer. 

So, considering the case where I've got both the offers, which one would be a better one to go for? Also, in terms of working there as a full-timer after the internship, which one would be a better one to work for?

Also, maybe if you've worked (or been working) for either of those employers before as an intern or a full-timer, how has your experience been?

Here's what I know about Goldman and ARM so far:

1. The (Dollar) amount paid by Goldman in Dallas is almost the same as what Microsoft offered in Seattle (plus what Goldman is paying worth even more because the living expenses in Dallas is way cheaper than Seattle (like the cost of living in Seattle is 44% higher than Dallas) according to Nerdwallet: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/dallas-tx-vs-seattle-wa](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/dallas-tx-vs-seattle-wa). As far as I know, people who work in Dallas usually live in Forth Worth and end up saving much more (and if I compare Forth Worth to Seattle, Nerdwallet says that Seattle is 70% more expensive than Fort Worth: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/fort-worth-tx-vs-seattle-wa](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/fort-worth-tx-vs-seattle-wa))). I'm not sure about how much ARM will offer to pay
2. The career progress in Goldman Sachs is faster.
3. Goldman Sachs is known for the intense work and not having a reputed work-life balance.
4. ARM is known for their good work-life balance (they've even got the best place to work title or something).
5. ARM has got some interesting work, while I don't know much about Goldman as most of their software tools are for internal purposes, except for Marcus (which is cool too)

Please help me decide. Thanks in advance!"

t18y7z,468,2022-02-25,I went from 0 lines of code to Google in a year,AnonymousCSRantAcc,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/t18y7z/i_went_from_0_lines_of_code_to_google_in_a_year/,"I really feel like you can do anything as a CS major, and although my story isn't standard I think there's some value in it.

I went to a business school for a semester fall of 2020 and hated it. I had never written a line of code but I happen to learn the absolute bare bones of python in one of my business classes. After a semester of continuing to learn Python and researching CS/Data Science, I decided to pursue that path. My school sucked for CS, I was warned by the upperclassmen, and overall I didn't like the small school vibe so I dropped out in the second day of the spring semester.

Months with nothing on my plate, I decided to dive into projects and leetcode. Somehow I managed to get an internship at a local small tech company doing web dev (React and C# [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net)). Honestly I think the company made a mistake in hiring me, but it played in my favor and I was able to learn fast enough at the internship to keep pace.

An important note is that when covid hit a year before, I spent a lot of time reading self help books, working out, meditating, building good habits, and I think all of that was key in keeping myself disciplined and motivated to learn without a formal academic environment.

For leetcode, I read a data structures and algorithms textbook and did a problem or two a day. Easys were a struggle at first, but eventually, I got to the point of comfortably doing mediums.

Also, I am lucky to have parents that we're able to let me grind away in my bedroom rent-free for a few months. I did keep a part-time job just for some cash flow but most of my time was learning to code and making YouTube videos. That doesn't mean I wasn't reading books, rolling a TON of Jiu Jitsu (got a blue belt in this time period), and visiting my friends to party and hangout at their schools. You can grind AND have a well-rounded life.

When internship season came this last fall I was a CS student at a large state school taking intro to CS, calc 3, linear algebra, physics, and intro to computer graphics. I applied to a ton of companies, did a few OA's, but pretty early in the process I had an interview with Amazon and I got the offer. I pretty much stopped the grind after that because classes were becoming too much to do while leetcoding heavy. I did get denied from General Motors, FaceBook, Capital One, and a couple other's who's OAs I failed.

In January I got a Google OA months after applying and went through the interview process. I did apply with a referral from someone I interviewed on my YouTube channel.  I got in. After only intro to computer science which I hadn't even finished when I applied.

There is a lot of luck in this story with the good parents, local internship, and other little things, but I want the moral of the story to be if you really grind anything it is possible. I think that the luck sped up the timeline, but that so long as I grinded it out I would have been able to make it eventually.

So thats (in very broad strokes) how I went from 0 lines of code to Google in a year (and a half-ish). I am picking Google over Amazon. The offer expired while I was in project search so that was nerve breaking.

Ask me anything.

The DSA book was Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich."

t19o1w,1,2022-02-25,I feel inadequate at work and guilty after getting promoted to Junior,calm_mind99,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t19o1w/i_feel_inadequate_at_work_and_guilty_after/,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for advice how to get over feeling so unexperienced and constantly having to ask for help.

I'm currently working at a company as a Junior developer. I recently got promoted to junior from Graduate developer about 2 weeks ago. I've also worked at the company on an internship, in the past, during my 3rd year of university and somehow I managed to received a graduate offer. Prior to this promotion, I worked as a graduate for 6 months now and unexpectedly got promoted so soon. Although I'm very happy that I got this promotion, I feel like I don't deserve it.

Normally, I would pick up a work item/ticket and get the job done really fast with very rare mishaps. Everything was good, I was happy and I got the job done on-time. But recently, my team leader personally assigned me to a task I was very unfamiliar with. He said it would be a pretty good challenge for myself and to work on something I'm not used to working with normally.

And early-on, while working on this new requirement/feature, he gave me that promotion. Working n that requirement, I was just so lost. I misunderstood the requirement description, I constantly called my seniors and asked for help. I felt so bad annoying them constantly. Everyday, I would ask for a call and ask for help with the requirement **assigned to me**. In the past, I rarely ever did so. If I did, it would be a simple short 5 minute call. Now I'm taking 30 minutes to 1 hour of their time.

My Pull Requests are filled with comments after comments for refactoring from my team lead. I've got so many questions to ask but always so afraid to ask them because I didn't want to waste their time as they have more important things to be doing. Sometimes, my lead would have go into my branch and update the code themselves. I felt like he was getting increasingly more agitated and I get it too. They shouldn't have to reiterate something more than once for me to understand.

I get stuck in a dilemma where I want to show that I can work independently and make code changes myself but every time I commit my changes, my team lead asked why I even made that change as it wasn't even necessary or the incorrect way. But also, not wanting to constantly ask questions every second and take so much of their time.

My team lead's a great person and always ensures the work is done to a good standard. He's always so nice to me. I'm very thankful he gave me a job offer. But these past few weeks on that new requirement, I just know he felt annoyed at my work. I just don't want to disappoint them and am trying my best to grow, and make sure I don't make these mistakes again. I keep thinking to myself ""I don't deserve the promotion, I was fine as a graduate. I didn't mind at all"".

Has anyone been in this situation before? Please, can you offer some advice on how to get over this feeling? Maybe I'm just ranting at myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

Kindest regards"

I was in college for about 2 years working towards a Software Engineering Technology associates degree. It was tough, especially balancing a restaurant job and internships at the same time. I feel like I didn't really get anywhere in the field and it made me feel very down about myself. I'm super interested in computers and have built several, two for myself and a couple for friends as well. I'm just computer savvy in general. So, I thought software would be where the career and money is at. I had two internships, one that was application development (it was very boring and I did a lot of tedious work.) And the other I was data science. Which I've heard is a very hard field and I just had no idea what I was doing half the time. Felt so terrible about myself that I kind of gave up on software engineering altogether. I feel like I don't have the mind for it. I am pretty close to finishing my associates degree, but I recently got married and moved, so I was a little too busy. Plus I have a new job. (Don't wanna give too much away but let's just say I throw packages very early in the morning and for the rest of the day.) It makes money but I'm miserable. I hate this for myself and I hate this for my wife. I need something that will make me feel happy, proud of my work and proud of myself.
I've been looking around the IT world just for some ideas since I already have some computer stuff on my resume and I noticed CompTIA A+ (and others) helping people out a lot. I know I'd have to study and take the plunge and commit but I just have no idea where to start or if I'd even like it. I've already invested so many hours and money into stupid college and I just don't want to make another mistake. Should I try to continue on software engineering or should I see what IT has for me? 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated! And if you happened to not understand me please ask any question. Thank you!

Edit: I'm an incredibly hard worker and can be very social. I'm also interested in pursuing other certs."

First time posting here but been a reader for a while.
I live in the US now but I’m from a different country. While living abroad, after a couple call centers as CSR I managed to land a role as part of Access Management Team for a MSP that had GE(General Electric) as their main campaign.
Pretty much lots of AD groups and users, Exchange 2010, ARP, iDM, and all the lingo that I can’t remember much no more. This was about 8 years ago….

Currently:
After becoming an American citizen I decided to go back to school. Did GED in less than a week, and went for a Network and sys admin associates at my local college (Texas).
Im half way thru it now and I managed to land a 20ish/week paid internship (after being referred by my CCNA professor) as I guess Helpdesk/solo type of guy at a small mom and pops company. My internship mentor  is in a diff city and pretty much have access to Meraki (Desktop Central), AD, and all the jazz that helpdesk gotta do.

I guess everything has happened really fast for me and I’m still trying to see where I’m at.
I should be going for my CCNA this summer, feel very confident about it. I was told by my internship mentor to try to get the windows server admin fundamentals, which honestly as far as I can tell seems pretty easy.
My plan is to finish the degree and since idk how long the internship is(wasn’t told) just stay there until I feel confortable enough to apply for sys admin roles.
What do you think about my career path? Am I in a good direction? 
Any comment is much appreciated."

t1hakf,1,2022-02-25,"What to choose first, job or relationship?",JaclynDaniellez,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/t1hakf/what_to_choose_first_job_or_relationship/,"I'm having this dilemma right now because I don't want to sacrifice a good job/career, but also don't want to choose money over my long term relationship that could easily be promoted to marriage. We've been together for about 2 and a half years and I can easily see myself with him for the long haul. I am a senior in industrial engineering and engineering management, and will theoretically be graduating in one more semester. My boyfriend is going to be graduating one semester after me as a mechanical engineer. However, I have a nice set up to get a co-op (internship but longer, summer+fall in this case) starting this summer. But that means that I will not be able to graduate next fall, and since all those fall classes can't be taken in spring, I would be moving my graduation back a full year, have a nearly empty semester in between (unless I chose to work for a full year before graduating) and therefore would be ending my financial aid for that last semester and/or ending my loan grace period by being below a half time student. I think I would have enough money to make it after working a decent co-op for 8 months, so that's not such a huge deal tho. 

The main goal is to find a stable job at a good company, while not having to live across the country from my boyfriend. But what I'm wondering is, should I postpone my graduation for a co-op and have my boyfriend graduate before me, or should I decide to graduate asap, and throw away the co-op opportunity, and graduate first? This all majorly affects which of the two of us needs to change their after-graduation plans according to the others, so idk what to do. He will likely have more opportunities than I, because he's smart. But I'll likely have more flexibility with where I can work because Industrial engineers are very versatile and needed in lots of places, he's more niche. He is assuming that we won't be able to work it out right away and might have to live apart for several years first (not like a street away either), but I know how that goes and I would rather die because I can't see that working out. I don't know if he is right about those assumptions or if he just feels that way because of his specific experiences growing up.

I would greatly value some opinions on what you think would be best to do. I need to decide to give up the co-op quickly if I do decide to do it. Please help"

t1hrd6,1,2022-02-25,Having a hard time finding the point.,SkinnyButJiggy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/t1hrd6/having_a_hard_time_finding_the_point/,"What's the point of all this? Billions of people on this world, and everyone seems to have a direction. A dream, a goal, a talent, a choice, or even luck. Not saying I have none of these things, but in the end, what for?? Am I just supposed to continue fighting in this world full of death, depression, divorce and disagreement? The further I look, the darker it gets... but I have too many hard ties currently to take my life right now. I'm (24m) years into depression now, so I love learned to manage the day-to-day ""sad thoughts"" and what not, yeah it sucks and can be fatiguing sometimes, but don't nobody wanna be around a crybaby all the time, so soaking those up and turning them into humor or pseudo-optimism is the new norm. 
I've failed any chance at a career... I wasted my life chasing a dream of playing professional sports that fizzled out without me putting up too much of a fight, and the worst is I put all of my eggs into one basket. No internships, no fall-backs, nothing. My reason why?? Because I believed at one time ""if you found yourself putting energy on more than one thing, that one thing you want will fail because you lost focus"".... yeah lol I was one of those 😂 I have a whole college degree that I haven't used whatsoever, I work a dead-end hourly wage  job, and with the job competition out there right now I feel like i have to choose between doing illegal things to make money or kill my body (that's already trashed from sports) working 2+ jobs to try and make myself proud doing something I couldn't respect doing because at the end of the day I won't be satisfied, as I failed the original goal and plan that I wasted the first 22 years of my life chasing. 
I either haven't been good enough, or can't seem to align with any potential life partner as well. Its not that I've ever had a problem acquiring one, but I feel like if I haven't known a woman for 5+ years already, if I can't prove that I'm not a minimum six-figure dude that isn't a rapist and isn't a man but also does manly things but also let's her be independent but also can be there for her but I can't expect her to be there for me because I don't think anyone has honestly ever really known the real me. I've gotten close... theres a few people who I've told 99% of my story to, but either because of trust or some other reason I can't let anybody all the way in. People don't even believe in relationships anymore I feel. Everyone wants multiple partners without ties, I actually was blessed to have a very big family. And not ONE of them has had a good marriage. The one couple in my entire family (aunt &amp; uncle) who is still together split up for 3 years because my uncle cheated. My father has divorced 4 times, my mother can't find a good man to save her life and she's almost 50. 
Around every corner is someone waiting to trap you for your money, attention, or time. 

So really... what's the point behind living another lifetimes worth of years (and possibly more) filled with a life of pain, fake love, constant thirst for money that chases temporary highs and permanent heartbreak? Worthless things do not hold or gain value with time, so I have a hard time waiting sometimes, but I know its necessary. I have too many people counting on me in one way or another at the time, so I have a couple years before I can disassociate myself enough to make the actual move without a drastic domino-effect following. This leaves me in this bland, black-and-white feeling of a life, in which I feel nothing, have no direction, don't want to move, speak, or live, but do all three in a necessary loop in order to keep surviving day by day. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have happy moments. There are great people around me that do great things that I can genuinely appreciate and acknowledge, but unfortunately that doesn't change the outcome of my own demons/shortcomings. The people around me have been the reasons that I haven't made any rash decisions and ended things too early, and it took the early suicide of a dear friend for me to realize that I couldn't put people through that pain this early on, but still... I know that one of these days I will have reached my limit of being able to fake this content-ness, and finally find out what happens after we die, but until then... I'll be trying to figure out the answer to the title of this. 

If you read this, I hope you have a great day, and I hope there was a little sun in the day to brighten your day, even if it was only for a bit."

I have applied to over 100 places.  Most ghost or reject. I have an interview next week for a really great company but am worried I will fail and my life will be over as I will have wasted the one opportunity I was given.  It will be my first real technical interview.  I have been practicing LeetCode over the past year, and really love some problems but struggle with others and am terrified I will choke and fail.  I am also nervous about the behavioral interview, as I don't have many good projects or experiences to talk about.  Practically speaking, I have no friends.  I did do an internship the summer after graduating high school though.  I just had an interview for a code tutoring job and got rejected, and feel awful.  During the interview, I was physically shaking as I tried to speak because I was so anxious.

Anyway, do y'all have any advice for other places I should apply if this place doesn't work out?  I am thinking that I might have a better shot at smaller local companies.  It seems that all of the large companies with internship programs are full by now.  I will add that I got a 774 on CodeSignal, and have come very close to cracking the 4th problem and think I can with some more practice."

I'll be getting my associates this May and I'll be working on my bachelor's next fall. I keep reading everywhere that the best way to get your foot into the door is to start with help desk or customer support.

Is there another way to break in without doing help desk or customer support? I'm not trying to sound antisocial but the idea of dealing with strangers back-to-back for 8 hours a day sounds incredibly exhausting and not good for my current mental state.

To be clear, I don't mind working with others, but customer support doesn't don't like a place I would thrive. I wouldn't be able to take that kind of battering on a day-to-day basis.

TL;DR: Customer support doesn't sound like a place for me. What are the alternative ways to break into the IT field?"

From September last year, I have been applying to about 130+ internships of various companies with a main focus on web developer and software engineer. I have an adequate amount of knowledge of web developing (HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, SQL, PHP) and programming languages (mainly C++ and Java) and did publish some personal projects onto GitHub. However, what I got were just rejections from the companies even though I pretty much fill my resume with everything that I have (programming languages, courses, projects, gpa (3.9), ...). Would it be because I don't usually include my cover letter when apply for the job or just that I'm missing something important (I don't have any prior internship)?? Can anyone give me an advice on what I should try to do next (I'm also currently learning some courses on Udemy and Coursera to get some certificates). Thanks a lot!"

However I found out thanks to a friend she was on Badoo as single. Commented on other boys pics on insta, I liked one of those comments she placed and commented the exact same underneath a random girl to see how she’d react. Now she’s told me it’s just a friend and I’m in the wrong for not trusting her. I feel like if I let her do her own thing she’d cheated on my ass. Wouldn’t be the first time. Anyway I feel like shit, my life’s going to shit. My grandad is diagnosed with 2 different types of cancer and my internship is pretty demanding.

Outside of education, I’ve had one internship but I worked as a continuous improvement engineering so nothing that was software engineering related. 

My plans for this upcoming summer are still undecided but I haven’t gotten an internship as of now. The plan I have for now is to grind LeetCode for the next year as I won’t be graduating til May 2023. This way I’m already prepared for these technical assessments and interviews. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips for what else I could do to increase my chances of getting a post grad interview?

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang - 8.5/\`10: taught me virtually, I did very well in her class (like I might've been the best student, I was scoring close to 100% on final essays and timed writes), she liked me a lot and helped me start a speech and debate club

AP Bio - 9/10: taught me ap bio in 10th grade and biotech in 11th, here's how I knew she really liked me: AP bio has 60 or so kids (across 2 periods) and each year she selects about 5 to present the class in the informational meeting for prospective students for the next year, these students are generally her favorite or the most high achieving and I was one of those students

Referee from AYSO - 9.5/10: this guy knew me since I was 9 and brought me up through the program (he works as an executive at a biotech firm so he knows how to write), he went over all of his bulletpoints he was planning to write about, and all of them were solid

Manager from Internship - 8/10: he wrote my letter kinda late but he knew me very well and I performed nicely in the internship, my managers offered to write me referrals for future internships but he went over what he was going to write about and they all showcased me well

Counselor - 8.5/10: she knew me since freshman year and loved me, treated me like a nephew

**Interviews**

I had 5 interviews total, but all of them for RD schools, so I don't have anything to write about here

**Essays**

9/10 personal statement:I started over summer, personal statement was about my sister/family and understanding her struggles growing up in a traditional family and our different interactions with culture

I had a private counselor who gets a lot of good results every season so my essays for every supplemental were like 9-9.5/10 - I had a lot of iterations and met with my counselor multiple times a week to go over stuff

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* EA Purdue - CS
* EA UMD - CS with 50k Presidents Scholarship
* EA Wisconsin-Madison - CS
* EA UIUC - CS (uiuc doesn't have EA but it's like a priority deadline)
* EA UVA - CS (college of engineering, BS not BA)

*Deferrals:*

* EA UMich - CS through LSA (BA not BS)
* EA Georgia Tech - CS
* EA Northeastern - CS

*Rejections:*

* ED CMU - IS not SCS
* EA UNC  - CS

Waiting: Mcgill, Uwaterloo, All UCs except ucr and merced, SJSU, Cal poly SLO, Northwestern, Rice, Vandy, Dartmouth, Penn, Cornell, JHU, USC, Duke, BU (all RD) - will make a separate post once RDs come out

**Additional Information:**

The goal was to go 1/4 with UVA, Umich, Gtech, and UIUC. Going 2/4 (no rejections so it's really like 2/2) is an absolute dream. I got super lucky with this. Still a little sad over CMU since it was my dream school but hey UVA and UIUC aren't bad at all. UNC was fine to take an L on since they take so many in state kids so that's life. Wrote LOCI for mich and GT but not Northeastern since I got into purdue at the time and I wouldn't have gone to Northeastern over Purdue. Lesson here is EA helps a ton so apply EA everywhere you can.

Note about my counselor: she hard carried. She helped me find and create some of my better ECs, and really helped with my essays. Without her I wouldn't have gotten into uva or uiuc. I had a lot of help."

I am student who is still learning.

In future, I want to get a role where I work at interaction of sales &amp; marketing, finance and actual Programming too. I love all this fields as per my interest.

What are some good working options?

And what are best learning pathways for me?

I am planning to learn full stack web developement with more backend focus, data science, digital marketing and microeconomics and finance fundamentals for this. Computer science and programming have honestly sparked a great curiosity in me. I have became very interested in different areas of  cs. I want to build applications using all my knowledge. 

Can someone comment upon my learning outline?

Is this too much?

 I think I will be ready to work as junior dev by mid of next year. Will be Ready for internship by end of this year.

My primary motivation for now is money (I.e. high paying job. Willing to work hard for it. Not much into work life balance temporarily.).

Goal is to become very competent at one field while having good basics and big picture skills.

Received OA2: Feb. 17th 2022Finished OA2: Feb. 17th 2022

Received Interview Survey: Feb. 18th 2022Scheduled Interview: Feb. 25th 2022

Just finished my virtual interview today. Was asked LC Medium (like many people I believe). LP questions part was a breeze and I saw the interviewer nod his head several times (good sign?) whenever I gave my answers and he only had to ask for clarifications twice.

We jumped into the coding question after about 10 minutes. Managed to give a solution that runs better than brute force, but not the most optimal. Also missed an edge case and did not fix that since I was pretty nervous and my brain cells were running out by the end of the day. Only noticed afterwards that the edge case was really simple and I could've easily written that on the editor if I had just chilled out for like 10 seconds.

Interviewer did mention there was a linear-time solution but there was only 5 minutes remaining and I couldn't piece it together in time. Linear time solution was also pretty easy too come up with if one had not seen the problem before and went through the solution I showed first (but 5 minutes wasn't enough for me to see it unfortunately).

I'm feeling pretty uncertain about my chances. I feel like the obvious edge case I could not fix would not be a huge deal since it's easy and missing it may be seen as just nervousness, but I'm not certain if missing the optimal time solution would have a huge effect.

Anyone else who did the interview felt the same way or had the same experiences in the final interview? It's going to be a long weekend of waiting, so I figured I'd ask to see what my chances are based on what everyone else says.

Couple of extra points/questions:  
1. I also heard some of my friends say that at Amazon, if you don't get a rejection the next day (regardless of it's a business day), then the odds are that you'll receive an offer. Does anyone else know anything about this?

2. If you received an offer for SDE intern, were you ever asked near the end of the interview questions such as ""when can you start?"" or ""you have at least one semester remaining after the internship, right?"" One of my friends asked me if I was asked any of those, but I didn't, so now I'm even more uncertain of my odds."
t1picl,21,2022-02-26,My university journey: from coding noob to getting multiple offers,rahulkpandey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t1picl/my_university_journey_from_coding_noob_to_getting/,"This is the story of how I came into college without any real awareness of software engineering, and I came out 5 years later with multiple offers in hand. First, let me acknowledge that I had a bunch of privilege going to Stanford -- I had access to internships and career fairs that gave me tons of learning opportunities that other folks didn't have. But, I hope the lessons here are applicable to everyone who's on the journey of becoming a software engineer. 

**Internship #1** \- My freshman year, I took 2 intro CS classes (Java and C++) since that's what everyone was doing. At my school these courses were extremely well taught and actually fun, so I thought I was ready to contribute in the ""real world"". But sadly 2 intro progamming classes didn't prepare me (at all) as a real-world programmer.

I had applied to around 50 companies and was ghosted by almost all of them. Of the 5 or 6 that got back to me, I quickly failed all of them except 2. I only got the internship because some startups were desperate to hire interns right before the summer, and I happened to be one of the students who hadn't landed a gig yet. The startup paid $20/hour and used Ruby as the programming language. I wasn't equipped at this point to quickly learn a new technology, so I failed miserably during the internship.

**Internship #2** \- After my sophomore year, I had a better idea of what it meant to be a SWE, but I mostly still had no idea what I was doing. This time I applied to around 50 companies and got 15-20 interviews, which at least was an improvement over my first year. The company I ended up interning at primarily used Java, which I was excited about since I had taken not one, but TWO classes in Java. 

However, I had another rude awakening that summer about my deficiencies -- I was overwhelmed by the codebase, and I had no idea how to work with the version control used (Subversion). This internship paid $25/hour.

**Internship #3** \- I finally reached a point in my CS major where I got more confidence with programming. I started getting to the final round interviews (still failed most of them), and I believe I ended up with 3 or 4 offers. This was the first summer where I actually contributed something meaningful. 

I built an internal dashboard to track the popularity of various search queries. I wrote cron jobs to access the data warehouse, Ruby to script out some data munging, and then a JavaScript front-end to display some pretty charts. Getting this to all work together was a huge confidence boost, but the main missing piece from the summer was that I mostly worked on my project in isolation. I was missing the ability to collaborate with a team of professional SWEs. This internship was a significant bump in salary, $40/hour plus housing. 

**Internship #4** \- After years of failing Leetcode-style interviews, I finally started to notice the patterns and gain more confidence. I finally got the big tech offer I wanted, spending my summer at Facebook as an engineering intern. I also felt more confident as an engineer (which, as we all know, is actually a distinct skill compared to passing the engineering interview). I was able to quickly learn Hack (similar to PHP), and Mercurial for the version control, and deliver production code on my team that summer. 

This was also, by far, the best internship experience I had. The culture and perks at Facebook were amazing, and it also paid well: $6800/month + housing in the Bay Area. Getting the return full-time offer at the end of the summer was probably one of my happiest days from college. 

# What I Learned

1. **It takes time** \-- I was very clearly dead wight for the first 2 years of my education. I'm sure many of you can become competent programmers faster than me, but truly becoming an expert as an engineer will take **years**. 
2. **Failure is ok** \-- Whatever success I had, I can attribute to not being afraid of rejection. I actually hacked my mindset with the mentality that, if I wasn't failing at least half the time, I wasn't being ambitious enough. Remember, you only need to get one job offer!
3. **Teaching and building are critical** \-- I owe a lot of my confidence in my later years to becoming a TA for the intro CS classes. I also \*finally\* started building my own side projects in the last 2 years of school, and I learned more doing those than I did in any class. 

I'll stop there to prevent this from becoming too long. But I'm happy to answer any questions or share other insights from my experience!"

I haven't heard back from a lot of the companies, a few of them rejected me. I have experience with javascript, react, react/redux, python, django, flask, python image library, some aws stuff, etc. I don't go to the best school (UCSC) but I interned at my a company as a developer in 2019, and I've had a code tutoring job since 2017. I also have a personal project on my website, a 3d car web game. It's basically a 3d model of a car and some cubes. The car can move and you can push the cubes with it. I think my project is pretty good for showing people my web dev abilities but I'm not sure if it's enough to impress recruiters. What's another good personal project I can do, and what else could I do to increase my chances of landing an internship?"
t1sv99,1,2022-02-26,Need help deciding on a college for CS,Zubyking,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/t1sv99/need_help_deciding_on_a_college_for_cs/,Two of my options are an almost full tuition scholarship at UTD or just going to the university of florida. If i go to utd i’d only have to pay 1k yearly excluding books since i would commute to the school. The university of florida has a much better ranking but i’m wondering how internships for cs are over there and if major tech companies are interested in it. Scholarships for UF come out in about a month but even then money isn’t TOO much of an issue. And which school has the better computer science courses and teachers?

However, I also received a spot for exchange studies at a prestigious university overseas. Worth mentioning is that my uni only has one spot for this exchange which is kind of wild… I can only do one of them since the dates overlap. 

How would you prioritize these opportunities for maximum benefit while searching for full time positions in the future? Any thoughtful comments are well appreciated, thanks!"

Also for reference, with my family’s current financial situation, if I do choose Georgia Tech or Purdue, I would probably be graduating with around ~60k to ~70k worth of student debt, which isn’t too too much and my first job (considering it’s CS) will probably pay higher than that. But obviously with UF, I could probably make money through college with internships and stuff. So I just want a few other opinions/thoughts on this situation that factor in cost effectiveness, program prestige, networking opportunities, internship opportunities, and startup/business opportunities, and social life as these are the things I value most in my college experience."

Does anyone have experience converting at either company?

However, if I had the choice I would strongly prefer to just knock out the last class in the summer and start working as a junior software engineer in the fall. The only reason I am still considering the internship route is because I don't think I know enough or qualify for a junior position yet, and think it is much more likely that I will be offered an internship over a full time junior position.

I'm looking to go into web development, and so far I know CSS, HTML, and am currently in Data Structures and took intro to comp sci where we learned/are learning java. I've also seen a lot of web development internships I'd possibly want to take in the future expecting fluency in certain programs and languages, but all in all, I really don't know how to approach this.

I heard that intro to cs and data structures projects aren't really impressive on a resume, but putting down those classes is a start, and that the real importance comes from AI projects, which again I have no idea whether or not that would be useful to me as a someone looking to go into web development, and still have enough knowledge to be able to have another CS job if web development doesn't work out for me.

And as for extracurriculars, I haven't done any yet, I've had a hard time balancing a current family situation so I haven't been 100% involved and I feel like that's making me more confused because idk if I'm behind on something or on track :/ - I plan on joining Hackhers and Women in Computer Science next year though

Sadly I failed in IB recruitment (that industry is very small and super competitive in Canada) and didn't get any interviews for B4 M&amp;A jobs either.

So I'm wondering how easy it would be, and how long it would take, for me to make the move to M&amp;A given that I was hired for the audit practice. For further context, I was even quite honest about my intentions in the interview, saying that I was still interested in deals/valuation work but wanted the audit job for the B4 ""culture"" and to help me get my CPA as easily as possible (given the firm's ""world class CPA training program"" and other kool-aidy stuff).

I moved 2 hours away to pursue a career at an artisanal bakery. I graduated from college last year with a BA in graphic design and studio art (yes yes I know fucking useless but it’s what I’m good at) but COVID cost me several internship opportunities, and my foster mother’s sudden passing derailed me personally. I decided to switch career paths to baking because it was her trade and it was something I was talented at and deeply passionate about.  I have worked at several tourist attractions and restaurants with high production rates so I knew what I was getting into when they told me they were a production facility (IMO a little contradictory to being “artisanal” but whatever).

I was a massive fan of said bakery, and I would make pilgrimages out from where I originally lived so that I could take home some of their bread and pastries. I deeply admired the quality of their goods and felt so strongly about wanting to learn their secrets and techniques. I saw that they were hiring and I applied. They took 2 months to call me and offer me a job—$12 an hour, with guaranteed 40 hours/week and a GUARANTEED raise at the 3 month mark. I noted that the starting pay was much lower than I was expecting, but driven by my sincere love and passion for the art and the idea of this job, I decided that my desire to work at this superseded my need for money. I just wanted to do fulfilling work—I wanted to make art, nourish people, do something pure that I could really feel proud of.

Well, fast forward 3 months—I’ve sold some clothes and my furniture, moved from a pretty affordable small town to a slightly more expensive college town (still not bad, with a double income household). My fiancé gets hired by the same bakery at $14/hr since he has 10 years of food and fine dining experience. He is put in charge of prep/delivery for this “small business” (which, unbeknownst to us, has 7 mini like outlet locations somehow) but is tasked with basically every single job under the Sun. This leads to him getting screamed at on a near daily basis by the store owner (people call him a CEO, idk if that’s even remotely correct), who, on our first day of work, has to brag about some custom several thousand dollar bamboo fly fishing pole he had custom made. Okay, I thought, kinda weird that you’re telling me this but sure man, whatever floats your boat. He lets on about his property ownership around town, and it becomes apparent to me that he’s exceptionally well off, and clearly wants to brag about it (he has a habit of driving his employees to see his massive house while ON THE CLOCK just to brag). It’s around this 3 month mark where things started taking a turn.

In order to keep up with production demands, my fiancé ends up working 50-75 hour work weeks. I never see him, and when I do, he’s beaten down and exhausted and a husk of a human. This massive amount of overtime pisses off my wealthy as hell “CEO” and he lays my fiancé off, saying that he’s just too expensive to keep. We’re devastated but attempt to be understanding of the situation. In his stead, boss man hires 3 college kids to replace my fiancé, all at $8/hr. This greatly impacts the bakers’ production as, surprise surprise—these kids aren’t getting paid enough to give a fuck about the BOH staff.  Laying off my fiancé made my rent near unpayable, so I have to work every hour I can to make up the difference between us.  Not long after this happens, my CEO comes in while I’m attempting to finish my shift, and he spins this 20 min yarn about a cowboy hat he “accidentally” spent $900 on because he was drunk. 

I keep ignoring red flags like this, until they hire this assistant manager who is just downright verbally abusive. She’s OBSESSED with currying the favor of said CEO and is just insufferable to deal with. She’s a massive micromanager who cannot help but correct every single person in her path and she’s really big on forcefully ripping stuff out of your hands to make a point on “how slow” you’re being. Granted, she’s shown nicer sides of herself before, but it’s this irritated, irrationally angry side that everyone sees the most. Her presence makes coming to work anxiety-ridden and miserable for me and a few of my other coworkers.  She took a lot of what I loved about this job and made it painful, filled with pressure, and un-fun.

So I’m now 6 months in—I have been told I won’t be getting a raise this year because I take too long to finish my shift. Mind you, I’m clocking out at around 6-8.0 hours EXACTLY every single time, even clocking out early in some cases to avoid getting screamed at by the assistant manager for “bleeding the boss dry.”  Yesterday I got taken aside by her and she tells me I’m not allowed to work 8 hour shifts anymore, and I have to clock out under 7 hours. What?? I was hired to work FULL TIME. I was told 40 hours a week was not only guaranteed but expected of me. I NEED to work those 40 hours to literally survive in this town. I notice that my pay stubs are capping my hours at 35, which is completely incorrect.

The work itself has become so physically demanding on my small, malnourished body that I am getting hurt at every turn at work.  I’m still the lowest paid person in the bakery, and I’m one of two full time employees that can work all aspects of the BOH (pastry and bread have separate sides and I was trained in both which is not extremely common where I work).  I haven’t slept in 4 days, and all I can afford to eat is the bread I make—I am allotted 1 loaf for free for every shift I work.  I’m angry because the work environment is super toxic and this asshole can just come in and brag about his massive wealth and indiscriminate spending but can’t bring himself to pay me anything close to a living wage. I’m trying to move down to part-time, but they will probably be super pushed and reject my request. If they do, I’m putting in my two weeks and going back to freelancing and going to school for IT. I can’t take it anymore. I’m tired of literally putting my life aside and sacrificing my self, physically and emotionally, for a job that just keeps taking without giving in return.

I am so disappointed in myself because I wanted this to work. I wanted to love my work. I wanted to become a master of this thing that brought me joy and brought me close to the memory of my mother. But the petty behaviors of my superiors and the sheer disregard for the humanity of their staff has finally broken me. I could keep going on but it just gets worse and worse in every single way possible.  I know it’s not just me—my coworkers who have been there for 1-2 years talk a lot about how bad the turnover rate is here.  In the short time I’ve worked here, I’ve watched 4 people quit. I’m not even surprised. I am so unbelievably heartbroken and sad that everything has turned out this way."

My understanding is that working a software job, especially a higher paid one, will guide me to learn new things and attain a deeper understanding in particular areas.

College will cost me around 6K per year at a decent state uni, as well as \~30 hours a week, barring me from being able to work full time for 4 years. My parents can pay for it, but their money is my money so I do factor that in.

My goal is to make \~500K total comp (again, not because of money, but to be able to objectively say I have valuable, relevant expertise before pursuing other things), and I am fully aware of how much I have to expand my time horizon for such a lofty goal. 

Assuming I remain dedicated to my goal, which path will get me there in the shortest amount of time?

There might be other alternatives, but broadly speaking I see 2 paths:

1. get a 4 year degree, do internships every summer, spend whatever free time I get to learn relevant skills online, and then hopefully get a decent FAANG/comparable job shortly thereafter. Then excel at said job, keep learning and doing what I need to do to jump levels. 
2. spend \~6 months getting certifications, working on personal projects that would look good on a resume and/or open source code. apply to low level software jobs, and then work my way up from there to FAANG. It seems pragmatic to distill this down to ""after 3.5 years of grinding, would it be unreasonable for me to still not be able to compete for a job with the version of myself that got the degree?"" Right now, I'm leaning towards yes, that would be unreasonable, since 3.5 years is a long enough time horizon for me to assume that luck won't be the deciding factor. If you believe I'm mistaken, I'd love to hear why."

Last year I applied to 13 schools for a PhD in computer science. I had a strong background, first author research publications, prestigious internships every summer, 3 glowing LoRs, a solid SOP. You get the picture. I ran my application list by my mentor several times, and we refined it to include reach schools, and safety schools (ranks ranging 1-60 on US today CS). Given my undergrad school was ranked top 25, I didn't think this would be a problem.

Obviously there were a lot of reasons that made Fall 2021 applications bad. It was a perfect storm. Several students deferred from 2020, some schools chose not to accept students, etc. I have a few connections who sit on admission committees, and the numbers were grim.

I really believed that I was the type of student who was ready for graduate study. I'm a researcher at heart, and it was shown consistently through my profile. As the rejections came rolling in, it was a huge blow to my ego. I felt ashamed, dumb, and embarrassed. My whole extended family all knew about my grad apps, and then all learned about my failure. That shit hurts. I think this entry from my journal last year properly summarizes how I felt:

&gt;*The worst part about these applications is that after writing all these positive things about yourself for so long, you start to believe what you’re saying is true. Certainly, there is truth in the words, but you are omitting all the character flaws. This picture you’ve painted is a lie. As soon as those applications go in, you feel proud of yourself, and you start to believe that maybe you are the type of person who deserves admission. But when the results all come back negative, that image comes crashing down. Because no matter how unlikely it was, you now know that a committee of individuals agree that you’re not ready for their program - which means that the committee agrees with you. What you’ve thought the whole time is now certifiably true.* 

Obviously I was in a dark place, I completely lost all faith in my abilities. I didn't know what I was going to do. I was mad, just in general, I felt that in my blood. I hated talking about it. My parents prying questions as my world was falling apart were added knives in the wound.

I let myself be upset for a few weeks, but then I started working the problem. Because that's what we do as scientists, we **work the problem**. I couldn't do anything about the past, but I could change my future. 

The first thing I started doing was consulting my mentors, and getting in contact with my professional network. I started asking about jobs, especially focusing on contacting former PIs from my internships. The key here was to move quickly, because by the time I received my last rejection it was past April. Jobs/internships are usually filled quickly.

I ended up talking with a former PI who knew the value of my work. This guy was my savior, he pulled some strings, and got a new job posting up for me. The work was semi-related to what I wanted to do, but I was able to work with my PI to incorporate some of the skills &amp; tools I wanted to focus on as well. A good manager will always want their employee to be excited about their work, and that was the case here. 

I ended up moving across multiple states to work in person, arriving at a city I had never been to (&amp; never wanted to be in). I got an apartment, and eventually made friends through my work. Life wasn't bad, all things considered. Being in CS meant that my job was technical in nature, and paid well. I started saving as much money as I could, since I knew one day I would be a broke grad student again. 

I made several changes to my grad school strategy, which anyone could and should implement. First thing I did was pick a more realistic range, I applied to schools in the range of 15-80. More importantly, I started really focusing on the quality of research fit. This takes a lot of time, and I probably looked at 200-300+ faculty profiles. What I did was open up the CS department faculty page for a given school, open all faculty in new tabs, and read through them. If a school had a professor or two I found interesting, I recorded their names in a spreadsheet, and continued. If I could not find a single PI that interested me, I removed the school from my list. Note that these removed schools went onto a separate list of ""if I don't get accepted into a PhD program I'll apply to these programs as a MS student"". I didn't end up needing this but I HIGHLY suggest it.

Another huge factor that helped me this year was **contacting professors I wanted to work in September.** I would do this only after a significant amount of time was spent understanding their work, lab, and research. I'd send an email basically saying ""hey \_\_ this is who I am, this is the research I do, this is what I'm interested that you're doing, this is why I think we would be a good fit, if you agree lets video chat"". Obviously, much more graceful. Keeping these emails short and to the point is essential - professors can get hundreds of emails every day.

Assuming all goes well, you should get some responses. I had a professor who was particularly interested in working with me, and wanted me to give a research presentation to their lab. This was my chance. I prepared the most amazing research presentation, filled with pretty visuals I made. I was an expert on my research, and the confidence showed. This professor mentioned to me that they thought I would be a good fit for the lab.

During January - February, I received my acceptances. 4/5 of the schools did not include an interview. Some part of me is surprised it all worked out so well, but I still want to believe that Fall 2021 season was fucked. I know that I'm made for grad school, and I'm really glad that I stuck with it. Application cycles are the worst, I hated trying to sell myself. But for me, persistence was the right choice.

Something to note, is that I always try to hedge my bet. If I had gotten another sweep of rejections, I already had set up contingency plans with my current employer. That helped, know that no matter what I was going to be okay.

I'm not going to stand on my soap box and preach that you should try every year to get into grad school until it happens. Honestly, sometimes the hop you're trying to make is too much. I wish that everyone who wanted to go to grad school *could* go to grad school. Unfortunately in the US, grad school is driven by money (like everything). If you're a ""risky"" applicant, you might have trouble securing funds. Especially in a field like CS, which is incredibly competitive.

This process worked for me, but always do what is best for you. Feel free to hit me with a DM if you have questions, I'm pretty active on this sub helping other applicants.

TLDR; got 13 rejections, used my professional network to secure a job, applied again focusing on individual faculty members, reached out to faculty before submitting apps, got into 5/5 schools."

Sunt elev în clasa a 12-a și nu știu ce facultate să urmez în viitor. În principiu opțiunile mele sunt între a pleca în Olanda sa studiez computer science (VU Amsterdam sau universitatea din Groningen) sau să rămân în țară (Unibuc sau universitatea din Craiova).

În timpul liceului am participat la olimpiade și m-am calificat chiar și la naționala de info în clasa a 10-a și am încercat chiar să obțin internshipuri la diverse firme din oraș.

În prezent, dacă aș rămâne în Craiova, aș putea merge la un internship pe care l-am primit la una dintre cele mai mari firme de programare din oraș (Netrom, pentru cei care cunosc) și e posibil chiar să primesc o ofertă să lucrez în timpul facultății (am un prieten care e student și lucrează acolo full time). În plus, mai sunt și pasionat de fotografie și video și voi merge la nunți și evenimente vara și toamna (până în septembrie dacă aleg Olanda pentru că atunci va începe facultatea acolo)

Pe de altă parte, dacă aș alege sa merg la facultate în străinătate, aș putea merge la o facultate din top 150 în lume și aș putea obține alte oportunități acolo, dar nu aș mai putea să profit de cele pe care le am aici.

Facultatea în Craiova durează 4 ani iar cea din Olanda 3 ani, deci ar fi posibilă și varianta în care aș merge un an în Craiova iar apoi, dacă nu îmi place situația, să mă duc în Olanda.

Aș vrea să îmi dați și voi niste sfaturi legate de alegere, poate să îmi spuneți dacă voi recomandați facultatea în străinătate sau nu. Până la urmă sunt conștient de faptul că programarea se învață singur și dacă nu ai proiecte și experiență de lucru tot nu demonstrezi că ești un programator bun.

TLDR: Sunt indecis între a merge în Craiova la facultate și a participa la un internship (posibilă angajare) și a merge la evenimente vara și toamna ca fotograf sau a merg în Olanda la facultate."

I found it to be the complete opposite in the UK.

If you're a smart person (120-130iq) with normal social skills, programming is the fastest way to getting paid great money starting from 0 and there's no saturation whatsoever.

I'm 1h away from London, not british, no uni degree, did a self taught online ""bootcamp"" for 8 months(half of it playing video games), 0 interview prep and got a well paid work-from-home job in 3 weeks, 2nd interview.

I didn't even apply for the company, they found me on Linkedin. I also still get constantly contacted by recruiters.

They provide as many benefits as they can because they're having a tough time hiring half decent developers. I get half a day and free courses for my own learning, no micro management, mentorship, private healthcare and they even offered to pay for my uni degree if I want to get one. ""JUST DON'T LEAVE US!""

I'm a lazy, laid-back, happy type of person who mostly worked retail jobs, not caring much about money and career. The only reason I switched was because the pandemic hit the retail market a bit hard(in the touristy sector where I worked). 

It would have literally been harder to find even a minimum wage stable retail job than this. I have friends who worked retail and had a tough time finding another decent job for months after their store closed.

If I can get a job that fast with that little effort and the company trying very hard to hold on to me, how can the market be ""saturated""?"

I'm going to do my best to 

**Some background:**

My first experience with programming was in the early 90s with an HP85 as well as MS DOS, Basic, and a few other languages on different platforms. (This was starting around 5-7 years old since my parents are engineers in the Silicon Valley and they encouraged us to play and mess around with programming ).

Since then, I've taught myself HTML, CAS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, C++, C, shell scripting, python, Visual Basic, apple script, and a variety of other languages and frameworks. I also got an associates in computer science while finishing up at a community college to go on to get my BS and MS at a renowned technical university in the US.

I've done freelance wevdev, coded to compliment jobs that I've worked at, made a real world adventure game using PHP and MySQL, built our (my wife and my) agritech startup facility's sensor system, and am currently building both a smart using AI and ML as well as a three tiered object recognition system using computer vision.


Despite honors and accolades, a patented invention, hands on experience, a prestigious internship at NASA, and more, I never successfully got into industry for my major (a specific hardware engineer field). Treating the job search like a full-time job in parallel with several side jobs and hustles and 3 years, over 300 custom tailored resumes per position, countless lunches and professional development help, and more and I had nothing to show for it. I just don't get where I went wrong. People love me and I am a phenomenal communicator (in college and grad school I won several awards at conferences and other places for capably communicating our work and research), **I just don't know how to play the game of marketing and selling myself**. I also have no clue how to ""close the deal"". Any time that I met with people for a particular position it just ended with ""Your resume looks really great! You should be getting bites any time now."" 

It's been 5 years since I gave up.

During that time, I successfully solved a problem that one startup had which would have invalidated their patents if it weren't for my solution, built 2 tech programs for underserved and underrepresented people (while teaching the tech - hardware, software, and entrepreneurship), and have had to hustle like a mad man to make ends meet.

**Why I gave context and the help I'm hoping for**

I think that I'm ready to try to turn my hobby of programming into a potential position. However, when I look at job postings, they are highly specific about tools or frameworks and they ask for a major specific degree, number of years of experience in certain tools, etc.

I find it daunting.

I'm literally building an AI and ML climate control smart systems for predicting and adapting to the weather and I'm doing it from scratch.

There must be some way that I can leverage what I know, my life-long experience, and my willingness to pickup and learn new things into a position.

But another reason that I find it daunting is that I had put so much time and effort into the job search previously, to the point of building and deploying my own Applicant Tracking System to test my resume against...and it feels like this is the first thing that that I haven't been able to figure out even in time and with help :/

I've seen advice for:

-	people who have never coded before
-	new grads
-	late learners

But my biggest struggle is that I HAVE coded before, for a long time, I'm not a new grad, I just haven't figured out how to market and sell myself or get people's attention not have I figured out how to turn networking into a position nor ""close the deal."" I feel like there is a hole in my mind where so many others simply know how to do this thing, even those who struggled but made it.

I'm looking for any advice that you might have, suggestions, tips, etc.

I'm not looking for a huge paycheck nor am I looking for something unreasonable, I just want to get my foot in the door somewhere that I can build and grow as a professional programmer beyond my personal projects, freelance and side software engineering, and the coding for our own business.

My dream would be a place where I could leverage my knowledge and experience, learn and grow, and possibly be mentored (but that's a bonus).

Unfortunately, I have not used GitHub regularly as I keep my projects private except when I deploy them but I have used GitHub and other versioning systems.

Thank you all for your time, advice, suggestions, and anything else you share here."

I've double majored in Biology &amp; History at my state's college with a pretty good reputation. I'm really fortunate to have had my education paid for by my parents and seem to have good job prospects for post-graduation in the fields of biotech, pharma, etc.

But I can't help but feel a massive sense of imposter syndrome. I originally went into college fully set on medical school and wanting to study neuroscience. It's what I had been interested in in high school and both my sister and mother were (or going to be) medical professionals. Despite my really, really strong aptitude for mathematics, that's the path I ended up choosing. I've been grateful to have had an internship at a large biological company that I loved. The environment was great, I loved the work they did. I've had a couple interviews for pharma startups, but they seem like the type of companies to work you 50, 60+ hours a week. The thought of pursuing one of those jobs scares me for that reason, but also because I'm not convinced that's what I want to do in life.

Part of my problem is that I'm interested in a lot (and I mean A LOT) of different things. I do research in a biological laboratory that I enjoy, I love learning about how cars work and new developments in that field, I love learning/discussing history, and I just really enjoy learning about everything and anything I can. Sometimes I can't help but feel I picked the wrong career path studying biology and that instead, I should've utilized my skills in math for something like engineering. Even with good career opportunities, I have the constant nagging feeling that I won't enjoy working in either pharma or biotech and at that point, I'll have no idea how to progress and find something I actually love. It doesn't help that I seem to be surrounded by people who know exactly what they want to do in life, while I'm still struggling to find the field I really want to go into. I've thought about trying for graduate school (PhD life sciences) or even going back to school for an engineering bachelor's, but I don't even know if I want to do any of those.

My parents have been supportive of me not knowing my future ambitions. I have tried my college's career center and I do utilize a therapist to work through the anxiety of all of this. I'm just looking for a bit of advice/support as to whether or not this is truly normal, and maybe how I can discover my passion."

I narrowed down my list but don't know which to focus on.

1. Study math (I'm a little rusty and will be taking differential equations, linear algebra, etc later in college)
2. Do one of those online courses (like coursera) for comp sci or data statis
3. Take classes at my local cc

Hello y’all, I am a 19 year old student in my last semester at a community college receiving my Associates in Business. I am hesitant on transferring at the moment for a couple reasons, which I’ll talk about soon. Initially, I was planning on studying accounting and even worked at an accounting firm for a bit south of a year but learned quick it wasn’t for me.
As of recent, I was fortunate to have been offered an internship for this upcoming summer at a Wealth Management firm with the help of a family connection. It would be a paid internship where I could potentially work my way up.

However, as of late I have been learning a few programs such as Python, SQL, Jupyter, etc. To which I have become very fascinated with and I genuinely enjoy learning. To give a better understanding, I do not want to become a SE or programmer solely, rather so a career that is data driven- one idea is an analyst (Data or Business Intelligence specifically). 

With all this being said, should I take the opportunity still and give this internship a shot or should I chase these recent ambitions? I am certainly interested in WM and with what I have been told, they are willing to offer a full-time position if I excel and do not want to pursue at least a bachelors.  


***Side note:
-If I were hoping to pursue an IT career such as an analyst, is a bachelors absolutely necessary?
•Could I build a resume with taking courses or getting certifications, while also developing projects of some sort to showcase my skills for future interviews? Or, is a degree completely necessary?"

No official title yet but what I’ll be doing is:



-formatting and adding finishing edits for videos for final release



-uploading videos to podcast services, YouTube, tik tok, etc.




-schedule videos on weekly basis (eventually, not scheduling yet, just uploading)



These duties will basically correlate with growing the show / channel.  Decent size (I think) currently.  Over 400,000 followers on multiple streaming sites.  No estimated number on engagement but it’s definitely successful and was grown without the whole methods that would ruin engagement.  Got a couple million views on some episodes so that’s probably why it grew quite a bit.



If there is a title for a job with these duties, please feel free to comment it down so I can find similar job salaries.  I was offered the position by my supervisor as I was just an intern before and it’s a pretty new company so I’m basically the first person to have these kind of duties with the show

However, after doing more  research and realizing that the likelihood of me getting sponsored by an employer and getting a H1B Visa after the  1-2 year OPT certificate were slim, I'm seriously reconsidering. It's literally a lottery system.

Like, unless you somehow are able to work for a big tech company like Google who have the resources and money to sponsor you, I just don't see it happening. Even then any employers would have to legally prove to the US government that no U.S citizen can fill your position. I've read other int students on r/immigration try for years and even decades to stay in the U.S but to no avail.  The fact that I can't even get work experience or do internships if I do happen to go to college in the states also just exacerbates the issue.  You would also be tied to that employer until you get a green card, which could take years. Your boss would essentially have complete control on whether or not you stay or are sent home. If you leave your job, you have a set time period to get another job (and find another employer to go through the trouble to sponsor you for another H1B visa) or you are sent home.  Even if you do find an employer willing to sponsor you, you only have a 33 percent chance to get it through the lottery system.

I seriously don't intend to sound like a doom and gloomer, but I just seriously don't want some of you to be disappointed, given how hard you all have worked and what it means to a lot of people on this subreddit to try and start a better life abroad.

Unless you marry an American for the sole purpose of getting a green card, the only realistic and secure option I see is studying in the US and moving to Canada via Express Entry, a place with a way easier immigration policy that actually values skilled immigrant workers.

I definitely know I don't have all the answers, so let me know what all of you think."

I am currently looking for internships (my university mandates at least 2 summer internships before we graduate). I made the mistake of applying to many different internships for companies without googling them beforehand. 
Then, out of nowhere, a company ""Talent Acquisition Specialist"" starts spamming me with phone calls non-stop (does not even email me first), with phone calls during my classes and my part-time work (don't like it but better experience than 90% of my previous employments and with an ""acceptable pay"") and my project with the university. At first I panicked because I never normally answer to unknown phone calls, but when I answer, the most rude individual I have ever dealt with starts shouting at me for:
1) Not responding to her phone calls (even AFTER telling her I was at class)
2) Not responding to her email (SHE NEVER SENT ONE, I CHECKED MY SPAM FOLDER AS WELL)
3) When she tells me what the offer is, and I refuse it, she starts shouting at me how I am not responsible enough to go for a career and I am not bold enough to make ""investment"" desicions. Keep in mind that this ""internship"" is a year to 18 months long with a ""possibility"" of a small bonus (around 100$) and a full time offer at the end if my work was satisfactory.

I decide to, logically, stop the call. Then, she keeps calling in again nonstop so I get forced to remove my SIM card from my phone. 4 days later, when I inserted it back, this rude ""specialist"" was still calling (at 1 AM no least), so I block her number. She starts calling from other numbers so I block them too.
After calling from 14 different numbers, the calls stop and the emails start. Luckily since I gave them my university email, I contacted the IT and told them to redirect all mail from that company to spam. They luckily agreed after telling them my story.

So, this is the worst employer yet I have had to deal with, without ever getting employed there. Cannot even fathomed what I would have dealt with if I accepted their offer.
This has been 1 of the 2 shitty experiences with my job applications of the last week, the other being a scam (it turned out that way) company called Brainnest that rejected me for a position that I am WAY overexperienced for and wanted me to pay for a 140£ a month ""training"" for 3 months where I learn things I already know.

P.S: neither the pay, the internship duration, or the working hours were specified when I first applied to that internship from hell. All it was listed for is ""summer internship"" with qualifications, so I assumed it was only for 3 months and standard 40 hrs/ week."

It's gonna be one hell of a ride. 

Truthfully, I didn't think I would be moving out this soon because my plan was to do an internship while slowly getting back into my (mostly online) university studies. 

It was a fight about how she needs to stop giving my cat wet food because the dry food is necessary to give her additional oral care. My vet says that it's either because of her genes or some other reason that my cat happens to have poor oral health. If it's because of her genes and nothing we do helps, she may need to get her teeth removed.

I don't know why my mom insists on giving her wet food even though it's more expensive, and I don't care. It was that fight that was the last straw. If I knew this, I wouldn't have taken up the internship, but here I am. 

On the bright side, I've made many friends and connections. I'm on good terms with my boss and if I need a full-time job after I graduate I can go to her. Who knows what will result from this. :)

I'll try to stay optimistic. I'm strong and capable, and this is completely doable.

Ultimately I would like to work in something with exposure to Equity markets, or as a Financial analyst.

I've had past internships as a Financial analyst and as an Equity Researcher, but haven't really learned much because it was during the pandemic, and managers were less inclined to give confidential informations in a remote work environment.

I've been applying for internships in said posts but unfortunately as I'm not in enrolled in the top 3 business schools here it's quite difficult to land interviews.

But I've been offered a Business Analyst internship at a promising french startup with interesting pay, basically it is an AI powered platform for life science investment, that predicts the future of exponential technologies (deep tech), and help match the most promising startups around the world with leading buyers and investors, with the following missions : (I know the missions are quite vague and touch on a little bit of everything and that's part of the problem).

 \-Conduct market research work including market sizing, competitive, comparables and news monitoring.

\- Create and update financial models including business plan, monetization, pricing and benchmarking.

\- Create innovation and investment reports to showcase the insights of the platform.

\- Support the company capital raise by providing research on investors and funds.

\- Support R&amp;D projects by providing business guidance and feedback.

And after talking with HR about the position, they said that they've just finished their seed funding, and moving on to series A funding, so they're expanding on a commercial/marketing POV, and they need help looking in the competitive landscape, market and for potential investors (also something about it being a mixture between a journalist and a BA).

My problem is, since Business Analysis is quite different from Financial analysis and can be a drift from financial markets, i'm afraid by opting for this internship I kind of limit myself in the future to only Business Analyst offers, which can impact my objectives of either becoming a FA or on Equity.

I've asked around and I have been given conflicting answers, ranging from, 'you can opt for it and then valorize the financial side and then convert back to Finance', to, 'this is mostly marketing/strategic marketing, and your masters' final year internship is crucial and will draw your professional path afterwards, making a conversion harder afterwards'.

I'm lost, between taking the safe bet and accepting the risk of not liking what I do on the internship and having a hard time converting back to what I want, and taking the risk of finding something more suitable, not find it, and miss on this opportunity. What would you guys recommend me?"

I would like some advice or opinions in order to gain a better perspective. Sorry, this is a long post.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

I'm in Canada, QC, I have a bachelor's degree majoring in Finance and Business Technology Management, graduated 2018. Since then, I co-founded a non-profit focused on mental health, a MedTech focused on laproscopic surgery and since 2020 I got recruited and working as the CFO of a startup that is doing very well. I got into a computer science certificate at university and planning to finish it by end of 2023, studied data analytics from google and registered for my CFA level one this November, paid by the company. I have no clue what to do with my career after this company. I like finance, I love data analysis and research, I love project management and team handling, I hate accounting. What would you do with my experience and credentials? I kind of entered the startup world after graduation because of my mental health non-profit, which I made because I had no support during my studies, and did not have luxury to get an internship since I spent summers going to my home country and help family since my grand-father was dying of cancer. So here I am. CFO with little in terms of credentials, but closing a seed round worth millions, grew with the company and doing quite well in terms of work achievements (I think?).



Long story:

I (27M, living in Canada, QC) graduated in 2018 with Bachelor's degree, majoring in Finance and Business technology Management. I turned the university association I was in into during school, into a Non-Profit focusing on mental health. My social enterprise won a few prizes and made some significant changes in a couple of universities within a year. After a year, I decided to move on, since I was getting into more and more conflicting strategies with my co-founder, but believed in her and the company, and another opportunity came up. A close friend of mine studying medicine was onto an interesting project he wanted to commercialize. So in 2019 we co-founded a MedTech startup and again, gained attention, momentum, won some prizes, etc. The company was getting off the ground but some major players pretty much crippled us with a patent submission that covered just enough of our tech to render us in trouble. We ended up focusing on research but eventually doing it under a university was better than under a company banner. So we dissolved the company and my friend is still doing research on it but I do not know if I will ever get back to it. Anyways, we dissolved in Jan 2020, I took a break for 2 months and decided to review some things in life. Gained an interest for programming, but in March, I got approached by a startup who heard of me and my work and wanted to hire me as their Financial Director. I joined in, since I missed the innovative environment a lot. At the same time, I also applied for a CompSci certificate at university, since I faced a lot of situations where coding and automation could make my life easier. I got in for Fall 2020.

From March 2020 to September 2020 I worked with them, a team of 5 people (me included) in a small office. Started school in fall and took 2 classes while working 50-60 hours per week. In winter 2021 took 1 class since things at work started to get intense.

I took a year off from school and focused on my current job. Within a year, we grew to a team of 16 full time employees, a big office and a seed round being closed as we speak. I am officially the CFO and holding shares in the company, even though I am not a licensed accountant, hold only my bachelor's and am currently 27. Investors are concerned about my lack of experience but they do not seem to have other issues with how I work and the value I brought to the company.

While I took the year off from school, I still studied but at my own pace. Completed the Data Analytics Professional Certificate from Google, learned R, SQL and a Java on my own. I have classes starting again for my CompSci certificate this fall 2022. At the same time, the CEO gave me the approval to start my CFA level 1 and the company will pay for it. I registered and I have my CFA level 1 exam in November this year.

Here is the issue:

I do not know exactly what I want in life anymore. I freaking love problem solving, working in a startup environment where your decisions and strategies require research, design and implementation. While I enjoy finance, I do not like accounting, which is why I would rather pursue the CFA than the CPA.

But I am starting to realize I enjoy the data analysis and project implementation and management more than anything else. Since I started having a team under me in my department, I actually started doing much better and hitting goals much faster.

Honestly, by the end of 2023, I would be a someone with 5 years of C-level financial experience, out of which 3.5 will be at this company, which I helped grow and even close investment rounds. I would also have a CFA level 2, a CompSci certificate and a Data analysis certificate from Google.

If you were in my place and still felt lost...what would you do? Investment banking sounds toxic and brutal, accounting would require me at least 2-3 more years of studies and I would rather do a complete bachelor's in CompSci than progress in accounting.

Anyways...I feel lost. I have a strong impostor syndrome and often feel like I am underqualified and not good enough. Was wondering if I should look into actual data analysis as a job, or project management. The idea is that in 5 years, I am pretty sure I will be working somewhere else. I feel like I should figure out now what to hone and prepare. But I feel torn between finance and programming, ironically.

Thanks for listening to my rant. Any ideas, advice, suggestions, insults, threats, compliments, etc?"
t3kxjs,3,2022-02-28,Sunday chills on Saturday Night,Powcakes411,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t3kxjs/sunday_chills_on_saturday_night/,"Hey antiwork.

I (23M) am getting tired of doing the grind. I don't have it a fifth as bad as some of the other posts I've read. Salaried IT professional, 45-55 hours a week(no OT pay of course), pretty good salary, but a very small team of 3. Boss won't give me any remote work flexibility even though I can do my job 97% remotely with exceptions of hardware maintenance (of which I create a maintenance window on my own time afterhours). I've even suggested hybrid work but heavily in-office and its still a hard no.

When the pandemic happened, I took on the hardship of working a full-time job, full-time university (US btw), and preparing to get married all in the same year. I thought once I got my degree and got married, a big weight would be lifted off my shoulders. Things just got more complicated with my job at work. as time went on, I kept receiving more and more responsibilities outside of my job description (metering mail, intercorporate courier runs, even general maintenance like light-bulb replacing and responsibility of generators on-site). I can't keep up the day-to-day IT responsibilities anymore, it takes up so much time. The company has issues replacing people (including maintenance staff)

A big problem is I am working full-time for the company that hired me as an intern in college, and still feel like the intern as I was 4 years ago. I wish I established boundaries when I could of.

I have been on call the past 3 weekends with several calls. I can barely enjoy my weekend as I'm getting the ""Sunday chills"" on Saturday night. I've been actively looking for another job for 6 months, had about a dozen interviews, and I get dropped at either the 2nd or 3rd interview and get completely ghosted. Hoping I may of locked in a network engineer position this week. \*fingers crossed\* 

Monday has me broken down in a bad mindspace. I've only been doing this for 3 years and I don't think I can make it till summer. My wife has a good job but if I quit we couldn't sustain on only her income, unless we heavily budgeted more than we are now.  I would love to quit but I feel like I will lose my leverage of a good wage unless I keep my current job and continue applying.

I feel like all I need to be happy is a fulfilling remote IT job with a normal workload without BS random odd-job responsibilities.

I want to thank everyone in this sub for giving me content to read at work and give me the courage to post this myself. If you made it this far, I appreciate it."

My application went under review on 27th February and I was casually checking the portal just now and saw that I have been rejected.

They took 1 day to reject me?! Only **incomplete** applications would receive rejection so fast! It is really hard to believe because profile is not that weak!

* GRE: 311 (159Q)
* TOEFL: 102
* CGPA: 7.96 (CSE)
* 1 journal publication in ML
* Almost 3 years of work-ex in a reputed MNC
* 2 research internships (both at IITs)
* 4-5 relevant projects and 1 open source computer vision project

And they rejected my profile in a day?! It is really shocking and disheartening as I was hoping to get into Rutgers :(

The only two reasons I can remotely think for rejection are:

1. I applied in Mid Jan (but they have deadline till Feb 2!!)
2. I didn't upload my unofficial GRE scores (which was unchecked as well in the checklist) but I had sent my official GRE scores on 5th of Jan!

And I had specifically asked them if my scores were received or not? And they said that ""they were added and reflected in the checklist"" but the ""unofficial GRE scores"" remained unchecked.

Do you guys really think this can be a possible reason for rejection? If so, this is bad! As I had sent my GRE scores on 5th Jan and they would have definitely received it!

I have not received any email till now but the portal specified no reason for rejection. I feel very lost and clueless right now.

Any feedback from the community is appreciated! 


PS: The only reason I didn't upload the pdf of GRE score was to prevent them from seeing my past GRE attempts in which my scores were lower."

As a freshman, are there internships/job opportunities available this summer for me? I am eligible to work in Canada and the US. If there are places I can get an internship for the summer, please let me know so I can work on applying.

In the event I am unable to land something for this summer, what would you suggest I do? I was thinking of taking summer classes or maybe working of a project(if you have any ideas I'd appreciate it). Or should I just learn languages like Python and Java during the summer?

Your response is appreciated. Thanks"

No official title yet but what I’ll be doing is:



-formatting and adding finishing edits for videos for final release



-uploading videos to podcast services, YouTube, tik tok, etc.




-schedule videos on weekly basis (eventually, not scheduling yet, just uploading)



These duties will basically correlate with growing the show / channel.  Decent size (I think) currently.  Over 400,000 followers on multiple streaming sites.  No estimated number on engagement but it’s definitely successful and was grown without the whole methods that would ruin engagement.  Got a couple million views on some episodes so that’s probably why it grew quite a bit.



If there is a title for a job with these duties, please feel free to comment it down so I can find similar job salaries.  I was offered the position by my supervisor as I was just an intern before and it’s a pretty new company so I’m basically the first person to have these kind of duties with the show 





Thanks again everyone"

t3scv8,1,2022-02-28,How I can go into Prop Trading after College?,azamat__bagatov14,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/t3scv8/how_i_can_go_into_prop_trading_after_college/,"I don't know if this is the right forum for this or if there is a post similar to this, but I would appreciate any advice:

I am a sophomore in college and I want to get into prop trading after I graduate. 

I embraced this idea fairly recently so I don't know exactly how I should approach it. I am passionate about trading, for the longest time my plan after college was to get in a random finance job while trading on the side and quitting after a couple of years to trade full time independently, but learning that I can start as a trader getting trained by the experts, with others just like me, as a career really changed the whole equation.

Although I was always somewhat interested and the idea has been on my mind for some time now, taking action took me some time and I should say I am currently in the very beggining. I am studying textbooks and watching YouTube videos to learn technical analysis. I'm also reading Market Wizards and listening to podcasts with traders to understand the emotional and practical aspect of trading.  

I know firms have summer internships, but the ones I found are almost all for juniors and for most others they either don't have anything or I missed the deadlines. I was kind of late in terms of planning and taking action for this summer for internships etc., so I'm not sure what I will end up doing. If I can find anything, I might do an internship in another field, I guess it's better than nothing. At the very least on my own studies, I'll be able to get some more trading knowledge, maybe get some experience with paper trading.

So my questions is:

What can I do in the near future to increase my chances of securing an internship next year, and a job offer after I graduate? Would starting paper trading or trading with a small account so I have a track record be a good idea even though at first I would have no idea of what I'm doing? Would reaching out to people in the industry for advice be inappropriate especially when I am in a very early stage in my journey? What paths did some of you who are in proprietary trading now took when you were trying to get in the field?

I'm fully committed to this path and am ready to dedicate any amount of time or resource. I would appreciate any advice, suggestion, resource or anything.

Also if people think this is not the way to go, I would also like to here your input.

I know it has been long, thank you for everyone who took the time to read it and a special thank you to everyone that replied.

TLDR: I'm in college, what could I do to get into prop trading after graduation?"
t3ss5o,4,2022-02-28,Team at work wants me to move to another project because I’m struggling. Really not sure what to do.,Parapurp,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/t3ss5o/team_at_work_wants_me_to_move_to_another_project/,"Hi. I have been at my first job out of school for around 7 months. 
Only offer I got, in the tech/ defense industry. From the beginning, I expressed interest in getting involved in UX design but Initially I was assigned to work under the chief engineer/ project leader on controlling hardware for the system. 
I was learning from doing that but given that I don’t have a computer science degree, there was a lot of fundamental knowledge and experience I just didn’t have. I was swimming in software design docs, complex hardware code and just didn’t understand as well as I needed to even though I tried taking courses online. Also, I’m interested in UI design/ development and eventually want to move into design. So that tasking did not align with my goals. I tried to stick it out but eventually I ended up asking my scrum master how I could get involved in UI/UX on the team. Almost immediately I was moved to the UI development sub-team for the project. 

The team only had two guys on it, one of which is the lead. Both have way more experience than me as this is my first corporate job apart from internships. 
Since then, I noticed a few things.
- they’ll often have meetings I’m not included in. 
- I have to reach out to my team lead for information in most cases to stay up to date on what’s happening.
- when deciding what tasks to assign to team members, they don’t know what to give to me.

The team lead seems to be frustrated with me because I take a lot longer to finish tasks. When I ask for feedback, often they don’t have time. For example I’ve been trying to get their feedback on a component I built for over a week to no avail.

Well, today one of the leads of the entire project let me know that they want to move me to another project where I can be “given better opportunities to get up to speed”. She said they don’t think the lead of my UI sub-team has the “bandwidth to support me” and hasn’t been giving me the mentorship I need. 
She reinforced that the project has been a mess since the beginning and requirements keep changing, so she knows it’s been exhausting for me, etc. 
While this is true and this project keeps getting redefined and more complex, I know this is due in part to me not finishing all my stories in time for the end of the sprint, and not meeting the velocity of the team. I really feel that I am trying my best at this job- I don’t wait for people to reach out to me, I ask ANYONE I can for help but also try to figure out the problems I’m having myself. I’ve been trying to troubleshoot this one task for over a week by getting help from outside my sub-team, as they have not had much time when I ask them to help. 

But It’s getting to the point where it’s harder to ask for help and my moral is low. I think I’m just not where I need to be to survive in this environment without working 50+ a week and burning out. Because my long term goals are not in software development, I’m wondering if I should even keep trying.

Is this a case where I can just work harder and improve?
Is moving to another team at this company even a good idea?
Or should I look for a job I don’t suck at and struggle with every single moment?"
t3tix6,1,2022-02-28,transfer pros and cons,amoebabyclairo,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/t3tix6/transfer_pros_and_cons/,"Hi, I'm a freshman transfer admit and I was wondering if it was worth coming to UMich. I currently go to a school in texas which covers my total cost of attendance. Basically, they're paying me to attend. It's a cs focused school and has regional recognition, but I don't want to work in texas after college. I know UM is known better across the country and places better in the parts of the field that I want to work in. I am out of state, so I would have to be paying \~70k a year to come here, which totals to about 210k. My parents are helping me pay, so I think a third of that will be what I have to pay off. I'm not sure if its worth it to come here for the price. CS jobs are well paying, so I'm not too worried about paying off the debt. For CS majors, is getting internships very competitive since there are so many other CS majors? For transfers, what has your experience been like? thank you!"
