from the beginning.

2013 has been complete and utter shit, and i can't stand it anymore. Januari started off with me getting dumped by my girlfriend for nearly 5 years, who i was planning on pruposing too during summer. I missed out on a great internship because I was too upset about beeing dumped. I failed all my classes in school. Meanwhile my sister graduated with flying colours from a bordingschool in swizerland.

And to top this fucking year off... i found out that i nearly raped a friend of mine yesterday, she has no recollection of us fooling around during new years. However my fingers smell of a different story. She tells me it's ok and that deep down she wanted it, but i feel bad anyway for doing it without consent.

I signed a year-long lease in August, and was planning on subletting my room for the spring semester, but my roommate is making that incredibly difficult. 


The lease I signed is only for my room (we are not on the same lease) and the property management company assigned him as my roommate. 

This roommate works night shifts, and comes home around 6 or 7 AM and proceeds to get black-out drunk every day by 11 or noon.

 He does not clean up after himself, and there are currently 45 empty beer cans sitting on the table in the living room, along with cigarette butts and ash from smoking pot. He frequently leaves the oven on when he cooks food drunk, to the point that I have to turn it off several times a week, sometimes hours after he has passed out.

He also occasionally sells pot, cocaine and LSD. 

I have asked him to clean up after himself so that I can have people over to see the apartment, but he always passes out before he gets to cleaning up. I am embarrassed to bring anyone over to see my room because my roommate is always wasted during the middle of the day and I can't imagine anyone wanting to live with him, but the days are counting down before I have to move out. 

It has been next to impossible to find someone to take my room, due to the horrible roommate that was assigned to me.

Do I have any basis for breaking my lease?"

1u75y0,1,2014-01-01,How did you decide between schools? (Warning: wall of text incoming),brutusthedinglefairy,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1u75y0/how_did_you_decide_between_schools_warning_wall/,"**TLDR; UC Davis vs. San Jose State. I’m interested in both, both have their merits, but I can’t identify a front runner in my mind**

I’m having trouble deciding between schools. I know it’s early, but I really have no idea where I want to go. I applied to several UCs and CSUs but right now my top two choices are San Jose State and UC Davis. I’m a psychology major at my CC, but ultimately I want to go into research so I’m going to transfer into a Biopsychology or B.S. Psychology program.

My Transfer Admissions Guarantee (TAG) was accepted at Davis, which means that as long as I complete a set list of classes and maintain my GPA (both requirements should be no problem; my GPA is well above the requirement and the two remaining classes on the list should be easy) I have guaranteed admittance to Davis. I also talked to an admissions counselor as San Jose and when he looked at my transcript and he said that my GPA looked great and I had completed all the required classes plus the IGETC, so unless some catastrophic failure occurs, I should be good there as well.

Both San Jose’s B.S. program and Davis’ Biopsych seem appealing to me. When I spoke with one of the Psych professors as San Jose, he mentioned that requirements within the major were more or less flexible, meaning I could choose classes based on my interests and focus with the help of a faculty member. The honors program requires either a research position or an internship outside of the school, so that would provide me with some good experience. In addition, I think the area could provide for some other good internship opportunities. On the other hand, David has the MIND institute which has several psych research programs with the opportunity for undergrads for get involved with some of the projects there.

I haven’t really visited Davis yet, but I have a trip in the works. I went in high school, but it was just a quick tour and I don’t really remember much. I do remember that the campus was really pretty and I got a pretty good vibe from it. I’m looking forward to going back and really experiencing the campus now that I know what I’m looking for. I went to San Jose over the summer right on move-in day so I got a chance to look around and talk to some people, but not to sit in on a class, which is something I plan on doing at Davis. I did like the campus and everyone I talked to was really nice there. I really like the San Jose area. The campus was right next to the downtown area, with lots of things within walking distance so I wouldn’t really need my car. Plus, I have family in the area, which is nice, but probably not a deciding factor.

As far as I can tell it looks like the degree requirements are pretty much the same, the only differences are that I’d have to take physics for non-engineering majors and o-chem, which isn’t really a big deal to me. I’m curious about the rigor of the courses or how they’re typically structured. The biggest thing is that I need to be interested and wanting to engage in the class, which is something I’ve learned in my time at my CC. Both schools have opportunities for sports involvement without having to join the school team which is something I like; San Jose has PE classes (it’s also a graduation requirement) and Davis has several club sports teams, as well as more casual student-run clubs.

I really don’t know what to do. I’ve spent hours on each school’s website trying to find something that pushes one ahead of the other, but nothing has really blown me away.

 Does UC vs. CSU matter as much to a grad school as which classes you take, the grades you make, and the experience you gain? How do these schools really stack up against each other? How did you guys ultimately make your decision between schools that were neck-and-neck in your mind? Can any of you guys share you experiences at Davis or SJSU? Any advice or input would be super appreciated!

Good

1) I go to a prestigious university well known for its engineering program.

2) I have a ""presidential research scholarship"" due to research accomplishments, which has funded some of the research I've done on campus.

3) Speaking of which, my research involves using bioimaging techniques to assess certain cancer treatments and making steps in the treatment more efficient. I have thus far coauthored 2 papers, and I've been involved in this research for my entire time in college.

4) Some coding prowess, understanding of data structures, will probably have enough CS knowledge to be useful after college. (will have a CS minor)

Bad

1) 2.3 overall GPA, I'm a junior

2) Bioengineering major, job prospects generally not great for bachelors

3) Might lose the aforementioned research scholarship due to low GPA this semester. It's a miracle I've had it for this long, but my luck has probably run out.

4) I've never done any paid work/internships besides the research

Now: I'm applying to several bioengineering related summer internships this winter break. I'm pretty sure my GPA leaves me with virtually zero chance of me getting into these programs. I also plan on attending grad school, but I know I must experience a marked GPA improvement in order for that to be a possibility. 

Can anyone council me on what I might need to do in order to improve my job prospects after my education is complete? I feel like I'm in a pretty bad place, and I only have myself to blame for it."

Specifically I suppose I'm aiming at the gaming industry because that seems like the most fun that can be thought of when discussing computing. I notice that a typical computer science major only requires integral calculus and an introductory level of linear algebra knowledge to graduate with a BS. Is there anything a math major can offer to the gaming industry?

For example I'm looking at how RIOT games lists their career options, and they pretty much say ""computer science or related field"" for all categories of work. I would consider their intern position eventually but I feel like I made too many offensive comments with my LoL account to qualify, but generally speaking, does any advanced math go into game programming?"

I've got a C.S. degree from a mid-level northeastern U.S. university. I've held a job in financial software, and one developing a 3D application in OpenGL. I have had internships, I've worked every week of my life from 16-24. For the past 6 months I've been unemployed, and, to be honest, I'm not really looking that hard anymore, because I know what I'll find.

If you go through Monster or CareerBuilder or Bright or CyberCoders, you'll send out 25 applications and you'll hear back from one person. If you started this application process at CyberCoders, before anyone will even contact you, you have to use their ""competency sliders"" that will ask you, on a scale of ""Novice"" to ""Expert"", how competent you are with ""Node.js"" or ""Hadoop"" or ""Iterative Development."" 

At this point, you must lie, or I suspect you won't even get someone on the phone.

THIS IS WHAT BUGS ME. I got a degree in Computer Science. Computer. Science. I know how to program in at least 3 languages on an expert level. I know dozens of graph algorithms by heart. I know what a support vector machine is. I know Calculus, Physics, maybe some Chemistry, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Statistics...

Do you REALLY think that Node.js is that big of a leap after hacking a linux scheduler?

This is the issue - I'm FORCED to lie during the application process. The recruiter, probably an English major who hasn't coded a day in their life, is given a checklist and I have to meet every bullet point on that list. It's as if the piece of paper that I spent 4 years getting means NOTHING about my ability to learn new things.

If I wanted to be a professional liar, I would have applied to Law School.

That is all. I didn't really have a question.

I've had graduate school in my plans all along, but today it hit me hard that I am getting dropped from the program.

I was conditionally accepted into a Masters program with the prerequisite of getting a B in two undergraduate courses (statistics and research class). Got a B- in the research class (with the help of unhelpful TAs and the lack of my English skills as a foreign student) therefore I am getting dropped.

I was doing well in the other statistics class and other two graduate courses, but because of this I am forced to stop my continuous study in the field.

I don't know how to face myself, my parents, and all the people who had encouraged me, people who stood by me when I needed help. I feel I failed, big time. Falling down in a hardest way that I could have ever imagined.

Although I've had previous internship experiences, it was in a totally different field from what I've studied. (interned as a photography studio assistant but studied psychology)

I'm not sure if I want to get back to graduate school now. I would have to take another similar course from another school and then reapply if I wanted to go back, which by the time would be 2015.

Sorry but now I really don't know what my next step should be. My plans are now shattered and I am really lost.

(Disclaimer: Posted this in the sister Iwantoutjobs subreddit but thought I'd get a better response here. If this is inappropriate, then I apologize and shall remove this thread if required.)

Anyways, I iust finished my Masters in Economics from the University of Warwick in the UK and am graduating this month. Unfortunately, my grades really aren't that great and I've had some bad luck job hunting and I'm supposed to heading back to my home country by the end of the month so thought I'd try my luck here. I'll follow the format that's already been laid out for simplicity.

Age: 26

Education background: Just completed my Masters in Economics. Have a BSc (Hons) in Economics and Politics

Job skills: Experienced user of Microsoft Office. Currently learning the basics of SQL. Much of my other experience is in the form of internships where I worked for around 6 months in the development sector. Worked on two development projects: one a local provincial one while the other was a UNDP flood relief program. Had to work on the field and do Monitoring and Evaluation work. Currently working as a volunteer at a children's charity retail shop here in the UK (Barnado's for those who are aware of it)

Language skills: English, Urdu, Hindi (spoken) and French (Basic)

Criminal conviction: None thankfully

Are you willing to consider alternative destinations? Yes. Just so long as it's not my home country which I'm not particularly fond of working in due to the current job market, the political situation and also because of my agnostic background (I come from a family with a somewhat conservative background). Plus, I'm not strictly hetero and that is kind of frowned upon my side of the world- more so because of the majority Muslim population factor here.

Temporary or permanent? Honestly, I'm not picky. I don't mind moving place to place trying to find the real job. However, I feel that if I just return back home then I feel I won't get the chance to ever work abroad since chances like these rarely come.

Nationality: Pakistani

I'm currently residing in UK and my student visa is due to expire by the end of this month. Renewing it doesn't seem like an easy task and I thought I'd come here for some advice and guidance since I'm really desperate as to how to proceed. Not sure if posting here will actually yield anything productive but I thought there's no harm in trying. That and some of the responses I read on the other posts seemed really useful so here's me humbly asking you folks for a chance to make things work for the better.

Thank you for your time and patience :)

I.e. I had calculated the GPA before summer, then just updated the portions that pertained to the Work I did that summer, and additional projects, I did not update the GPA. 

The transgression would take my ~3.3 reported GPA to about ~3.2. 

I want to make sure the company is aware, both so there is not problems with the mandatory background check they require and also because I feel it is the honest thing to do.

What would it take to become a coder at Google, if you had only one year to do so? 

Background: I'm a coder (now computer science researcher after working on a bunch of SV startups) graduated from Stanford about six years ago and me and my friends (couple of us do work at Google in the valley) were discussing ways someone with no coding experience could become 'Google' ready in one year.

We have an answer of our own (we'll post after getting some traction and feedback) but we were also curious what the various 'learn' communities (posted this question around on IRCs etc.) think the path should be.

Assume you have the full year, willing to work 24/7 on this, and are able to reinvent yourself. You're not a prodigy, but you're no slouch either. (Also no web designing/mobile shenanigans - that's cheating - I mean something with meat in it not just bells and whistles and graphics). 

Post either what you would think someone would have to learn (languages, concepts, a timeline of sorts, even relax some assumptions if you have to, number of projects/type of projects). Cheers!

************************************

EDIT (UPDATE): Wow! I didn't anticipate this thread would blow up here! Hopefully we can submit a long post on our thoughts on another blog (it is a couple of pages) which I'll link to here when it's done. BUT, I'll post the gist of what we are saying here.

*Adamchik*: ""It is **possible in terms of timeline but it is a hard road** (I graduated from a state college and moved to SF). It helps a lot if you have a **mentor, or even a group of friends that you just code jam** with. When I graduated with an Information Systems degree, I was more into web design as opposed to programming but I took about six months with friends to really dig into systems programming and assembly code so yeah it is possible, BUT it is hard. What I would do:

1) **timeline separated into six months** - the first six I would teach someone the pure basics, the essential mathematics and familiarity with a language. Have them building something basic so they understand what a language/framework can do/not do. 

2) The **next six would be focused on mastering the tool**, **building products** to showcase your prowess and having a **community profile**. The latter is key - we need to see what work you have done - whether it is open sourced contribution, your own projects, perhaps even a small internship, problem solving on things like Top Coder, Code Chef or Code Forces. 

Anything that showcases that **you know that TOOL inside and out. This is your portfolio**.""

*Jason*: ""One thing we want to emphasize, if you have only a year **focus on ONE tool/language**. Too many people list down 5 things, HTML5, Java, C#, C etc. But if you can't tell me why I would/wouldn't use C to build an OS, what so special about Java 8 then it shows me that you don't know programming enough. You don't know the algorithms, the nuances of the language, the data structures (ESPECIALLY HASH TABLES) then it's a moot point. 

Trust me, even if you don't think your tool doesn't get used all that often e.g. D or Ruby, we'll find out where you're needed. And the **good thing about knowing one tool in depth that it gets easier to learn something else when you need to**.""

*Adamchik*: ""Yep. There are tons of resources online to help you do this - not just learning to code. **Follow tech and programming blogs, have stack overflow bookmarked/see if you can answer some of the questions**. Being able to pass the **technical interview** is paramount - if you're going to put down Java, then be prepared to answer tons of **questions on the language, data structures, and problems** (not brain teasers) such as the 8 queens problem, how to **implement algorithms** such as Dijkstra's algorithm or **design patterns** such as facade pattern. All of these are tools in your belt - you need to know them and understand them because they really do help you out in day to day work.""

*Jason*: ""Try also be good at **debugging code** or **optimizing/improving** programs. This is where having a common group of friends/colleagues you regularly hang out with to learn helps because you can check each other. 

One last tip: try surfing online for computer science courses - perhaps even the syllabus or courses from top universities. I particularly like to surf Carnegie Mellon websites - majority of the course websites are on the internet for people to see the assignments and syllabus. You don't need to do the course itself, but having a general idea of what is being taught might help with how you tackle your own study plan. CMU websites on system programming helped me quite a bit, and their OS course is BRUTAL but really nice (I'm a Stanford grad).""

Other things I wanted to point out: Google isn't the be-all and end-all of software companies but it is a good validation of your skills if you can get through the process. And this does help with applying for other software companies. I'm also glad people pointed out that we are software engineers as opposed to coders - majority of the time you're problem solving as opposed to hard coding.

I just got off the phone with my friend, John, who is a wizard at his craft in programming.  John has been trying to get a second side-job to the current one that he is working, but he has been unable to actually get an interview because his professional experience is minimal... However a major corporation had him managing other software developers at a very young age after only a short internship.  

John was approached by a friend of his, Jane.  Jane asked him to interview for her for a 100% remote work position because she was having a hard time getting a job.  John agreed and not only took the interview, but received a job in return for Jane that was actually a step above what she was going to interview for.  

John is now actually working the position, pretending to be Jane, and is also continuing to work at his current position.  Because he is so good at what he does, he has thus far not raised any suspicions... however I believe he's committing a crime.  

Is he committing fraud?  What would the penalty for both John and Jane is this scenario?  "

* Nexus 7 would require special cord to connect
* Neither can ""cycle"" a group/folder of backgrounds (as far as I've read)
* Neither can run Firefox or Notepad++ portable, which I need for my research &amp; internship

1uf60d,10,2014-01-04,Should I work while I attend college? (long-ish description of my circumstances inside),unexplored,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1uf60d/should_i_work_while_i_attend_college_longish/,"Hey guys!

I'm gonna be starting college in the fall of 2014. I really like to prepare for everything so I've been thinking whether I should work during college or not. Personally, I don't want to work during college if it's not related to the field that I'm majoring in and here's why:

I'm 100% convinced that I want to major in business. However, the field of business that I want to major in usually varies from finance to accounting. As of the past few months, I've been thinking of doing a double major in Finance and MIS. Now, the reason for sharing this is that in the business world, it really matters who you know and not as much of what you know. Although the field of business that I want to major in varies from time to time, the fact that I have to network like crazy will remain constant. Now, let me add that I'm not going to a top school at all. I'm going to be going to FIU which is a large school in Miami. I have heard that large companies (including the Big 4) recruit there although it isn't a target school whatsoever.

Since I'm not going to a target school, I understand that I will have to go out of my way to have an advantage over my competition if I want to get a good job at a top firm. This is why I want to devote all of my time to being active in school. I have researched clubs at my school and I'd like to join some honor business societies and some service clubs and hopefully have leadership positions in some of them. To add on top of it, I'll be joining the Honors College (I already accepted my invitation) which requires the students to go to seminars, speeches, etc. In general, I'd like to attend as many networking events, career fairs, internship fairs, and seminars as I possibly can. I know that having a job will make this extremely hard and I don't want to sacrifice possible internship positions and connections because I'm working at a random place. Most importantly, I'm an over achiever when it comes to school so I really want to study my ass off and get no lower than a 3.8 GPA (we can all hope!).

Now to the money part:
I received a scholarship from the school that covers my full tuition (not room &amp; board although I'm planning on living at home so that's not really a problem). On top of that, I am eligible to get the highest Bright Futures scholarship which is $103 per credit. Since I have a scholarship, this will be reimbursed to me (around 3k per year). As for FAFSA, my brother and sister are both in college and receive the highest award which is around $5k since my family's source of income is very low. As you guys can see, although money is a problem in my household, my scholarships cover everything tuition-wise. 

The main reason why I'm debating whether I should work or not is because my mom is pushing me to get a job while I go to college. She doesn't think that the left over money from scholarships and grants will be enough for me to purchase everything necessary for college and she can't supply me with any financial help which is why she's so serious about me working. On top of that, my brother calls me lazy for not wanting to work which, of course, makes me rethink my not wanting to work. Conversely, when I ask my dad if he wants me to work during college, he says ""it depends where"", meaning, he doesn't want me to work at a coffee shop or a random place since, technically, I don't need the money for school. However, if I get an office job related to my field, then he wants me to definitely work.

Just to add, expected expenses while attending school include car insurance, gas money (I live about 10 miles from the campus and plan on driving there every day), as well as gym membership (at least $100/mo) and suits/business attire. Just like any person my age, I like to shop and go out with friends but I'm willing to sacrifice that lifestyle for success in school and in my future.

Sorry for the long post. I just feel that everyone has different circumstances and there is no straight answer to whether one should work in college. Hopefully I gave a detailed description of my scenario and I hope to get helpful advice.

Thanks in advance and props to you if you read it all!"

I’m a CS senior currently looking for my second software engineering internship. My situation is a little unique though. I'll finish classes this Spring, however I need to complete a second full-time internship this summer to earn the credits required for graduation. After the second internship, I'll be graduating in August. I actually look at it as a good situation compared to most, because I can immediately transition into permanent employment if it works out.

I've applied to a few startups, as well as one large corporation. I expected it to take a while before hearing back from the large corporation, but even the startups haven’t reached out to me yet. Starting to wonder if there was something wrong with my resume, so I’m requesting a resume critique.

A few factors to consider: 
1.) A majority of the positions require relocation. I do not see why this would be an issue, but I wanted to make a note of it.
2.) I originally listed May graduation on my resume when applying. Given my situation described above, I could see how this May (definitely a pun) have been a mistake on my part.

This is the last summer I have before graduating (in 3rd year), but my school offers a 12-16 month internship program to work at companies like IBM, AMD, Qualcomm, small/mid sized tech companies in Toronto. 

Wondering which would be benefit me the most when I start applying for full time jobs when it comes to graduation.

Working at Amazon I feel like is a 12 week interview for a full time offer to be given at the end. Interning for 12-16 months offers more project experience and development, but less reputable companies and a much lower hourly pay compared to Amazon and less interesting projects than Amazon (AWS S3).

Appreciate any advice!

I am at a leadership retreat right now in the middle of nowhere and have very limited/spotty internet access at best. I was just informed that I have a skype interview in 4 days for my first programming related internship. The job itself asks for knowledge of object oriented programming (my only experience is in .NET) and proficiency in the use of MS access. 

I have taken a class in MySQL, but know nothing about using access. Can anyone give me a quick rundown of the differences/similarities between the two, just so that I can talk intelligently enough to let my interviewers know that I will be able to apply my knowledge of one to the other? For that matter, I am working off of an assumption that access is a simpler DB tool, based on what I have heard in passing. If they are not as related as I thought, what are the basics that I need to know?

Since the internet here is so poor, I will probably just screenshot any useful responses and study them in my bunk. 

TLDR; I need a quick rundown of the similarities and differences between MySQL and MS access. I am familiar with MySQL, but know nothing about access.

Not all, since some classes were just too easy to not get A's in, but the classes that seem to matter and were challenging; I did do poorly in.  However, it misrepresents me as I've taken classes in other programming languages in High School.  While I was still no expert going into my first semester of college, I still had a much better position than lots of my classmates.  In fact, I voluntarily taught a lot of my classmates up until the point of a drastic change in my life.  I did my homework, and carefully helped shape the understanding of my friends who needed the help to grasp the point of our assignments and lessons and such.  Regardless, while it is not recorded in my transcripts that I fully can express the knowledge of the course content, I just could not bring myself to turn in assignments during the time of my downward spiral.  Thus, bringing down my grade and painting me a hopeless student.  You would not expect a student with my grade in the programming classes to be able to teach his classmates well enough to get A's and B's on their own assignments.  All while I was receiving D's and F's because I wasn't functioning as my normal self out of classes.  This worries me as I don't want to take the class again, although if it's my only option I would reconsider given my primary question doesn't have the predictably fortunate answer I want to hear.  Which I am wondering if I spent my extra time after homework working on Apps or games that would seem ideal to a company looking for new talent, the door being an internship.  Would companies weigh my laughably low grade higher than my sufficiently engineered mobile or web applications?  Personally, if I were the decider, I would weigh the experience and results higher than the graded history.  But also, I am not the decider in the real world.  Can anybody shed some light or give me some insight or even firsthand experience with the same situation?"

Although I had obtained a bachelors degree in social sciences in my home country, I never felt passion for it. Therefore, after working at several places and playing online poker for 1.5 years, at the age of 26 I decided to change the path of my live and dive into a field that kept me interested while I was 16-18 (I spent most of my offschool time learning flash5/mx (yep, I'm that old)). 
I chose to study abroad in Denmark, as the education is free. Being a poor guy from Eastern Europe, this was very important for me. I got admitted to, and studied in a two year program of Multimedia Design and Communication in one of the Danish education institutions. I was learning a broad subject list: html5/css3/jquery, some php/mysql, some actionscript3, web design, character illustration, video editing, etc). I soon discovered I liked designing and coding websites the most and got a feeling it's something I could do for the rest of my life. I was very happy I finally found my purpose at the age of 27. 

**The internship**
This autumn - for my final semester - I had to find an internship, so from this September to winter holidays I found a paid (khem.. compensated) Web Design/Frontend internship in a startup in Netherlands (I;ve always liked travelling and discovering new countries).

I was very optimistic about my situation at the beginning: interesting company with nice people, lots to learn, the atmosphere of agile web development; chance to get a full contract after it and settle in a new country, bring my girlfriend over, earn money, travel the world, etc.

I was very eager to work a lot at first, sometimes spending ten hours or more at work out of pure interest in design, html/css/javascript, trying to learn as much as I could and apply the knowledge immediately. I had many things to catch up with, that I had very minor experience in (git, bootstrap, wordpress). I don't think that went wrong, since I am now more or less comfortable in them. 

At first everything went well. We launched company's website, which I have remixed from a bootstrap based theme they bought off of themeforest and designed some things for the website/presentations also. 

But soon the internship started to turn into internshit, although I always had a hope those things were just temporary and I would get on track soon after they end...

* Having learned coding from the ground up (no frameworks, etc), it was difficult to start using bootstrap and only bootstrap. 
* No responsive design because""phone usage is too low""  (later they checked analytics and realized they had 50% of their visitors through phones.. sigh)
* Company's policy was to use as less custom code as possible, as ""there is someone else already who probably did this and this before"". (I don't know if this is a good approach and if it's everywhere in webdev companies, but it felt like my css skills (and they weren't that bad) were pretty much useless.).
* I soon started getting loads of projects in wordpress (boss had his own wordpress based webdev business on the side). I started hating wordpress with its constant bugs, plugin incompatibilities and websites crashing because of that. I was telling myself that at least I now know what I don't want to do further. 
* Inconsistencies in team management: boss saying I wasted time on designing some stuff for one of the projects although 3 hours ago he was telling he liked what I was making.
* Boss' remarks that I'm working too slow or my work is not good yet, or doesn't meet professional standards (well I'm trying it's only my first month ever in the business..)
* Boss unhappy about me doing slow work in wordpress or me not being able to solve some wordpress bugs (I'm not that good at php) 

**An (un)expected turn**
Soon company was happy to attract one frontend dev who used to work for google. That's when I started to feel my work wasn't good enough. (I have to say I felt hope again when our backend dev started cursing at all the code he had to fix made by the new guy (table layouts, missing &lt;/div&gt;s, poor css, questionable js)). 

As I was expecting, two weeks before the initial contract ended, boss told me I won't be working for them after christmas, reasons being: I'm too slow, my learning curve is too steep because of my age (I'm 28), I've made some major mistakes in wordpress projects (although he had just sold the company).

Soon after that my motivation had dropped by the day. I started arriving at work 9:00 sharp, going home for luch exactly 12:30-13:30, leaving 18:00, and not caring about work until the next day. I felt a decrease in my CSS/HTML skills, I was exhausted and demotivated, without any emotions at work. I must add that I looked at each job I got with responsibility and tried to do it good.

Two weeks before my leaving, they got a new frontend/backend intern (local student who probably won't be paid) and that's when I knew it's almost over. 

**Side projects**
Since I made some useful connections during the period, I now have two quite big projects to focus on that will take some time to make. The pay is tiny bit better, but I feel strong lack of skills in backend for one of them, and pessimistic of my skills overall. It's difficult to focus at home and discipline myself well enough to be productive in both of them, but I'm trying. 

**Further options**
So here I am, living in the Netherlands with my SO (finally), having two freelance projects, but being a bit pessimistic about my skills and future.

I have narrowed down my options:

First: Go back and study further in Denmark from February (top-up to bachelors in Web Development in 1.5 years (1+0.5 internship)) + freelance projects. Study program teaches:
* oop, data access, relational databases, sql, 
* web security
* php frameworks
* advanced js, dom, html5, css3
* web communication sociology
* UI design and aesthetics
* some media stuff

Second: Get my shit together and work on freelance projects here fulltime, perhaps register a company; focus on studying on my own.

Third: Search for frontend job here in Netherlands and possibly maintain one or two freelance projects. learn at work + study on my own a bit.

TLDR;
Read: 'Further options'

I would appreciate any insights into my situation and any advice."

* We're at a point where we can make a change.  I'm about to graduate with my master's degree, and my husband feels that it's time to move on from his job.

* Husband [22]: graduated May 2013, has a degree in mechanical engineering. He's been with his company for several years, working first as an intern, then full time.  

* My [24] undergrad degree was in science education, but after teaching abroad for a short time in two different countries, I got more interested in international relations.  My master's is in essentially global education, but I don't think my heart really lies in education (rather, I'm interested in university study abroad program development,  government jobs, non-profits, possibly even some kind of business application for my skill set).

* I speak decent Spanish, my husband might be able to conjure up some Japanese from his highschool classes. Open to new languages.

* I have a underage alcohol consumption citation from when I was 18.

* We are looking for a permanent home. 

**What we're looking for in a new place:**

We both really love working, so we're looking for good job situations for both of us.  Ideally, wherever we move will have a globally active population for me, and hands-on engineering opportunities for my husband.  I could teach, but I'm honestly not interested. 

We're homebodies, so while it's fun to live in a city that has a great nightlife, we prefer to hang out with our dogs and each other in the evening (reading, watching TV, cooking).  On the weekends, we love going hiking with our dogs (Mountains are a plus), out to dinner, shopping, and my husband has a motorcycle.  He also has a road bike that I'm sure he'd like to use more in the summer.  The best thing about the city that we live in now is that they have an awesome food selection! 

We have three dogs who **must** come with us.  They are 20, 50 and 80lbs. They're the most important things in our lives, and we won't be going anywhere without them. We realize that this is very limiting, unfortunately.  They need some kind of fenced in yard, courtyard, etc. 

EDIT: Dogs are a german shepherd, hound dog x boxer mix (though she's clearly more houndish), and a jack russel mutt.

We currently live in the southeast of the US, and we're tired of the muggy, hot summers.  We would prefer a cooler, or at a minimum, a less humid climate.  

We're very open to staying in the US, but we're excited to hear ideas about other countries that might desire our educational backgrounds while still providing a good home for our dogs.  

**Tl;dr: Husband and wife and looking for cooler climate where we can *bring our dogs*, both find jobs in our respective fields of engineering and international relations/educational development, be around culturally diverse people, and eat lots of awesome food.  Open to literally anywhere.**

I've been at a good software engineering job post college for about six months now. I'm not seriously considering changing jobs in the near future but I wanted to put together a new resume with my new job/skills on it so I can send it around and test the waters a little bit.

At this point, now that I have some real skills and experience, is it reasonable to start dropping menial jobs from my 'experience' section? I worked as a summer camp counselor for like, three or four summers when I was 15-18 or so before college, but I can't imagine that any future employer would care. Without it though, my experience section seems a little bare (just my current job and a CS internship after my 3rd year)."
1uhhw2,3,2014-01-05,Undergrad accounting major looking for input on MBA.,Calvinhedge,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1uhhw2/undergrad_accounting_major_looking_for_input_on/,"Hello /r/MBA! I've been a long-time lurker that has finally decided to add yet another advice post to the mix. 

I'm currently an undergrad at a large public university in the Midwest (Colorado), and am in my Senior year of my concurrent MS/BS accounting program. I've got another year till graduation, so my motto this year is YOAST- You're Only A Senior Twice. 

I've spent a good amount of time talking to several faculty and top 20 MBA alumni at my school, and have been seriously considering looking into an MBA down the road. My main reasoning behind this is to keep myself from being pigeon-holed as merely an accountant for the rest of my career and open doors to job opportunities beyond the traditional CPA --&gt; Internal Audit --&gt; Controller route. I can't claim to know what specifically I'd like to do, as I'm still a naive college kid, but I do have some thoughts. 

As I have another 1.5 years left in school before graduation, I was looking to see what would be helpful to do in regards to admittance. I feel as if I have some of the boxes checked, but would like to know what I can do now to improve my chances in the future. I realize I'm not going to get into H/S/W, but I am absolutely shooting for top 20- I don't know if it would be worth it otherwise.

* Concentration is in Accounting (MS and BS), with a certificate in Info Systems. 

* GPA is 3.4, major GPA is 3.8. Rough start from a transfer, but I've been on Dean's List (&gt;3.75) for the past 3 semesters including this past one. Trying to get it up as much as possible the last 3 semesters

* I've interned at a local dairy/foods company in an process improvement role. Will be interning with PwC this coming summer and will *hopefully* be getting a full time offer for after graduation. Most interns do from what I've been told.

* Plan on obtaining the CPA before beginning work after graduation

* GMAT- I took it to get into my program, but didn't take it very seriously (only needed a 550). I got a 630 without studying more than a few hours, I feel confident I can raise it to a 700 with enough studying.

* Extracurriculars. I really enjoy being involved at school, and it's been my favorite part of college. I'm currently president of my business fraternity, a Tri-Exec on the business student government, and a Junior/Senior representative to the curriculum advisory committee. I'm also involved with our professional mentorship program, and have an awesome mentor if that counts for anything. A few other volunteer activities, etc. but those are the big ones.

* Relevant classes. I'm in a lot of accounting, but know I have a gap with finance classes, as I had to double up on major courses due to the transfer. I'm taking info system classes (SQL work, databases, VBA, etc.) and am in an invitation-only leadership class where we present cases to visiting executives several times a semester, which has been awesome! Don't know if this is important, however...

**TL;DR: Accounting undergrad looking for ways to put myself in a better position for MBA if I choose to go that route in a few years. Any input appreciated.**

Hope none of that sounded too noobish- I'm just looking for ways to continue to improve myself and have the best possible shot at getting into a good program if I choose to. Any advice or critiques are greatly appreciated!"

I have an internship that gives me money enough to support myself and take care of the dog.

The main reason why I wanted a dog is because I feel like this house is too quiet most of the time, and even though I live with my friends I often feel quite lonely, and wanted a little buddy to keep me company. It's not an out of the blue decision either, I've been thinking for almost a year now, and I even went to vets near my house to ask how much I would spent to take of it, so that's all fine.

On the other hand, I'm unsure because last dog I had, died when I was 13, and I remember actually feeling relieved because back then I hate nothing more than taking it for three walks a day. And also because if I buy a dog now, most of the days it would stay home alone until we come back from classes (around 7pm), and I don't want the dog to suffer.

What do you guys think?"

1uj2ds,4,2014-01-06,Rant about impossible family situation ... be warned.,saddetective87,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1uj2ds/rant_about_impossible_family_situation_be_warned/,"Okay, so I grew up in a ""family"" with a single mom and three brothers. The brothers I have had no real problem with, but my mother is a different story. She is a co-dependent, dysfunction, borderline personality nightmare that spent the first twenty years of my life (as far as I can remember) randomly terrorizing her children with random recrimination, bargaining for affection, and generally being emotionally abusive.

So I leave for university when i am twenty after two years at the local college where I was living alone with her as my brothers had moved out. During that time I put myself through college by working at a hotel, and on particularly bad days I considered throwing myself in front of some railway tracks that I had to cross in order to get to work. I got into university, and after about six months I realized I needed to go into therapy because my self-esteem was zero (I had always known it was low but had no idea how to deal with it). Three years of therapy, changing my major, joining the army as a reserve officer, rediscovering my love of martial arts and athleticism (I do Bujinkan ninjutsu and yoga along with weightlifting), taking some paid civie internships, paying for university with no student debt (I live in Canada so it's just possible) and making some friends and traveling a bit I feel okay with myself, just going through the normal problems of being young, in school and dealing with a shitty job market.

During that time I progressively limited my contact with my mother and made an effort to reconnect with my father (they are divorced obviously) and my extended family who I wasn't allowed to know growing up (my mother basically cut off all contact with them and didn't encourage us to know them either). Last Christmas she came to town (as three of my four brothers were in town) and there were three separate occasions where I was at the door ready to walk out, or one occasion where I almost broke my twin brothers jaw for siding with my mother's behavior (he is an enabler). After that (and the fact that she given me a verbally and emotionally abusive phone call at the beginning of that year -- her claim that my working at a summer posting with the army was insufficient reason for not visiting her even though it was impossible to go visit her with the amount of leave that I had and the distance - i would just, and I mean just, be able to get there before I had to start heading back -- that sent me into a year long depression forcing me to take a leave of absence from school that I eventually pulled myself out of) I made the decision to cut off all contact. A year has passed.

And you know what happened? My life improved. I got out of the dumps, back into school and I started to explore my life more than I had before.

Now comes the shitty part. I spent this Christmas with my aunt, uncle and cousins which was great because they are functional human beings who are actually nice to me instead of guiltily controlling everything that I try and do. Well I come back after Boxing Day and I still refuse to see my mother because I just don't want to. Then a couple of days ago I get a skype call from my eldest brother from oversees who says I need to reconnect with her because he thinks that she has the beginning of dementia (her mother had it and I spotted her symptoms two years ago but none of my brothers were willing to accept our mother had it), and that I needed to mend the fence before it was too late. I also needed to get together with them to start to figure out what we were going to do to support her in her old age (she is reaching 60 but she has the mentality of an addled 70 year old). 

This is a woman who tore my mental health to shreds growing up, didn't actually support us because my paternal grandfather sent her a monthly stipend and bought her house for her, destroyed my father, drove me to the point of contemplating suicide at a few points of my life, prevented me from having a relationship with my dad and his part of the family, taught me to be afraid of everything and not to stand up for myself, did not allow me to go out during high school for anything (I still have some social problems to this day) and belittled everything that I ever did: becoming a freelance journalist with a lot of work to my name (she once called them scribbles for a pathetic little rag - try a couple of international newspapers), becoming an Army officer, paying for my own degree, and exploring the world around me a bit. And now I am just supposed to forget all that and just worry about taking care of her when I have barely started my own life after she robbed me of the first twenty years of it? 

This may sound cold, but that is cosmically unfair. "

So I know in computer science many say you should get summer internships starting your sophomore year, look into having side projects, have a github, contribute to open source projects, etc. Does most of this also apply to M E?

I was interested in CS but I didn't like it too much and M E was always my second choice. With CS my plan was to hopefully get an internship at one of the big places (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) during the summers. I'll be honest, I know little of the various M E disciplines or field in general. What would be some ideal companies in the M E world that offer internships for students (I live in Seattle so hopefully that's good)? 

Basically, what is the optimal plan/track/route for students to have a nice job lined up when graduating? Is all this less important than I think it is?

I was offered an internship at a large software company this fall.  Nothing else was at the table at that point, and they pay well, so I accepted it, despite not being thrilled with the job.  There was no contract or anything signed, just a verbal agreement with the hiring manager.

A few weeks later, a company that I was really interested in contacted me.  I decided to interview for the sake of technical interview practice (and it was exceptionally worthwhile in that respect).  I was pretty honest with them about the other positions (I said I had received another offer and that I was extremely seriously considering it.).  They said they wanted to continue the interview process anyways, and now they've offered me a position.

I'm really interested in the work the second company is doing, and I like my department and project a lot.  It's much more well known, and more representative of the tech industry, I think. The pay is very comparable to the first company, and it's in a location I much prefer.

Which leaves me considering backing out of my agreement with the first company.  I imagine they'd be rather annoyed, and I wouldn't have much of a chance of working there later on (but I'm not particularly interested in doing so anyways).  It's also early enough that they should have no problem filling my space, as opposed to if it were May or something like that, and I haven't been assigned to a department or team yet either.

But, of course, I'm much better at justifying the decision I want to make than look at this fairly.  So that's why I'm here: how bad is it to renege on the first internship?  Are there burned bridges that I'm not considering?"

1ukh2w,1,2014-01-06,Career changer seeking entry-level job/internship in health care while in school... What's out there for someone with very limited pertinent experience?,michaelnotjoe,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ukh2w/career_changer_seeking_entrylevel_jobinternship/,"Long story (sorta) short:

I've worked for a few years for a large med school as a standardized patient &amp; patient instructor, working with med students teaching basic exam and communication skills. Initially I sought the job to support my career as an actor, but over the years my interest in acting waned while my interest in healthcare grew.

When I got my original undergrad BA in theatre, I took very limited science coursework. Last year I began taking relevant coursework as an undergrad and have completed gen bio/chem sequences with a dash of physics. I figure this is a necessary foundation for about any career I'd pursue in healthcare. I hope to finish my prereqs in the next year and then apply to career-specific program.

While I continue my education, I'd like to find a part-time job or internship in the field that will expand my understanding of the industry and maybe put a couple bucks in my pocket toward tuition. Honestly, I'd be happy to clean the toilets in an office if it lets me pick up 5 minutes worth of useful knowledge or experience every day... but ideally there's something better out there.

I am:
-Experienced in basic physical exam skills and concepts, and in basic bio/chem, but very little else that's relevant to healthcare
-A good communicator who enjoys dealing with people
-Nifty with computers, entering/handling/interpreting data
-A pretty quick (and dedicated) study

I'm looking for a job that:
-Doesn't inhibit my ability to attend school
-Will better familiarize me with the industry (ideally in a clinical setting, but I'm realistic)
-If possible, allows me to make useful connections with those already in/related to the career I choose (but again, realistic)

For what it's worth, the careers that are still on the table at this point are, in no particular order:
-Occupational Therapist
-Physical Therapist
-PT Assistant
-Physician Assistant
-Speech Pathologist
-Registered Nurse
-Respiratory Therapist
-Radiologic Tech
-Cardiovascular Tech
-Nuclear Med Tech
-Diagnostic Sonographer

...So a pretty wide net. 

Anyhow, given all of this: What jobs are out there that I might be qualified for, right now, while still in school? I'm doing as much research as I can on my own, but I know a lot of y'all are smart / more familiar with the industry than I. All help in any shape or form is very appreciated.

TL;DR: What part-time entry-level jobs (or internships) are available for somebody currently in school pursuing a career in healthcare? Assume said person has pretty limited experience in the field but is generally eager to learn/willing to work hard/not a schmuck. Thanks for responding!

I'm a serious dog person and have been bereft of a furry friend for many years now. In eight months, I'll be starting a mechanical engineering program after having been out of college for about 12 years. Expecting to have a lot going on which has been halting me from getting a pooch. 

I would dearly love to have a dog in my life again and have felt this way for several years. It won't be just me, I've a hubby who will be around, though the walking and such will be mostly on me. I've a lot of experience with dogs up till I was 25 (12 years ago) and even did a few years of college while having my last dog, so I do have an idea of what to expect. 

Thing is - I was a different major and it wasn't as intensive of a study program. I'm not really sure what to expect later this year when I start back to college, though if I were to get a dog, now would be the time to do it when I have a lot of time free to get it settled and work on training. 

So who's had a dog while going through an engineering degree? Would you do it again? Did the dog suffer for you being gone too much or how did you find ways to fit it all together?

For internships and such, hubby said he'd take care of it no problem since he'll have more time without me around... lol :) At least that's covered!

Thanks for all input!"

Please help!",[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1unlqp/intern_trying_to_figure_out_a_career_path_in_the/,"I have been working in the industry at one particular job as an intern for almost four years, ever since I had graduated from high school, but I am, at the moment, undecided on how I should further proceed with my career, and am seeking guidance from experienced system administrators to find out as to how to finally have a permanent position of my own, as a result.

Within the last several months, I have decided that I was confident I wanted to continue with a career in the IT industry, as I am passionate about, and fascinated over, computer technology. I live and breathe computer technology every single day, and can't possibly see myself living without it by my side. It is, and will always be, my livelihood.

With that being said, I have been a recent convert of GNU/Linux and have been further expanding my technical knowledge during my personal time, simply out of pure fun and curiosity. I currently manipulate programs via config files to my liking, create and improve on bash scripts from scratch to develop a proper file backup solution, using SSH and other GNU utilities, on a couple of personal servers, and perform many other tasks related to file/directory manipulation and security practices via the command line, and I genuinely enjoy every moment of this experience. I would love to, however, take this experience to the next level and turn it into a potential job outside my man cave.

I also recently attained a VCA-DCV certification, as I am also interested in virtualization in an enterprise environment. I have experience dealing with virtual machines on a personal level, but would also love to specialize in VMware, as well, and learn my way through by tinkering with an ESXi host.

However, I don't have many responsibilities in my current position, as an intern. I work with Windows servers and workstations, and deal with occasional workstation deployments and the installation and proper configuration of software that our end users require. To allieviate this process, I have created a somewhat complex PowerShell script to handle backups of user profiles. I also handle the termination of dismissed employees and, as a result, have basic experience in AD and Exchange, but this is essentially all I do. Sure, I can also assemble hardware components and open a computer's casing to diagnose an issue,  but I cannot seem to expand my list of responsibilities past what I have now. No matter how many times I ask to help assist with this or that to gain some more experience in the field, I can't seem to get any of my colleagues to help me. I am also trying to expand my knowledge on the fundamentals of networking using my work experience, but to no avail. Outside of dealing with my router by opening and forwarding ports, assigning static IP addresses to specific MAC addresses, and other configurations done on a consumer router, not much networking experience has been gained in this job of mine.

I feel as though my technical background may not be sufficient enough to find a part-time or full-time position elsewhere, even though I reside in one of the hottest metropolitan areas for sysadmin positions in the United States.

Perhaps I am not confident enough to realize my potential in this field, but I am a bit intimidated by those who have much more experience than me and, in a sense, fearful of taking the next step.

But, at this rate, should I consider pursuing more certifications, beginning with A+, to fill in any potential gaps in my technical knowledge? Should I just skip that for now and search for a junior sysadmin position anyway and hope for the best? I simply cannot do helpdesk work, as I deal with a speech impediment, but I believe my current work experience will allow me to dodge that very bullet, but I am unsure as to whether or not that is true.

Please help me figure out a career path, fellow sysadmins! Thank you, in advance!"

Sorry if these are particularly obvious questions, but I've looked around and haven't really found the answers I'm looking for.

Some background info: I'm currently halfway through my first year at university for CS. I'm loving it so far, and I have a pretty solid knowledge of OO principles and concepts, and I'm reasonably confident with Java and Python. I am also currently building a couple of little apps on Android to further my knowledge. For my first semester, I achieved a GPA of 3.5

So my questions!

1. Are the requirements for acceptance into the Google Internship program less difficult to achieve than a graduate Software Engineering job? I know that intuitively the answer would be yes, but from what I've seen, it's a lot of the same stuff (knowledge of data structures and algorithms, strong knowledge of one or two languages)

2. Does the Google Internship program in the US accept applicants from other countries? (The application page makes no note of having to be in the US, but I'm not too sure if this is something that commonly happens) If so, do they pay for relocation? 

3. Could I realistically land an internship at Google at the beginning of next year? If so, what should I focus on learning and what resources would be good to look over/learn from?

Funny you mention it, it recently happened to me at work. My wife had made some spicy Sichuan hot pot the night before, so at around 10AM, I feel the explosive urge to shit. Initially I tried going to my factory dormitory to laduzi in private, but when I get there I discover the ayi (read: housekeeper) apparently likes to take a shower every morning in my room, so I'm locked out of my own fucking bathroom. There isn't an elevator in my dormitory and I reside on the fifth floor, so with each step I can feel my asshole puckering to contain all of the laduzi as I run around trying to find a bathroom in my factory. What do you know - all of the Western toilet stalls in my department are occupied. I resign to using the factory workers' bathrooms, which consist of a bunch of squat stalls that stop at eye-level, don't have doors (just those small swinging doors you see in saloons, the name escapes me) so I'm assaulted by the sight of a bunch of Chinese dudes squatting, shitting, and smoking while playing on their iPhone 88s as I try to find an empty stall. I finally find an empty one at the end of the bathroom. I discover that this style of Chinese toilet is merely just one long trench running underneath all of the stalls before it, meaning there is actually a river of shit flowing towards the hole in the ground in my stall. I am struggling to squat as I expel the demonic Sichuan hot pot as it mixes in with all of the other shit from the stalls next to me. It was a horrible experience.
 |But no, I never call out of work when laduzi calls. It is also pretty much impossible to work entirely from home in this type of career. I did call out once for food poisoning, though.

The best advice I can give to anybody trying to pull off crazy shit like working in China is to just do it - don't try, just tell yourself you're going to do it and then go out and do it.

I drink some coffee and start mulling through emails sent overnight (since there's a 12-hour time difference from China and New York) from our brand's office. Afterwards I'll stroll around the factory and check up on the sample assembly lines they have running. I'll usually finish up at around 11:30AM, take a two hour break, return to work at 1:30PM and attend different sorts of meetings - shoe fittings, manufacturing issues, quality assurance with component suppliers. More emails, more translations. If all is well and there's no more work to be done, I take a company shuttle at 5:00PM. Since this is a busy season, we actually pull overtime until about 9:00PM.

The materials Nine West uses are very cheap compared to Prada. My rule of thumb is to take the price of a shoe and divide it by 4 (sometimes 5) to figure out how much it actually costs to make. I don't develop for them, but I'm guessing Nine West costs about $20 per pair, but it varies on how many components they use, which materials for the upper, etc. Upper-tier brands like Prada and Alexander Wang use materials like baby calf skins (imported from Italy) which are definitely more expensive than the Indian kid skins Nine West might use. Each brand is run by a different development team which have separate standards. Upper-tier and lower-tier shoes are usually developed in different sample rooms before being approved for the mainstream market. When it boils down to production, though, yes - the same machines and workers making your Prada heels have likely made a bunch of Nine West pumps the week before.

This past summer was full of blue skies and rarely smoggy. I don't wear a mask unless I'm sick or if there's an outbreak of some illness. However, major cities like Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing have become increasingly worse with their smog. I went to GZ last week and I couldn't believe how bad it's gotten since I went there. I avoid traveling north because of the smog. The winds carry that shit down here and it sucks; it will probably factor into me leaving China if it isn't fixed within five years.

[What do you do if workers commit suicide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/cekk1rl?context=5)|That kind of shit doesn't happen at my factory. We don't have any ""suicide nets"" or any of that crazy stuff like they do at Foxconn. Completely different industry and a different line of work.
[Tell me is Western workforce wanted in China. I am from europ and if I was interested in working in China. Would I have some preferential status as white guy?  *ninja edit*  In what areas is China looking for skilled workforce? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/ceke4gz?context=5)|Like any other country, you need marketable skills that make you stand out from the average Chinese guy. Maybe you're bilingual, maybe you have business connections back home, maybe you cook well, I don't know. Yes, you'll get preferential status as a white guy, but that shouldn't be why you want to go.
[How did you meet your wife and what was the dating to wedding process like compared to America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/cekonhu?context=5)|I met my wife while I was out shopping, weirdly enough. She was working at a cellphone kiosk while she was in college. She gave me her number, went on a couple dates, moved in together after a few months, got married four years later. The wedding process is pretty similar to the US; it's actually kind of nice that we get to take a photo together for our wedding license. She chose not to do a traditional Chinese wedding because of her bad relationship with her family, but we had a small celebration back home in Boston this past summer. 
[What  can you tell me, if anything, about the Nike Red October Air Yeezy 2? Can you get me a legit pair? I heard they smuggled pairs out of the factory before shipment or around completion. Then I heard Nike ordered all pairs to be destroyed.. but some are floating around on eBay and some celebrities have legit pairs and as do some really big sneaker heads. In all seriousness, do you have anything to do with Nike or their shoes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/ceklrxo?context=5)|Sorry, don't work with Nike. I only do women's shoes in my factory.
[My wife loves her Christian Louboutin's..  Anything I should tell her about the shoes? Are they even really made in Italy?  We don't buy our nicer stuff used or Craigslist.. Only stick to Saks, Bloomies, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/cekql3m?context=5)|I haven't heard about Christian Louboutin making shoes in China. Miu Miu is definitely manufactured here, though. 
[Duuude! So weird. I remember your username for some reason - you must have posted in the /r/hongkong thread a few years ago and I vaguely remember your other AMA. BUT YOU WEREN'T MARRIED AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE A KID YET (this is so weird/creepy that I remember this...\) Congrats on all the changes -- I vaguely remember back then you were still dating around/your students or something?? So nice to see an update!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/cel764n?context=5)|Wow, great memory. Thanks! It's been an eventful four years for sure.
[Any tips for getting a job in China besides ESL? I'm currently in beijing studying Chinese, and hope to land a factory job somewhere, as an engineer. I'm also American and married to a Chinese girl, no children yet though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/cekl8ob?context=5)|Network the shit out of yourself. Look for industry events and conventions. Foreign technicians make a company look great, and with your Chinese language skills, you might have a shot at it. Good luck.
[How is the pollution where you live/work? My brother-in-law goes to China about two months a year to work on a power project and the town he works in rains coal dust every day. He said the pollution over there is unimaginably bad compared to over here in Canada.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1up3gz/im_a_25yo_white_american_working_in_china_at_one/cekk4yf?context=5)|It was pretty bad a couple years ago, but a lot more regulated now. Sounds like your brother-in-law works up north where most of the coal production is. I'm sure it's as bad as he says.
[I'm learning Mandarin at the moment (English speaker already fluent in Thai\), any tips?

1uq0fo,2,2014-01-08,I need to learn asp classic...,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1uq0fo/i_need_to_learn_asp_classic/,"So I'm working for a company that has a browser based CRM written in ASP classic. This is my first job in IT and I'm not done with my 2 year technical degree yet. I have about 7 classes left which are more advanced programming classes.

If I can learn asp classic I could wind up in a developer position. If not at least I learned a new language. I need to learn asp classic which, correct me if I'm wrong, is vb script. Obvious database work as well. I figure this would be a good opportunity to learn this stuff in a business setting.

Can anyone give me some direction towards a great book or web tutorials for picking this up? I have a 100$ gift card to Amazon. I'm pretty inexperienced in the whole server side web programming. Most of the programming I have done has been application programming in Java.

P.S. This was suppose to be a paid internship type job that I have been at for more then a year now. Their promises of mentoring have not gone very far pass help desk type stuff(call center). It's hard to get anything out of the 3 developers I work with so I want to take the initiative to learn this on my own. 

Any help is greatly appreciated."

_______________________________

May 26th: ...Freddie Maxwell worked the night shift at the Hess Gas Station on Ketcham Road in Altamont. He’d had other jobs and other schedules over the years but this one seemed to suit his temperament and sleep schedule best.  His family worried about him working alone from eleven in the evening until seven a.m. but he assured them he was perfectly safe. After midnight he was for all intents and purposes locked into the building; he could only communicate with customers via a speaker set into bulletproof glass and anyone wanting to exchange cash for goods would have to perform the transaction by way of a metal drawer.

That wasn’t to say he didn’t see more than his fair share of cranks and weirdos while he waited for sunrise. From his secure little box Freddie had seen all manner of hook-ups, break-ups and freak-outs. That was one of the things his friends always said about him, “Freddie always has the craziest stories.”

Security footage recovered from the scene shows a figure walking into the gas station parking lot at 12:40 a.m.. The shape approaching the secured building was slumped and seemed to carry its own shadows with it. It held a thin length of metal in its right hand and dragged it along the asphalt as it walked. Freddie was too busy sleeping and didn’t notice the stranger until a filthy, lichen coated hand rapped against the bulletproof glass. Freddie started but then, ever the professional, shifted into customer service mode. He asked the bearded, grimy figure, “Can I help you sir?”

When the stranger spoke the audio on the security tape went wild with static, obscuring the voice. Whatever he said sent the suddenly terrified young cashier scrambling away. 

All Hess late shift workers are required to wear what is called a ‘Panic Button’, pressing that button sends the local police speeding to the rescue. The security video clearly shows Freddie pressing the ‘Panic Button’ but no alert ever reached the local authorities.

At 12:44 a.m. the Hess Station trembled, the shelves toppled and the thick, security glass of the building’s walls and windows shattered as though they had been struck by a thousand invisible fists. The stranger must have spoken again because the security camera’s audio erupted into fresh wave of static that faded away just in time for the viewer to hear Freddie’s final plea for mercy.

So, in the end Freddie Maxwell’s craziest night shift story of all was the one he never lived to tell...


**[THE NIGHT BLOGGER: A Season In Hell Episode Sixteen ‘Personal Journal Entry#156’](http://albruno3.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-night-blogger-season-in-hell.html)**
by
Al Bruno III


*...where was I when Freddie Maxwell met his demise? Where was I when I learned about the Black Door? Where was I when my research buddy almost got killed? I was at my favorite bar of course. Jasper Moradi and I were both in that wonderful place that exists between Not Sober and Not Sloppy Drunk. We had run into another dead end in our hunt for the vorvolaka but thanks to him I had just learned a stunning new fact.*

*“This...” I looked around the Blue Valentine in confusion, “...is a gay bar?”*

*Jasper snickered while ordering another round, “You didn’t know?”*

*“It... It doesn’t look like a gay bar...”*

*“You were expecting it to look like Elton John’s basement?”*

*“But there are women here...” I’d like to be able to tell you readers that it was the seven white Russians that were making me this clueless but we all know the truth.*

*“Yes, there are,” Jasper said. “and there are gay men in straight bars. Truly we live in an age of wonders.”*

*I have to admit that my impressions of what the inside of a gay bar looked like were primarily influenced by the Blue Oyster from the Police Academy movies. A nightmarish vision of a dimly lit dive full of leather clad men forcing unsuspecting straights to dance with them to jaunty salsa tunes.* 

*Blue Oyster? Blue Valentine? Was it a color scheme thing?*

*“Maybe we should go somewhere else?” I suggested.*

*“Oh don’t worry about it,” Jasper said. “Lets talk about something interesting. I think I’ve found a copy of the Liber Cicatrices in readable condition. I’ll just need to go to- To go to- What is that smell?”*

*The man approaching our table smelled and looked like he had come from a swamp. The first thing I noticed was that he was carrying a serrated length of metal that only bore a passing resemblance to a sword. My eyes traced a straight line from the stranger’s weapon arm to his face. It was a face made cadaverous by necrosis and eyes made insane by abandonment. Strings of lichen hung from his clothes and was tangled in his long hair. “Didn’t you hear...” he spoke revealing teeth that were as discolored and bent as his weapon, “...the clawing at the Black Door?”*

*All around us people were making for the exits. Jasper had his hand and mouth over his nose. I was pretty sure the question was directed at me so I said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t even know who you are.”*

*The stranger started to cry, his tears cut veins through the filth that coated his face, “You made a sacrifice of me.”*

*“Now just a minute here-”*

*He raised the blade over his head, I hit the floor with practiced ease. But he didn’t go after me, he went after Jasper. The weapon missed my friend’s head by inches. Swamp Man was screaming now, he sounded like an animal left to die in a trap. He took another swing at Jasper but before that blow had a chance to connect I kicked my friend’s seat over.*

*“Who the Hell is this guy?” Jasper asked.*

*“I don’t know!” And I really didn’t.*

*“Whoever he is I think he watched too much Highlander II.”*

*“Highlander II?” I almost turned away from our assailant so I could give Jasper a dirty look, “You’re thinking about Highlander II now?”*

*Swamp Man attacked again swinging the weapon like a demented samurai warrior. I grabbed a chair and deflected the blow. I positioned myself between Swamp Man and Jasper looking like some kind of a third rate lion tamer. “Listen,” I said, “we can talk about this.”*

*“Too late now,” he sobbed, “too late now. I’ve seen the secret at the heart of the Never that beats behind the Black Door.”*

*“Wait. Just wait and tell me what’s going on.”*

*“Why?” Swamp Man brought the length of metal down with enough force to smash the chair to pieces, “So you can put it on your fucking blog?”*

*The next words out of his mouth weren’t really words at all, they were collections of ugly syllables that shattered all the glasses and windows of the Blue Valentine and made me feel like I was drowning. Swamp Man raised the weapon high over his head. I raised my arm in a feeble attempt to protect Jasper and myself.*

*And that was when one of the bar patrons shot Swamp Man dead...*

+

...The bullet punched a hole through the back of Swamp Man’s skull and when that bullet came out the other side it made an even bigger hole. Swamp Man dropped dead at my feet. Maybe it was a trick of the light or the ungodly number of drinks I’d downed but the stuff leaking from his skull didn’t look like any kind of blood I’d ever seen.

Fact: The events of that night have forced me to reevaluate my opposition to concealed carry laws.

The first thing the police did after they arrived was give me the standard ‘Not this guy again look.’ Then they ushered everyone out of the building and sealed the area. Not sealed the area in the crime scene sense but sealed the area in the hazmat sense. Since I had a bit of Swamp Man’s brains on my favorite t-shirt they took it into evidence.

Fact: I don’t think I’m ever going to get my White Brains On Toast 2003 world tour shirt back.

Once the police had finished with us Jasper and I headed back to his place for a little research. We had some wine and while he went through his volumes of questionable lore on modern day supernatural legends I logged into the FEAROFTRUTH message board and started asking questions.

Fact: The legend of the Black Door is your standard Book of Revelation/ “The stars are right” kind of stuff. It says that there is another world near ours; a world that the Creator turned his back on because the creatures that lived there were worse than any devil or angel you might imagine. This world is called ‘Nix’ or ‘Never’ and there is a heart at its center. That heart beats slowly and irregularly but when it does the Black Door opens.

Where does the truth begin and the half-assed metaphors end? I can’t tell you yet. What I can tell you is that Jasper has no idea why Highlander II popped into his head in that moment of crisis.

Fact: Highlander II sucks ass.

I can tell you is that I stole a bit of evidence before the police ushered us out of the Blue Valentine, a clump of the slimy plants that covered our attacker.

I’m no horticulturist but ‘ShortRound92‘ from the forums is and was able to tell me that the vegetable matter in question was tillandsia usneoides or, in layman’s terms Spanish Moss.

Fact: Spanish Moss is not even remotely native to New York.

When you get right down to it Jasper and the regulars from FEAROFTRUTH did all the work; ‘50Fingers’ got me the surveillance footage from the Hess Station, ‘ObamaWanKenobi’ worked as an intern at the Altamont county morgue and found out that Freddie Maxwell’s heart had collapsed and ‘ScaredGhost’ was the one that found the eventual, unexpected destination of the hazmat truck.

Fact: The hazmat truck was found in a ditch along the Northway, the crew dead, the body of Swamp Man missing.

1ur9s1,24,2014-01-08,[Rant/Life Advice] I'm in a CS slump after dedicating the past year to learning to code &amp; finally getting a job. Everything past what I need to do my job feels hard and impossible to learn. Any advice from the peanut gallery? What were your emotional speed bumps when learning to code?,awesomeflyinghamster,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ur9s1/rantlife_advice_im_in_a_cs_slump_after_dedicating/,"TL;DR: Spent last year learning to code (Ruby). Now have a job as a Jr. Dev. Not really progressing beyond basic daily tasks and feeling extremely overwhelmed with how much core computer science knowledge I do not have, with no idea how to learn it. Getting a bad attitude about that as well that I'm not sure how to turn around. 

-------------

Some background - I took 2 CS courses in college, one being the ""weed out"" major course using Java, so I knew more than some. This past year, decided to pursue CS full time; got an internship (company uses Ruby on Rails, not my first choice but oh well) and got into a developer bootcamp program.

As I progressed, I found the bootcamp program wasn't as advanced as I needed. Angsty, I dropped out of that and pursued self-study. Ultimately a good decision, as I really am more advanced than the bootcamp level at this point and didn't need to drop $11k.

Fast forward, I'm in this awkward teenage place where I have a job as a junior developer at a small company, but I'm not really progressing beyond that. I still don't have a grasp of core computer science concepts (like wtf is n vs. n^2), and it's becoming more difficult for me to stay level-headed about all the things I don't know. 

I find myself fighting back when my SO, who has a CS degree, tries to teach me things, because it feels condescending. I find myself getting less excited about learning CS concepts because they feel impossible, and I'm shying away from things I find are more difficult, like learning to use an IDE like Rubymine. 

Getting to a point of day-to-day proficiency was the easy part. Getting my job as a junior dev was fine. But now I don't really have a mentor besides my SO, which isn't working out so well since any feedback I get makes me feel terribly inadequate. 

I'm in this scary place where I don't want to go to Meetups, I don't want to learn, I don't want to do anything except for coast. I see myself being stubborn and know it's probably coming from a place of fear, but at this point I haven't yet figured out how to move past it. 

Have any of you other beginner programmers experienced anything like this? I'm wondering if it's just a weird dynamic attached to my SO being a developer, and also trying to be my main CS mentor. Or if maybe this is a phase a lot of people go through. It just feels so emotional right now when I don't get things, or something is mentioned - like pointers or some algorithm - and I've never heard of it in my life. I feel put down when other CS people appreciate things I don't or can't appreciate, and the result is me pushing back to separate myself emotionally from the situation. (""Oh, you use Rubymine? Whatever, I'm fine with my text editor and command line. I just don't like using IDEs."") 

Partly this is just a rant. Recently I bought ""cracking the coding interview,"" and I couldn't even get past the first question. It made me feel awful about everything I didn't accomplish in the past year, and I haven't picked it up since the day I got it. The Rubymine thing is nagging at me as well. Fucking Rubymine. 

Any advice on getting over this slump?"

I've heard that FSU shares its engineering school with Florida A&amp;M, is this true? If it is, does it effect CS majors or do they use a different building?

I've also heard that FSU has a more C++ based program where as UCF uses a lot of Java, just wondering is this is true or if it's balanced for both.

I would also like to know what kind of companies recruit from each school, internship opportunities, and just general quality of each program and maybe which one you think is better.

Any information that you guys could give me would really, help! I'm just very curious and I find this to be a really hard decision for me because I'm completely torn between the two schools."

1usc05,5,2014-01-09,Starting programming classes at college and kind of nervous,levyreadit,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1usc05/starting_programming_classes_at_college_and_kind/,"Greetings, reddit 

I start programming classes this semester on Monday and I'm suddenly getting kind of nervous. I know I love working with computers and solving problems, so I picked my degree path for programming and analysis, which will qualify me for a bachelors program later on. 

I'm looking around and seeing all these job openings which are nice, but I looked at internship requirements for Microsoft and to be considered for the internship program, they require you to have completed a calculus course. 

Which raises the few questions: Will Calculus come up in an every day situation as a programmer? Will I be incompetent in my field if I don't know calculus? Am I just looking at too big of a goal as a starting student? 

I'm really nervous and would appreciate some input. I came here on the advice of a fellow redditor. 

TL;DR I'm a newly starting programming student, am scared out of my mind and would like some input from anyone who has been on this boat before. 

TIA "
1uscun,1,2014-01-09,"Dear Reddit, I am having trouble deciding where I want to do my internship.. hear me out please!",Sanctumed,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1uscun/dear_reddit_i_am_having_trouble_deciding_where_i/,"For my study I have to do an internship. So yeah.. While looking for internships, I found 2 companies which I both really would like to do an internship (and I'm able to do one at both of the companies since they both accepted me). However, the companies differ quite a lot. Let me list them down here, with all the advantages and disadvantages they got. (I won't name the companies because of the fact that promoting is forbidden in this subreddit)

I should note that the companies are game studios.



**Company 1**

*Advantages*

* Has an incredible portfolio of games they worked on.
* Have a ton of awards and nominations.
* Really big company with lots of employees which is also intimidating.
* At this company I will really learn to work in teams and communicate my ideas and thoughts with other people while working on projects.
* Will add a lot to my status as a game developer.

*Disadvantages*

* Because this company is so big, I think I will not be able to get going quickly in this company. Like: I don't know anybody there, so yeah.. That would take some time.
* I have to travel 4.5 to 5 hours a day, monday to friday to get there. Normal workdays starting at 9 am and ending at 6 pm. (Note: 9 am - 6 pm thing really is not a problem, it's normal). However, I will kill myself in stress and not have enough sleep because I have to get up at 5.30 AM and get home at 8 PM, every day.
* They create serious games, which is not really what I prefer. I prefer entertainment games.
* They will have very high expectations of me, which I am not really sure of that I can live up to.. At least, not with such a short window of time.
* High work pressure because of deadlines constantly on the horizon.
* Interns have to do household chores, such as picking up the phone, opening the door, getting food ready in the breaks, etc.
* No possibilities to expand my skills as a game developer because I simply won't have time for that kind of stuff.


**Company 2**

*Advantages*

* Small indie game studio which I mainly prefer over big corporations such as Company 1.
* I know some people that work there (the CEO and another intern)
* I don't have to travel that much, 1 hour at max total every day.
* Chilled work pressure. Not too stressful, just good enough. What it should be.
* They create fun and serious games which is much closer to what I prefer.
* Possibilities to make myself a wider programmer skill-wise (new programming languages, tools and game engines)

*Disadvantages*

* This company won't add that much to my status as a game developer.
* Their portfolio of games is not that great, but the projects they're working on are cool though.
* I will not as much of how a game studio really works as I could have if I were to go to Company 1.

I really do not know what the best option is.. I am asking everybody that I know and well.. it's 50/50 what people say. The one half says Company 1, the other says Company 2. So Reddit, what do you say?"
1usjmr,13,2014-01-09,Engineers with criminal backgrounds,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1usjmr/engineers_with_criminal_backgrounds/,"Hey guys, long time reader here. I had a question that I probably should have asked a long time ago. I'm a senior Mechanical Engineering student with about 7 classes left to go for my Bachelors. I was offered an internship this semester for a pretty big company. I accepted and was supposed to move several states over to start working for the next 4 months. 

Well, about 8 or 9 years ago, I wasn't such a good kid. I was 18-19 and quite the hell raiser. I've been arrested over 12 times in my life. I'd spent over 2 years of my life incarcerated by the time I was 20. Most of my charges were never really serious, and most were as a juvenile. Some were dropped completely, some had adjudication withheld, some were convictions. This was all over 8 years ago, when I was a teenager. I did have one thing come up 2 years ago here in my college town where I was charged with a felony and the charges were dropped a couple days later.

So, to get to my problem. The company never said anything about a background check, but they were leasing an apartment for me and the apartment complex decided to run a background check. I failed it. They wouldnt tell me or the company why. The company decided to run a check themselves to find out. They had me fill out a form describing my work history, cities I've lived in, arrest record, etc... This all happened about 4 days before I was supposed to leave the state. So, I found myself in a dilemma, as I've never been asked about my criminal history before, and honestly I'm not sure what will show up and what wont show up when its ran. It just runs so deep. I had things happen in counties all over the state and even some things out of state. There is no way I could put down everything I'd been arrested for and expect to be taken seriously. So I decided to put down the most recent conviction I knew would show up, which was a DUI and left it at that. Well the check came back and the withdrew their offer. They wouldn't explicitly explain why either, but I got the jist that it was because 2 small misdemeanors came back that I hadn't put down. They said the DUI didn't even come back.

So, I was crushed obviously, but I felt I did the right thing at the time. It obviously wasn't meant to be if something this small and petty from that long ago held me back. 

But my question to you guys is: have any of you had trouble in your past and how have you dealt with it. I should have asked this question a long time ago, because now I'm scared that no one will hire me after I graduate. Like I said, if I put down I've been arrested over a dozen times, how can I be expected to be taken seriously? If it were just one charge, one time I could get it sealed in my state but its more than that so sealing would be pointless. 

I just want to know if theres a chance I'll be able to get a good job in the future. What should I be telling people at job fairs and stuff? I really don't like my time being wasted like it was in this past case, so I want to get anything out of the way that would disqualify me early. Should I just tell them at the job fair that I have criminal record and ask what their policy is? 

Any advice would be helpful, sorry for the long post, but its kind of a big deal to me. If you want to know the specifics of the charges I can give that. I'm not a convicted felon, but I have been charged with a felony twice and neither one resulted in a conviction. One was dropped due to lack of evidence and the other had adjudication withheld. My last criminal conviction was over 8 years ago. My last charge was 2 years ago.

I'm just trying to find the proper solution to getting into the workforce without making myself look like Billy the Kid, and wasting everyones time. I'm a different person that I was back then, I'm married now, settled down, own a home, making good grades in a prestigeous university. Thanks guys. 

EDIT: Thank you for all the very helpful answers. I believe I've heard every side of it and am confident about the future. Thanks reddit. "

I'm currently a second year student at the University of Toronto. I'm enrolled in a computer science program, and have an atrocious GPA (to the point where it's now or never has far as marks go). I don't have any significant project work in CS. It's not that I'm dumb or anything, but I just don't seem to be getting what I want out of the courses. I'm really interested in learning new things and can pick up things fast.

I wish to apply for an internship for this summer in Toronto, but this may be hard since my marks aren't that good and I don't have too much to show for. 

Where can I get started on projects and what else can I do to make myself more hireable (apart from getting better grades, as that's trivial)?"
1ut835,17,2014-01-09,Vicarious,DrowningDream,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ut835/vicarious/,"Sometimes the bottom just falls out.  Not much reason for it, really – you just wake up one day and instead of the floor you get the abyss.  It’s philosophical and metaphysical and incredibly real.  Everything is right where it ought to be, shrouded by the distance between you and you, emptied of all the meaning that life used to give it.  You can’t hardly make it to the bathroom to brush your teeth; a shower requires more energy than you can fathom; the cereal tastes like ash or nothing at all.  Still, you drag your ass out to the car and drive to work.

Usually, someone smiles at you and it pulls you up.  Or some news makes you angry and the colors come back.

Not today though.  Not for Steve.  Or Jim or Bob or Nathan.  We can call him Asshole if we want; he won’t care and probably deserves it.  His hole is too deep and nobody is smiling.  It’s one of those dead cold days in the Midwest, the kind that go right through the skin and press down on the bone.  It’s the kind of day everybody just wants to get through.  Sometimes we’re just happy to survive.
When Cathy doesn’t say mornin in her usual chipper voice, it’s because she’s fighting off the layers she wore to work and digging through her purse.  When the boss, an ugly but fair man,  slams a thick file down on the desk and walks away without a word, it’s probably because of another affair gone bad.  The intern, Jane, spills coffee on it because she’s a fucking idiot. 
 
No internet/ice,  cold office/old windows, files missing/upgrades.

The coffee is cold before Asshole takes a sip.  Harvey, some kind of IT guy, is cussing out the printer.  A phone is ringing somewhere, the harsh brrrrrrrrrr of the hell before tones.
  
It’s all very far away.  Asshole opens the file and stares at the black lines etched into the white paper.  He has no idea what he’s looking at.  Whatever it is, he’s pretty sure it isn’t worth looking at in the first place.  There has never been a file worth opening.  All those neat little figures on parade towards the next quarter, the next report – he wonders if they can see the cliff.  He wonders if they could see it, would they would scatter off the page or just keep marching because that’s all they knew how to do.  

Office morale is up 10% from last quarter.

When lunch comes around he goes for a walk.  Maybe the cold will wake him up.  The sidewalks are empty except for hard patches of ice and there’s a hatchet in the wind.  It’s a busy street, buried downtown, its traffic the only sign that the town is still breathing.

He sees a bus rumbling toward him and he steps in front of it.  Doesn’t think about it much, the action just takes care of itself.  Not that he’d bother to remember, but he read about this phenomenon somewhere.  A lot of suicides merely happen.  Unplanned, moment-spurred, spontaneous.  Your subconscious self-destruct mechanism gets activated somewhere, and the gun finds your mouth the way a sock finds your foot.  

The bus swerves.  The drivers are trained not to swerve, to take the guy out and avoid something worse, but it’s useless training.  Everybody swerves.  

Asshole watches the bus roll right past him, hears the squeal of rubber and the screech of brakes and the crunch of metal and glass.  When he turns to look it’s already over.  The front of the car is smashed in all the way to the rear seats.  The woman in the road, it’s only half of her.  She’s conscious and she’s in shock, reaching up for something.  Steam is rising from the blood. 
    
He wonders who she is, where she’s going.  He wonders about the pain and why it matters.

My question is, should I stay one more year in school? The way I'm looking at it now is if I stay Ill have to take out another 7k in loans, but it will give me the ability to: 1) Find an internship this summer and network more for graduation at the end of the next school year 2) Take more classes and raise my GPA and 3) Give me another year to learn as much as I can about finance.
I'm still planning on setting up as many info interviews as I can in hopes of getting an interview and an ultimately a FT offer or even an internship offer that could turn into a FT offer, but what do you guys think about staying another year to try and better my chances?"

1uu9ko,3,2014-01-09,A few questions from a college student.,eggzema,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1uu9ko/a_few_questions_from_a_college_student/,"
I'm about to start my 4th semester in college, going for a CS major. So far I have taken 2 CS classes, Intermediate Programming 1 and 2, which used C++. I have no other programming experience. This semester, I will be taking OOP with Web Applications, which will use Java. My history with this degree path is essentially I took a programming class on a hunch that I'd like it, and it turns out I do. That's it.

Here are my questions:

- **Career paths/fields**: I tried looking on the wiki for some fields to look into, [but that section turned out to be empty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/fields) For a while I wanted to be an indie game developer until some guys on here kind of turned me off of the idea. Now I'm trying to find another path and not sure what all is out there. Software developer has been the sort of default and obvious choice, and I'm not against it, but I just want to be aware of all options. I've done research outside of this subreddit, but honestly a lot of it is lost on me, as I stated above I'm new to all of this stuff, and all I really have going for me is that I enjoy my programming classes.

- **What should I be doing right now to get ahead?** As it stands right now, I'm just taking classes and doing homework, and it doesn't feel like enough. I feel like I should be doing more, especially with all this talk of internships and stuff that I don't feel even remotely prepared for. I know a lot of you are thinking ""program"", but program what? In what language? I've been thinking about doing one of the following things: Going through my C++ book and going over anything we skipped in class, going onto codeacademy and learning a new language (Python maybe?), or just doubling my efforts in this Java class. Would it be better to learn more about/get experience in C++ or should I focus on getting a basic understanding of some other languages?

- Finally, **what should I be preparing for in the near/distant future?** What are some critical steps I need to get ready to make in order to land a decent job? For example, do I need an internship before my junior year? How experienced should I be to land one? Anything you wish you had done at this point in school that would have helped you out?

I know these are long questions and I hope it's not too much to ask. Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Thank you."
1uugis,2,2014-01-09,Career guidance for finance or investment field,futurehelp,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1uugis/career_guidance_for_finance_or_investment_field/,"Hello, I'm 27 years old, graduated with a degree in Business Administration in 2010. When attending school, I didn't have any goals, no idea what I wanted to do afterwards, and basically performed poorly in school.

After graduating, I got an internship at a CTA research firm, which basically tracked performances of CTA/CPO's and had its own CTA Index to benchmark performance. I interned here for about 5 months. During my time here, I also got my Series 3 license.

After the internship, I got a clerk job at the CBOT for a private broker in grain options. As I worked here, I quickly learned all the basic functions for a clerk, and then took over the research side. I wouldn't exactly call it research, but basically I would record large trades throughout each trading day, find out which trader or brokerage firm made the trade, and we would share this information with our clients. The only valuable thing I probably picked up from this job was a minor understanding of Options trading, and some of the lingo used. I don't know how to price Options, but I do know what butterflies are, 2x1 call options, straddles, synthetics, etc. I know what they look like, and if I have the leg prices available, I would know how to figure out the premium. I know about time value, volatility, greeks, etc but don't know how to calculate them. I also know some fundamental pricing ideas for grain products. The broker I worked for really liked me because I was a hard worker and I actually wanted to be there, unlike most other clerks. When I told him I found an internship back home, he offered to get me a badge and wanted me to stay on with him with plans of making me a broker, but I declined the offer. I worked here for 1.5 years.

I landed a summer internship at a CTA back near my hometown as a Research Analyst. I thought that (like my job at the CBOT) I would glean a lot of information about trading itself and about how to research the prices for commodities. This CTA has been very successful since inception in 2007, making a profit every year. I thought my goal would be to one day start my own CTA if I got the hang of researching products and trading in the future. But once I got here, I didn't learn much. I did some admin work, I called sell-side analysts to get their opinion on the markets, I updated excel data files, etc. Although I could hear the traders making all the intraday trades and discussing their after market trades, I could not glean any information. Since this was a discretionary CTA, the head trader made all the trading decisions. All day he would tell his traders what to fill, what to buy, what to sell, etc. This CTA ran solely on the head trader, and all the trading ideas came from him. For the research side, they were expecting a huge sum of institutional funds to come in, and because of the increase in capital, they wanted to expand their trading into other commodities. So they hired 2 summer interns (one being myself) to research about the meat products. We each were assigned a certain meat product, and were told to create a ppt presentation to introduce these meat products and how generally the prices move depending on fundamental factors. I interned here for 3 months, paid internship. The managing director liked me because I tried to work hard, and I was honest about my work. He offered me a temp job for administration work because I did not have any job set after my internship ended, but I declined. Mainly, I wanted to try trading myself, and I didn't feel comfortable there.

I couldn't find a job ever since. I worked in sales (commission only) and worked at my father's shop part-time. It's been about 1.5 years since the internship ended. I trade my own small account, but I haven't made any great improvements. I just started studying for the CFA Level 1 exam for this coming summer.

I know I made a lot of bad decisions, and now I'm in a rut. But after the sales gig, I know I want to be in investments. But more importantly, I want a stable job with growth prospects.

So here I am begging for advice. I would really like input from people in the field of finance or investments. I don't care if I start off at the bottom again, as long as the future growth prospect looks good and that it is stable. 

Is my decision to take the CFA a bad idea? I would prefer to take the Series 7 before taking the CFA, but I need a sponsor. My Series 3 has also expired. What career can I pursue in my kind of position? Where should I start off? Should I go back to school? Try pursuing an MBA? Any recommendations would be great. 

I'm being very serious here. I am also willing to talk by phone, send a copy of my resume (but I basically explained everything here), anything to get a good foothold for my career. Again, my school gpa wasn't great, my school was ok but definitely not a top 10. But, I'm very hungry to do well, to proceed my career. I think I'm very level-headed, I can multi-task, I'm interested in learning, and I've experienced failure, and don't want to experience it again.

Thank you for reading this very long message. 

With all sincerity,

Even with an account, I still mostly lurk.  However, this winter break I have had some great experiences with engineering, and I suppose this is the outlet I'm choosing.

I am studying computer science at a fairly reputable engineering university; I'm graduating in May after 4.5 great years.  The fact that a lot of engineers and I won't relate is actually in the spirit of this post, a point I'll get to shortly.  I don't share ideas of engineering major superiority like some.  I don't view computer science above the rest just because I picked it.  It's simply the aspect of engineering that I chose to focus on, just like my roommate chose mechanical engineering, and my neighbors chose electrical and nuclear.  I will say that I regularly hear I don't fit the CompSci stereotype and I won't lie, I take a small amount of pride in that.  Most of my friends are not CompSci's, but I honestly do not believe I picked the wrong major.

Being around all of this diversity has made me a better problem solver.  I have come to value the interactions between my peers as more beneficial to me than any classroom.  I was reminded of this yesterday as I sat in our student design center talking with fellow team members about the project we are working on - a mars rover.  Last year, the team I'm on built one for the first time and it didn't work as well as intended, so most of us are back to really improve on our design.  There's nothing like the feeling of being at a competition and thousands of hours of work not working, but the failure only made us more excited to do it again, and better.  I digress.

So, I went to the student design center to pick up something and ran into the team designing the body of the rover.  I quickly sat down to look at the 3D models of the rover that they had designed in NX.  It was badass, they even repainted it for me in different colors and told me that I'd be able to ride on it.  They showed me some 3D-printed components they had just made, including time-lapse footage they took.  I asked so many questions about why they decided to design things a certain way, but not once did they get annoyed or get the vibe I was criticizing.  It was just pure curiosity.  They even thanked me for asking questions because I pointed out something they didn't think of.  Things got even better when they asked about what I was doing.  It's awesome to see their faces light up when I tell them how the graphical user interface that will be used to control the rover IS working, and then to see them light up even more when I tell them plans for the future.  When I tell them that we will be able to control multiple rovers if we need to, they immediately start telling me about their dream to build the next rover completely out of carbon fiber, and even though they bought two of every part seemingly to have a spare, it's secretly for the second rover made of carbon fiber.

It's these moments that remind me of why I want to do what I do, how I know I made a good decision to be where I am.  To understand nothing about so much, a little about something, and still feel as if I make a big impact because I wake up and code.  To be surrounded by people younger and older than me who impress me beyond measure, yet to somehow inspire excitement at what I do in those same people, it's great.

For many of the guys on the team, this is their shot to get the experience needed to stand out in interviews for internships, however I joined the team my senior year having already done this so for me it's purely about taking in the experience.  So far, worth it.

If you guys have any similar stories, I would love to hear them.

I have a degree in engineering but have not found a job in the 2 years since I graduated. It is at the point where all I get are calls from recruiters who I don't even respond to anymore because I give them my time and then never hear back. I have had internships at 2 fortune 500 companies but the few interviews I did have, it was obvious from both ends that I did not have the experience needed to do the job.

I am now trying to change my career path. I am working towards getting certified in working in a new industry. I can't pay for school but it is not needed to get this certification, I just have to teach myself. It is an accredited certification from one of the biggest companies in the world, failure rate is about 70%. There are different levels of certification, I am hoping the lowest level will be enough to land me a halfway decent job.

I am trying to think proactively, and if I do get this certification and I manage to get interviews in this new industry, how do I explain this to an interviewer without coming off as bitter, dejected, a bad investment, etc...I would love to have  gotten a job that I studied for and if given the choice would pick engineering over this new industry. However, I don't mind the new industry but I can't think of how I can bring this up without sounding pathetic. In my mind all I can think to say is:

""Well after 2 years of getting not working in my field, 1 year of no calls, and being in a tremendous amount of debt. I felt this was easier to do/get a job in (not true though but I feel that is how I will come across).""

Any help would be very much appreciated.

tl;dr: 2 afters after graduating from college and have not found a job in my field. Looking to start over in a new industry, how would I explain why I am doing this in interview without coming off as desperate or a bad investment since I could not get a job in my own field."

Thanks!,brobi-wan-kendoebi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ux57c/just_got_my_degree_resume_critique_for_applying/,"[Link to the resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8vsruo5l1unad3g/resumecritique2014.pdf)

A little background:

I just graduated two quarters early. I'm in a 5-year program where I'll continue to take a couple classes a quarter for my masters, either at nights or online. It's designed for people who work full time, and everyone I know in the program is full time in the workforce. I really like it so far since the classes in the masters program are more specialized and interesting.

I've spent the last few months interviewing. I was rejected from a pretty big web company that I like and interviewed me 3 times over the course of a month (kind of frustrating), and was rejected at a big finance company which I'm interested in, as well as a few other rejections that I didn't care too much about. I have a company interested in wanting me to interview for an internship, but I really want a full time position at this point, both financially and from an experience standpoint.

If there's any critiques, good or bad, please be honest with me! I haven't updated the layout of it in a while. Things I'm considering:

* Should I mention projects somewhere? I worked on a pretty big social media site for businesses project in my capstone class, and made a sudoku app with my friend for a class also. I also have a (currently pretty bland) personal website, showing links to my github and linkedin. I need to put some time into making it look nicer. I don't have any other big projects outside of class, but I'm considering looking into some open source projects to contribute to in my free time. 

* There's other languages I'm familiar with - Objective C, Node, HTML/CSS, Scala - but I don't think I'm comfortable answering interview questions related to them. Should I just leave them off?

* Should I list open source tools I've used in the past? Pretty familiar with Puppet, Apache Solr and Nutch, a bit of Salt and Hadoop (not a ton though), and Docker, to name a few.

Thanks again! I'd like to find a software engineering job somewhere in finance (either in trading/banking, etc) or web application development, doing work on some distributed software or big data problems. I'm based in Chicago. Any tips of open source projects in this field would interest me, too! Thanks again."

I have to say I am in need of advice regarding potential graduate studies. 
I am currently in the first year of university, so this is pretty early, but I think it is never too early to think about my future and prospect career. At the moment, I am doing two majors simultaneously: political science and finance and accounting. I would say that political science is my first choice, since it was a topic that I have always been interested in, due to its international perspective. However, I have chosen to do the second major as a safety margin. Atm I do have high grades (higher than 8.5/10), and I plan to keep improving as I go futher into studying. 
After graduating (so in two and a half year's time), I wish to pursue a graduate degree abroad. I was considering the UK, Germany, Belgium, the US, Canada, Austria or Sweden. However, since financially I am really restricted, and since I know that the tuition fees are high (or really high in the case of the US), I am looking for scholarship options that would cover as much as possible of the tuition fees and overall costs.

My questions for you are:

1) Do you think that having two majors, and with this the possibility of having a combined graduate degree (say politics and economics) will be an advantage for my future career?

2) Considering my majors along with the scholarship options, which country do you think would offer me the best study options? (or if you could even narrow it down to a particular university, that would be fantastic)

3) Considering that during my second and third year I will get two internships (one for each major), I will continue to be part of a debating club, I will learn both German and Spanish, and I will try to subscribe to a summer school in Hague this summer (the field of study being political science), what do you think my chances to get into an Ivy league univeristy are?

Pertaining to my career, I want to learn about business and running/creating a startup but also knowing how to build the product in the first place (i.e. Computer Science). My question is, to all college students who are sure of your major and why you're studying it, why did you choose it, was it simply to gain some new knowledge, career-based, internships, easy money?

Or will my email just clutter their inbox and I risk irking them.

Is it even acceptable to email the recruiter before meeting them? 

I would especially love it if a college recruiter for CS would give me an answer, but I do appreciate help from everybody.

b) Should I make an application for the companies I am interested in before I go talk to my recruiters? Or should I talk to them at the career fair and then put in my application?

Basically right now I am planning to major in Computer Informations Technology and possibly double major in business (maybe marketing). Problem is right now I am in an IT Essentials coarse at my high school and I am kind of struggling in it. I am a pretty big geek as I know the basics of building a computer, basic troubleshooting, and some other stuff. I however don't know if this is the right career for me. It is a lot of information that gets overwellming too. I have done some basic Computer Aided Drafting and Design which I enjoyed and was pretty good at. Here are some attributes I would like my job to have:

-Lots of interaction with people whether through travel or large office buildings/campuses. Also in a city environment

-some traveling would be nice

-Obviously having something to do with technology

-A challenging environment where I can always have something to shoot for and improved job opportunities. For instance my dad's path hospital security &gt; airport &gt; security &gt; sherrifs department &gt; promotions within this department (get what I am saying? It is kind of hard to explain) 

-Something where I am not solely pressured to meet a quota much like a retail job

-I am not very good at math but I would like to design things, however most engineering jobs or jobs where you make things technology wise require this

-Lastly I want to feel like I am making a difference. That is the main reason I am hesitating with the IT support field is that while I am helping people I am not really going for a certain goal or making an improvement.

1uzcmb,7,2014-01-11,"I have the opportunity to work my dream job this summer, however it will require reneging on a Big 4 company. What should I do?",ThrowAway_CSQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1uzcmb/i_have_the_opportunity_to_work_my_dream_job_this/,"Last year I interned at a Big 4 company and really loved it.  After my internship, I was only given 3 weeks to accept the offer and I panicked thinking, ""What would happen if I don't find anywhere else?"".  I still placed my application at my dream place to work (another Big 4) and ended up getting an offer for a team which I would be happy working on until my 70s.

However, I don't want to renege on the internship I accepted.  I really loved that company and they treated me really well.  The work there was great and my team for this year would consist of machine learning/AI so I would get to learn that.

It's hard considering the two -- they're both amazing opportunities and Big 4 companies and I wouldn't mind working for either one full time post college...

I started a new internship and am trying to be more social in general, but am finding it pretty hard.

Out of all he people I try to find the few I fit with the most and talk to them, but even then they just don't seem interested, or just go off on their own thing with no effort.

If I met anyone in college, or in the past they just seem to drift away as the semester ends or after a while, except the few people I still see now.

Whenever I meet someone new I just think I rather just hang out or try harder with the people already have, as I know I won't be let down.

But basically I am worried that me thinking I rather just stick to the people I have now, or finding it tough in general just means there is something wrong with me?

For example, I met everyone in my company the same age as me (there's about 20 of us that are lower 20's) and have tried to talk and get to know them, but I just feel like its going to be a long road with some, and the others either me or them don't seem to be interested in one another."

Any advice is appreciated!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1v0f0u/high_school_senior_trying_to_map_out_my_life_from/,"Hey guys, sorry if this question has been asked before, I just couldn't find any that were specific to my question. 

 I am currently a senior in high school. A few months ago, I learned about computer science. I have always liked computers, but I didn't really know what went on behind the scenes. I didn't even know this major existed. Now that I know about it, I want to become a software engineer. I can honestly say, I have absolutely no experience with coding, but I am planning on teaching myself a bit before I graduate this year. 

Anyway, I started thinking about the jobs I want, and I then got the idea to work for my favorite site, Pinterest. I know that they accept applications year round. My problem is, I know it is not as big of a company as say Google or Amazon, but by the time I graduate in 2018  I am scared it may be as coveted as those companies. 

Another problem I have is that I am not going to school in California (even though it is my home state), so I don't know if I can do an internship with them. I also don't know if I will be at a disadvantage because I am not going to school that has a ranked CS program, but it is a well known university and in the top 50 public universities. 

So what should I do between now and 2018 to prepare myself for a dream job at Pinterest?

I know I should probably get my first job somewhere else so I can gain experience before I apply to Pinterest. 

If anyone has any experience working for them, please give me advice as to what things I should do to get hired. I would truly appecriate it!

Edit: I also don't mind spending all day in front of a computer, if that helps. I can sit for 5+ hours straight just looking at my computer, haha!

BTW, if you guys have to, be honest with me and bring me back down to earth. I probably sound like an overly hopeful teen right now, sorry about that."

I have a pretty big question as to what exactly the difference is between a CS major and a Software Engineering major or a Computer Engineering major. I enjoy coding and I definitely want to code as a job but I'm trying to differentiate between what exact major I should be looking for in a college. 

Another big question I have is whether or not my skills are sufficient. I've recently started a IT internship with my school this year and about 3 months from now I'll (hopefully) be Comptia A+ certified which will allow me to work a paid internship over the summer at school. I am taking a intro computer programming class, at school, teaching Visual Basic 2010 this year and finding it very easy. I plan on taking an AP CS class next year. I unfortunately do not have much actual programming experience outside of this class however the way things have worked out I plan on focusing on IT certification this year and then focus on programming throughout my senior year in which I plan to work with iOS app development. I want to make it clear that I am only doing the IT internship to help create a strong resume for college and I do not intend to pursue the IT field. There is also the possibility of taking a 2 month vacation to Canada the summer before college. I would be volunteering for the IT department for the 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup however I am undecided about this because I feel like it would be placing too much emphasize on the IT field and not as much on programming. 

I really just want to know if this is a solid road map leading up to college and if I'm going to have solid building blocks for my future career. "

Since April, he has been sending endless CV's out to companies for any number of financial roles. Banks, accountancy firms, any company that is hiring anyone for a financial role. Hell, he's even applied for financial officer roles in schools where they only require a post-16 education and pay peanuts, and he's not heard anything back. After sending out hundreds of CV's, he's had a few online tests and a few interviews, all of which have turned him away. He's applied for an endless number of graduate placements, and even though he's usually rejected, they continue to push the ads out for graduates to join. He's also signed up with a number of recruiters, but has heard absolutely nothing.

He's taken a number of accountancy and finance classes during his history degree, and from what I can tell (as a programmer) he has a rock-solid knowledge of Excel. He's confident in his numeracy skills, and he reckons that if he could get a chance he'd do well in a finance role.

I'm a Web Developer, and in my line of work if you have the skills you'll be able to at least walk into A job, but so far he's struggled for months to even get an interview. Hell, he's even struggled to find free internships to take just so he can get some experience. If a Web Developer ever offered to work for free they'd have their hand bitten off by companies across the city...

Is the job market for those in finance really that bad in the UK, and is there anything my friend can do to at least get noticed by companies?"

Right now I am a software engineer in Minneapolis earning $70,000/year doing Java development. 

I work on internal business systems for a large corporation. Soon, I am supposed to start working on consumer-facing products that the business sells. 

I graduated last may, but have been doing this year-round for about 3 years now (intern, then hired full-time), so I have a bit of ""real-world"" experience.

I am bored. Really bored. I need to do something more interesting, but I don't want to fuck myself financially.


**Questions:**

1. What are some higher-paying, specialized computer science jobs that require a Master's degree? I am interested in data-mining/data-analytics/""social-computing"", human-computer interaction, and distributed computing. 

2. After my company's tuition reimbursement plan, I would have to pay about $17,000 for grad school over three years. Will I be able to recoup that over my career with a higher salary after I finish grad school? 

3. How do the answers to the first two questions change if I move out to the west-coast after receiving my Master's?"
1v2852,0,2014-01-12,Would it be right to quit now?,aliekiddo,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1v2852/would_it_be_right_to_quit_now/,"I've been working on a music video project with 2 other people for the past 12 months (we'll get to the gamedev part shortly), I'm a 3D artist &amp; originally signed up to rig a few characters.  I'm working with an animator who also has been doing concept designs, &amp; there's one other guy who is the music artist &amp; has commissioned the project &amp; ... well, I say commissioned, but this has all been unpaid work.   

So I've been modelling, UVing, sculpting, texturing &amp; rigging characters, I then did an indoor environment &amp; a couple of rigged props, &amp; it was all going well until recently when I've felt like I'm being put on more &amp; more.  

During the same time, last Feb, I did a bit of work on some low poly charas for a game dev project, I guess back then I was getting a bit bored &amp; wanted to do something different to break the routine.  This was also advertised as unpaid (although I did actually get paid, which was nice) Things were quiet with it until September when we started 2 crowd funding campaigns.  I genuinely care about this project &amp; hopefully it will lead to bigger things, as It's something quite special.  

I also had to start a full time job in September, which is the main reason why I haven't got the time to work on both projects as much as I think I could before.  

So I feel bad that I'm feeling like I want to hand over the music vid project to someone else, because doing this project got me learning Maya, which got me an internship, &amp; I wouldn't have started working for the gamedev project if I hadn't started taking on unpaid work, &amp; I feel like it was the catalyst that got me out of a rut &amp; gave me something to do when I wasn't working full time.  

I know I shouldn't feel bad about leaving an unpaid job that I'm maybe not enjoying anymore, but I am quite a caring person, but I also care about the work I create.  

I've been mulling this over for a while, &amp; one other little factor is that, whilst we're all in London, I'm a little peeved that I haven't met these guys in person once... (the 2 of them have, but not me) is it weird to work with people long term that you've never met? not even a twitter follow, LinkedIn connection, anything. (we've spoken on Skype twice) so I wouldn't call these guys friends exactly, &amp; I don't have to have any loyalty to these guys.  However, I've worked on projects before where I'll hand off my piece &amp; never get to see a finished product for whatever reason.  It'd be a shame to quit &amp; have all my effort over the past year wasted either because it never gets finished or I'm just never given it

Now whereas with the gamedev project, I feel we're more on the same page (gamedev ppl ftw, &amp; I'm really enjoying seeing some work on screenshot Saturdays), but neways... the main guy behind it I've met quite a few times now, even went to Rotterdam with him in November, &amp; some of the others, as they're not in the UK just the once, but it's been a lot more friendly over twitter, G+ &amp; in emails, &amp; I do class these people as friends  (We'll be at the Global Game Jam later this month too).  I've wanted to work in games for a while now &amp; I think this project has more chance of going somewhere. 

So, (I'll probably get no responses to this as that's what usually happens to me lol) would it be the right thing to do to withdraw from the project or hold on &amp; struggle though to finish it? We have tried to get additional people on board to help, but one wouldn't do it unpaid (&amp; quite rightly because of the scale of it) &amp; the other who is helping, doesn't have the time either take it on fully.

Thanks r/jobs and here’s my story (stats +tips)",legionxiii,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1v2uck/after_6_months_120_applications_21_interviews_i/,"It wasn’t easy comrades, but I’m back in the labor force. I’ve been working for over a month now and have been meaning to share my trials and tribulations with the hardy people of r/jobs. There are some great people on this subreddit and the community has helped not only myself but countless others. 

Before I begin, I just want to say that **every rejection, every misstep, and every heartache- and trust me, there were plenty- I encountered along the way made me stronger**. I strived to learn something from all my interviews and constantly looked for ways to improve my presentation, interview ability, resume, personal and mental health, cognitive abilities, and my holistic happiness. One redditor on here- I tried to find your post and damn was it good-compared the labor market to the trials of sisyphus. **You’re doomed to linger at each stage until you pass each test along the way**: application, follow up, interview. With enough effort, persistence, and reflection, you will find a job. I know that doesn’t mean much from a random redditor but it will happen and likely when you least expect it. 

About me: 26, B.A. History, 2 years of internship experience in government/law, 2 years experience in non-profit advocacy. 

The Story: My organization was faltering and I was required to take a severe pay cut. After applying and working for 3 months, countless promises of my pay restored to its original level, and a toxic work atmosphere, I quit. I was unemployed for 3 months until I found my current position. 

Number of Applications: 120 

Number of Interviews: 21 (across 12 organizations). 
Number of Interviews at networked positions: 5 
Number of Interviews by bulk website application: 7 

Number of job offers received : 1 via bulk application 

Websites I used: Craiglist, Idealist, NYFA, Mashable, Mediabistro. 

My approach to The Trials (finding a job)
I. Daily habits
II. Tracker 
III. Know your story and what you’re looking for 
IV. Resume, Cover Letters, Digital Portfolio, and Linkedin 
V. Follow up
VI. Networking
VII. Addressing your needs and finding your balance (intellectual, physical, happiness, burnout)
VIII. Interview 
IX. References 

**I. Daily Habits**

**I can’t stress enough the importance of routine.** While I was unemployed, I woke up at the same time and, for the most part, ended my day at the same time. I created a daily schedule on a whiteboard that I followed religiously throughout my trial. I have since erased my board but it went something along the lines of this: 

8:30-9-:00 - Meditate
9:00-9:30- Eat, Shower
9:30-11:00- Openware courses, blogging, read literature (this was my study component)
11:00- 1:00- Apply to positions
1:00-1:30- Lunch
1:30-5:00- Apply to positions
5:00-5:30- Network 
5:30-6:00- Decompress
6:00- 7:30- Gym
7:30-9:00- Eat and Shower
9:00- 12:00- Read &amp; write/ Go out

I also set weekly goals for myself such as volunteer once a week, apply to 6-10 positions, write 3 times a week, etc. Routine is your friend and it’s so very easy to fall into the trap of lounging around. Lethargy is insidious and can easily derail your application momentum. 

**II.Tracker**

I created a simple excel sheet in which i transcribed when I applied, where i applied, and the address and phone number of said position. I also created a status row that allowed me to remember to follow up with the positions that I found to be a great fit. By detailing where I applied and application hits, I was able to learn which roles and cover letters/resumes I was getting a high response rate from. 

**III. Know your Story and What you want**

Another pitfall of navigating the labor market is saying and believing you want anything. As much as you believe it to be true, it hinders your ability to network properly and apply to the correct positions. Think about it: how can your network help you and direct you if you have no idea what you want? How can you create a compelling narrative during an interview without having an idea of where and what you’d like to be doing? **I highly recommend you take a week or two off from applying and sit and think about what you’d ideally like to be doing next.** Just ask yourself some questions. Do you want to work in a particular industry? Do you want a particular position regardless of industry? What skills do you have? What skills do you want to build?  Navigating these questions can help cultivate a sense of purpose to your search and make the market seem less overwhelming.

**IV. Resume, Cover Letter, Digital Portfolio, Linkedin** 

A.Resume- You need to make this document air tight AND make it look good. R/Resumes has some great tips and I highly recommend you dish out your resume to friends, family, career services, and any hr or skilled writers you know for some perspective. I sent my resume out to 3 writers, 2 hr managers, r/resumes,  and a graphic designer for feedback. This document is the foundation of your search so why take a chance with a flawed document? In addition to giving your resume some hefty review, I highly recommend you draft several versions with as many bullets/achievements you can think of. I created a master CV that had around 20 bullets per position. This allowed me to quickly pull together unique resumes tailored to each position I was applying for.

B. Cover Letters- There are several school of thought on this document. Some think it’s meaningless; other’s think it can make or break your candidacy. **I personally spent a lot of time perfecting my cover letters**. I started off drafting a completely unique cover letter for every position I applied for. It was time consuming, frustrating, and didn’t always pay dividends but after 2 months I had drafted enough cover letters to have a solid foundation to pull from.  After the first two months, I would draft a unique first paragraph and would often cut and paste previous content from my other letters. This allowed me to churn out more applications towards the end, netting me a higher response rate. 

C. Digital Portfolio- [Imaresume](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1o351d/free_kind_of_awesome_resume_cover_letter_and/) had a great post about creating a portfolio to put on your resume. You don’t need to be a designer to have one of these and I personally think it’s a great asset to show off any work you did in the past.  I used this portfolio to showcase some of my professional and personal writing, advanced excel docs I worked on, and some indesign work I did. I think it adds some flash to your resume and also shows that your a savvy user of the interwebs. 

D. Linkedin- Tremendous resource. Spend some time updating your profile and remember that It shouldn’t be an exact mirror of your resume-more akin to a professional summary. Employers will likely google you and having an industry or position tailored profile can really help set you apart. If you’re unsure of what to put up, just look at people with similar work experience or that work in industries that you’re interested in. You can find limitless great examples.** Linkedin is also a great way to find the hiring manger for a position you’re applying for or if you have any connections to people at the organization**. I have definitely called people in my network for an introduction to someone working at an org I was applying at. It really is a small world.

**V. Follow up** 

Whenever you submit an application, I highly recommend you call the organization you’re applying to and try to speak with someone (unless the posting specifically stated otherwise.) The goal here is to get a hold of the position’s manager and let me be clear: DONT SETTLE FOR HR! You want to build rapport with your potential future manager by simply introducing yourself, saying what you can bring to the job, and if you can send your details directly to him/her. After this, you can write a quick email thanking them for taking some time to chat with you and  simply attach your resume and cover letter. After a few days have passed, I would send a short email (1-3 sentences) just reiterating your interest in the position. Now, I didn’t do this for all my applications-mainly those that I thought were a good fit for my qualifications- but I did notice a slightly higher uptick in my response rate. Point being: If you think the position is a good fit, get on the phone and try to get a hold of the job’s manager. You’d be surprised what a phone call can accomplish. 

**VI. Networking**

The n word. I can’t begin tell you how often I cringed upon hearing its utterance. “Have you explored your network?” “You just need to do some networking.” And on and on. In retrospect, I think my biggest issue was my limited understanding networking. For me, networking was as straight forward as asking some co-workers, former bosses, friends, and others if they knew of any opportunities. And yes, this opened some doors but I was only scratching the surface. In navigating unemployment, I came to realize that one chance meeting or phone call can be just as effective as a full day of bulk applications. So what did i do? I went to meetups and events once a week just to meet people. I would plan events for my friends and co-workers. I would go on linked in and look through my connections contacts, seeing if any of them worked for an industry or company I was interested in. The point being that increasing your exposure, increases your chances.

1v2y8p,0,2014-01-12,Question about side projects,sgtbrecht,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1v2y8p/question_about_side_projects/,"My question is about side projects. This past winter break I've read 2 textbooks. One about JavaScript and the other about jQuery. There are some pretty cool examples (mini-games and such) there and I was thinking about posting it to my site and consider it as my side project. Is that considered ok or is that copying/plagiarism? I mean, I read the book and examined it carefullly so I know how to program it and can explain about it when asked. 

The thing is, I can program these BUT only if I was provided the graphics/images...I don't know how to use PhotoShop and all that stuff.

I'm a college senior and I'm graduating this Spring. I need some side projects on my resume to get a job...just spent two days building this site and posted some class projects on there. I'm mainly concerned about getting a job...my GPA is 3.27. I don't think that's too good but it's not bad either. I don't have any internships so I think I really need some side projects at least.

My goal is mainly to become a Web Developer. The textbooks about JS and jQuery was a good read. That's why I want my side project to be about Web Development to demonstrate that I have experience with JS, jQuery, and HTML/CSS. I also have experience with Ajax, MySQL, PHP and Java as shown on the class projects I posted. These are mainly the languages that I liked during my college years and I'm comfortable with. When I get a job, preferably it has something to do with these."
1v34cy,1,2014-01-12,Awesome(ish) job with miserable commute. What do I do?,needygaymer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1v34cy/awesomeish_job_with_miserable_commute_what_do_i_do/,"Hey, I'm 22, fresh out of college, and a good family friend was able to hook me up with a fantastic internship during college which eventually turned into a full time 9-to-5 with benefits and about twice the salary I originally thought a ""down economy"" could bring me at the entry level. Overall, I don't think I should be complaining, but there's a the major problem of the commute.

I'm not sure I can express how much I hate my commute right now. I'm in Chicago, heading out to and back from the suburbs 5 times a week. Overall, a trip one way ranges from a breezy and rare 50-minute drive to a hellish, miserable 2-hour stop-and-go. On a given day, I might lose 2-4 hours just to my commute. I've been at this for a few months now and haven't had much success with either to reduce the stress. Last week, with the winter weather in full force, was a bit of a breaking point.

I know I'm good enough at what I do (software development) to get a good job closer if I look, but I'm not sure if I should or how I could leave my current job without burning any bridges or making things harder in the future.

**tl;dr: My commute is just awful enough to warrant a change; how do I go about getting a new job properly?**"
1v36c9,91,2014-01-13,"An incident that happened to me a few years back involving a scary computer, eerie sounds, and unexplained blood. LONG STORY.",Psyqonaut,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1v36c9/an_incident_that_happened_to_me_a_few_years_back/,"Someone told me to post this here. This happened to me a few years ago.

I was a computer crimes intern that was staying late one night at the local police department. It was about 9 p.m. and I was actually getting my things together to go home. Well two deputies come in and ask me if I could come with them on a routine house call because it involved computers and I was the only one at the station at the time that specialized in that. I jumped at the opportunity because this would be the first time I actually assisted in this way. So we get in the car and I finally ask the details, and one of the deputies tells me that a man frantically called saying that he thinks his laptop was possessed by an evil spirit and it was trying to kill him. He wanted us to come out and cleanse it before it was ""too late"". The deputies were laughing about it and saying that they'll buy me doughnuts (yep) after the call since I had to stay out later than normal because of a whack job.

Well we finally pull up to the house, and I expected it to be run down house maybe with an older, mentally challenged gentlemen (especially with the way the deputies were talking about it). However, we pull up to this really nice house with a nice car in a fairly wealthy neighborhood. As we are walking up to the door, a normally dressed, clean shaven man about mid 30s greets us at the door and ushers us in. The house was REALLY nice on the inside and when I finally got a better look at him, the fear in his eyes was actually quite shocking. I mean, this guy was shaking and looked like his eyes were about to pop out because of how wide they were. I immediately tried to comfort him and tell him that it was most likely a virus, and that I would make sure that whatever it was was gone by the end of the night. I told him there would be nothing to worry about at all. He didn't look convinced though, so I asked him to just show me the computer.

He led us to this dark study with no light except for his computer. It was definitely an eerie setting, but I was just thinking that maybe this guy was on drugs and was tripping, even though he denied it vehemently. I overheard him tell the deputies that he worked as a part time engineer and a part time youth pastor. I noticed several crosses and religious artwork around his house. He told us he had come home from work and opened up the laptop, but before he pressed the on button, he looked at the black screen and there was a demon standing behind him in his reflection. He said he brushed it off as a trick of the mind because he was tired, but then he turned his laptop on and screaming starting coming out of the speakers and that ""fingers with claws started hitting my screen like they were trying to get out of the inside of my laptop"". Then he said there was a voice that came out of his speaker and told him that he was going to die soon over and over again.

Although I couldn't explain the actual visual aspect, there were plenty of logical things that I could think of that would explain the screaming and voices and visuals on the computer itself. I started walking over towards the computer and this guy starts fucking chanting the Lord's Prayer like it's about to attack me or something. Well I turn the computer on and it loads up properly like normal, and to be honest, I expected to find viruses galore and toolbars that took up a fourth of the screen or something, but to my surprise, it was very well taken care of. He had a great antivirus, the computer was fairly new, and I didn't find anything red flags in his browsing history. I asked him if anyone else had come into contact with the laptop or if he connected to anywhere else outside his home, and all the questions I could think of that would cause something like that to happen. Nothing. He lived by himself, he only bought it recently for home use only, his router had a REALLY secure password. I ran a diagnostic test and a slew of other tests to make sure there wasn't anything I was missing. Then I basically took his computer apart and put it back together again. There was nothing once again. Cleanest computer I have ever dealt with.

So being convinced that he may have just been really tired and it was just his mind playing tricks on him, I tell the deputies that there is nothing at all and tell the man that maybe he should just get some rest. At this point, this guy starts hysterically crying and drops down onto his knees begging me to ""cleanse"" the laptop. Well I felt really bad for him because he honestly was absolutely terrified of something, and I had a spare hard drive loaded with Windows XP in my case that was brand new that matched his laptop, so I offered to replace it, at least for a few days until I could absolutely purge his hard drive and guarantee twice over that there was nothing. It was the least time consuming option, and was getting uncomfortable because of this guy's distress over seemingly nothing.

So anyways, I hooked it up and as I was letting it load up, I walked out of the study into the living area where the man and the two deputies were sitting down. I had left my official document clipboard out in the car, so I announced that I was walking out to get it really quick. A deputy started walking with me, and just as we were about to reach the door, we heard this weird sound.. and it's really hard to explain, but it was like a cat meowing but like it was trying to form actual words, but muffled, and a like a sort of weird buzzing hum that pulsed with this other sound. We immediately stopped and turned around to see if the others were hearing it, and they were wide eyed and listening as well. Then we hear kind of like a chuckling or laughing or maybe like high-pitched hyperventilating (sorry for my shitty explanation skills, but it's hard to describe) and then we heard a really deep voice, but couldn't make out what it was saying either. Then they both turned their heads at the same time to I guess react to a sound they heard in the study, and the guy lets out the most bloodcurdling fucking scream, and jumps up and sprints out his back patio door, while screaming ""GOD HELP ME I DON'T WANT TO DIE HELP ME"" over and over. The deputy that was with him, while still looking in the office, just says ""what the holy fuck"" before getting up himself and running after the guy trying to get him to come back and calm down. We run to the office as fast as we can, and the deputy even drew his gun, and we carefully look inside.

The scene inside was something I still don't think I've logically thought through even today, maybe because it just makes me really uncomfortable, or because I don't actually have a logical answer at all. The laptop that was originally facing away from the entrance of the office was now facing towards it, so that anyone from the living area could see the screen. There was broken glass on floor from the lightbulb in the lamp that I had turned on (I'm guessing that's the sound they reacted to). The computer screen was blazingly white, and you could barely look at without squinting. The deputy walked over to the computer and I kid you not, as he starts to close it, just for a split second, there's like this dark imprint that pops up about 3/4 of the way closed. It reminded me of when a bird flies into a window, but bigger. Sort of like that movie White Noise, when that thing comes out of the static in the computer screen and scares the shit out of you. (Basically like this: http://i.imgur.com/RRrYo4w.jpg [1] ) but on the right side of the computer screen. And we definitely both saw it, cause he looks back up at me wide eyed, and this deputy slams the laptop shut so hard that we didn't have to open it back up to know that he definitely broke something. I ran over to unplug it from the outlet just in case as well as disconnect the equipment from the computer to make sure nothing shorts out or gets damaged.

The deputy then turns the bright overhead office light on, and when he does, he stops what he's doing and tells me not to move and look at my hands. There is blood on my fingers and hands and I immediately think that I cut myself and just didn't realize it because of my adrenaline. I look over my hands and everything but I don't see a single cut. Then I look at deputy and he fucking has blood on his fingers too. There's not a lot of blood on our hands, just enough to be noticeable. I asked him if he cut himself, and he checks himself too, but he didn't. Then we look over at the computer and notice that there are drops of blood on the computer desk right by the computer and on the back of the computer. We apparently smeared our hands in it without knowing (because it was dark) when we were trying to frantically get everything shut down and unplugged. But it was definitely not our blood, and we had to wait until the forensic team/backup to even do anything, because of protocol.

Around the same time the backup and forensic team got there, the other deputy walked through the front door and just looked at me and the other deputy and just said ""What the actual fuck just happened?"" We explained what happened when we went into the office, and asked him what he saw before the guy darted off. He told us that as we were listening to all those noises, he heard the light bulb shatter in the office, and when he turned to look inside, he said that the computer screen was facing them and the screen was a dark red and it looked like the room was filled with black smoke. He said that was surprised the house wasn't in flames when he came back. A quick blood type test determined that the blood was B+. Me and the two deputies had A type, but guess who had the B+? That's right, the guy who lived there. There was absolutely no way that the blood was there when we first got there. The only thing on his desk was his laptop and a file system off to the left side. We would've noticed it immediately, no question. (STORY CONTINUED IN COMMENTS)"

I'm a CS student at George Mason University. I've completed uselesss prerequisites throughout the 3 years I've been in college. I cannot stress enough the amount of pre-requisites that are irrelevant and only equivalent to loads of busywork and crap you have to go through. The intro to programming courses are pretty useless and a CS theory course isn't very attractive to HR people who have no idea what theory of automation is. I mention this because automata is a really fascinating topic for me. I enjoyed learning about language theory (cfgs), fsm, automatas and proofs.
I learn new things outside from school like graphics, functional programming with scheme and haskell, web development and android. I also do little bit of open source and enjoy reading dijkstra's essays!

Unfortunately nothing I've learned can be used in a professional setting because nothing I've made is a big project/significant.


So, I've been looking for software development internships/part-time jobs but am having a hard to getting one.
I've had a chance for a few interviews but none of them have worked. To give you and idea where I've applied are mozilla, google, cgi, general dynamics, mitre, my Uni's tech support to name a few significant ones. There have been a few that never replied back to me after the interview.

I have applied to different IT jobs in addition to software dev interns. I can guess IT majors that have specific training provided to them have a better chance as they also have the certificate requirements.

One of the things I've found out is that most jobs here require security clerances. This is one thing that frustrates me living in the DC area. Every freaking job 99% of the time has a requirement for secret clerance. Compared to the west coast where there are more startups, jobs in this area is still not upto par.

So now I'm resorting to applying at help desks support, geek squad in best buy (they rejected my application saying I'm not qualified for the job), and retail store associates (walmart) as a salesman. 

Honestly all this is killing my motivation to be a programmer. I'm hoping my next semester's course on software modeling and low level systems programming will help with the issue.

I probably prefer the work that I'll be doing at IBM but the 2 companies seem pretty interesting as well as the fact they are 2 months longer than IBM and work out to be same salary overall due to that. 

Is IBM still ""good"" to have on my resume or would I be better going with 1 of the other offers?

I'm edging towards IBM due to the work I'll be doing and I suppose when I finish (may 2015) I would be able to go and look for a summer internship.

* Exposure to WP/Drupal, transferrable job skills
* I feel if you're a junior web dev and work at a big company you're going to be bug hunting most of the time (might nobe true)
* Might be an easy path into freelance. 
* Might be more flexible with working part time

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What are they key problems to solve today with ion thrusters?  Or another way, if you could wave a magic wand and make one obstacle in your field go away, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceokq4n?context=5)|For electric propulsion thrusters, to get the big payoff of such a high fuel efficiency propulsion system you need to operate them for a long period of time (measured in years). The key problem we face is designing a device to last as long as we need it and to prove that it has this life with margin. You can imagine that running a device for multiple years can be costly and delay implementation. If I could wave a magic wand I would make them last forever and be able to prove that it meets the life requirement with few resources. I might be biased though since I ran an 8 year thruster life test for 5 of those years! (DH)
[Do the standard methods of accelerated life testing not apply to ion thrusters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceokzig?context=5)|To date we have been unsuccessful in accelerated life testing. Those tests uncovered failure mechanisms that were not observed in standard wear testing. (DH)
[This sounds really interesting.  Hate to be a bother, but do you think you could point us to any published work on this topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceolot0?context=5)|There are loads of AIAA papers published on ion thruster life testing, modeling and validation. Reporting on both the NSTAR and NEXT thruster covers a lot of this. -SB.
[How much thrust does an average Ion propulsion engine provide now? Ten years? Fifty years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceokn27?context=5)|Ion propulsion technologies are low thrust compared to the chemical propulsion systems. This is the main reason why chemical propulsion systems are used to launch things (thrust to mass ratio is greater than 1). Ion propulsion is used only for access through space (once you get into orbit). The current technologies that are flying and are being invested in by NASA are at thrust levels a fraction of a pound or a few grams. Working in metric units, thrust levels range from hundreds of mN to a few N. This low thrust is applied for long periods of time to continually accelerate the vehicle. Power levels for thrusters doubles every 10 - 15 years so thrust levels should be double in about 10 years. Maybe 3 - 5 X in 50 years. (DH) 
[How small can you make one of your Ion engines?  Does that impact longevity or efficiency of the drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceom2kf?context=5)|I've seen them as small as a few cm in diameter. They typically have lower efficiency (higher wall losses due to the lower ratio of volume to surface area). The longevity issue is the same. (DH)
[Sorry, maybe a dumb question: Are you saying that thruster technology in general doubles every 10-15 years or that any one specific thruster increases thrust (some crazy long warm up period or something?\).  As I would guess it's the first scenario, are there any new technological jumps on the horizon that might increase thrust much faster? Something like when ICs took over for discrete components for computer processors back in the day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceom4uc?context=5)|The power that spacecraft produce has been growing at the rate mentioned. The higher power allows higher power thrusters all though you can just gang up several lower power thrusters too - DM.
[ question: Given that ion propulsion has such a high specific impulse and low fuel mass requirement but also a very high electrical energy requirement, do you ever see nuclear electric spacecraft becoming a realistic option for deep space travel? How might this be done?  It seems to me that even very large solar arrays won't do the job for large, complex (read: manned\) missions to the asteroids and beyond.  Second question: are any of you involved in getting VASIMR on the ISS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceokqgk?context=5)|Nuclear power sources would be awesome, but we there doesn't seem to be support for that. In the past the public has been afraid because sometimes launch vehicles fail and there is a concern regarding radioactive material  Solar arrays can be used for relatively high powers. A spacecraft with solar arrays equal in size to the ISS, using current photovoltaic cells would have hundreds of kilowatts of electric power. We have been involved with VASIMR on ISS in the past, but there is nothing I am working on right now - DM.
[Do you think it may one day be feasible to acquire the nuclear fuel only once in orbit, probably by way of some kind of asteroid mining operation.  the fuel was never on the ground.  Is that possible, or am i crazy to think we'd be doing uranium enrichment in space, or whatever it might take.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceom2c5?context=5)|I think we will have to use material from space to make it affordable. We call in ""in-situ resource utilization"" or ISRU. I'm not sure about the uranium part, but I agree that if we want to have a greater human presence in space we will need to mine asteroids - DM.

This can give us a lot of information on the thruster, such as how fast the ions are coming out.  I've also used probes imbedded in surfaces to determine the properties of the ions reaching them and how this affects erosion. - RS.

To scale to higher power and higher thrust you need to increase the physical exit area of the device. There are a range of devices with different current density ranges at which they perform the best. So there are ion propulsion technologies that range from a few W up to MW. Over 200 spacecraft currently are flying electric propulsion (ion propulsion). Currently they are mostly communications satellites, but at higher power levels the technology can be used move around larger (heavier) things such as a space station or elements of a human exploration architecture beyond the orbit of the space station.

Most of the time this corresponds to science missions or station-keeping in Earth orbit.  I would still consider it a traditional-type propulsion (it accelerates gas), and the thrust levels are really low the trip times can be long.  Interplanetary travel can require a lot of propellant, so ion propulsion would be a great way to reduce that, but you would be waiting a long time to reach your destination (so it wouldn't be so good for a human mission). - RS.

And how does ion propulsion differ from this current tech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceokutu?context=5)|There are 2 main kinds of propulsion: chemical and electric. Ion propulsion is electric propulsion. Chemical propulsion uses the energy from a chemical reaction to generate thrust. Electric propulsion adds electrical energy to a propellant - the result is much higher fuel economy - DM.
 |Ion propulsion is used on over 200 spacecraft! For traveling through space (after launch), spacecraft use either chemical propellants like a rocket or some alternate advanced propulsion system such as ion propulsion. Chemical propulsion (think rockets) uses a fuel and oxidizer and ignites them producing a hot exhaust gas that provides high thrust to the vehicle. Maximum exhaust velocity limited to the chemical bonds. Ion propulsion uses electric energy to ionize and accelerate a gas to much higher exhaust velocities. This is more fuel efficient, but lower thrust. (DH)

For example, the Earth Observer 1 mission used a pulsed plasma thruster, in a technology demonstration, to control spacecraft attitude. Large interferometric observatories could use electric propulsion for fine control of position. Exoplanet observatories, such as New Worlds Observer, would use ion propulsion to move the occulter spacecraft around to the observatory-target line of sight. SB.

[Do any of you guys ever hit on girls by ""accidently"" dropping the fact that you're NASA engineers?  I want the truth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceomit3?context=5)|Married for 25 years, but I had no game back in the day, sorry - DM.
[What do you guys think about the whole Mars one mission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceokxrh?context=5)|I think its exciting. I am amazed at the willingness of people to risk their life for exploration - DM.
[Curious what it would take to make ion propulsion work in an atmosphere?  I know current designs can't but what would it take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceolq3t?context=5)|Electric propulsion doesn't work in atmosphere because you need to be able to ionize a gas and accelerate those particles over some distance prior to neutralization or collisions. In atmosphere there are too many neutral particles for ion propulsion to work. As you accelerate the particle it hits another air molecule and loses its directed energy. (DH)
[What is the one myth in your field the Mythbusters need to cover?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceom2c6?context=5)|That  TIE fighter could actually perform the maneuvers they show on Star Wars with current ion propulsion systems. (DH)
[Thanks for the AMA! As a follower of ion based propulsion, what are your feelings on Hayabusa and the VASIMIR system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceolr2b?context=5)|I think Hayabusa was awesome, especially the efforts of the team to get the spacecraft back to Earth. I think VASIMR is a great concept. The main challenge I think that idea faces it getting large enough/ high power spacecraft - DM.
[What relevance and application does a materials science and engineering background have for the work you are doing?  I am an undergraduate who is trying to figure out what type of work I want to specialize in with my classes and internships.  Thank you for all of your work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4czt/we_are_nasa_glenn_engineers_who_work_on_ion/ceomhjb?context=5)|We have a large materials science and technology area here at Glenn Research Center. However, that is not a big driver for electric propulsion. Generally, our specialties are plasma physics, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering (you have to convert the solar power to something that the thruster can use, and that gets tricky). - SB.

[I have a two-part question, Mr. Gnarr. In *D2: The Mighty Ducks* did you cheer for team Iceland? If so were you proud of them for going to go shake their opponents' hands despite losing in one of the most epic shootouts ever seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceome2y?context=5)|Of course I cheered for Iceland, like all Icelanders always. I was very proud of them to shake their opponents' hands despite their loss. I thought that was very typically Icelandic of them.
[Iceland is known to be one of the most progressive, peaceful and socially just countries in the world. What baffles many foreigners, then, is Iceland's pro-whaling attitude. What do you think about the whaling industry and why is this apparently so important to Icelandic identity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceommu6?context=5)|I think it's crap. It's not important to us, only to a very small group of men. 
[On election day, you came into the retail I used to work in to buy a brand new pair of shoes. They were black and a bit pointy.

Keep up the good work.

Please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceomp65?context=5)|I was in Canada last summer and I loved it.

Don't be sad, be glad it happened.
[In your previous AMA you said that you don't think Iceland entrance in the EU is really an important issue.  Why? Do you think the EU will ""work"", sooner or later, or is it a waste of time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceomjpg?context=5)|I know very little about the EU.

[Jon! What type of anarchism do you typically associate yourself with? From what I gather, you're a Taoist in the spiritual sense, but how about in practical terms? What are your thoughts on anarcho-syndicalist ideas, embodied in non-hierarchical labour unions like the IWW? (which has just started a Reykjavik branch in the last few months - join up...\).

It's just what I am. But on a professional level the Best Party is a way of taking comedy to a new level.

[Hi!  I'm a big fan, which is something I'm hesitant to say about any elected official.  What predictions do you have for the political climate over the next decade?  As we're saying a shift towards the right in almost all major world governments, do you believe the status quo will be moved to the right indefinitely, or do you foresee (as many do\) Western revolutions similar to those we have seen in the so-called East?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceomr31?context=5)|I really don't know. I think capitalism is the dominant power structure. Religion comes next. I think the greatest change we will see in politics in the future is an increased political relevance of cities and urban politics. Maybe with time, countries will just disappear. Maybe this right wing swing is just the last roar of the beast :)
[What do you think about Pirate Party? What would you suggest to the political pirates of today?  Do they stand a chance against badass copy monopolies and Monsanto private armies around the globe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceomkpo?context=5)|Everything is worth the efforts if it's fun.

[Hi Jon! Just want to say thanks so much for doing this AMA!  I'd like to know what you actually think of Russell Brand and his so called 'revolution'. Considering he has personally proclaimed that he has never voted in a UK General Election and we are currently living in a world where less and less young people are voting every year. Do you think he is a good role model for our society and a real arbiter for change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceon4t7?context=5)|I haven't really studied his ideology but he struck me as a likable, honest guy.

[Would it be unfair to say that the Best Party's handing over the torch to the Björt Framtíð political party symbolizes a resignation of the anarchic fervor that you brought into Icelandic politics? In what ways is BF not just another typical political party? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v4jfg/i_am_great_leader_and_humanitarian_lord_mayor_of/ceon38r?context=5)|Well, in a way the Best Party is technically not a political party. The only way to continue is to get political and that's what Björt framtíð is. But it takes with it the values of the Best Party, most importantly non violent communication and common sense.

[Thank you so much for doing this. As a loyal facebook follower, I appreciate your daily bits of humor, intelligence, and oddness.

I hadn't foreseen this impact :)
[Hi Jon! You've said that you're not going to run for election again (which saddens me, you're the best mayor of anywhere ever\). What do you think you're going to do next?

[Hello Jon,  What do you think about the jailed bankers and the unjailed bankers that still have definite guilt in your economic collapse? I mean, I'm sure you're all for them going to jail, but how would you tackle the rest of this mess if you were to try to do it within the bounds of reality? You've got some pretty good popularity in both Iceland and the rest of the world, how loud can you be while still being effective?

1v4yff,0,2014-01-13,Wannabe Game Dev,Banglinator,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1v4yff/wannabe_game_dev/,"Hey all,

I know you are likely tired of seeing this question, as I'm sure it pops up frequently. My goal in learning programing is to get in with a game developing company and be on the code side of game dev. My current experience is up to the ability to write a fizz buzz program, and basic I/O text based games, and I am at that level in java, ruby, and python. 

I want to do school,  and would (literally) kill for an internship opportunity.  Unfortunately my full time job makes both of those next to impossible, as I can't quit and continue to support myself and my fiance.

My question is, what do I need to focus on language wise, and what do I need to be able to accomplish before I can market myself for a job, preferably in the field I am aspiring to get into?

Thanks for being an awesome community."

I have a pretty big question as to what exactly the difference is between a CS major and a Software Engineering major or a Computer Engineering major. I enjoy coding and I definitely want to code as a job but I'm trying to differentiate between what exact major I should be looking for in a college.

Another big question I have is whether or not my skills are sufficient. I've recently started a IT internship with my school this year and about 3 months from now I'll (hopefully) be Comptia A+ certified which will allow me to work a paid internship over the summer at school. I am taking a intro computer programming class, at school, teaching Visual Basic 2010 this year and finding it very easy. I plan on taking an AP CS class next year. I unfortunately do not have much actual programming experience outside of this class however the way things have worked out I plan on focusing on IT certification this year and then focus on programming throughout my senior year in which I plan to work with iOS app development. I want to make it clear that I am only doing the IT internship to help create a strong resume for college and I do not intend to pursue the IT field. There is also the possibility of taking a 2 month vacation to Canada the summer before college. I would be volunteering for the IT department for the 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup however I am undecided about this because I feel like it would be placing too much emphasize on the IT field and not as much on programming.


I really just want to know if this is a solid road map leading up to college and if I'm going to have solid building blocks for my future career."

I'm a Junior in college with a CS major looking for a summer internship.  Basically here's the dilemma I'm facing:

* I put my github on my resume, an employer looks at it, sees there's not much there, and that the code isn't particularly good, and decides not to hire me.

* I don't give out my github account info.  Employer goes with someone with more initiative and demonstrated interest etc.

Thoughts on this?  There's just not much on there as is, and one of the projects is essentially copied code from a tutorial book (though the readme is honest about this).  Obviously the long term solution is to put some good code on there! But the career fair is in a week, so right now I'd love some advice.

I had an internship last summer where I made larger, fully fleshed-out web apps, but unfortunately they were for internal use only, so I can't pull them up to show-off in an interview and I didn't put them up when when I had access to the code.  Bummer.

I have a few options and I thought I'd run them by you.

1)  My research professor - I'm involved in undergraduate research and have worked under the same professor for three semesters.  I'll most likely also be doing my honors thesis with this professor and have had two classes with her (including one graduate-level course).  She's already agreed to write me one, so that's one letter down.

2)  My honors adviser - Each department has a faculty adviser who oversees students who are enrolled in the Departmental Honors track.  I've taken two classes with him and we have a good rapport.

3)  The ProbStats professor - Our department requires students to take our own probability and statistics course.  I did well in the course and I now grade for it.

4)  My boss from last summer - I had a relevant internship and my boss offered to write me a letter of rec if I needed one.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!"

I went to college and studied game development with an emphasis in programming gaining an associates degree. After falling on my face a couple of times i decided to just fall back on programming and finally what lead me down the software development path.

First question i have: should i go back for my 4 year degree in computer science seeing that I've already been working in the field for 2 years plus i have the associates as well (even though not in computer science)


second question: similar to the first question.  when applying for any jobs how does someone get around the ""need a bachelors in computer science or information technology"".


Third Question: I'm currently located in Kansas City and there are some opportunities here, but how would someone go about relocating to like Seattle and gaining employment?  I can't really just quit my job and move (i have a family).

Final Question: Git Hub Account - I've never really been a good new project idea guy, so just what the hell should I do to show off I can code? I've got some code snips from the projects I've worked on but that's not a full complete project I can show off."

1v7qjp,2,2014-01-14,Potential for a Game Dev Internship?,ShadowRaven6,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1v7qjp/potential_for_a_game_dev_internship/,"I'm currently 18 and completely self-taught as far as programming goes. I'm hoping to get an internship with any of the many game dev companies around where I live (Seattle, WA), but I have no idea what kind of programming knowledge any company expects interns to know before accepting them.

My high school didn't offer any programming courses, but I first taught myself some C++ and C# in my freshman year. I didn't teach myself much at the time, but I learned the basics. Sometime in my Junior year, I taught myself Java using Oracle's Java Tutorials. This is when I first learned how to create threaded applications. In my senior year, I decided to teach myself C++ and Java again, as I hadn't used Java for about a year and C++ for around 3 years. I decided to concentrate on C++, but I put it down again until around October last year. Since then, I've worked on multiple projects by myself, using only stuff I've taught myself. I have not yet gone to college, nor taken any online programming courses. Most of my experience is with C++ and some basic OpenGL. Here are some of my projects that I've created:

[Snake](http://youtu.be/42Y3U64QFms)

My very first project from when I just started programming again. It supports two modes- one where the user controls the snake and one where the snake is controlled using my implementation of the A* algorithm (this mode is shown in the video).

[Tower Defense](http://youtu.be/G-F0kt5Oojg)

A more recent project, I created this project just as a challenge to myself. Since it was personal only, I elected to not use textures for the towers, as I'm terrible at graphic design. I again implemented A* for the pathfinding.

[Cube Assembly](http://youtu.be/JMUsMQcIAt0)

I created this yesterday for really no reason, other than I thought of the idea and wanted to see how it looked.

[VoxByte](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUIiu8u2lUbwsKerxGCIIBxZJztBx8lSePlDjKOjovY/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a library I designed for personal use. The name is from the name I gave my game engine for the next project I'll mention, which was a play on the Frostbite engine name. The link leads to a Google Doc that I wrote in case I wanted to list off the features of my library for an interview.

Lastly, there is one final project I worked on. I'm a big fan of Voxel based terrain like Minecraft's, as it lets players modify the world as they please. so I decided to try my hand at writing a game similar to Minecraft. I undertook this project shortly after finishing Snake, so when I started, I had virtually zero programming experience. As a result, this project really taught me how to program and I learned nearly everything I know and use now, from language features to program architecture. I'm not currently developing it, as I don't feel like I know enough to be able to add enough features for it to be worthy of even an free release. However, I have a lot of images and videos from its development:

* [TerraCraft Development Album](http://imgur.com/a/kbLDR)
* [TerraCraft Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8AqY7tokGK22cAogiDEOHpMfzQS-KGpt)

My VoxByte library's design and implementation is literally a compilation of everything I figured out and learned over the course of developing TerraCraft. I began using a modular architecture for everything, which ensured as little connection between the different modules as possible. I also use a task scheduler at VoxByte's core, which lets me scale any program to the number of threads available to a system.

I've also read a lot about programming patterns, including the very helpful [Game Programming Patterns Book](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) (I know the author visits this subreddit, thank you very much for writing that!). I developed my modular architecture without really knowing how code is generally laid out in the industry, but from what I've read, I believe it's fairly similar to how code is organized in games. I feel very confident in using C++ and learning new techniques, but I don't feel like I know OpenGL very well, as I don't use it as much (Mostly just basic rendering as seen in most of my videos).

Having seen my work, what should I work on learning before contacting game dev studios around Seattle? How much do studios expect interns to know before accepting them, and how much do you learn on the job? Thank you very much for anyone who took the time to read this entire post all the way through and look at my work, and an even bigger thank you to anyone who takes the time to reply and help me out! =)"

I don't really like it. It's not engaging, interesting, or something I can see myself doing as a regular full-time employee. I asked my supervisor if I could shadow someone over in Department B because I was really keen on what they do over there. He said he *may* make some calls and look into it. Today (one month after I made the request), he said that the manager of Department B has not returned his calls, and he is dubious if they would take me at all.

About a week ago, I contacted Department B about what they do there, what kind of certifications they look for, and how I could get involved. Contact A said that they are hiring and that I should forward my resume to Contact B. Contact B says, 'looks great,' and we set up an interview. Interview goes well and I feel very confident that I will get the job. 

The supervisor of Department A clearly wants me to stay and is very reluctant to help me move into Department B. The thing is, my supervisor seems like a nice guy, but I have had no work, I don't accrue PTO or have benefits, whereas at Department B, I would be accruing these things as a regular full-time employee. I'm tired of being an intern.

Department A has had very little work for me to do in general and I am concerned that I may get let go. 

I don't want to burn my bridges, but there is little to keep me at Department A. I feel that I am at an awkward position since they have generously brought me on during a time when they normally don't take interns (this particular department has never had an intern before). I don't want them to think that I was only staying in Department A because I needed a buck. I was genuinely interested in the material when I first started, but I quickly realized that the job in itself was not for me.

A trusted co-worker advised me to stay on until I graduate in May, but I could *really* use the money and not having PTO really sucks.

**TL; DR: I'm in a boring internship that is not for me, where I am not accruing any PTO, vacation, benefits, etc. *This internship was left open ended without an end date even though I graduate in May.* Another department that I am more interested in has offered me regular full-time employment with benefits. My current supervisor seems like a nice guy, but I'm not not interested in their work. How do I move on without burning my bridges?**"

The only problem is on their job website they don't give much in the way of a job description, and on the 'main responsibilities' section of the job page it just says:

""As an Intern, you will join IFDS in Brentwood, Essex, only 30 minutes from the City of London where most of our clients reside. You will spend a total of 6 weeks of your summer break working on an IT project in our UK Head Office, in addition to a minimum of 2 weeks in our Bangkok branch where you will finish your project and exit interview before returning to the UK, alternatively you could take a few weeks off to take a well deserved holiday in Thailand!""

So they don't give much away about the job, and the title ""IT Intern"" is pretty vague, too.

Shall I talk about things like why I think IFDS would be a good company to work for, why I want a job in the finance industry, and more general things? I was thinking since a strong point in my application was owning my own business and being innovative that I could somehow spin this well while talking about the IT project we'll be working on?

Thanks!"
1v9z8x,5,2014-01-15,Graduated from College with a degree in Biology. Now want to shift career focus to Computer Programming. Advice?,BetaRhoOmega,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1v9z8x/graduated_from_college_with_a_degree_in_biology/,"I finished my degree in Biology this past May and have since moved to Washington, DC, looking for permanent work. I haven't found work yet, and in the mean time rediscovered my love for programming. I took a course on couresera.com teaching how to program simple games in Python, and purchased the book Head First Java and converted some of the projects from Python into Java. I'm realizing now this is the kind of work I would love. Of course, now I'm in a weird position though.

My question is, would it be possible to find employment programming without a computer science degree, or will I absolutely need to go back to school? Would getting certified in Java or C be worth it? Is it unusual to offer internships or training to people without an official academic background in computer science? Thanks for any help guys! I really appreciate any advice."

I just started as an IT intern at a small non-profit organization staffed almost entirely by volunteer 60+'s with minimal computer experience (thus, of course, a lot of the ""IT"" work consists of fixing the goddamn printer). I was originally hired to redo their website and most of my experience is in web design/CSS/WordPress that sort of thing, but I've discovered that dealing with the network (in addition to that stupid printer) is also expected. I am a COMPLETE beginner when it comes to networking and system administration with no idea where to start. 

Right now, they have around 10 workstations running either Windows 7 home, Vista, or XP and some staff people bring in their own laptops. They share files using DropBox and some of the computers are in a windows Homegroup together. I was initially told they had their own small server, but I'm on the job now and there's no sign of any server??? (I asked my supervisor who said, ""Oh I'm pretty sure we ordered something but I have no idea where it is""). This organization is woefully under-prepared for basically anything -- their wireless didn't even have a password how does that even happen?? And I want to help them as much as I can. I would really appreciate it if anyone could point me to some beginner resources or give me some advice! Thanks in advance."

I will find out what project I will be working on within the next few weeks. Whatever it is I intend to dedicate the comings months to learning the relevant fields so I feel prepared when I get there.

I have never worked a programming/software engineering job before, although I have done plenty of work with some projects online (so I at least know the basics of collaborating and I'm comfortable with a few vcs''). What should I know going in? Are there unspoken cultural elements of programming jobs I ought to know?

Based on my performance, I may graduate to the next year of internships. I'm a freshman at university right now, so it would be a while, but I could potentially graduate each year, and get a full time position afterward. In theory there's no where I'd rather work, so I want this to be an option.

I will also be living on my own for the first time, which I am relatively nervous about.

Thanks ahead for any advice!

I was an intern for about 8 months, and I've been full time for about 7 months now.  Over the past few months, I've started to realize that I don't see myself sticking with my current company, due to low pay, little room for growth, etc.

On a whim, I contacted another programming shop in town, even though they didn't have any applicable jobs posted for me on their site. I was contacted less than 12 hours after the initial message, and was asked to do a phone interview this week.  If all goes well, and they will offer me a decent pay increase over my current job, I'd be tempted to take the offer.

At the same time, I have been applying to a number of larger companies on the west coast of the US.  These companies seem like they would be able to provide me with excellent growth and opportunities, as well as open the door for even more future endeavors.

My dilemma is as follows: I currently live in a mid-size city that I absolutely love, but I fear there may not be enough opportunities here for me to truly continue to grow.  I'm worried that if I were to take a position with another local company, I may miss out on a chance to move out west. Even so, I'm not entirely sure if I'm ready to make that move or not.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation before, and if so, what was your decision making process?  I know that I must do what is best for myself and my career, but I don't want to make the wrong choice and end up kicking myself for it.

Any advice is much appreciated, and thanks for your thoughts."

Now we're switching both to SAP B1.

One company has been moved over. It's was a huge mess and extremely stressful, but we're operating pretty smoothly right now.

We're using SAP consultants, and they're not great.

I want to hire someone that can do SAP implementation work and take some of the load off of my hands, but we can't afford to hire an SAP specialist. If we were to do something like like that, we'd just go with a new consultant.

What might be a way to get what I'm looking for?

I'm thinking that the ideal solution would be an intern that needs work experience and is familiar with using/implementing SAP, writing Crystal Reports, etc., but I'm asking here first to see if that's a likely possibility.

I sure could use some advice on paths I could take.",Ziberzaba,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1vanfw/so_i_got_that_stem_degree_and_now_i_cant_find_a/,"I graduated last spring with a BS in physics and a minor in mechanical engineering at 30 years old, and I wrapped up a two year internship that involved data analysis and some programming.  The entire time I was in the program I was told that physicists are in high demand after graduation because we learn so many skills and our problem solving abilities are well known.  I personally think this is true, and don't believe that I was lied to in any way.  However I am having a really tough time getting started anywhere.  I have no interest in going to grad school, yet; and I would really like to start a career that lets me use my critical thinking and analytical skills.  
  
I've managed a few interviews at businesses and with recruiters, but every time I get the same question; ""So why physics?"".  I explain in a very professional manner why I did a physics undergrad, and they always seem very pleased with my answer.  However, at the end of the day I always seem to get the same response; we're looking for someone who really has ""X"" specific skill.  Most of which I have, but am not an expert in.  
  
I've been focusing mainly on junior programming positions, or other IT related fields, but I'm finding that my knowledge of programming isn't strong enough on paper.  I can only seem to get hardware support offers, which I don't want to continue doing.  I've been thinking about looking at analyst positions, as that's a lot of what I did in undergrad, but I'm concerned that they'll continue to look at minor shortcomings or my lack of a field specific degree.  I am also suffering from the way physics careers seem to be thought about in universities; you find out what you want to do after graduation.  I'm not really sure where to start, or who would be looking to hire people like me.  I really could use some good advice and suggestions.  Thank you.  
  
**TL;DR** Recently graduated with physics degree, keep getting told I don't have a specific enough skill set, and can't find a career.  Not really sure where to start either, as I'm not 100% sure what I want; but I know I want it to be something challenging that uses my strong problem solving and analytical skills."
1vaz4a,1,2014-01-15,"Friend moved away, shady landlord refusing to return security deposit. [CA]",Sahalis,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1vaz4a/friend_moved_away_shady_landlord_refusing_to/,"Posting for a friend.  

My friend was renting a room in a house for 5 months in Southern California while she completed an internship. Two weeks ago she moved back here (SF Bay Area), so about a 7 hour drive. Her landlord is now refusing to return her security deposit ($800).    

The landlord keeps changing his story as to why he thinks he can keep the money, but primary reason seems to be that she had a sub letter for 10 days. My friend was allowed to have a sub letter (says so in the lease) and got written permission from the landlord. When my friend called him on the phone, he screamed abuse at her and offered to give back $600, then $700. My friend probably should have just taken the money, but she was upset, and now he is not returning any of her calls.    

I know my friend has the option of taking him to small claims court. However, this guy is really shady and she has NO address for him to even send him a certified letter. My friend thinks he might pull this type of stuff a lot. He has a lot of different properties and his ""agents"" change their names and phone numbers a lot in emails and such. She's not sure if he's an illegal immigrant (it's possible), but some of the people in the house she was renting were illegally in the United States.   

Questions:  

1.) Can my friend go to the police, stress that she thinks her landlord is involved in some shady business and is very threatening, and have an officer give him a call? It might be sufficient to scare him into returning her money.   

2.) Is there any way to get an official address for this guy to serve him? She's tried looking online. I told her to send it to her old house, but she doesn't think he will get the letter.  

3.) If she files in small claims, does it have to be in Southern California? That is a hassle for her, and I think her landlord knows it, which is why he's willing to screw with her.   

Thanks for your input."

[Why is the Harold important? Please give your improv nerdiest answer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqdxu0?context=5)|First, it's the hardest. It's got an opening and required second beats and required callbacks. Those are the hardest things to do and by forcing you to do them you will become unbeatable. Second beats and callbacks are especially useful in almost any form -- but improvisers won't do them (At first) unless ""forced"" so it's good to do a form that forces you.
 |Second, it's part of the culture! Amy Poehler did Harolds and so are you.
 |Harolds force you to be GOOD. If your scene is weak you don't want to revisit it, but Harold says you have to. If you are good at finding ideas/games in a non-scenic opening you really understand that idea/game. If you have good scenes the Harold encourages your show to build and come together.  Some Non Harold forms do some or all of these. But The Harold isn't forgiving. Once you've learned the Harold it seeps into all other forms and for good reason.
[What's the best UCB show i should see in New York?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqdwer?context=5)|The best UCB show in NY (besides my improv team The Stepfathers) is Sketches From An Italian Restaurant: A Billy Joel Sketch Show which is super fun. Also whatever weird monstrosity Terry Withers is doing.  I grew up loving Steve Martin and Monty Python. Now I, like so many, can't get enough of Louis CK. But you know what? When, I laugh the most when I see Bill Cosby on Jimmy Fallon's show. He's still got it. I loved Seveteen Seventy Something. A musical about the birth of America as told by the Tea Party.
[How are your cats doing in LA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe2it?context=5)|To me delight and embarrassment, they made the trip pretty easily. -Will.
[What issue of the Amazing Spider-Man is the most pivotal in the series? Please both of you answer this and also defend your answers against the other's opinions of your answer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqefiv?context=5)|Amazing Spider-Man #33 - Shit got real. Doc Ock was scared. Spider-Man wasn't going to lose and let his Aunt May die. Will is going to agree with this, so I don't think I'll need to defend it more than that. - Kevin.
 |Gwen Stacy's death. One of the rare comic book deaths that wasn't undone. Added a level of devastation to the character that few other major superheroes have. Has not been forgetting in successive generations. Showed that Marvel had guts to do something dark at a time when it was risking plateauing. -Will p.s. hello chris. sorry there's no multiple man in that issue.
 |Gwen was boring. - Kevin.
 |Gwen was not boring! But even if she was, the death of a major character was a big deal. Tell me another story from 1973 that people still talk about in Marvel continuity!
 |Issue #33 is one of the all time great issues of Spider-Man but I'm not sure it's important.  I'm not sure it added anything that wasn't there already, even if it was done so well.
 |I think the introduction of Venom might be one of the most important things for Spider-Man's story, one of the rare post-Ditko great villains.
 |Gwen was smart and pretty and like Peter from moment one. Too perfect! The ONLY thing interesting about her was her death. Her Dad was more interesting because he was a father figure for a guy with no dad, and he maybe knew he was Spider-Man.
 |I think #33 was the first time it truly seemed hard for Spider-Man. What earlier story did he really feel pushed to the limit. If not pivotal for the character it was pivotal for the tone.
 |I agree that #33 is an amazing issue. Once people know that it was essentially Steve Ditko's close to the series you can see how great and epic it is. But I don't think it's had the impact fans would wish. It's like when you realize taht as great as Monty Python was, they probably didn't influence american comedy as much as early SNL, not even close.

Pack carrot sticks and yogurt cups. Avoid cookies and kit kats you pig! - Kevin.
[What's up with that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqdwwo?context=5)|There is a curse on UCB-NY that no machines are allowed to work. Only Soviet-level functionality can occur. Wi=fi is slow, vending machine is broken, air conditioning is hilarious. - Will.
[What are practical moves a committed team can make to improve their chances of success? An example of a practical move: practice one a week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqdwkp?context=5)|This is Will. Practice 3 hours a week with a committed coach. Do shows and have your coach there.  Try simple forms. Pick a specific goal and ask your coach if you hit it. See shows.
 |In addition to what Will said I'd recommend doing more shows. Find indie venues or start your own monthly run somewhere. Put your all in to that show too. Sober, non-fuck arounds. That's what Mother did. That's what Reuben Williams did. That's what Mailer Daemon and fwand did. I think you benefit from working so much. -Kevin.
[How important is owning cats to one's growth as an improviser?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqer7d?context=5)|Caring about animals shows empathy. A good performer can at least fake empathy. Adopt a cat! or dog! - Kevin.
[It seems that almost all who participate in 401 are accepted into Advanced Study at the theater which in turn dilutes the quality of the classes.  Is there ever any discussion about making it more difficult to be approved for advanced study classes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqedf0?context=5)|We definitely don't accept everyone. As the Academic Supervisor in NY I deal with broken hearted emails from people who didn't get in every day.  We waver on getting stricter and having people get angry and stuck in 401 and taking it over and over again - diluting that level and keeping it as is where some Adv Class don't feel Advanced Enough. But you know where I learned the most? After my classes, I joined groups of my peers and we challenged ourselves with a dedicated coach. If you find the classes aren't challenging you - then you take the time and challenge yourself.
[When you get to the level that both of you are at, how important is chemistry? Could you put on a dynamite show with any experienced improviser?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqedf0?context=5)|Chemistry is important. But good shows lead to good chemistry. When things work you like those around you. But AVOID judging your teammates. Once you start thinking someone isn't good, or that you don't like how they play it shows and spreads and hurts the team.
[What do you guys consider to be a good initiation off of a one word suggestion? No opening.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe0rk?context=5)|Something that sees the suggestion as an offer and accepts that offer. If someone says a celebrity --- you don't have to do a celebrity impersonation but you should speak to what you believe if the significance of that celebrity. If someone said Tom Cruise I wouldn't do an impersonation of tom cruise but i might do something abotu a guy who is always being asked if he's gay, or about someone who belongs to a religion that lots of pepole don't like? Or  I might be an action star. I dunno. -Will.
 |I like keeping it simple. One piece of information. Generally a who, what or where. I prefer to define what I (and my scene partner) are doing because it implies who and where and gets me started. But any piece of info gives my scene partner something to build off of. You'll have something soon if you keep building. -Kevin.
[How much of my base reality should I get out in my first line?

Don't drop a paragraph. Don't speak awkwardly and force it in. So, like I said - one piece a line is plenty.
[EDIT: Also thanks for answering my initial question!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqekrp?context=5)|You should be able to find a game by line 3-5 once you've been doing this a while, but you should never have to force it. It should grow out of your Yes ands. - Kevin.

[Will, what's going to happen to the UCB Long-Form Conversations podcast now that you're in LA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqfise?context=5)|People are fascinated with day jobs and making money! It's maybe the most asked thing I hear? How to make money? Do you have jobs? The current system of having to work for a living is more compelling than improv!
[Also, I'd love it if you asked people what they did for day jobs on that podcast. From the outside, there's a perception that everybody just does improv all day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqfise?context=5)|I believe John Frusciante is gonna keep the podcast going, yep. -Will.
[I am going to pursue a career in improv and sketch, and I was wondering if you knew of any internships or places that a performer can get experience with sketch and improv while still in college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqdyqr?context=5)|HOly jesus don't do it. There is no ""career"" except teaching other people to do it. Get a career in writing for tv/movies or acting or directing maybe maybe maybe doing stand-up. Do improv/sketch as a path to these other things. - Will.
 |I didn't do comedy in college, but I wish I did. Some colleges have stages and venues and those that don't have common areas and everyone has youtube. Find people to work with and CREATE! Colleges give you opportunities to do stuff. Take it. I can't speak for other schools. But UCB offers intensives. If you are in NY or LA for the summer you can take our 101 class in a week and our 201 class in a week. That's something! - Kevin.

The initiation usually has something to be processed and unpacked and the person responding feels too much pressure to add something. You could do a lot by requiring the second line have very little ANDing --- just confirm what you heard. -Will.

What do you guys feel is the key to making someone laugh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqedrh?context=5)|I don't really play improv games with non improvisers. A lot of the are like camp ice breakers. Fun at the time, but not really super fun long term. I love them in practice. That being said I play that mind meld iphone app, so maybe that counts? The best way to get better is to do way too much improv. Practices, shows, seeing shows, think about it. For a period get obsessed and then pull back some and let other influences back in. I don't know the key to making someone laugh, but it's all about communication.

 |I like Pattern Game. But that's probably because I so rarely have gotten to do it. It's pure and simple and the games are strong. But I had the most fun doing organic openings with fwand.
[When I hear about the old ali farahnakian days of UCB, I picture the 2000-2005 era as basically a 5 year long continuous DCM. Part of that is nostalgia, but do you think the UCB's weirdness has gotten gentrified in any meaningful way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeofr?context=5)|I'm suspicious of such nostalgia, though I'm certainly responsible for propogating it. I think that there were shows and times that were magical in a way that can only happen in a smaller community. I remember DCM 2 where tiny and rachel did a bunch of stuff for like an hour at 3am between Friday and Saturday. Or the two man set Ian and Ali did for a few weeks. But there were also way more bad shows and everything was more amateur in general. And it was meaner, maybe. You were very on your own. Had to tough out being cool enough to be asked to do stuff. I think there's a trade-off with size. -Will.
[Will, you've had your own sketch show right? What would be some advice you would give to someone about how to create successful sketches? Is it better to hammer away at one idea until it sticks or write a thousand ideas hoping one can turn into gold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeajl?context=5)|Sketch: keep it simple. A sketch is a like a joke, not a story. Embrace patterns. INdulge something you would be excited to do, be it silence or darkness (content wise) or verbosity or silliness. -Will.

[Do 'hobbyist' improvisers help or hurt the improv community? Do serious improvisers who are trying to 'make it' look down on people who are just into improv for the experience/fun and not because they have any particular desire to go into acting or writing or whatnot?

What's your level of commitment once the show starts? YOu can play like a pro even if you're just doing it for love.-Will.
[Who are some improvisers that inspired you and do they still?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe7rb?context=5)|Lots inspire me. ALl the time I see things that amaze me. Betsy Sodaro is magic. Aaron Jackson can do no wrong. Neil Casey makes everything better. Anthony Atamanuik is always always exciting. Sue Galloway surprises me every time. -Will.
 |Early on it was the big guns: Ian Roberts. Micheal Delaney. Jason Manzoukas. And everytime I see them they show me something new. Later on it was playing with people like: Jon Gabrus. Shannon O Neil. Charlie Todd. Everytime I step back and look at them I see how good, they are and I steal and learn from them. -Kevin.
 |I forgot Laura Willcox. I think she's another one who always does what the scene needs. That ability really impresses me.
[Obviously, UCB does well in bringing in audiences now. Can you talk about the point of transition where things went from shows where there might be a small audience (or no audience\) to being able to count on some kind of steady stream of audience members? What do you remember about UCB making it over that hill, so to speak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqg81c?context=5)|I'd like to ask Besser this, actually! Or Anthony King. To me, there were always enough people. By the time I was ""up"" enough to really think about it, things were solid. -Will.
[How often do you write every week? I'm trying to get a gauge on how much I should be writing.  Advice to a beginner sketch writer?  Which has more comedic potential, borscht in the butt or cooked yams in the butt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe1uz?context=5)|You should write every day. I don't and I know that's the place I need to work harder. - Kevin.
[How do you handle teammates who don't seem to communicate or want to book shows? Specific, I know, but I'm having this problem. What if you're the only one who seems to care?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqgjd2?context=5)|This is tough. One, make sure that you're not confusing ""caring"" with ""doing it the way you want.""  Maybe people are caring, but about different aspects of the project? I say that because I've been on the other end of someone telling me I didn't care enough when really, I just didn't care about what they wanted me to care about. It's different. If that's the case, you need to have talk about the group's priorities.
 |BUT -- if no one else will help with the work, then that is a drag and I sympathize. Keep an eye out for other people/groups but in the meantime do the work and know that you will be rewarded by the improv gods somehow. -Will.

Are you? DOn't do that. Get a coach who's good and do what he/she says.
[Also a good exercise for getting people to accept offers that they're naturally inclined to defend because in real life they'd be mean (e.g. you're always late\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeszd?context=5)|Accepting offers: don't make offers that are mean because of real life stuff.-Will.
[When did you break out of playing strictly straight man and start playing looser, crazier characters? How did that happen?  Are either of you ever going get to interviewed for the podcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe6tu?context=5)|What podcast? The UCB podcast? Will co-ran it, so he was never interviewed. I think I played less straight men during the time I was on fwand. The team was full of funny, crazy, talented folks and I got jealous and pushed myself to play more like them. I didn't notice the results until I played with other teams and saw how far I had grown. - Kevin.
[Hi. You have both taught many people comedy in NYC.  When instructing an individual, do you prefer to help steer them in a particular direction or let them find their own direction themselves?  Or is it circumstantial, like everything else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe7w1?context=5)|I usually just teach what I teach. Now and then I'll have individual advice. -Will.
 |I try to point out trends. You do this a lot or you never do this. Whether good or bad it can help focus you into finding new strengths and or fix weaknesses. A great improviser has to learn to take all their notes and guide themselves to some degree. All a coach or teacher can do is give a push. Good teachers can push you ahead, a bad teacher I'd guess could slow you down. - Kevin.
[How different is an improv class versus a sketch writing class? Would you be able to learn sketch writing intuitively thru improv? Thanks gurus of comedy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe6zr?context=5)|They overlap at UCB because they both deal with game. In improv you are writing, acting, directing the scene in the moment. There are things (Mistakes?) that work in improv that would not work in sketch.  Sketch is about re-writing, and polishing, and making it better. Improv its about being as good as possible as soon as possible. That's one difference anyway. -Kevin.

It seems to speed up. People get better at initiating strong ideas and so stuff goes quickly. Innovation: lots of interview openings these days; I think those should go away. -Will.
[How often do you meet students who actually have a shot at doing improv as a career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqe6nt?context=5)|No one does it as a career. You can teach it as a career. Do you mean be a fixture at a theatre as an unpaid member of a house team? Maybe once a year. -Will.
[Was there ever any sibling rivalry between you guys? Basically, who was the first to get into comedy, and who's riding off his coattails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqehex?context=5)|Will was first. I followed him. The rivalry is that Will is better and I am stuck in his shadow, but most of that might build out of growing up a middle child and those insecurities. - Kevin.
[Have you ever been in front of a dead audience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqf9jo?context=5)|I've had some audiences that were NOT into it. Early on that would have destroyed me. But I've gotten better at playing for me, and trusting my moves. I'll listen to what the audience likes/dislikes but I have to trust me more. Still - it feels better to have an audience that's ready to laugh. Best suggestion? That's tough. I really enjoyed getting Writer's Strike for a fwand show... but in general I hate the more pitch like suggestions. - Kevin.
[I can't imagine anything worse than a quite audience, that doesn't laugh, or respond to anything.  Anyway, how have/would you dealt/deal with situations like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqf9jo?context=5)|Yeah, it's brutal. I tough it out. I take it as a point of honor to endure it like a Slavic farmer enduring a drought. I've done enough shows at this point that I can shake it off, usually.
[Also, what's the best word someone has given you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqf9jo?context=5)|Favorite suggestion was when I was on a team called ""Monkeydick"" and we asked for a suggestion and someone shouted ""Monkeydick."" -Will.
[You mentioned, using improv as a stepping stone to writing/acting? Could you elaborate, or offer any advice on that subject? That's what I'm trying to do! BTW, this is Will the intern from the LA theatre!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqerxc?context=5)|Hi Will. Thanks for helping Kevin and I with photos the other day. I'm not sure but trying to figure it out. So far I've: done stuff I liked with people I liked and tried to be appreciative and excited and also spend time watching other people's stuff. -Will.
 |Step 1) Take pictures of people who show up at the theater. 2) improv helps you understand what's funny and how to communicate that to an audience. So it fine tunes your comedy sense and your comedic voice. To get good at it you need to become a better actor. So it works a lot of muscles.  I am not sure how to get work (as I am still not working in the industry) but you need more then improv. Use the skills that improv honed and focus them on something else. Acting or writing most likely. Make sketch shows or videos or act in plays. Work a lot! -Kevin.
[What's the most sex you've seen someone have onstage during an improv show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqepil?context=5)|I believe I saw Birch HArms and Bobby Moynihan do a pretty full simulation of intercourse in an old Couples Skate show, until Bobby's character got stuck in Birch's mimed zipper? - Will.

[Who is your favorite Harold team of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqee41?context=5)|Swarm is the easiest answer. They were so good and so simple. They embraces silence so well. But when Mother got good they seemed to do the most complete, strong Harolds. Other greats: Creep, Respecto Montalbon, and Dillinger/Shoves -Kevin.
 |The Swarm is the best improv team I have ever seen. When they were active and practicing they did amazing Harolds. One of the few teams I've seen that could reliably start slow but end big and huge in almost every scene.
 |Honorable mention to fwand for being so insand that they would break their harolds with dumbness and then always bring it back to greatness. -Will.
[Could you beat Gethard in a fight? He seems scrappy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqfv1t?context=5)|If I was full mad, I'd win. Otherwise he'd probably win if only because i couldn't commit to it. -Will.
[Is there a man alive that plays a woman better than Neil Casey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeh5n?context=5)|Neil is terrific but for my money Michael Delaney is the best actor in the UCB-NY community. -Will.
[I'm primarily an improviser, and I'm about to perform in my second-ever sketch show. I have no other theater background or experience. I'm finding that I have a lot of anxiety about remembering lines &amp; cues, since I'm so used to listening &amp; reacting spontaneously. Do you have any tips for experienced improvisers turned amateur sketch actors regarding lines &amp; memorization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeogf?context=5)|WHen I have a sketch, I record all the other parts into a voice memo in my iphone ,leaving silences for my lines. Then I play it back and try to say my lines. That helps me quickly. -Will.
 |I have gotten better at memorization. I for a short while filmed introductions for EPIX films and had to memorize a lot in a short time. All monologues. So I got good and just running them over and over until it got easier. Not really an answer, just I feel your pain! and it gets easier! - Kevin.
[When was the last time you did something a ghost couldn't do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeawe?context=5)|Can a ghost shower? - Kevin.

It was mind blowing, you guys are amazing and a huge inspiration to my troupe back home.  Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vasks/we_are_will_hines_and_kevin_hines/ceqeyfk?context=5)|I think what people mean is, be ready for lots and lots of rejection. Way more then you want. If you go into comedy expecting it to be easy you're in for a shock. So follow that dream, but it's hard work and there are lots of people trying and there aren't that many jobs. But to get good you need to put a lot of time in to this. So it's hard to do that and have a different career. At some point people have to choose... is this a hobby? Or their life? - Kevin.
[I've been watching a lot of improv  videos on YouTube, including The Brothers Hines, and they're really entertaining. Have you guys had any ideas to bring long form improv to television?

 |I think the handful  of videos of live improv on UCBComedy.com came out really well! I think it could work, though it's still taking a live theater show and filming it.

We change the curriculum every year. It's pretty solid right now, so it's often tweaking and slight modifying. This year we are attacking second beats earlier in 201 to hopefully help our students have a better handle on game and second beats by the end of class - Kevin.

So could they have expected me to bomb the first one and just wanted to see my thought process, or am I unprepared?"

I fucked around too much at Davis my freshman year and didn't take it seriously, got shit grades, missed a entry level requirement and got kicked out after the 2012-2013 school year. Since then, I got my act together and I fulfilled that requirement and am applying for readmission in spring quarter.

The problem is, I'm not 100% sure I'm going to get back in, which would be a huge problem because I now live in Reno with my dad. So if I don't get back in, I'm not going to be in that good of a position. So I'm trying to prepare for the worst here in case if I don't get back in. What should I do? Should I even bother going to a Reno community college, or try to build up experience? I don't really know which path to take.

**edit:** I should also mention what I could put on a resume....

I've been coding since I was 13, grew up in the silicon valley, had an internship while I was still in highschool. After high school I went to UC Davis for a year.

I've been working on a pretty complex iPhone app (unreleased) for the past year, it has about 50,000 lines of code in it at this point. And I can say I know Objective-C pretty damn well, inside and out. Including jailbreak development, core audio, core data, all those funky low-level things in &lt;objc/objc.h&gt;, embedding Lua, etc. etc. I also know Java, Web development (LAMP), python, C/C++, git, how to setup a arch linux box, tons of unix commands like vim, screen, grep, less, piping commands, bash scripting, etc. I've also been contributing to a lot of FOSS software as well.

My resume does not list Ruby as a language I know (I know Python, Java, Javascript, and C#). Furthermore, much of the company's code is open source, and everything in their GitHub repository is in Java (a language that I do know).

Is it acceptable to request to write the program in a language I know?

Things were great for a while, learned a lot... .NET 3.5-4, SQL server along with front end web dev, html, css, js, jquery. Also use many 3rd party applications for Content Management and E-Commerce, Know both iOS and Android development as well. Well, suddenly feeling like I'm not reaching my potential. The pay is low. My yearly raise was 50 cents and am just frustrated and feeling like i'm not being compensated well. 

On top of development, I also do tech support for clients' web and mail hosting, through answering the phone and email. Also help run/support some e-commerce websites.

My main question is, and of course this is area specific (I'm NE Ohio, not Cleveland), but what would be a good ballpark salary for a ""full-stack"" (front-end, back-end, database and service) .NET dev with two years experience, who also knows both major mobile platform development and integration of the two (web-service and mobile app)? I just want to get a feel for if I'm being taken advantage of

I'll be looking for employment at some point in the near future, but also feel I'm not really ""ready"" for an interview, maybe just a confidence thing... I would like to learn php, mySql to pad my knowledge of web development, as I feel it's a great field that still has tons of potential. I also love mobile development, but we haven't done much at my place of employment as I would like. So what are some good ways to get motivated to work? I have one large project that is on hold, and a smaller one. I want to get these going so I actually have something to show for myself, but I am just entirely drained.

they got in contact with me immediately after i sent in my resume and sample work. they loved it and my phone interview went great. that interview was w/ the VP. she said i wouldn't be able to be brought on as an intern for legal reasons, but wanted me to speak with the owner and see if anything could be worked out. she set up another phone interview with the owner a couple of days later. 

again, it went great and he wanted me to set up a trend report and bring it in for a live interview. i didn't think it was too much to ask. they wanted to see my skills. i worked on it as much as i could and it came out really well. the interview actually took place in his apartment, though they tried convincing me it was used only as an office and they wanted a view of the beach. i rolled with it, though they wouldn't show me the bedroom (i'm assuming it was the owners bedroom). anyway, it went great again. they actually wanted to keep the trend report, but i denied their request saying i had another interview later that day. 

i never heard back from them again until 3 months later. i received an e-mail from the VP pretty much fishing for another trend report and tips. these trend reports take a lot of work and i'm not open to making another in exchange for nothing. does it not sound like they're trying to take advantage of a new graduate trying to break into the business? i understand they're still a brand new company and probably can't bring in a new employee, but it shouldn't be too awkward of me to offer them trend packages for a fee, right? i thought it was ridiculous she would even try this. 

what do you guys think?

I got my Bachelor's in Math and Computer Science from Purdue in 2008 and a Master's from Tsinghua (a top STEM school in Beijing) in 2012. 

I had a job lined up at a tech startup in Beijing and came back to the US to handle the work visa.  Unfortunatly, I was recently told that there was some funding that the company was banking on that fell through, and they won't be able to support me coming on full time.  They are still willing to help sponsor my visa, which puts me in the States for another 6-8 weeks.  

In the meantime, I'm looking again for work.  This will be my first real job (I have some internship experience) and would ideally like to work getting some more programming experience or with a consulting company.  I would really like to be based in Beijing, given that's where I've been for the past 6 years, and it feels very much like home.  

 I'm wondering if anyone here has some suggestions for companies in the US that I might be able to apply to (or visit) while I'm here.  I live in Indianapolis, and will be travelling to New York, Washington DC, and Boston next week to visit friends and hopefully meet with some people about job prospects.  I feel like I have a unique background that would probably fit nicely into what many companies are doing (i.e. working with companies in China), but I'm trying to find different avenues for finding them (or helping them find me).

Shortly after, during the summer before I turned 18, I started working as an intern at a small company in their IT group. I gave working part-time, going to school full time a shot a couple of years later, but it just wasn't working. Up to that point, I was the kid that didn't have to try hard in class to pass tests and keep up with the learning. I abused that in my early years and didn't take school seriously, because I was bored most of the time. This, of course, carried on into college, so after 3 semesters of mostly general education, I became bored again and decided to go back to work.

So, other than a 3 year break for school, during which I started my own IT consultant company and kept working (very low key, not a lot of money, just something to do), I have been working full time. My most recent job is in the city at a well known company. I've been here about 8 years. I worked my way up from Service Desk to the Network team and everything is going very well for my career.

HOWEVER, for personal reasons, I really want to go back and finish a computer science degree. I've had my eye on Berkeley, but was basically laughed at by a couple of people at work who attended Berkeley years back - their response was ""Not going to happen. And even if it did, you'd likely drop out due to how insanely difficult it is.""

I consider myself smart, maybe even gifted, but not really ""school"" or ""college"" smart, if that makes sense? I'm definitely not a genius, and believe the people I spoke to at work are smarter than me. So I feel like I really don't have a chance. AND, if I want to keep working full time, which I do because I love my job and I need the money, then I'm limited geographically. I've looked at San Francisco State University, but they're ranked pretty ""meh"" on the academic scales. 

So, the question is, where or how do I obtain a worthwhile education (Computer Science) in my situation, in the San Francisco Bay Area? I want to have an actual degree, not certifications. I already have multiple Linux and Network certs (CCENT, CCNA, BCNE, LPIC-1, etc.). I feel like SFSU is an option, but do I really want to spend the money on such an average education? There are private schools that do more online stuff, but they're even MORE expensive, and arguably just as bad, or worse, in quality. 

TLDR; 31, working full time, want to go to Berkeley to get a degree in CS but was told it's pretty much impossible - how can I increase my chances, or what would an alternate path be for a high quality CS education in the SF Bay Area?

EDIT: Still deciding for the most part, and looking into options, but someone brought up Cognitive Science as an alternative. I guess my goal is to round out my skill set (read: learn to program well and pick up new languages). However, with CS, you get a TON of theory, algorithms, and high level math that I think would be wasted on my future. And since they're no joke to pass, it'd be extra difficult for me if I wasn't into them. SO, I could do Cognitive Science, which is an easier program to get into, and MINOR in Computer Science, since there are crossover classes. "

I have some questions about my next steps and current status of things.  To start, I have a year of direct experience in Engineering  from internships and 4 years of relative experience, from the military and also a very good GPA.  I have 18 units left and it may be tough, but I will try to graduate this spring. 

First, there are 3 companies involved.  Let's call them N, L, and X. There are also three locations involved: P,S,and O.  N is a very well known large company and would probably be super exciting to work for and they have multiple locations.  This whole thing started when I applied for an internship with N.  N has locations in O and P.  I got a call from N and they wanted to fly me out to O for an interview.  When I returned I got a call from L for an interview.  They are located where I am located...in S.  After my interview with L, I got an offer for an internship with N.  Soon after my internship offer with N, I got a full time offer from L. I told N about my offer with L and they were trying to make me a full time offer, but couldn't in time so I took the offer from L.  N still wants to keep in touch and all the like.  L is a smaller company, yet stable. The offer was very fair though not as high as I would like.  Today, I get a call from X for a full time position interview in P.  My wife and I would like to eventually end up in P.  X is another larger company, but may not be as fun as N or L, but that is only speculation.

1vew32,3,2014-01-16,Fast projects to put on resume?,watermelonbattery,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1vew32/fast_projects_to_put_on_resume/,"Hey friends, I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I'm currently in my third year second semester at university for computer science but switched into my computer science last year so I'm a couple of courses behind, but I've gone through and thoroughly understood a lot of core programming concepts (taught in Python).

The coop/internship program at my school only accepts 2nd and 3rd years so this is my last chance to find placement for an internship. Most intership ads that I see stress Java and Javascript (among other things) which I'm teaching myself right now at a furious pace.

My dilemma is this: Since I'm just starting my core CS classes now I don't have many noteworthy projects that I can list on my resume, so it's going to have a big white space where 'projects' should be. The only thing I've really done was a political vote counting program and a tower of hanoi simulator done in Python, but even in those projects our professors had filled in a lot of the code for us to begin with as a skeleton and we just had to code like 60% of it, so I'm hesitant on listing it as a 'personal project'.

I know listing quick/easy projects may not demonstrate my knowledge that well in this field but a lot of the internship ads have a deadline that's closing soon which is why I'm kind of in a rush to fill up the the white space in my resume so that I can at least submit my applications. 

Are there any quick projects that I can code by myself (or with a little help from guides) in Java, Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS, or Python that will make me look like less of a noob on my resume?"
1vexso,3,2014-01-16,College student having existential crisis...again.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1vexso/college_student_having_existential_crisisagain/,"Long story short (jk, post is long), I'm in my 2nd semester of sophomore year .  I've changed my major twice already.  I came in as an intl. studies major, realized I didn't like politics, then changed it to Biopsych because I like psych, was interested in bio, and wanted to work with animals.  Realized working w/ animals brings low pay unless you're a vet (no interest in med school/more years beyond a master's degree) so decided to focus on the field of Occupational Therapy.  I got a 2.7 and 3.0 my freshman year of college, and then a 2.2 last semester GPA.  I got two Cs in bio and chem, and a B- in statistics.  Oddly enough, Stat was the class I thought I was failing, while I thought I was doing great in bio and okay in chem.  Changed my major to Psych, partially because many of the required courses for Biopsych weren't a grad school prereq and I no longer had interest (genetics, orgo chem, ect), and I also know that I would just be fucking up my gpa taking some of those classes.  I know my weaknesses.

Anyway, now I'm taking Gen Bio II (easier professor), Gen Chem II, a psych class and a sociology class.  I freaking love psych and soc, and I still like bio and my professor is more chill.  Still don't care for chem.  What I've noticed is that I do well in classes like psych, sociology, and english.  

I would still love to go to grad school for OT, but fear that even if I pull out all As for the next 2.5 years (including taking summer courses), I'd still have a shitty gpa.  I don't know any high paying careers that involve psych, sociology, or english that don't involve Starbucks or getting a ph.D, which I have neither the desire nor money for.  

I was just wondering if I should stick with trying to get into OT straight after my undergrad, or perhaps take a year off after my undergrad, work, and retake some courses to improve my gpa (which will most likely be in the 3.1-3.5 range if I do somewhere between okay and great from now on), and THEN apply to Grad School for OT?  Or perhaps look into another career option altogether?

Last semester, I was miserable taking statistics and chemistry.  Freshman year, I was miserable taking freshman prereqs, politics, and biopysch prereqs (precalc, which I suck at).  This semester, I love my classes, and I'm actually good at them, and they interest me.  I just don't know if I should:

a. pursue something in a Psych or Soc (or both) field because it's interesting, makes me happy, is easier for me to comprehend and will make my gpa better.  I have no clue about careers in the psych or soc field that would be high paying without a phd, so I fear graduating and then ending up at McDonalds because I ""majored in what I love.""  I will start doing a bunch of internships, yet even those don't guarentee employment after graduating.  I also don't really know what I want to specifically be employed in, so I don't really have a set, mapped out plan of action.  I just know that I really love the courses.  

b.  pursue OT, which is also very intersting to me.  I would love to work with old people.  I have a soft spot for them, as well as animals.  OT is a high paying career, but I fucked up my first year and a half, and am afraid I'm not ""smart"" enough to really pursue such a career because of my grades last semester (grad school prereq courses) and overall gpa.  Grad school requires psych and bio prereqs, as well as things like soc, english, anthro, stat, ect.  I have the psych prereqs down pat (so far), but my bio, chem, and stat grades from last semester scare me.  The rest of the bio prereqs I will have to take as a transient at a CC because my expensive ass school doesn't offer them without ridiculous pre/corereqs.  Not to mention, I have no clue how I'm gonna pay for transient courses, or obtain a lot of OT observation hours.    

I'm seriously considering leaving college and society, and living in the wild off of berries and shit, but I can't go a few days without shaving my poon and armpits, and I love showers so...that's out of the question.

Tell me nice things, or hit me with some real shit that's gonna hurt my feelings.  Either is welcome.

My undergrad ECs are not great. I was involved in an engineering honors society and student charity cheering section.  

My work experience involves an internship I did with a top defense company during undergrad. I have been working as a design engineer at a top engineering company (Texas Instruments) for about a year. 

The reason I want an MBA is because I want to eventually go into investment banking and finance. I was just looking for some tips as to what I can do to improve my application outside of advancing in my job. I realize all my work experience is strictly in engineering, so I don't know if that will put me at a disadvantage? Does anybody know of any ECs I can do outside of work to improve my leadership experience? I was looking into some and thinking about volunteer tutoring kids on the weekends sometime. 

I want to eventually go to a school like Kellogg or Booth. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!  "

My SO is in his second to last semester of Undergrad and may have the opportunity to intern and work as a TA at a classical/Montessori school for the semester and Summer. He is interested in education and education reform. The school is also a Christian school and has some bible study time but has a very good curriculum over all. 

The problem is the majority of his other work experiences have been at Christian camps and youth retreats as a counselor, Assistant Director, and design team leader. 

He also volunteers at the Boys and Girls club and at a local non-profit crisis center, but as mentioned before, his biggest resume building experiences have been with Christian organizations. 

My question is does having the majority of your work experience as part of a christian organization raise any red flags for when he eventually goes to apply for full time positions or graduate school?

Thank you!"

Her: Oh god, Oh god, Oh god, It's all gone. Everything is gone. Please I need help!

Me: Wait... what's gone?

Her: All of it. All the patient information. Every sale we made tonight isn't there!

Me: (*in a tired haze*) Ok, calm down... walk me through what you did with the computers tonight.

Her: Well, while I was finishing up the shift, I had one of my interns restart and fix up the computer, because it had been running slow

Me: Does this intern know what the hell they were doing?

Her: Well, she said her dad taught her quite a lot about computers

Me: Where is she now?

Her: About to clock out. I'll put her on.

.....

Intern: Hello?

Me: What did you do to the computers?

Intern: They were running slow, so I used the Microsoft chat service to get some help, like dad always does. 

Me: What did YOU do to the computers?!

Intern: I turned them on and off again, but they were still slow. The support guys said that excess software and files would be taking up a lot of the machines working capacity, so I began deleting files...

Me: I'm going to have to stop you right there. Put [Pharmacist] back on for me.

Her: Please tell me this can be fixed.

Me: Well, start by firing that idiot. She went ahead and began deleting FRED files. I'm glad she didn't get further into the software. Do you have much security on those things?

Her: Well, this owner said he won't put on extra security, because they're already pretty secure back here with the drugs...

....

Me: I'd recommend telling him to either hire smarter staff, or begin having decent set ups where people can't just go into the computer and delete files. Now, can you access the trash can?

Her: Yes.

Me: Are there still things in there?

Her: Quite a lot, the icon says the bin is full.

Me: Open the damn bin.

Her: Hey, FRED files! Holy shit this is excellent, thank you so much!

Me: Now restore them back to their original place settings. And please encourage the owner to hire a damn IT person soon. They're going to have bigger troubles on their hands if they keep up this security setup.

At least I know which Pharmacy not to go to...

Edit: Should mention that I'm in Australia. Different laws and requirements, but still, this is a pretty fucking major issue. Will edit a follow up if I find out what happened to the intern."

The name is very well known among all other tech companies in the area. I really enjoyed working at the company but due to a change in how hiring was done for the team I was on I was not extended a full time offer. My lead had told me that they could not hire me even though they initially took me on as an intern with the intent of keeping me full time. The vast majority of my engineering friends that worked there with me got full time offers. 

Here's my issue: Every time I talk to a new potential employer they interrogate me on why I am not returning to my old company. I try explaining to them things I didn't like with my job/things I am looking for in another position but they then interrogate me upon whether or not I got an offer to which I eventually have to explain what my lead told me. All of my interviews start this way and make me feel as though I am being attacked which deflates my self esteem for the rest of the interview. 

How do I deal with this situation? It's bad enough that I didn't get an offer but now it seems as though my lack of offer is stopping me from getting offers at other companies. "
1vgvta,0,2014-01-17,"Sorry to dump this on you guys, but I need a place to host this so I can include the link in my job postings. Thanks!",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1vgvta/sorry_to_dump_this_on_you_guys_but_i_need_a_place/,"Our clients *pay* us to find them exactly what they’re looking for. If they wanted underqualified, unrelated or dishonest candidates, or ones who are “looking to make a career change”, they’d post a free Craigslist ad and sift through the endless “If’s, And’s and But’s” for themselves.  

Whether it be for lack of time or resources, these companies come to us to find them qualified candidates with the background and skill set they have deemed necessary for the position at their organization. We have an obligation to them to present the best possible candidates who are available and interested, and who *fit the job description*. There is rarely time or money available for heavy training or ramp-up time; often candidates are expected to hit the ground running from day one. Again, if they wanted to accept any old application from less-than-a-perfect-fit candidates, they’d be recruiting for themselves.

If the client asks for an A+ certification, *an A+ certification is required*. If the client asks for prior experience in the Medical Device industry, *prior experience in the medical device industry is required*. These requirements are **always** listed in my job postings to the best of my abilities (there will be surprises from time to time, and I do try my best to update existing postings the more I learn). If something is listed as a “plus”… well, that’s quite a grey area we’ll be dealing with. More often than not, our clients will be presented with enough candidates possessing the “plus” that you can **pretty much consider it a requirement.**


We primarily work on a fixed-rate markup, meaning **the more you get paid, the more I get paid.** If a pay rate is set in stone, **I post it as such.** If a pay rate is in a certain range, **I post it as such.**  If a pay rate is “open” or “market”, this could mean one of two things. Either A) The client is truly open on salary range and would like to see what candidates are asking for. This doesn’t necessarily guarantee what they’ll offer if you’re extended the position, but they’re at least open to considering your going rate. The second most common reason for an “open” pay rate is B) They will gather a pre-determined number of resumes, average out the asking rates and then decide what their salary cap will be based on what they’re seeing. When they’ve determined what their set rate or range will be, I update my postings to reflect. In any case, I do not have control over what the client is offering for a position. 

In regards to contract positions, *I do try to be brutally honest about contract lengths and likeliness of converting to permanent.* In some cases positions are strictly project-based or a leave coverage, and will end vaguely around the time frame indicated. In far more numerous cases, contracts are more of a “try before you buy” situation, or a trial period if you will. Pending nothing disastrous happening, you would likely be extended or converted within 3-6 months. Extension or conversion is almost always based on performance, but could also be affected by workload and budgeting.

(A quick note to students: We don’t typically fill internship positions, sorry :(  My best suggestion would be to check with your school’s internship coordinator, or visit the websites of any companies you’re interested in and apply directly – most organizations aren’t going to pay a staffing fee for an intern. The majority of our positions are full-time, M-F 40 hour/week schedules as well, and don’t allow much flexibility on that.)

So here’s the thing: I don’t have time for whining. Whine to your mom, or your spouse, or whoever is there for you to vent your frustrations towards. Find one of the numerous forums dedicated to the vast injustices of corporate America and lament together over low salaries and stringent qualification requirements. I do feel the need to personally respond to anyone who reaches out to me, and I’m finding that talking people down off of a cliff is eating up a significant amount of my time. This is the way this industry works, and until someone in a leadership position finds the means to change it, this is how it will be. **Run for office** and impose heavier restrictions on the industry, and I can promise you’ll have my vote!

That said, I am more than happy to help you out otherwise and in a non-psychiatric capacity.  If you’re not necessarily a fit for a certain position but are actively (heck, even passively) looking for work, I welcome you to send your resume along and I can keep an eye out for anything that might possibly be a fit. We recruit coast to coast, for positions across the board in a number of industries. (We **do not** recruit for retail, healthcare or legal positions at this time, so sadly I won’t be able to help you out in those areas.) PM me for contact info and I’d be happy to send you my email address to send your resume to, or if you’re more comfortable with just LinkingIn that’s fine too. I can’t promise I’ll be able to find all of you the perfect job but I can sure as shit try.

I will not be responding to comments as I’ve posted this primarily to help myself – I just don’t have the time on my hands. I will however respond to all PM’s, and hopefully in a timely manner. Apologies ahead of time if it takes me a day or two to get back.

Happy Job Hunting, troll along now!

I'm a masters student from the UK in a postgraduate-only university which I suppose is the equivalent of an American grad school. I am really enjoying it here and have learned a lot since arriving. However it just passed the time of year where everyone has begun to receive their rejections from various companies grad schemes. So far there has been no continuations to interviews etc for any of my classmates (to my knowledge) and many rejections. We are doing a specialist subject on what many consider and integral part of the future of aerospace and yet nobody seems to be getting anywhere [and many of my course mates are a damn lot smarter than I am and many have done internships]. 

After the whole process last year of applying to the companies when finishing my undergrad I didn't even bother doing it this year. The whole process seems to have been made up by someone determined not to employ people which given the apparent shortage of engineers seems ridiculous (although I believe there is no such shortage considering many of my already graduated engineering friends still don't have jobs). You've got to send your CV (which is fair enough) then some external company sends you some asinine quizzes to answer, followed by usually some unfortunate woman from HR (who from my experience doesn't seem to know much about engineering) telephoning you for some more generic and asinine questions. Then you go to an assessment center with ten other poor sods which usually culminates in some presentation. You can (and probably will be) rejected at any of these stages. I've made it to the assessment centers quite a few times but so far I've not gone through one of these schemes without thinking less of the company behind it. I'm not even convinced that this process actually works in discerning the best students. The best engineering student I've ever met seems to get less far than I do in these schemes.

I know one person who got their job this way (and he went into banking after finishing his engineering degree).

So I pose the question, *why?* Why does this system exist?  Why do people even bother when it appears that very few people get their jobs this way? Why, when there is an apparent shortage of graduate engineers, do they have such momentously inefficient and tedious recruitment programs. I do not pretend to be an expert on the area of graduate recruitment. Perhaps some of you work in the companies that do these, I would ask you to speak your mind. I am fully willing to accept explanations and/or justifications if they provide some insight into these seemingly silly processes."

I really enjoy CodingBat, there are a ton of questions and, while most of them are ridiculously easy (so far anyway), it really helps me get certain concepts drilled into my brain.  I really want to get to the harder problems (completed both warm-ups, string1 and array1), but I'm a stickler for completing everything in order.

Once I finish with CodingBat for Java, I'm planning to start with Python in Codeacademy, then go back and do the Python section in CodingBat.  I haven't used Codeacademy before, but one of my CS friends swears by it.  Do you guys think it'll be comprehensive and good to learn Python through Codeacademy?  I've never learned or touched any Python, but people tell me that it is VERY similar to Java.  He also recommends Ruby, but we'll see as it'll take me some time to do what I'm already planning to do on top of school and work =P

So, what do you guys think about CodingBat and Codeacademy in general?  Are they very good sites to learn programming?  Does anything happen when you complete everything in CodingBat?

Oh, and someone else told me that if you complete an entire section in Codeacademy, you can pay like $30 for certification.  Is this true, and if so, is this worth it?

Thank you guys for reading this.  I really do have a passion for programming, and I'm hoping to get an internship next Summer (backpacking through Europe this Summer... HELLLLLLL YEAHHHHHH).

Just graduated from college.  Great school, GPA, internships and overall just a great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.  But college is over now and I have accepted that, as it is time to move on.

My major (Media/communications) is not really suited for the geographic location my school was in (Hartford CT area), which is where most of my school friends chose to reside after college.  The area is also mostly wealthy suburban families, not really my ideal location to live out my 20's.  My home residence is a short commute to NYC where I have job interviews lined up, so I moved back home with my parents.

After a month of living at home I can say it is already getting to me for obvious reasons.  My best friends from high school all live in NYC now either working full time jobs or going to grad school.  Their parents pay for their apartments or they are on loans.  I cannot afford either of these options.  I would love to live in NYC with all my friends but the cost of living in my eyes is astronomical and I most likely won't be making decent money for a good amount of time.  I've been thinking a lot about it lately and have come to 3 possible options 

1.  Move to NYC and have this once in a lifetime experience.  The money will work itself out eventually.
2.  Commute from home.  Save money.  Eventually decide to move into the city or invest it in more education but in result wasting most of these years.
3.  Move to an entirely new city somewhere else in the country that is more affordable and start from scratch.

I've never had a girl friend before and view the 20's as a time you will make several serious relationships and having different experiences, I don't see this happening living at home for half my 20's.  I see myself living out all my weekends watching television in my room.  I worked for six months at a co-op in college so I know what it is like to be paying for expenses, so I am a little more informed and realistic than most recent college graduates.  

Anyone one older who has been down a similar path what do you think/would have done differently?  I can really use some input as my parents and I have different philosophies.  "

I'm a mechanical engineering and computer science double major, graduating next spring from a reasonably well ranked school (top 50 or so).

I did a 2 semester co-op with a computational engineering firm before I added my CS major, where I worked on testcase automation and various other scripting tasks. I am now about to accept a part time job (technically an internship) in testing for the money.

I am really worried about getting pigeonholed into a QA career path since all of my experience has been in testing. Are these worries well founded? What can I do to avoid this from happening?

This isn't to say I wouldn't also be okay working in testing, but for &gt;90% of the companies out there, I think I would get bored with it.

I have an appointment with my general advisor and my independent study advisor in the next few weeks, but I can't get my mind off several questions that I have, and I was hoping that /r/gradschool might be able to give me some advice.  I graduate with my master's in December. Tl;dr is at the bottom! 

In my undergraduate career and my master's career, I feel like I've done a decent bit of work in the field that I want to be in.  I spent part of a semester teaching abroad, did a shorter internship in another country, and am going back to the first country in March to do research in a university on teacher leadership and curriculum development.

My career goal is more or less to build (and/or coordinate/direct) study abroad/exchange programs- particularly teacher exchange programs- in the US, and possibly in other countries.  Maybe further down the road, to go to developing nations and assist them with setting up teacher education programs. 

I'm currently the education coordinator of a program that I'm building from the ground up, which is cool, but it isn't a huge program, and I'm very young, so I don't think it necessarily gives me a ton of credibility in larger projects.

Now, the problem:

My grandfather (Ed.D) and my dad (Chief of Party in his branch of his company) are insisting that I go straight through my master's into a doctoral program.  I've spent the past 6, almost 7 years in school, and with my recent experiences abroad, I'm *so* ready to get out and do something.

But I get where they're coming from.  I've started looking for jobs- just getting to know the right key words to use, etc- and my dad and grandfather are right.  Almost all the positions that I'm most interested in list a doctoral degree as a minimum qualification (in addition to several years of experience, of course). 

So my **tl;dr** questions:

1) Is there such a thing as a doctoral program in education that will have me traveling and interfacing with international programs?  If you think there is, how do I weed though hundreds of programs to find one that suits my interests (and will accept me!)? I went to the same school for my undergrad and master's because my school had the exact program that I wanted for my master's. I don't know how to properly search for a program, and especially not one that actually uses field experience. 

2) Like I said, I'm pretty young. Should I ignore the advice of two people who have both been extraordinarily successful and ditch the doctoral program for now?  

Any advice that you could give would be awesome!

That calculation comes from all the courses required by my major only (programming, mathmatics, etc...). However, I did not excel in the gen ed's and electives that I hated (History, English, etc...), thus bringing my overall GPA significantly lower.

I quoted career because I'm still a student. And I'm in desperate need of some advice of people with experience. Last year I graduated my bachelors degree in ICT. This was mostly application development, networking (cisco, PIX firewall security,..) and server management.
I am currently going for my masters in engineering (Electronics-ICT) but I hate it. I hate it that I'm not doing anything practical and I seem so far away from development and even further from anything related to apps and web dev.

I did an internship for the altima group in Shanghai. Not sure if any of you is familiar with altima it's a french web development/seo/sem company. I worked in the web dev division. And this was the point I found out I really like/enjoy doing web dev, aswell as design (which I was not so much involved in) and seo.

I'm currently in my finals and they're not so great. And I'm not feeling well (as in feeling depressed) with what I'm currently doing. I feel like I made some bad choice (influenced by parents) and I should pursue my interest in web dev.

So what I was wondering is. How do you guys work? In a company? What kind of projects do you do? Can you accept big projects as a self employed? What do you do if you don't have any work as a self employed? Do you work at a company and be self employed at the side (doing smaller projects for example)? I'm a little afraid of what the future might bring, as being afraid of being financially unstable.

TL;DR I'm studying engineering, after graduating bachelor ICT. I miss my pasion of development. Any advice? And what does your week look like? What are the ups and downs of the job?

Here are some questions I have. Feel free to answer just one. 

1) So your GPA is obviously important. It looks like 3.0 is the magical minimum line for most jobs. In comparison, in my Scandinavian home country, an average of 9 out of 12 is considered quite good. What would you say the top 25% and top 10% GPAs are? Is 4.0 obtainable?

2) Internship, how important are these? Should you do one every summer until you graduate? What is the general employment time and hours per work week? Could you give me some examples of tasks for an intern?

3) Do you apply for jobs before you graduate, so you basically start working the summer after you graduate?

4) What is the difference between a science major and an engineering major in two similar fields (ex. physics vs. physics engineering, or computer science vs. software engineering etc.) in terms of a) what you learn during the education, b) internship expectations, c) salary (don't need specific numbers), d) industry. 

5) How is the employment rate for engineers - is it easy to get jobs?

6) Do most get a bachelor degree and then a master degree? Is it possible to get a job only with a BSc? 

Thank you! If you have any questions about the Scandinavian system, the Danish in particular, go ahead and ask me. I have a bachelor in nanoscience and I'm working towards my chemical engineering master. "

I'd like for you to see my MVP, which is the re-launch of my price comparison engine for health products and nutritional supplements:


http://www.priceplow.com


**Stats**

- 12,500 products
- 1,000 categories (exactly)
- 1,300 brands
- Currently comparing 22 stores, with at least 15 more to add


It is finally at a point where I am ready to start talking about it and move forward with some joint marketing initiatives while we refine the technology.


**Vision**

""We do the work, you do the workouts.""
My vision and strategy is twofold:

First, I want excellent content on the site - especially when it comes to the supplement categories - that cites *real*, properly-done research, and tells the honest truth.  If something is good, we'll show you where to get the best deals.  If something is garbage, we state as much.  I would rather not make money on snake oil, to be completely honest.  There are simply not enough trusted watchdogs in this space.

Second, I want to help other brands, media outlets, and social media personalities to be able to monetize their followings in an *ethical* manner.  On a small scale, I have proven that this engine works.  There are seriously very few ways to make money in nutrition online in an *ethical* way.  Our upcoming API will help with this.


**Story**

This has been quite the learning experience.  It was originally launched in 2008, and I had *massive* success with some microsites that utilized the engine/API for monetization.  However, I am admittedly a casualty of Google Penguin, and revenues have been down for nearly 2 years.  That needs to end this year.

**Team**

We have what I call a ""stack of contractors"", which includes 3 part-time programmers (I would make 4), a content team of 4 writers led by an editor who I found thanks to /r/austinjobs, and one VA.  Now that I'm entering marketing mode, I'll be looking for some kind of marketing intern as well.

No matter what happens this year, I can tell you a few things:

- I am an entrepreneur for life
- I freaking love this stuff.  ALL of it.
- Learning how to hire/recruit has been the single most important thing I have learned (and that's been in the past year or so).


Would love your feedback.  This post has gone long, but I'd be happy to edit it in a bit with some of my marketing plans.

Cheers and THANK YOU!!!

1vlsr1,1,2014-01-19,"I'm in a somewhat unique position to negotiate my first ""real"" job, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",HelpMeNegotiate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1vlsr1/im_in_a_somewhat_unique_position_to_negotiate_my/,"Hey guys.  So, I've been a developer intern at the same place for the last two summer breaks and winter breaks from school.  I have two semesters left of school, and I will graduate in December of this year with a BS in CS.  At this time last year, my boss was aggressively implying that I should drop out of school and keep working for him, full time.  Of course, I said no, but that I might be interested in working there after I'd completed school.  He eventually relented, and I continued interning there when I wasn't at school (which is four hours away).

Now it is winter break again, and the first day I was back, he gave me an offer and until I graduate to think about it.  I was offered $50,000 and full benefits to work for him, and I've got plenty of time to mull it over.  Now, this place is located in a tiny unincorporated town in Wisconsin, a good 30-40 minute commute from the larger town where I'm from, where I'd be living if I were to take this job.  That's a 50-mile commute each day, unless I wanted to live in this tiny little town, which I don't.

The company is small, less than 40 people, but they're leaders in their industry and are pretty successful.  The company culture is fantastic and I really like pretty much all of my would-be coworkers.  It's a really great place, I fit in really well, and I enjoy the work.  

As for me, I'm pretty good at what I do.  Forgive me for having to sound like an asshat for a second, but I'm guessing my skills are relevant here.  I've been programming since I was eleven, my CS classes have yet to pose any real challenge to me, I have a few successful side-projects (nothing open source, but they do pay most of my bills), and I've gone leagues beyond what former interns at my company have done.  In the past, they've mostly done data entry and other stuff like that.  I've been put in charge of several projects which are somewhat integral to the business, I've saved thousands of dollar and hundreds of hours of labor by automating some processes, and I think I've contributed an awful lot.  Okay, sorry for sounding full of myself.  I'm done now.

Anywho, I know that $50k for a starting salary is nothing amazing for the industry, but for a small town in Wisconsin (i.e. not Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay, La Crosse, etc) that's likely above average.  I also know that employers tend not to start with their upper-limit, so I'm guessing that there's room to negotiate.  There's also the fact that I know the business and can hit the ground running, whereas if I decline, then my boss has to put out an ad, interview candidates, and then spend months training them.  That's a lot of time and money.  

All in all, I feel like I'm in a pretty good position to negotiate, but I don't really know how to.  I know that everything is negotiable, including salary, vacation days, signing bonus, etc, but I don't know how exactly to start.  Do I ask for $55k?  $60k?  Signing bonus?  What?

Also, should I be going to career fairs, applying for other jobs, and going to interviews while I'm at school over the next two semesters?  Is it wrong to go through all those motions just to say no?

**TL;DR**  I have two semesters before I graduate and a standing offer for $50k in a small Wisconsin town.  I've interned there on and off for two years, and I've kicked some ass.  They really want me.  How should I negotiate?  I feel like I'm in a great position to negotiate, but I don't know what to ask for or how much to ask for.  Also, should I go to career fairs and interviews in the meantime?  I have until I graduate in December to consider this offer.

Sorry for the wall of text.  Please feel free to ask any questions!"

My name is James and I'm strongly looking into becoming an engineer.  More specifically a Computer Engineer.  The majority of my questions are geared towards a Computer engineering standpoint.

Here's a little info on my current situation.  I'm 23 years old, a SSgt in the USAF and am active duty stationed at NAS Fort Worth JRB (Carswell AFB).  I am a 2W0X1 (Munitions Systems).  I'm married, and also a home owner so I do have financial responsibilities that still need to be met while I'm going about this endeavor.  I'm hoping to not have to reenlist when my contract comes due, which is in March 2015.  I may be able to work the system and get an extension, but I want to move on with my life before I end up being in for 8 years and having to walk away from the military after all of that time, but I am definitely realistic about it.  My recent decision has been made because of the way the Military has changed gears in the way they're doing things and I'm just having a harder and harder time following along with it.  It has nothing to do with anything political, more so how everyone is/is going to be treated.  That's a totally different story though.

I have always had an interest in computers and soft/hardware but haven't really explored beyond a ""beginner"" level because I'm afraid to ruin something...  I have always loved to learn new things, which is why I feel like this is an exciting adventure for me.  If anybody has any websites or any other information for someone who is looking into learning how to write code and do other applicable tasks for computer engineering, I would greatly appreciate if you would share them so I can take a gander at them.

I haven't begun any schooling for engineering as of yet but have been working diligently and have gotten in contact with my local university with an accredited engineering program (University of Texas Arlington).  My current plan is to use my MilTA, along with my GI bill if necessary, to begin as much of the schooling portion, online, for my general ed requirements as possible.  The reason behind this is because, with my busy work schedule and not being able to really pick what shift I'm on to accommodate my schooling, I want to get as much of the schooling taken care of as possible so that I can minimize my down time of not having a job and being in school.  

How many engineering students got a job in their field (either part time or full time) while they were still in school, under an internship?  

How is the quality of life for a computer engineer?  (More so geared towards how is the pay if that's not too personal for you...)  I'm not doing this job for the money, seeing as I make pretty good money doing what I do now.  I bring home about 53k/yr with all inclusive benefits and retirement etc.  That's with no degree, straight out of highschool and less than 5 years in the military.  That, however, changes based on duty station as my housing allowance plays a large role in that as well.

Have any of you guys been in a similar situation as mine, and how did you proceed?

For computer engineering, what classes would you recommend to take/not take that are actually worth while?  

What kind of programs are good to participate/lead in?  I think my military experience may help with this as I've done quite a bit of ""leading"" in my short time in, so I've got good experience doing that.


I really do appreciate all the help that anybody is willing to give as I'm extremely excited to do this but also very nervous as this is a huge change for my family and I.  Thanks for taking a look at this!

Sincerely,
James"

All four of them looked similar to that, with the BACKING UP MY SHIT literally in the path. Turns out she copied any that she could into a giant folder on her network folder. Hundreds and hundreds of PDFs and word files, all in the same location as the originals.

She has not answered a single one of my phone calls, nor emails me back with a time that I can contact her, so I closed the ticket. I continue to get emails from her weekly saying she cannot access the files, yet she won't return any calls.

A quick question - I'm an unpaid intern at a company getting college credit.  But I never signed any 'official' paperwork stating that I was an Intern.

Basically the way I gained the internship was that I took a specific elective class.  The professor basically said that whoever gets an A in the class will be his interns for the next quarter (give or take performance in the class).  I managed to get selected, but then it was basically along the lines of ""Okay what's your schedule for next quarter, okay come in on these days then and we'll start you working.""

I'm a little nervous about this whole process.  And, in all honesty, what made me nervous about this was that up until this quarter there had only been 5 to 8 people taking the class.  Now we have 8 times that number this quarter (and next quarter seems like it will be larger).

I'm just concerned that the company might get screwed over down the line.   I really like my boss and the company and don't want to see them get messed with by  someone who doesn't agree with there ways.

I would like to live and work in the US, which I'd prefer doing after getting my degree. How do I shape my resume and make myself more appealing to any Bay Area employer?

Some things:

- Dutch higher education has two levels. One vocational oriented called HBO, and one more academic. Both offer bachelor degrees, though the HBO-level usually does not include the ""-Of Science"" suffix. HBO's are considered better for the job market because of the more practical experience students will have upon graduating. The academic degree however will have a higher influence on your salary. HBO degrees also certify at least 1.25 years of internship experience. I'm doing a HBO-bachelor with a minor in artificial intelligence taken from a normal university. In my opinion the HBO degree is definitely much easier to get.

- I plan on pursuing a Master's degree after this.

- In order to make myself more useful I've taken up learning Spanish. It will be the fifth language I can communicate in. 

- We do not use GPAs. There's a conversion for Dutch grades to GPA, but it's awkward to use and would look me look bad because of low grades on group projects (which, entirely, is not my fault but rather a product of the system used by my college and country) 

Example: My average GPA on theory testing and individual tests would be somewhere between a 3.7 and a 4.0 (on a 4.0 scale), while my group projects are about 2.5. And they fluctuate wildly. 

How should I approach doing personal projects, should I start working on a portfolio of projects? What kind of things look good right now? And languages? Would potential financial viability be better than something more complex? 

How is volunteer work viewed?

I've been thinking of applying for an internship at US-based companies because of the familiarity of their name. Is this something that will help me, or am I over-evaluating the name familiarity? 

My interests include AI and Robotics. I'd love to work on things like autonomous underwater vehicles or swarm AI."

1vok1g,6,2014-01-20,Microsoft internship phone interview,theintellects,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1vok1g/microsoft_internship_phone_interview/,"Hey Reddit,

I have a Microsoft phone interview for an internship coming up, and I'm really nervous. Most of my experience has been doing web development, intern + fulltime + freelance, but most positions on the Microsoft site seem to be more C++ related.

They asked me to fill out a preference form between SDE, SDET, PM + what kind of stuff I'd like to work on (front-end/UI, server, OS level, etc). I picked SDE front-end/UI, but I have a feeling the interview won't be geared towards that.

The interview is only 30 minutes apparently, which is pretty different from the 1hr phone interviews I've had with other companies.

Anyone know anything about this process/have experience they can share?"

I currently have an upcoming interview for a software development internship. The company that I'm interviewing with deals primarily in objective C. Most of my experience has been in just C (dealing with micro controllers such as the Arduino Uno), and the interviewer knows this.

The interviewer has told me that there will be a software development quiz that he plans on giving during the interview. I'm not really sure what to expect from something like this, and I'm curious if there are any good resources that people would be able to offer me to prepare for this interview? 

A few notes:
-I'm dual majoring in EE and CE. I'm just starting to get into the bulk of my CE classes this year. So I'm by no means an expert. (I think the interviewer knows this as well)

-This will be my first interview for a software development position. Are there any things that I should be expecting that differ from other interviews?

Thanks for your help! Any resources or advice that anybody can provide will be greatly appreciated!

I'm sure this is a question that pops up a lot, but I'm just curious to see what everyone has to say.  DID YOUR LIFE LACK DIRECTION IN YOUR EARLY 20s??? 

Here's my story.  I grew up in a suburban town in West Michigan.  Obviously there were certain problems that pertain to those in high school, but nothing was to terrible.  

When I was a senior in high school my parents split up.  It didn't effect me to much.  We always had sort of a rocky relationship and they were sort of ""staying together for the kids"".  My parents are very conservative WASP types.  I'm definitely on the opposite side of the spectrum. This has lead to a lot of ideological clashes over the years.

Fast Forward August 2011.  I had graduated High School and moved to downtown Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I was in a band in high school, but things didn't get really serious until around this time.  We began playing house parties and lots of local/region shows.  It was around this time that I went on my first tour of the Midwest...crammed into a van.  I had a blast!

I took the following semester off of school, and eventually my parents convinced me that it was time to give it a try.  I took a bunch of bullshit classes at community college and have achieved almost nothing except getting myself more into debt (10,000-ish in student loans to be exact).  I really don't think there was a single practical thing I could take away from my college experience except for an internship at a local public access station.

I dropped out of college after 3 semesters.  My 3rd one I dropped all of my classes anyway.  I struggle to make ends meet, but I enjoy the way I'm currently living and the freedom it gives me.  My dad gave me a phone call the other day to ""talk about the direction my life was going in"".  This sort of shook me up a bit.  

I need some advice from someone who has been through it...obviously I'm going to find a way to survive.  I have before.  I just need some assurance from someone that my life isn't a total crap shoot.  I think I may have watched Fight Club a few too many times when I was younger...haha.

TL;DR---College Drop out, clashes with WASP parents, want to play music.  Seeking advice from whoever has been where I am now.

Thanks everyone for reading....Looking forward to what people have to say."
1vpxq3,4,2014-01-20,Have a developer job. Should I get formal CS education?,bmay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1vpxq3/have_a_developer_job_should_i_get_formal_cs/,"**Background:**

*I graduated college almost 2 years ago with a liberal arts degree. Shortly after graduating, I was able to land an internship at a software development company, and then after a few months, they brought me on full-time in a slightly technical, client-service role. Shortly after that, I was transferred to a more technical team where I did a lot of SQL writing and some C#/ASP.NET coding.*

**Issue at hand:**

About 4 months ago I was promoted to become a software developer and work on our core product (fix bugs, write features for our main web application). Everything I've learned up to this point has been self-taught (my interest in programming started about 3 years ago) or learned on the job. I have motivation to learn about good coding practices in my spare time (reading books like Code Complete, Pragmatic Programmer, etc.), but I'm still wondering if there's more out there I'm missing that could greatly increase my chances of succeeding in my field in the future.

I've been going back and forth with the idea of taking classes part-time at local universities/community colleges, but I'm wondering, is it really worth it? I often see differing opinions on this topic in this subreddit: some people say after your first developer job, your education doesn't matter much, others say you're really missing out on the heart of computer science and *computers* as a whole if you don't get formal education. I feel like there's still a lot of ""stuff"" out there I don't know about and I don't even know what that ""stuff"" is.

And honestly, one of my biggest worries is that I got a bit lucky landing this job and that if I ever needed to relocate to another company, I'd have a bit of trouble finding a similar position because of my lack of formal training in CS.

So should I try to take some CS classes part-time and work toward a second Bachelors or will teaching myself various topics like design, algorithms, etc. on my own be satisfactory?

Thanks."

Since I did all my calc/physics and gen ed requirements at my CC, I only have 2 summers left to get an internship in. This summer isn't looking likely that I'm going to get an internship, because I have no side-projects to put on my resume. Also, my GPA at the uni is currently shitty because my first semester I was an EE major, and I did poorly in a couple classes. My GPA at the CC was a 3.98, sad that it doesn't transfer over to the uni :(.

I have some cool ideas, like making an HTML5 game and a chrome extension, but when I go about starting these projects I just get overwhelmed so quickly and feel so underskilled. Should I even think about side-projects yet if I haven't even taken a Data Structures class? I'll be taking that class in the summer."

I just recently failed a class (STATS) and I don't know what to do. I'm dealing with some medical problems (not making an excuse) which I've tried to apply to do a retroactive withdrawal (basically drop the class after the grade is posted if you have a good reason). That got rejected even with concrete documentation so I'm appealing it.

Anyways, some background info:

* Started school in '08. Failed physics first semester (my fault completely; didn't try)
* Tried somewhat and failed 2 math classes next semester which were due to medical illness. I tried to talk to instructor/school (applied for retro withdrawal) but they wouldn't let me
* Next few semesters did poorly but still passed with Cs and Ds. Had a fire in house (moved 3-4 times in 3 months), personal problems, parents separated etc..
* Some more Cs and a couple of Bs

Recently I failed a class now... This is my 4th fail. My school has a policy that you're only allowed 5 retakes in your university career (Dean can extend this). I'm on co-op (kinda like internship) right now for 8 months (mandatory for my program; minimum 1 year) so I have that for me. My GPA is 2.2 right now and I'm just... lost.

Besides my first F in physics, I'm trying in the other classes. My medical problems really are interfering with everything and it seems like the school doesn't give a shit unless you're dying in a hospital (that's what it feels like, at least). I still have 15-20 courses left in engineering and my curriculum is all over the place due to me working in the past and taking only 2-4 classes a semester (not the usual engineering 6 classes).

Of course I want to finish but I'm just scared of my GPA falling down more or getting another F not being able to finish the program.

Thanks.."

I've already accepted a job offer with one of the big 4 at a satellite office.

For the first few weeks of this semester I've been doing nothing but partying and watching The Wire, but I'm sure I can find better use of my time. 

I'm interested in finding and reading resources that touch on topics of being successful in one's career. Now that I've found a job, I want to know how to be successful in it. At some of my internships, I've seen great programmers stuck in the same position, and I don't want that to happen to me. I would like to learn how to know which projects to go after, how to best receive credit for work, and how to move up within a company (or how best to leave for a better position). 

Additionally, I'll probably put some time into a couple of the personal projects I've worked on to keep my technical skills sharp. The team I've accepted the offer with looks to be very cs theory heavy, which unfortunately is not a strong point for me, so I'm also looking for hands on resources to improve my skills (project Euler maybe?) 

Any suggestions are appreciated :-)"

Hey reddits CompScientists,

I am about to finish my first semester of CS at a university in Germany.

So far I like it quite a lot, despite the usual ""being blown away by math"" (I hope I'm not the only one), but I was told so and prepared for it and it's not that I wouldn't like math (it's the opposite actually, I loved it in school, it's harder and more frustrating now, but the feeling you get when you solve an assignment now is even better :-) ) 

I actually like the theoretical stuff a lot (at least what we have right now, Discrete Math, algorithms and data structures, and computer architecture) - But it's not really where I see my future. And judging by a lot of current graduates, a lot of them are going to do jobs which involve a lot of programming (or to call a spade a spade, they are software developers / software engineers) - of course they APPLY that knowledge but don't really - I don't know how to say it - directly use it.

The next year (Semester 3-4 specifically) will almost only be theoretical classes, so I'm wondering what I could learn in my spare time. I did some programming while in school (C++, .NET (C# and VB), and a *tiny* bit web and scripting oriented stuff (PHP and HTML but mostly Python) and also a **tiny** bit messing around with MySQL-databases). 

However I began liking Java a lot and heard that - though sometimes hated - it is used quite a lot in enterprise applications. Is there a way to combine that with web development? (I don't want to be a web designer or anything for that matter, but I guess some basics couldn't hurt).

Also, I guess I should do some internships soon. I think right now I'm not quite good enough for that, but I only left school half a year ago (with 17, I am now 18) and I think if I work hard enough the next 6 months or so I might gather enough knowledge to find some sort of Java-oriented internship. Right now I would consider having sort of entry-advanced, but not professional knowledge (I know oop, exceptions, concurrent programming, how to adequatly use data structures, basic I/O, know how to write JUnit-tests and know a little bit about reflection, but I am missing more specific stuff: networking, GUIs (though I really don't know if that is necessary), and databases).

In short, my questions are:

- How can I expand my Java knowledge and combine it with web technologies?
- What other programming languages (or scripting languages) are worth learning (and since I know that depends a lot on what you want to do maybe it is better to ask: what languages are NOT worth learning ;-))? I wanted to dive in Qt with C++ and do a small OpenSource-project (for a tool I have in mind), is that something worth learning?
- What general IT/CS/Programming knowledge is good having when applying for/doing internships?
- Just for curiosity: What would actually be **NON**-programming jobs for CS-graduates (or internships - I didn't find a single one that was labelled ""CS"", but didn't involve programming)

Thank you in advance!"
1vs8gz,2,2014-01-21,Take an international internship or look for jobs at home?,tk338,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1vs8gz/take_an_international_internship_or_look_for_jobs/,"Hi all

I'm graduating with (hopefully) a 1st class degree in computer science this year in the UK. I love doing programming, but the main reason I even began the degree was so that one day I could hopefully move to America, it sounds shallow but it has motivated me for the last 3 years.

Last summer I completed a 4 month work placement in a family run supply store in the USA, I had an awesome time but had to come home to finish my last year at university as well as my visa expiring.

This year they have asked me to come back to complete an 18 month internship (I believe in business management), its a paid position, with subsidized housing and they have even said they will cover my airfare and any costs that I incur while applying for the visa/getting there. 

Now, my dilemma. That is a fantastic offer. Its the USA which I have wanted for as long as I can remember, its a job which isn't my fast food job in the UK and its international which can't hurt.

The only thing is, is its not in my discipline, computing, and more specifically programming. I absolutely love programming and would love to do it for a job one day.

I am currently applying for a couple of international companies for software developer jobs, but have yet to hear back. 

If I go for 18 months I get an internship under my belt, I can live in the USA with a job until my visa expires (non extendable) and well, its better than half of my friends who graduated last year currently have. However my degree and experience in programming will slide fast and my 'employability' in that field go down drastically.

If I'm strong and say no I'm waving good bye to any chance for working in the USA for realistically at minimum 5 years, but I get to begin my programming career immediately. 

I know no one has definite answers but I'd really appreciate some input. 

As I see it my options are:
 
- Regrettably decline the offer and begin a possibly fruitless hunt for jobs at home (although there are a lot), however I could regret this as the field has a high burnout rate, or so I hear.

- Take the offer, work my arse off and keep up software projects on the side to continue my experience and build a portfolio up for my inevitable return (since its very unlikely they will sponsor an H visa for me)

Thank you very much, sorry for the wall of text, if I've left anything out, please ask."

1vsehe,1,2014-01-21,The awkward gap between undergrad and PG/grad school.,Kalivha,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1vsehe/the_awkward_gap_between_undergrad_and_pggrad/,"I'm going to finish undergrad in April. And do the whole graduation ceremony deal in June. 

I'm also probably going to start a postgrad somewhere.

I'd also rather spend the period from mid-May to whenever grad school starts (September or October most probably) being productive; I'm taking a 2 week break after finals which is as much time off as I can bear/afford. 

I'm fully intending to stay in academia till I run out of places I can go, or till I get tenure or some equivalent deal (perma-postdoc?) and this would ideally include that stretch of 4ish months.

I've had funded internships before. My first one was so overfunded that I got enough money to self-fund a MSc degree out of it if I can't get a PhD position this year. But I need to keep that money because I probably won't get a PhD position, so I need something for the summer and I would very much prefer this to be academic.

I've currently got three offers, one is under-funded (and would require me to move in with my mum and live off her income again, which is undesirable, but makes it technically an option), one is in one of the more polluted parts of China (and that's too far away to just jet back here for graduation day), and one is still in the phase of negotiating with the university's HR department over whether I can get a grant. 

Now, that third one is *the one I want*. I'm even considering applying for another full-time job in that city/country just to be able to fund it.

Are there any grants for UG-PG-gap-internships? This one happens to be in Europe and I'd much prefer to find funding for something somewhere in Europe because that's where graduation will be for me. Actually, I'm very likely to dismiss anything outside Europe for that reason.

Are there any places that fund that sort of thing which are not scams?"
1vsm1s,4,2014-01-21,Advice for a soon to be new engineering grad on life after college?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1vsm1s/advice_for_a_soon_to_be_new_engineering_grad_on/,"I'm about to graduate from school this May. And although, I went to a very established university and will be obtaining my Civ &amp; Evr engineering degree with a pretty good gpa, I'm pretty lost and confused when it comes to finding entry-level positions or just a career path.  
  
I think the problem is that although I obviously learned the material and was previously good at it when it mattered, I don't necessarily recall everything (mostly anything) that I've learned.  I have a bad memory overall and this might contribute to this aspect. Or, I might just be over exaggerating, I'm not sure.  

I think what I learned throughout my school years is that I'm pretty much good and enjoy doing math and applied math which is why engineering was good for me. Math has always been my favorite subject. In addition, applied math doesn't require intensive memory skills of random subjects and definitions that no matter how much I'm taught it, I always seem to forget and need a refresher. And some interest in the environment led me to choose my concentration in that area, but I'm not as passionate about it as I am about just math. I've just grown a liking to it due to its lofty goals.
  
But, what companies or jobs should I go for? I think my problem is that I don't see why a company would want to hire me if I don't feel I have developed any important specialized skills despite getting a degree and having some internships. Which might be instilling some self-doubt in me. And I also always fancied Industrial Engineering and am planning on going to grad school for it eventually.   
  
In summary, it seems that I'm lost and I need to figure out soon what I'm going to do as most of my friends have jobs already lined up. Although I'm happy for them and have helped them in their career search thinking it was a shared effort of ours, it looks like once they settled their immediate futures they tended to overlook everybody else's. And career services at my university doesn't seem to help as it caters heavily to finance, analyst-consulting, and software positions.  
  
It's not like I'm not trying too. Last semester, I've been to all my school's career fairs, 2 separate career conferences, 2-3 consulting interviews which did not go well, 1 banking one, and one oil &amp; gas engineering company interview which I passed to the 2nd round but haven't heard from anyone even after I emailed. What I ultimately gained from those experiences, is that I don't have the specialized skills they need. 
 
Does anyone have any advice, career or otherwise, or can lead me to some resources or database online that list entry-level engineering jobs?"

I am seeking an internship and would appreciate any advice on learning assembly. The main goal will be to write high performance code that works on ARM processors. I know and have used C in my internships / undergrad courses (although I am not a CS major). I have some limited experience with x86 from about a year ago, but it was a bit ad-hoc and I learn best in a structured way.
* What are the main references/resources out there for ARM?
* Is my goal realistic (i.e. ramping up part-time on this specific instruction set)?
* Are there free/cheap development tools for educational use that you know of?

Thank you for your responses!"
1vsxt1,1,2014-01-21,[Build Help] Time for my 1st PC child!,Thegoodkev,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1vsxt1/build_help_time_for_my_1st_pc_child/," Hello everyone, I have waited and saved my money a very long time for this moment so I am asking for assistance in building a PC that I will be very proud of! While I certainly am not an expert on any aspect regarding PCs, I am confident that I am not completely incompetent either. I have had the same family rust bucket for over 9 years and I am tired of cleaning it up day in and day out after parental and younger sibling use only to receive minimal performance. It is finally time for me to move on from old Bessie and create the new love of my life.

 Let us start with the goals I hope to ascertain in building this PC. I hope build a PC that can handle all but the most ridiculously intensive games on high graphic settings. This alone is not the sole goal for my PC but I think it starts everyone on a similar page. For a concrete example, I have wanted to play Skyrim ever since it came out on high settings and have collected quite a few mods (roughly 30) I would like to add as well. In addition, I have little to no interest in MMOFPS games like CoD or BF4 in case that helps.

 Apart from gaming, I have a few other core intentions concerning my PC build. Next on the priority list is dual tasking. I have always enjoyed gaming but as time has gone by my daily schedule has been less and less open with free time. I hope to combat that by being able to ""do more"" or optimizing the small windows I have dedicated to personal time. I believe the best route to do this would simply be using multiple monitors. One dedicated to my desktop, internet browsing, word processors or basically business while the other(s) would be for entertainment purposes such as; television, movies, games, and internet browsing again.

 With those two goals I understand I will most likely need; a decent amount of ram, multiple strong graphic cards and intern, a decent cooling system to keep it all under optimal conditions. What I understand beyond that is pitiful as I have not a single clue which manufacturers develop the ""best"" parts within my budget (which will be reveled at the end of my post). I also do not understand much about the relationship between the graphic cards, motherboard, and the cpu other than what the [Guide to PC Components](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/partsguide)
explains.

 My final goal revolves around compatibility/adaptability. Being a desktop, my PC will not have mobility in its arsenal which can be a huge blow in today's busy, always on the move world. I hope to work around that by purchasing a decent tablet for all my computing needs when I am not at home. The problem lies in the fact that I do not want to only use my tablet outside the home. I cannot perceive any reason in the slightest to use a tablet when my PC is available so I must anticipate a feeling of wasted money when at home. I also imagine when I am out and about a nagging sense of constant wishing I had what was available on my PC. If possible I would like to be able to sync up my tablet and PC in a way to get the best of both worlds while I am in comfort of my own home. What I am hoping for is the ability to turn my tablet into a touch pad for unique commands or maybe have it become an additional monitor. This dynamite combo would also allow me to transfer documents, movies, music and other files for easy viewing and/or editing from anywhere. 

 So there you have it, my dream PC but here comes the final dreaded question. What is your budget? Well good news everyone! I have managed to put away the sizable sum (for my age) of $2,500! This budget is only for the actual PC itself and its operating system. **I do not need** assistance picking out a tablet, monitors, external storage devices, computer mouse or keyboard so please exclude those items from all calculations. Now my budget is more of a rough draft amount as through some basic research I do not believe I even need that much  but I would also not be turned away to spend a tad bit extra for a perfect fit.

 If you could find the kindness in your hearts to help me sort through all the products available to me, keeping all of the above in mind, I would be extremely grateful. Since you all are at the heart of my PC building I think it is only fair to let you guys help name my PC. So if you wish add a small side note of what we should name **her** and the best will be complied for a vote when I show off my completed PC. Thank you again for all your expertise and handwork, it is going toward making a man's life much more free and happy!

edit: I do not have any understanding about overclocking so if someone could explain the pros and cons of that whole process I would a happy man!"

I have been offered a business management internship in the USA which is very much of interest to me, however after 18 months, unless nothing has come of it, I will have to return home to the UK. 

I would very much one day like a job programming, but the internship is a foot in the door to living in the USA, which before I started university was my ultimate goal. 

Is it a sensible option to take the internship? And should it come to nothing, is there anyway I can keep my degree 'valid' for 18 months? I am very aware an 18 month old degree with no experience is worth less than a new one."
1vtgmt,1,2014-01-21,Getting my hours cut,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1vtgmt/getting_my_hours_cut/,"Hi all. 

**Background** I work at a corporate-owned veterinary hospital; I have been there for 2.5 years while I was working on my bachelors (in biology). I finished my bachelors in december and I now have the semester off until I go into a computer science masters program in june.


**Issue** There was all this excitement that I would be out of school and able to work ""full time"" during my off semester. That is why I didn't look for another job after graduating-besides, a biology major is not the most exceptional graduate in the world.

Anyways, I have been getting ~6-12 hours per week since I graduated. It is slow season and I am the only part time worker at the hospital. Whenever hours are cut, mine are always cut the most drastically. This is especially unfair because they have been using an intern as an excuse to cut hours (my hours) because they essentially have a free worker. My problem is that I love my job, I love my coworkers, and I even love the boss that is giving me these shitty hours. They work around my school schedule great and this is the first major problem that I have encountered. I don't know what to do. Business starts booming again in march and I am typically able to get ~35 hours during better months. I have bills to pay in january and february though (even though I live with my parents) and I am frustrated. I sent my boss an email today and I have not gotten a response yet. I love this job and I don't want to leave, but I am aware that if my requests are denied, I will probably start packing. What do you guys think I should do?"

Most of it is research I can do by myself (finding articles and such) but he also asked for an interview with a professional. He wants to know the company you work for and I'm pretty sure your name (it doesn't specify on the handout he gave us).

I don't need a transcript of the interview, it's more you answering the questions and me implementing your answers in my report, that doesn't mean I don't have questions though, so it'd be awesome if you could answer them.

The questions are...

1. What training is required for the job? Cover both undergrad and graduate course work, as well as any internship requirements and post graduate work. 

2. How much will it cost to finance my education/training? Here I believe you can just say how much it cost you, and I'll look for other numbers from articles and redditors. This doesn't only cover academics, he also wants to know what professional training you need/might need, if there is any.

3. What is the lifestyle you have with this career? 
4. Will I be working 80 hours per week? 
5. Will I have to live with my parents in the early part of my career? 
6. In terms of location, where will I ""have to live?""
7. Can I work from home? Will I have job stability?
8. Will I have a pension and health care plan?
9. Will my spouse have to work in order to afford a home and college tuition for my children?
10. What was your ""hedge"" if you failed (becoming a Computer Scientist)

It's late, so I'll be online tomorrow to pick one of you guys. Sorry I can't pick you all, but I'll definitely include the differences you guys had. 

Send it through PMs or in the comments obviously. Thanks in advance."
1vtqh3,10,2014-01-21,Tips for hard working &amp; semi-experienced high school senior seeking summer employment as a lab/research assistant?,Ry2D2,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1vtqh3/tips_for_hard_working_semiexperienced_high_school/,"**Basic Question:** Where could I look for/who should I contact for such a job in the Los Angeles area? I would vastly prefer a low-paying employment (eg minimum wage) in the lab to other more traditional teenage summer employment, although if only unpaid internships were available, I would be fine with those as well.


**Experience &amp; Background**
 
* I am currently a senior from a central Ohio high school and for the past 4 years of high school, I have been taking an extra class called ""science research"" in which the students are to investigate a scientific topic/question of their own that is unique and not already solved or answered, write a thorough paper on our findings, and then present the findings at the end of the year.
* I have been working on my current project for 2 years (I should specify the research is really done year round) with intensive lab work done at the Ohio State University Department of Chemical Engineering on a Chemical Engineering/Biomedical Engineering themed project involving modified quantum dots (a particular type of nanoparticle) for cancer detection. It is likely that we will be able to publish a paper by the end of this school year (May) with our findings (hopefully) in a reputable journal.
* I am obsessed with the sciences and have taken AP Biology, AP Physics C, AP Chemistry, Physiology, and Honors Organic Chemistry (the latter two were semester courses offered by my high school and were more of introductions to the fields). I also keep up with and read many of the most recent publications on topics that interest me from open access journals (eg PLOS ONE) as that has proven a crucial part of my research process in the past. I have also taken to learning from free courses online (eg on Coursera) for science courses I could not fit in my schedule but would have liked to take this year. **TL;DR, I think I should be more experienced than most other incoming college freshmen.**
* My intended major is chemical engineering due to its flexibility for me to incorporate components of other fields (implications in energy, medicine, materials science, etc.) but this is subject to change as I also am very interested in Biochemistry and medicine and would be open to work in just about any other field if the opportunity arose (Astronomy is another area I find to be quite captivating).
* I am not paid currently for my work, as it is my own research project with guidance from the graduate students and a professor however, if I were to stay here over the summer I have been able to assist (to some degree) with the lab's other research projects for pay while learning yet more about lab procedures and various projects of the graduate students here.
* Unfortunately, I may be relocating to the LA area in the summer so I would need to start afresh and would have no contacts in the area. **Do I even have a basis for expecting anyone would be willing to pay me even minimum wage for helping with the research of my employer? I would gladly accept an unpaid internship as well for the summer, however the fact that I am about to go to college inclines me to prefer a paid position.**


**My plan: Any further suggestions?**

* I was looking for internships and most of them required the participants to be of incoming undergraduate sophomore level or above. I'll keep looking though but it seems difficult to find internships that will accept incoming undergraduate freshmen.
* I intend to email many professors and perhaps also hospitals in the LA area asking if they would like assistance with any of their research and detailing my experience. I could also email companies involved in the areas of my interest in the LA area, however I do not know of many or of a good way of finding out which tech companies in LA might be a good fit and willing to take on a lab assistant/intern.


If there is a better place I should have posted this, please let me know."
1vtyiy,1,2014-01-22,Senior looking for resume advice,meepo_resume,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1vtyiy/senior_looking_for_resume_advice/,"My school has an upcoming internship fair next week and many on-campus recruiting deadlines are approaching, so I would really appreciate some brutally honest criticism of my resume to get a reality check of what I can expect in my job search and hopefully make some improvements.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/tbwof3niwm8t8wv/meepo_resume.pdf

Some notes:

- Three months after submitting my previous resume which did not include three of the four projects, I recently received an email from a Google technical recruiter asking if I was interested in a SDET position. Do they send out tons of these emails with no interest in actually interviewing or is it legit? There seems to be some debate over whether an SDET becomes too pigeon holed to transition into an SDE. Ultimately, I want to be an SDE but beggars can't be choosers. Would it be advisable in my current position of having no offers on the table to reply that I'm interested in SDE, rather than SDET, and forward my new resume? I have had zero interviews so far.

- The ""In Progress"" courses are what I'm taking this semester. It seems like it'll be a high workload (is it?), so there is a small chance that I will end up delaying graduation by one semester, which is not uncommon for transfer students in my program. If I delay, I'll take programming languages, upper division computer architecture, and one of the four next semester.

- I'm not really proud of the third project, ""Color ... Tracker"". We didn't make efficient use of four group members and the result was something that could be accomplished by one or two students in the time frame. I ended up doing the majority of the work and some other rants etc. Should I remove it?

- From what I read, it is suggested to not include lower division classes. I left out data structures, computer architecture, discrete math, and some EE courses.

- Don't mind the indents after the bullet points. LibreOffice messed up the formatting when I imported. I'll fix it later.

Thanks for taking the time to look over this. I really appreciate it!"

1vup51,4,2014-01-22,Do I have a shot in consulting? (Computer Engineer),taintathrowaway,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1vup51/do_i_have_a_shot_in_consulting_computer_engineer/,"Good morning, y'all! I'm studying to be a computer engineer and I'm wondering If I have a shot at an entry-level position with a top 4.

### Reasons I'm attracted to the field of consulting
- Allows me to exercise, showcase, and improve sharpened social skills in a way engineering will never let me
- 50+% travel is hugely attractive to me... I'm not trying to start a family, and travel is one of my few passions in life. I know business travel is quite different, I've been with relatives.
- My technical background could potentially still be useful


### My qualifications

- BSE (3.1) and MSE (3.8) from an ABET-Accredited Engineering school
- Two years of experience as a club promoter and karaoke host, brought a local club back into the limelight
- One year as president as my fraternity, two years as social chair and secretary, one year as new member educator, rush chair, and vice president. I have two pretty serious awards from my national fraternity as well. As an executive of the fraternity, I've doubled membership, boosted the GPA, expelled problem members, and increased member ritual development from ~20% to ~100%.
- I've had two technical internships, one at a university in europe through that country's government, and one at a private defense contractor. I currently hold clearance for the second (where I still work), and both are technical internships in my specialization
- I am also an excellent programmer

### My questions

- What type of position should I seek within the field of consulting?
- Do I have a shot at top 4?
- Will consulting firms like my experience and ""unique story"" coupled with my master's GPA enough to overcome my limp undergrad gpa?
- If I were to pursue a PhD, could I still find my way into the field, and which PhD would be most valuable in your opinion?


Thank you for perusing this minor novel of mine, and I trust someone else will be helped by this post- search turned up nothing *quite* relevent."

It was my first mod, ever. I never finished it but me and a few friends played it. I shelved it as too hard but the basic idea grew into DayZ much later.

 |But I get a royalty, and I get paid. I also sold (assigned) the rights for DayZ to Bohemia so I was remunerated there too. Compared to royalty rates for other ""artists"" and such I am probably doing very well. Compared to game designers (who mostly don't get royalties) I'm doing extremely well.
 |My royalty rate is not insignificant (it is fairly significant).
 |I like short names, like Tom. But I'm also fairly self absorbed so I would probably name him Dean Jnr. I do that with my preferred successors in CK2.
 |I'll try not too. But I'm more concerned about squandering my time in the universe, rather than dying. Everyone dies.

In other words, not getting distracted with everything outside of the development (PR stuff etc...) as well as getting distracted from the core design etc...
[Did you ever feel that the game was not going to be released?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2n6?context=5)|I always knew the game would get released, but I did worry that we might have had some technical problems that would mean it would have been a shadow of what we wanted for the vision.

That is a really weird feeling. I find myself saying ""this is so crazy"" very often, as do the people close to me. It can be very hard to believe I'm not just living in some kind of dream world.
 |I don't really reflect on that I suppose, it just makes me want to not waste the opportunity. I want to make sure DayZ deserves the attention it has, and then use it's success to enable more great games to be made.

I understand that involves porting Arma 3, which is a huge task in itself, so it's going to take some time and effort, and you want to focus on getting the game done first. But with SteamOS and Steam Machines coming, there is an interesting opportunity for developers like you to take hold of an upcoming platform - maybe by contacting someone like Ryan Gordon to do the port for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevya06?context=5)|I really hope we can. We will be splitting the renderer out. But it won't be priority number 1. I just hope we can do that as part of everything else.
[Oh god I know that feeling. My mom just got a new gaming pc, and I being the son of course had to set it up. I've never used windows 8 till now, but I have to say, it's extremely shit.

But I had to fly out the next day.
[Game engine question ! ARMA games are known for there 'not so great performance' on even high end pc's. The engine is very CPU intensive compared to other game engines which utilize GPUs better. Is your team going to improve the engine to utilize more of that pc master race GPU power ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx8sf?context=5)|Yes. It is easier for us to optimize DayZ in some ways, because dayz's focus is very narrow. ArmA is an *incredible* game and ArmA3 is no exception. It has massive scope and a huge demand on AI and many other things.
 |Many of these things can cause problems for MP gaming, and that's what I'm all about really.
 |We have reports from Intel, AMD/ATI, and Nvidia. These give us ideas for how to optimize the client. Let's just say there is huge room for improvement.
[If an actual zombie outbreak would occur, what would be your tactic to survive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2hx?context=5)|Right now, I'd be pretty screwed. I think Prague/Europe would be a the worst place (as a foreigner) when something big went down.
 |My first goal would be to get out of metropolitan areas. I'd try and find some camping equipment, a pistol (hard), and break into an aircraft at a small airstrip. Try and use the aircraft to get somewhere remote with friends. My flying isn't great but I'm fine with a small single prop.
[What happens to DayZ if it stops selling well before its finished? Is it under your control whether you keep developing once the cash flow has slowed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2u7?context=5)|DayZ will absolutely continue development, no matter what happens to me.
[Hey Dean, thanks for doing this!  I remember I heard that you wanted to improve upon the VOIP in DayZ. Would you care to elaborate on how you aim to improve the current system?  I'm also looking for a suggestion. I'm currently at University learning games programming and I'm wondering what would be your recommendation for the best technology/language to learn? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2pw?context=5)|Well kind of everything. The quality. Allowing more types (whisper etc...). How zombies react to it. And also particularly the animation and how it plays when your character opens his mouth to speak.
[Edit: actually, I'll be the first for a non-DayZ orientated question. Any plans to climb anything else that's unfathomably huge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx116?context=5)|I'd like to get back into my climbing properly. I'd really like to do some more expedition type stuff, like I want to visit the North/South poles on foot (whole way). I'd like to return to do some climbing in New Zealand (Mount Aspiring, Mount Tasman, ""the grand traverse""). One day I'd like to take a crack at K2.
[Can you tell us if there are any plans for aircraft in DayZ? If so, what do you have in mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx39n?context=5)|Yes. I think helicopters and small aircraft will be important. But they should be very complex to maintain.
[Was the decision to release the Standalone in it's current state one of you and your team or one of Bohemia interactive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx4j2?context=5)|It was a decision we all discussed. Bohemia executives, the team, and myself.
[What's your opinion on the Early access market as a whole, and how it's helped develop your game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx4j2?context=5)|I think it's great but there are massive icebergs sitting around it waiting to be hit. I think some projects are going to hit those and those issues will need to be addressed. It helps because it gets rid of the publishers dictating what the people find popular. You guys say what concepts are good, not some fat guys driving bugattis.
[How far up Mt Everest did you climb, and what did you think of that experience as a whole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx4j2?context=5)|All the way to the top! It was much harder and much easier than I expected. The hardest part was probably in my mind, really.

Just a confirmation that it's coming ever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevyvpp?context=5)|Mouse accel can't be *removed* without *redesign*. So we are going to redesign how it works, there's no target date on that.
[Hi Dean! Thanks again for all your work on an awesome game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2oi?context=5)|In the Air Force I was a ground officer, but I graduated top of my class which was actually the first time a ground officer had beaten all the aircrew candidates. So that was cool. I worked as a contract relationship manager, with a secondary appointment as the NZ Police liaison. Was a cool job did all sorts of crazy police training for search and rescue. Lots of jumping out of helicopters!
[You have a bit of a military background that I seem to remember spans a couple different countries. Can you elaborate at all on your service record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2oi?context=5)|Then in the NZ Army I was trained as an infantry officer with the Singapore Army. Got to do lots of cool stuff. Survival training. Demolitions training (even got to set off all my charges cause I got a good score in my tests!). Urban ops. Lots of stuff. But my corps was actually Signals. This is why I wasn't promoted, because I wasn't technically qualified and I couldn't be bothered to do my corps training because it was really shit. So I've been a Second Lieutenant for a very long time.
[I've heard a lot about Day-Z, but have yet to get it even though it looks pretty freakin awesome.

The price will not change, but the game will get better. It is a promising concept now, but it is not a good game.
 |In a month, watch some livestreams and look for good/bad reviews. Read both, make your own mind up, and choose to buy it if it really looks good.
[This is why I, and many other people, have respect for what you do. I rather have someone be honest with me, rather than covering things up and pushing things out due to hype. Keep doing what you're doing man, good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cew5ax1?context=5)|Exactly. That's what is great about social media. You don't need all the marketing bullshit. It's so much easier just to be honest, and people respect that. Most people are smarter than advertising/media give them credit for.
 |Except youtube comments. do NOT read youtube comments. It's like looking directly at the sun.
[Hey Dean,  What do you think of shelters, are you planning to insert different shelters then just tents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2bb?context=5)|We have a plan for camping.

I used to pee in bottles in the army. While developing DayZ in my barrack room, at Waiouru on ex Thunder Warrior, I accidentally grabbed the wrong bottle. It was really gross.
[How much has CCP and EVE Online had on influencing your development decisions.  EDIT : and do you one day hope to have one big server like EVE?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx6z3?context=5)|Yes. Huge influence. I'm good friends with many of the people in CCP. The CCP parties are the only ones I drink at, ever!
[Do you personally play DayZ? And if so, what is your least favorite aspect of the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevypc2?context=5)|Yes. Zombies are my least favorite.
[Will you continue to add content even after the full release of DayZ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx30a?context=5)|Yes. There will be content updates and such for DayZ for a long time, I believe. However that would be up to Bohemia for the most part. I'm not sure I would (not want to) be super involved with that.
[You want to leave the dev team when the game goes gold? That makes me sad...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cew4r1h?context=5)|I'm not really sure what I would do, as the project *lead* then. I have many skills, but I'm more like throwing a grenade into a room. It's good for *clearing* it but its overkill for *cleaning* it.
 |I'm great for getting things done, aggressive, dangerous, difficult, new and exciting ideas. That's my best skills. But for BAU - I'm probably the wrong guy.
[Did you dream about anything unusual while at the Everest base camp? Like a bacon bathtub? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx3p3?context=5)|I had a recurring dream where we were on our summit attempt, and I needed to pee. It was very cold and when I started to pee, my pee hit the ground and it started to freeze. The freezing ran up my pee as it was coming out and into my penis. I would always wake up just as it hit me.
 |I was so concerned about it, I told the expedition doctor and we all had a good laugh :)
[Can't lie, that sounds fucking terrifying...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cew61ag?context=5)|It is right? it was a really scary dream!
[How long did you spend on the summit of Everest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx7sb?context=5)|About 20 minutes on the summit. I didn't leave anything up there, but as I was about to leave the Sherpa stopped me and gave me three small rocks to take down. I didn't really want to at the time, because they were heavy (they were tiny but when you're really tired...).
[Did you leave any memento on the summit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx7sb?context=5)|I'm glad he did. I have one on my desk right now.
[Personally I think it would be a great idea for everyone who goes up to grab some of the crap that's left up there with them down.

It's their mountain, if they want to leave prayer flags I think that's just fine.  Also, the jetstream is over the summit for most of the year. There was no rubbish on the summit. Anything left there would be blown away very quickly.

If so, What position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx33x?context=5)|I can run fast, but I could never catch very well. I played some touch rugby in the Army. If I could get the ball, I was really awesome. I played wing - but like I say,... the hard part was getting me the ball.

[Hey Dean!  There have been some leaked pictures of 3d models for DayZ SA, are these legit? Can you confirm that?  Also, if they are legit are these things coming soon or will they be spread over time, since the shotgun is coming very soon. How far ahead are some of these models? weeks or months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx4f2?context=5)|Probably. If it is the same untextured one I saw, yes. It was taken from the data files, not hard to do with dePBO. They will be in soon anyway :) Weeks, max.

The early access police dept sounds like a bad idea.
 |I think with the huge power of social media the community has, there is also massive responsibility. Consumers need to realize they need to be actively making decisions, and voting with their wallets. Not just buying everything ""just in case"" and then complaining after the fact.
 |Do your research, don't support bad people. Reward projects by people with a good track record. Then the economy will be pushing towards quality.
[Would you say that your climb of Everest was a major turning point in your outlook on DayZ? I have been searching for my own Everest for a while to clear my head and find a more direct purpose in life for a while now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx2pj?context=5)|I think Everest helped get me back on track. It was my survival experience in Singapore (and my whole time attached in singapore) that completely changed my life outlook. I got a bit lost with everything when DayZ took off, but Everest helped me get back to what mattered and what I wanted to do, to hell with everything else.

 |I have huge respect for most of the Czech people I work with. I think the country itself is crippled though, but corrupt politicians and people who think the state should pay for everything. I think with the changes coming it will make people (like myself) leave and there will not be the people to pay for the social security etc... that everyone demands.
[Then you're a good observant, our views are very similar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevze97?context=5)|It's a shame because I've *never* seen a country with so many highly educated, hard working, people. Salary expectations here are extremely modest. You have great internet, excellent power, and you're beside the economic powerhouse of europe... germany. This country has amazing industries, it was a the technological center of europe.
 |More than anything, it feels to me like generation after generation of politicians have used this country for their own purposes. It's gone on so long the people just seem to largely accept their fate. It sucks, because I could see this country being one of the most amazing places in europe, economically.
[What's your very best life advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevx50w?context=5)|Learn everything you can about the world. Never miss an opportunity to learn more. The universe is so fascinating it blows my mind every day, and I feel so lucky to have the ability to learn about it.
 |In the army everything was often very boring, and I struggled to stay awake. So I used to intensely focus on anything said or trained, ask massive amounts of questions. Not only did this keep me awake, but I found how fascinating even the most boring thing can be when you really try and understand it.
[On that note, too, what's your opinion of the WarZ dev playing your game and then openly criticising it negatively?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vulr2/i_am_dean_rocket_hall_creator_of_dayz_and/cevxa0t?context=5)|Haven't seen that. Everyone is entitled to their opinion though.

This is then the authentic solution, and thats the one I go for. I also ask people around me for their viewpoints - and try and consider alternate opinions (especially for anything views I hold with strong convictions).
[I've been playing the experimental build and can only say. The most important thing in the game right now is the need for loot to respawn.

More than I ever had. I regularly found my memory wandering across life as a teenager. That meant a great deal to me. When I was a teenager I was obsessed with mountains, with Everest. I was also frustrated with life sometimes because it always felt like the ""party was somewhere else"" in my life. I wanted to be at the center of the world where cool things were happening.

I thought that was going to be the end of my trip. I lost so much blood, my thermal long-johns were soaked with blood as were my socks and my boot inners. But I got better. On the summit attempt itself, I felt great! I was just very nervous about the wind. All I needed was my chance! We had a great team and fantastic logistics.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[ of all, congrats on the amazing lineup!  One of the best surprises for me was The Strokes.  What kind of black magic did you use to get them out of hibernation?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew484k?context=5)|We have tried to book The Strokes every single year that Gov Ball has existed. They essentially have had an open invite to play when they wanted. We got a call from their agent at the very last minute, saying that they wanted to reunite and play at the festival. Dream come true for us. We're New York City kids, and they are the greatest NYC rock band of our generation. BOOM -JW.
[**what day are vampire weekend and disclosure playing??**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew5w1s?context=5)|Bold question.  VW on Sunday.  Disclosure on Saturday. -YR.
[When you booked Kanye West for last years headliner, did he have any ridiculous demands that he required in order to play?  Also any chance you could please give me free tickets for this years festival?  pleeaassseee???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew3z1g?context=5)|Kanye was a true gentlemen. He was a pleasure to deal with, through and through. 
[What did you think last year when you first heard about the possibility of the storm? Have you made any changes this year in case of a similar situation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4b8m?context=5)|When we first heard about Tropical Storm Andrea it was 8 days out from the first day of the fest. By that time we have a Meterologist on call 24/7 to give us updates on the storms track, it's potential impact, etc. and we used that data to prep the site as much as we could for the coming rain. Unfortunately everything we did to prep the grounds was entirely negated by the massive amounts of rain we received. It was the most rainfall NYC has gotten in a 36 hour period EVER. That being said, during our repairs we did add in a new drainage line to help deal with rainfall, and we have had many convos with all city departments about how to address expected rainfall in the safest and best way possible. We have a new Weather plan which the City of NY have helped with, and we are better suited to deal with rain in 2014. That being said, and just being totally honest here, if we get 6 inches of rain in 36 hours again it will be another crazy year. However, let's think positive - it's gonna be beautiful and sunny and awesome! - T 
[There's 4 headliners on the poster and only 3 days - are Vampire Weekend and The Strokes co-headlining the same day? When will the days and stages be announced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew48oj?context=5)|None of the 4 headliners' sets will overlap. Don't you worry. -JW.
[Were there any serious inquiries into getting Daft Punk? If so, what was their official response?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew51m5?context=5)|For sure. Last summer, they said no dates in 2014. A month or so ago..it was 'not looking at dates till after the grammy's."" they're cool though. much love to them. -JW.
[How much does food and drink cost there? (talking burgers and pints, nothing too fancy lol\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew42hz?context=5)|Cost of food will depend on what you get (lobster rolls vs burger) but we try to keep prices reasonable.  They'll be cheaper than what you'd see at a sporting event at MSG, for example.
[What ID do I need to take to buy drinks? I don't want to take my passport and lose it so would a UK drivers license/passport scan be accepted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew42hz?context=5)|Cost of beer last year was around $7-$8.  Again, we try to keep it reasonable considering the cost of a beer in NYC. You'll need whatever ID proves you're above 21.  This is obviously a very strict rule.  A valid UK drivers license will work. Regarding recs for NYC - we work with partners like Cultivora to put together city guides.  Keep your eyes peeled for that in the future. -YR.
[WHAT DID THE BIGGIE &amp; TUPAC PICTURE MEAN?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew47na?context=5)|Ha, this got a lot of feedback from folks and much of that feedback was totally unexpected. We posted the picture right after Coachella posted their lineup, and it was a gesture to the old East Coast vs. West Coast days in hip hop. For the record there will NOT be any holograms at the event, and we apologize for any confusion about such a thing! - T.
[Was it difficult to have the festival at Randall's Island again, considering the deaths at Electric Zoo last September? Was there any special requests from the city so that something like this wouldn't happen again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew416n?context=5)|The tragic events that occurred at Electric Zoo have lead to new protocols and additional oversight from the City of NYC and the Parks department. More city agencies (and more folks from each agency) are involved in our planning meetings, and we are required to do many additional things, mostly safety related. That being said, the city has been a pleasure to deal with and they have been very professional and practical about things. Safety is their number 1 priority, and we feel the same way, so our interests are aligned there. - T.
[What was it like negotiating with Outkast, given their push to seemingly appear at every major festival this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew41rs?context=5)|We have their exclusive NYC market performance. Considering that New York City is the birthplace of hip hop...this is a very big deal!
[June 6th is my girlfriends prom &amp; I already bought my Gov Ball ticket. What do you guys think I should do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew453p?context=5)|Friday's lineup is very, very strong. Not sure how strong the Prom band/dj is, but we guarantee you will dance harder at Gov Ball than prom. We are a little biased however...-T.
[Do you ever have bands contact you saying they want to play or do only you do the contacting? How do you choose bands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew3ys3?context=5)|Some artists submit themselves and ask to play the festival. Some we reach out to and we ask. As the festival has grown in stature and popularity, we certainly get more and more artists asking to play. Choosing the artists is basically a combination of art and science. You want to book acts with a proven track record of selling tickets in the market. You want to book acts that haven't played the market in a while, and people are drooling to see them again. You book acts that have a new record coming out, and thus will have their own marketing push behind them. You also want to book some young, lesser known acts that you believe in, and think will become bigger come festival time. And sometimes I just book an artist because I love them and I think they are awesome :)
[OutKast and Killer Mike (Run the Jewels\), Disclosure and Alunageorge, Chance the Rapper and James Blake.  Any specific plans to bring any of these collaborations live at the festival?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4w9u?context=5)|For sure. But we don't want to ruin any secrets ;) -JW.
[Have you considered implementing something akin to Bonnaroo's ""Superjam"" (where a couple of acts that will be there get together to play on stage together\)?  I'd die happy if I could see Big Boi and Earl Sweatshirt go back and forth on a verse with a hook from Julian Casablancas...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4tif?context=5)|YES. GREAT MINDS SIR! -JW.
[If it's not too personal, would you mind me asking how you guys got into this business? I just graduated with a sport/entertainment management degree and am having difficulty getting off the ground and into a similar line of work. Any advice would be appreciated!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew3tkp?context=5)|Each of the three partners got into the music business by starting as interns at various different companies. One of us was an intern at Superfly Productions, who do Bonnaroo &amp; Outside Lands, and he ended up getting a full time job there at the conclusion of his internship. Another was an intern at Atlantic Records and then get a job at Paradigm, a major booking agency. The third partner worked at various festivals around the country and then went to business school. Each of us had different areas of expertise (one was operations &amp; production, another was booking, and the last was marketing &amp; sponsorship). We learned as much as we could from our respective jobs and then once we hit our ceilings we decided it was time to start our own shop. - T.
[PS Are you guys hiring any interns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew46a4?context=5)|We are! Email info@govball.com. - T.
[What's it like working with Julian Casablancas and The Strokes? Also, would you tell them I said hello?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4g3v?context=5)|I'll tell em you say what up. Jules and The Strokes are awesome. They are beautiful New Yorkers, through and through. Just like us ;) -JW.
[Would you guys ever consider getting a jamband? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew42eb?context=5)|Absolutely. No genre is off limits!!
[What act is each of you most excited to see this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4q9a?context=5)|DIARRHEA PLANET!! -JW.
 |The Strokes. - T.
[What date do you estimate that 3-day GA tickets will sell out by?  Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4pnz?context=5)|Last year 3-day tix sold out in early April. Sales are stronger than last year, and we anticipate being sold out in early spring. - T.
[ off, YOU'RE DOING GREAT! I went to GovBall for the first time last year and had a blast. Plan on going again this year since it's one of the best lineups I've seen this year so far not including Coachella.  What was the idea behind the name for the ""You're Doing Great"" stage? I noticed levels/tiers of wristbands above VIP and super VIP, how do people obtain those?  What was the overall attendance last year like compared to previous years? I imagine the numbers have been increasing every year, how do you guys adapt the festival to its increase in popularity? What's the budget like for a festival like GovBall? Is there ever a point where you would consider an artist too popular to book them? Adding onto that, if money weren't an issue, what would be your dream headliners for the festival?  Lastly, since Outkast is going to play pretty much every festival, is there anything unique you guys are planning on doing that would make Governors Ball stand out from all the other festivals Outkast is headlining?  Thanks for the AMA and keep it up! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew5o5w?context=5)|Ha. Thanks! You're Doing Great is just a funny saying we like. It's positive, and oftentimes hilarious in context. Anyhoo... Super VIP and Cabana tix are the highest tier of tix one can purchase.  You might have seen guest or artist wristbands on some people. Last year's attendance was our greatest, for sure.  It was the first year we did 3 days and had 4 stages.  We also expanded our grounds to allow for more capacity. No artist is too popular, no.  Some might not be a great fit, but too popular is not a metric for us.  The budget is very large.  Dream headliners for me are probably The Talking Heads Reunion, Phish, and LCD Soundsystem (or something like that). We always try to be unique and we'll work with the OutKast camp to see what's possible. -YR.
[What are some artists that you guys absolutely wanted to play at Gov Ball but couldn't due to logistics or otherwise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4mnp?context=5)|Pearl Jam Drake Eminem The Beatles.
 |JW.
 |Less Than Jake for me, but i just love me some old school punk &amp; ska. - T.
[Last year, you guys had the clearly defined three headliners in GnR, Pretty Lights and Kanye. This year, looks like you more or less have 4 (Outkast, Strokes, Vampire Weekend and Jack White\). How do you plan on balancing that, or will two of them end up playing around the same time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew47e1?context=5)|It's a delicate balancing act. But luckily, none of those 4 artists will overlap their sets. -JW.
[Will there be overlapping sets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4fcf?context=5)|It'll be just like last year.  4 stages and two acts performing at any one time.  So you'll always have two choices.  We do our best to counterprogram as well. -YR.
 |Yes.
[What made you choose Eventbrite for your ticketing? How does a ticketing service help/hurt the Festival? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cewbxim?context=5)|We chose EventBrite because of the people who work there and the strength of their technology and ticketing platform. Their on-site operations person is an old friend of ours and incredibly smart and we knew we could trust ticketing on-site if it was in her hands. Additionally their sales guy was also an old friend of ours and he bent over backwards to get us a deal we thought was most fair. Lastly, and arguable most importantly, their technology/ticketing system and the data you can pull from ticket purchases was unsurpassed by any other ticketing company we talked with. If you have good people you can trust, you're in good shape, and if you have a platform that can get you data that can help understand your consumers, you're in fantastic shape. - T.
[Any specific act you were *really* gunning for this year for couldn't fit in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew45q5?context=5)|Pearl Jam. They already had plans to be in Europe for their summer tour. Next time!! Also, Jagwar Ma. They're an awesome up and coming young act. They already had plans to be in europe as well. They rule. - JW.
[Thank you for doing this AMA. Two logistical questions: I am unfamiliar with NYC but got a place in Harlem for this event. Will I be able to take a bus or subway into Randall's Island Park or should I purchase one of the ferry tickets? Second question: Are there any unannounced bands you plan to add to the line up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew3yvl?context=5)|You're welcome! Here's your best bet - [Link to governorsballmusicfestival.com](http://governorsballmusicfestival.com/getting-there) But from Harlem you can either walk over the bridge (depending on how close your are the to east side) or take the MTA bus from 125th St on the east side.  You can always take a cab as well. There are no unannounced bands, no. -YR.
[How far in advance do you begin booking acts? Have you already started booking for 2015?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew51jk?context=5)|I'm already booked 2016, my friend. It never stops! -JW.
[How were you able to convince The Strokes to play their first show in almost 3 years at your festival?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4kuh?context=5)|I answered this below. But basically we've said from Day 1 that if we could book one band for Gov Ball...it'd be The Strokes. They knew Gov Ball was the right place to stage their grand comeback! -JW.
[What is the most difficult part of organizing a music festival?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew3wjy?context=5)|It's a huge, constantly moving puzzle. On the artist side of things, it's putting together a lineup that is unique and awesome enough to get people to commit to a full weekend festival. On the operations end, it's dealing with city gov't officials. There's tons more too! -J.
[What the status with ticket sales (particularly in comparison to last year, as the festival has definitely taken on a bigger role nationally it seems\)? Can you give a rough percentage sold out (VIP &amp; GA\)? When do you expect each to sell out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew80rn?context=5)|Hi! You're asking some great questions. Who are you?
[Did you guys talk to Julian Casablancas? How is he? They're so misterious as a band..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew89dp?context=5)|Jules is doing great. Just got into yoga and badminton. -JW.
[Any after-shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4fjb?context=5)|TONS! And they're gonna rule. Info coming soon! -JW.
[Which act are you most excited for this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4572?context=5)|I'd say Deafheaven and Diarrhea Planet... -JW.
[My friend was convinced that you were going to have Phish play last year in the final spot before you announced Guns N' Roses. Was Phish ever a legitimate option and may we still see them in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew6pc5?context=5)|Phish will be at Gov Ball at some point. For sure. -JW.
[What was the single biggest finding/learning from the 2013 festival?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew4mha?context=5)|In the words of OutKast ""You can't predict the weather."" -T.
[You said we could ask anything...So, are any of you guys single ??? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew9hy2?context=5)|Tom - you can find him on Tinder.
 |Whoever posted this...NOT COOL. - T.
[What is the best part about throwing the event? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew44uo?context=5)|Watching people have the f*cking time of their lives... -JW.
[After last year's torrential downpour, how will the island be equipped now to combat potential flooding and mud? Will there be shade for those waiting for ferries?  Who was the artist who was hardest to get this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew45mu?context=5)|We added a drainage line to the west side of the park which will allow for much better drainage in the event of heavy rainfall. Additionally, we have worked with the parks department to repair the grass so that it is stronger and better equipped for patron traffic and the outside elements. And toughest artists to get was definitely The Strokes. - T.
[Any details on what VIP for the weekend will get us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew5w0m?context=5)|You can see the info on our tickets page, but: - VIP viewing areas located at each stage that will provide a comfortable, close, and rockin' viewing experience. - VIP lounges at each stage will provide fans with access to an exclusive, shaded area, and limited comfortable seating. - A cash bar (credit cards can also be used), offering not only beer and wine, but also spirits. Whereas GA ticket holders can only buy spirits at the liquor lounge. - The VIP lounges will also provide special and much more comfortable air conditioned restroom facilities. -YR.
[I'm very interested in attending, but it's a 3-day thing and that commitment is big. Is there any way to find out which acts are playing when, so I could schedule it accordingly. On the same note, if it turns out all of the bands I'm interested in are playing on one day, is there any way to get a one day ticket, rather than the $230 3-day ticket?  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew49js?context=5)|We'll be releasing single day tix in the coming weeks, yes.  We'll release the by-day lineup a couple days before then as well, to allow you to plan and decide whether you want to go all 3 days or just one, etc. -YR.
[I've tried looking up more info than what is available on the website in regard to VIP.  My main concerns are where are the viewing areas located?  Thanks, you guys ROCK. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew535d?context=5)|The viewing areas are close to the stage, slightly just off to the side.  We'll provide a map as soon as we can, but try googling gov ball 2013 map for reference - they won't be much different than last year. -YR.
[Would you guys be interested in having a festival blog? I'd love to help contribute, and help get people pumped for the festival. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew52ab?context=5)|Email us at info@govball.com.

[ANY CHANCE OF U2 EVER PLAYING GOVBALL?!?!?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cewaj79?context=5)|Never say never...
[What would you say is the biggest misconception people have about booking acts for a festival? How does this change when working with big acts verse small acts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew42sj?context=5)|One of the bigger misconceptions is that people tend to think booking a band for the fest is similar to inviting someone to your birthday party. There is a TON more to it than that. NYC is a very important market to 10 out of 10 artists, and they need to choose their play very carefully. Timing, slot, billing, money, etc all come into play. -JW.
[What's your favorite US festival, outside of the ones you promote/produce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vvb0u/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/cew452q?context=5)|Bonnaroo, or Outside Lands -JW.
 |Bonnaroo and Jazzfest. - T.
[Will there be an official wristband this year??

During the repair we made some capital improvements to the park to help better deal with heavy rainfall, so the park is better prepared to deal with extreme weather. Obviously with the massive amounts of mud we had last year, many folks didn't have the best time. Unfortunately weather/rain/mud is the nature of the beast when it comes to music festivals and we all have to embrace it to a certain degree. On our end, as the producers, we will continue to improve our responsiveness to cases of extreme weather so fans can have the best time possible, no matter what the conditions are. - T.

The only reason I come to school is so I can broaden my knowledge with my math and science classes. I read and study on my free time anyway (and I learn much faster when I study outside of school). Most of my teachers don't care for the students and they over complicate the hell out of everything (showing that they don't understand the basic concepts of the subject themselves after x amount of years). Everyone is feeding me this ""You need college."" garbage. School has stolen enough years of my youth already. The safest trades that I could land (that I would want at this age) are:

-Information Technician (I want to get my CCNA next year and do an internship this summer)
     
-Electrician (would seem fairly easy because I study physics so often)

-Programming (I have experience with C++, HTML, CSS)

-Research Work (Working in a lab, I would feel open to working for free)

If you guys have any advice on what I should expect from my position / the trades I listed or just tips on 
how to get into these trades feel free to give feedback. Thank you for your time."

I think the biggest problem is my lack of projects. The only thing I have even worth mentioning is a website I helped build for my class. 

The only work experience I have is in IT and it doesn't really translate into any developer experience. 

I know I should be working on my own stuff but there's nothing I can think of that I want to do. I'm trying to learn Ruby On Rails and eventually build some web apps but I don't have anything in mind and I feel like I'm not competent enough to contribute to any open source projects. 

It's starting to feel like I've wasted the past 4 years getting this degree even though I really like programming. Any advice would be really helpful."
1vw1bq,2,2014-01-22,B.S. or B.A. in computer science?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1vw1bq/bs_or_ba_in_computer_science/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm seeking some advice on which computer science degree I should pursue. 

I'm currently a sophomore and I switched into my university's computer science program last semester. Because I switched into the program after my freshman year, I'm behind in my computer science requirements. My question is this: is the extra time I'd have to spend in school worth it to get a B.S. in comp sci instead of a B.A.? 

If I were to go for the B.S., I would definitely have more than two years left of school. If I were to go for the B.A., I could likely finish in two years (4 years total). 

Here are the requirements for my school's programs:

[BA degree](http://imgur.com/j8xOUvL,hplFMXC)

[BS degree](http://imgur.com/Exzdq3L)

As you can see, I'd be taking fewer CS courses with the BA.


Will my job prospects after college be significantly impacted by having a BA instead of a BS? 

I'm sure it depends on what exactly I'd like to do with my degree after college, and to be honest, I have no clue. I've taken several courses in my school's systems engineering department and I find project management to be fairly interesting.




Some other info that's relevant: 

* I haven't yet had an internship
* I'm taking out loans for college (not a huge amount, but loans nonetheless)
* I don't have any projects that I'd feel comfortable putting on a resume. I'm working on changing that right now, but for the time being I don't have any.


If there's any other info I can include that would help with your suggestions, please let me know! Thank you in advance!"

I guess I might as well tell somebody.",alone20,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1vwcxo/im_fucking_done_with_life_ive_had_enough_i_guess/,"I don't have anybody else to tell or talk to in real life, so I'll do it here. No career, no money, no friends, nothing. Graduated with honors from a prestigious university a year ago and had internship experience on top of that but still making minimum wage at a shit job for teenagers and living with my parents in a small town. I'm the oldest one at my job by 10 years and the only one there with a college degree. A few 15-year-olds are making more money than me there. It's humiliating and I'm ashamed of myself. Guess I chose the wrong degree. B.S. in radio-television-film. Not as good as a computer science/STEM master race degree, but maybe if I work really, really, really hard and make great grades I can get a job in entertainment? Nope. Media? Nope. Advertising? Nope. News Media? Nope. Local video production? Nope. Office monkey job? Nope. Assistant retail manager? Nope. An administrative assistant job? Nope. Janitor? Nope.

And I just love the attitude employers have towards their workers now, especially younger ones. I saw an unpaid internship job posting with this in the listing: ""This position is unpaid. If this is a problem for you, don't bother applying."" What a great attitude to show to your future employees! If you don't have someone willing to cover all your living expenses for months, don't even bother, you lazy, entitled fuck! And my favorite, on a media-related job listing at a church: ""This position is unpaid; interns should look to god for their other needs."" Yeah, your fake god doesn't provide housing and food. Fuck you for justifying not paying your workers by using your fake fairy-tale god. Fuck you, you greedy, worker-abusing cunts.

So I go to work at my shit job 30-40 hours a week and am very friendly and work super hard despite everything. Nobody there has any idea how depressed I am. Every other second of free time is spent job-searching and applying for real jobs. Nine months later and not a single response to an application. I'm not lazy or stupid or spoiled. I'm clean-cut, well-dressed, intelligent, and friendly. If I'd ever get called for a single interview, I know I'd do really well. And my resume isn't the problem, it's been revised by several career counselors who've said it's an excellent resume, and I make adjustments in my cover letter and resume for every single application. Maybe I should've done five more unpaid internships? Twenty more? Then I would've gotten a real job? Who fucking knows. Every entry-level job has 400+ applicants, what are the odds I'll ever get chosen? Guess I should've just gotten my parents to pay all my bills so I could work for free for half a decade. How nice, to be born wealthy and not ever have to worry about starving or affording the simplest medical procedures. America is truly the greatest country on Earth, with all this freedom and opportunity (for the rich).

Oh yeah, and I have a degenerative and incurable medical condition that's disfiguring my body and will continue to get worse until it cripples and kills me. Not that anybody cares. Except to stare and stifle laughter at me while I try to work out at the gym. Or when someone touches me and flinches away, repulsed at feeling the deformities in my skin. Not that anyone's touched me for years. I can't remember the last time I even got a hug. My only two friends, my dogs, are old and dying. They probably won't make it through the summer.

I'm not greedy. I'm not spoiled or entitled. I don't care about money, I don't want expensive vacations, I don't want a nice car. I don't even want kids or a family. I don't want a nice apartment. All I want is enough money for a cheap studio apartment and enough to eat decently so I'm not hungry all the time. That's it, that's my only dream left at this point. So what is that, around 30K a year? If that? After graduating from a great college with internship experience and a 3.9 gpa, is it really so much to ask for to have an opportunity to prove myself at a job where I don't have to skip meals and live with my parents? 

When I sleep, I dream about being in a relationship with a sweet, kind girl with loving, gentle eyes. Someone that will give me a warm hug or hold me through the night without recoiling in disgust. Someone that has conversations with me and wants to go places and have fun and spend time with me. When the alarm clock goes off I just want to go back to sleep and not wake up.

Finding someone that wouldn't be disgusted by me seems about as likely as getting a decent job and moving out of my parents house. As likely as my disease just magically disappearing. As likely as someone ever loving me. I used to be the kindest, warmest, happiest person. Now when I look in the mirror, I see a mean, sunken face with cruel, dead eyes. I look ten years older than I am and feel thirty older than that. Enough is enough. I want to be happy, I want to have friends, I want to work hard at a good job, I want to love and be loved. But how much longer can I lie to myself by thinking that any of these things will ever happen? "

Any advice?,johnly13,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1vwerx/just_bombed_my_first_technical_interview_any/,"I just interviewed for a technical summer internship. I ended up making it past the initial phone screening to the in-house interview but when I walked into the interview I completely bombed it.  The problem wasn't hard, I just couldn't get myself to the answer in time.  

I've taken all the classes I need to that will cover the material on technical interviews (Algorithms, Data Structures, Computer System Fundamentals).  I think it was just nerves (it was my first interview ever) - however, I can't shake the feeling of being very disappointed in myself, like I'm just not cut out for this.  I do very well in my CS classes and can pick up on the concepts rather quickly.  It's just when it comes to thinking outside of the box, this feature that employers seem to be so keen on finding in their candidates, I'm afraid I don't have what it takes.

As far as my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, I feel pretty solid but I feel today was a huge hit to my confidence.

Sorry about the long winded rant.  Anyways, is there any advice from all you developers, engineers, etc. regarding how to better prepare for these interviews outside of schoolwork? And what do you do when you feel like you're just not good enough to for these jobs?  Thanks in advance.

Throughout that time I rose higher in tiers to just under the help desk supervisor role.  
  
Much of the upper management knew I was interested in web development and programming, and in November 2013 I was presented with an opportunity to work with one of the developers on an internal web application for the call center. I had little to no real world experience at this point and accepted. However, soon after, the developer was moved onto another project and I was now the main developer for this project and way in over my head.  
  
Where I am now: I am still currently maintaining the application with the limited help of the same developer. My main concern is that I still have the same title (and pay) as a help desk technician. I still have some responsibility in the call center when call volume is high. I obviously would want to be in dev full time and I also think a title change would look better on my resume. I feel like I am working two jobs for the lousier title.  
  
What are your guys' thoughts on my situation? What would be the best/most professional way to ask about a title change? Either way, I think it is great experience for me and am learning C#, ASP.Net, and T-SQL. I am also in a SCRUM team.  
  
Side question: How well will this experience look on my resume when I start applying for jobs? I still have a side project I work on, but should I look to apply to internships for the summers as well?   
  
Any feedback is really appreciated, I love this sub and it has been a huge help to me!"
1vwov4,0,2014-01-22,Will I die in 14 units that all involve coding?,calCSjunior,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1vwov4/will_i_die_in_14_units_that_all_involve_coding/,"I'm an L&amp;S CS major with 3 semesters left including this one.  Right now I'm enrolled in CS 189, CS 161, Music 159, Psych 1, Music 140 (easy 2 units), and 2 units of independent CS research.  Music 159 is a new class where the entire grade comes from programming homework and projects.  I need to decide whether to drop CS 161 or Psych 1, since CS 189 and Music 159 are both directly relevant to my research.

Looking at the draft schedule for next year, I would really prefer to take 161 this semester.  But I'm worried that having almost all of my units (14 / 16) involving coding is too ambitious of a schedule.  So far, in all my semesters I've been in only 8 technical units (and often, half of these do not involve programming, like math 54, cs 70, cs 170). Does anyone have any advice?  Should I go try to see the CS advisor?  

Some other potentially useful information:
- I usually get good grades
- I won't be job / internship hunting this semester as I already accepted an offer

If I think of anything else I'll edit it in.  Thanks in advance for any responses!"

I've been feeling really lost and worried lately and I could really use some advice. I've loved this subreddit and you all have always been very helpful.

I'm a junior at a university that is really high ranked for computer science, the thing though is that I'm not a computer science major! I'm declared in Economics and due to how far I am through school and the fact that CS is a capped major, it seems unlikely that I can major in it.

However, I've been taking CS courses since freshman year and I'm on my way to completing a minor. I've also had a few internships, one of which was in software development.

Based on what I've heard on this subreddit, many doors are closed for people without a CS degree, and I would like to feel more at home among my peers if I can finally get a job in software development.

Based on this, I'm thinking grad school might be the way to go. If this is the case, for this summer should I take more computer science classes, more math classes, or try to get another internship? Which do you think grad schools would like to see the most?

**TL;DR: Should I go to grad school with just a minor in CS, and if so how should I prepare this summer?**

Also I'm totally freaking out and also feeling inadequate among everyone who has a major and is more set up. How do the rest of you handle that?"

I feel like I haven't taken enough upper division CS courses to be able to compete against the 3rd years at my school. Also, my level of understanding in CS isn't the best. Before I was able to switch into CS, I had to take intro to programming classes offered by the math department. Now that I'm in CS, I've noticed a HUGE difference in how things are taught. Math's version was more of just introduction to concepts and briefly mentioning how to use them. So I feel like I'm rebuilding my foundations on how to code and such (in a good way).
I was considering using my third year (and summer) to just catch up on upper division courses and get better acquainted with projects that I'm already working on.

Part 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1vyx7d/my_very_long_story_seeking_advice_part_2/

Anyway, as classes continued, reality began to set in more and more. I struggle with Japanese. It's indeed a very hard language to learn, and like an idiot, I thought passion alone would give me what I needed to pass and work hard. Now would be a good time to mention that I have a learning disability. I could study all day and not remember a word of it the next day. I also have test anxiety, which makes my mind go absolutely blank when I take tests. I actually did get academic accommodation...for the test anxiety. Unfortunately, there's nothing proving that I have an actual learning disability. That, or the info I gave them wasn't clear enough or it's outdated. I can't remember which. The college doesn't give out learning disability tests, so I would have to go back home to take the test, which is a complicated matter in and of itself. The test anxiety privilege is useless to me. It would have been useful to have something like it in high school, where the classes are short, and test times are shorter, but in college, at least my college, they give you the whole class to do the test and classes are usually an hour or so long. My main problem lies with my inability to retain info.

I began to feel more and more upset about college. I had decided that Japanese Studies wasn’t going to get me anywhere in life. I was scared that I wouldn’t be able to get a good job because of it, because I didn’t want to be a translator or an English teacher in Japan, least of all a Japanese teacher in America. Not that I’d be able to anyway, considering I’m sucking hard at Japanese right now. My way of thinking is this: Pretend you’re me, just graduated from college, and you go around telling people who are hiring that you’re available. They’d ask you what you can do, and then you’d say, “Well I know a lot about Japanese people, but can barely articulate the language. Do you have a place for me?” Anyway, what really made me think that I wasn’t going to get anywhere with Japanese Studies was the fact that my fascination with Japan was mostly because I wanted to go there from a young age. Maybe I’ve just been fooling myself over the years, convincing myself that I wanted to go there with some better goal in mind, or maybe I thought I could figure something out along the way of getting there. I feel like it was the latter.

There was also the fact that there’s absolutely no privacy here. I’m very much introverted, so I like to have those quiet moments to myself a lot. I live in a triple with two other girls, and while they’re nice, they barely give me a moment to myself. It’s not like I can tell them to please get the fuck out, because it’s their room too. Actually, this semester, one of the girls moved out, and the one that still lives here doesn’t come back too often, so it’s a little better. Still, I’d rather have a whole room to myself.

I would get an apartment, but then there’s the fact of getting a job. The economy in this town is piss poor, so nobody’s hiring. Everyone who’s lucky enough to have a job is holding onto it for dear life. I can’t work on campus either, because I have to come from a family with no money whatsoever, then I can work here. There was a paid internship that was offered that I was only interested in because of the money. The internship was basically training to be a lunch lady, but I didn’t know it when I first heard about it. I thought it was something like working in a restaurant, where I could actually cook instead of sticking frozen shit in an oven. I wanted to do it just so I could bake, because I like baking, but the lady I talked to said that they don’t really do things with baking in the internship. When I talked to her, I also found out that it’s basically lunch lady training. My mom’s a lunch lady, and I know the shit she goes through, so I didn’t want any part of it. Of course my mom wasn’t happy when she found out that I dropped the internship, even though I made it clear to her that I wasn’t interested in what they were offering, and that taking an internship that taught me things I’ll never use is a waste of time. She keeps bringing it up and it’s making me mad. “You know, you should see if they’re still offering that internship.” She’s said this so many times it makes me want to scream just thinking about it. 

It soon began where I would start crying almost every day, because of how confused and lost I felt. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like if it keeps up, my depression is going to return. I had it when I was ten. I don’t know if it can just come back, but that’s what it feels like sometimes. I don’t cry much anymore. Going home every other weekend has helped that, but it doesn’t get rid of the constant sadness I feel inside. I constantly feel sad or angry sometimes. I’ve been doing a better job of repressing it, but it surfaces every now and again. I’ve talked with the school’s therapist, and it didn’t really help. She just gave me a bunch of generic cures like doing exercise and walking around campus or going to events, even if I’m not interested. In fact, talking about college with people in general usually makes me sad or angry, and I’m tired of feeling like that.

I don’t know if I’m going to stay in college. I kind of want to go to one closer to home, so that way, I’ll know I’ll be able to get a job. There’s a place downtown where I can continue learning Japanese, but I’ve been thinking of majoring in creative writing. I’ve told my mom about transferring colleges, but she doesn’t like the idea. She thinks that I have it good where I’m at. It’s a great campus, and the people are nice, but it’s just not for me. She thinks it’s ok for me to change my major, but wants me to stay here. She says I’m being so sudden about my decision. I’m really not. I just didn’t tell her when I first started having doubts, so it just seems sudden to her. If I do change my major, I don’t think I should remain at Earlham, considering I only came here for Japanese Studies, and I can go to a much cheaper college to major in something else if I wanted.

Then there’s the question of what I want to major in. I honestly have no fucking clue. I’ve been thinking about creative writing or music technology and recording. Neither of these are bound to get me into a good job either, but they’re the only things I’m actually sort of good at. I really don’t have any worthy skills that can get me into a good career. I can sort of write, and I can read music. I like books and movies. I’m not really skilled at anything else. I flunked math anytime I ever took it, and I suck at academics in general. I’ve also considered dropping out.

I’ve tried asking advice from my mom, but I feel like she doesn’t really understand, since she’s never been to college. Even if she had, it would have been radically different to how it is now. My school counselor isn’t much help either.

What initially compelled me to write this huge wall of text was what my Japanese teacher said to me today. I flunked the first test of the semester and she wanted to talk to me about it. She asked me how I was, and I said I was good because I always say that. I could be worse. I could be dead, for instance. She asked if I was liking college and I told her not really. She said it was sad that I thought that, because I should be enjoying my life. I wanted to start crying there, but I didn’t. She asked why I didn’t like it, and I said that I pretty much feel obligated to go here. Because that’s basically it. I probably would have transferred/dropped out but I can’t because of the things people expect of me. My parents were so proud of me, and I feel like I’m letting them down. Everyone in my family is proud of me and they keep praising me, inadvertently guilt-tripping me into staying here. I don’t want to be a disappointment. I’d rather die than let my family down. The concerned/pity look my teacher gave me upset me so much that I wrote all of this. I need help. What do I do?

(WOW this ended up really long. Sorry. I was upset when I wrote this, but I'm calmer now. Anyway, I appreciate any advice you can give me. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way, but no one has been giving me helpful advice.)"
1vz3dp,3,2014-01-23,Pros and Cons of Community College,Greatlawlochina,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1vz3dp/pros_and_cons_of_community_college/,"I've noticed that there are a lot of, ""Should I go to Community College"" posts and I wanted to throw my two cents in. My experience is based off going to two separate California community colleges and numerous friends and family who have gone.  
  
  
Pros:   
-The Teachers: Community college is great for actually interacting with your teachers because the class sizes are so small. Also the teachers are paid next to nothing so usually they have a love of the subject they are teaching.   
  
-The Cost: The best benefit of community college is the cost. In California each unit costs $46. My tuition for 17 units (plus fees) was $806.  
  
-Transfer Agreements/Guarantee: Almost all community colleges have transfer agreements with schools where you take certain courses and maintain a certain GPA and you're guaranteed admittance and a spot in your major.
  
-Transfer with a Diploma: Often times when fulfilling major requirements for another school students are able to receive an Associate's degree. It's nice to have in case of dropping out or potentially internships.  
  
Cons:  
- Registration/Overcrowding: Community colleges have a problem where there are certain courses that are required for a majority of students (usually revolving around math classes) and because of this some students have to stay for 3 years in order to get the classes they need.  
  
-Ugly transfer classes: Depending on the schools that you apply to transfer to, some of the classes that you take at community college don't transfer well or at all. While one school may require a certain course for their major, another school may not need that course or not even have a class equivalent meaning you only receive elective credit for it.
  
-Little support: At a university if you are having trouble, there are a lot of resources to get help. Community colleges have them too, but not to the same extent as the universities. While both have places such as a writing lab, tutors and counselors, community colleges often lack mental health services or qualified counselors. The counselors at community colleges are often overworked/understaffed and there is too much information about transferring out there, the student usually needs to do his own research which is where some students fail.  
  
-Social Life/Campus Life: For a student out of high school, community college can be disappointing simply because of the nontraditional students and the commuting aspect. A big part of the university life is joining clubs but at community colleges it can be difficult because students at community college often work while chasing their degree and the large number of nontraditional students aren't interested in on campus clubs.  
  
-Certain Majors: Certain majors are easier to transfer to because of the low math requirements and more funding. If you want to pursue a STEM major it's a guarantee you will spend at least 3 years at a community college because of the incredibly impacted math, biology and chemistry classes. If you're not going into a STEM major, it's a lot easier to get your classes.  
  
Conclusion: There were times that I hated my Community college experience and times where I thought it was the greatest thing in the world. Community college is really what you make of it and usually requires a lot of motivation just to keep going."

They do 10 to 12 hrs a week, including teaching 2 1.5 hour sessions, sitting in on the classes themselves, and getting together to discuss stuff. 10 to 12 hours may not seem long, but I'm taking 5 classes this yr+ a lab. 3 hard science/math classes. And for this one class I've been just looking back and forth between the book, my notes, and the online homework, trying to find connections. So basically it means this will be one of THOSE classes. I have a strong feeling that the other 2 classes I mentioned will be similar. 


So, i am officially wimping about on this great chance to put something really good on my resume, as I have never taught anything in my life before. I feel like such a loser, because I want to work at a car dealership this summer, and on top of the fucking fact that I won't have a car AND that I'm in college (car dealerships don't like hiring students) I will have by then a one school year gap in employment (I quit my summer job at McDonald's back in August) in college. And if I get rejected from the car dealership job, that employment gap timeline will carry onto the future when I'm trying to find internships, the collapse of the domino's will inevitably start with my chickening out on this tutoring position due to too much work in my classes. GAHHHHHH!!!!!


Sorry for the rant, I just wish there is an alternate way to resolve this, but as of now I can't find anything.

After that he went on to say that they will still pay me for the 79 hours of overtime I had racked up, as if they are doing me a favor.

I have had some issues with the company such as them not paying me time and a half for working over 40 hours in a week which is illegal as an hourly employee and them letting me go after telling me many times how much of an asset I have become in such a short time, but I'd like to take the high road and leave professionally.

Example: Wikipedia has been in the press lately, because they're accusing some editors of writing biased articles for payment. How would you detect those edits/editors?

Example 2: How would you design a traffic app that gave directions, and also used information about the cost of tolls, the cost of carpool lane fines, and the likelihood of getting a ticket/carpool lane fine?

My life was so lost and lonely. I was always at home and friendless, my parents were never there, we lived in many different countries, and my world was computers and electronics. I was both abused and spoilt.

When my parents moved to Japan when I was 14 or 15, it was the first place I found myself. It felt like home, people thought I was Japanese, and I picked up the language and kanji really fast. But because I was finishing my study elsewhere, and applications to university were automatic, I got in and my parents made me go (in an abusive way).

I went back to being lonely and unhappy and friendless, a year or so later my parents moved out of Japan. But I got a Japanese boyfriend at university very unexpectedly, and he became my life for years, practically over the whole course of university.

Then I got pregnant on a trip with him and he didn't want me to abort. I was still going to abort because I never wanted children... but he told my parents who also strongly were against me aborting.

I didn't know what to do. I tried to downplay it as much I could. I did my internship while I was pregnant, basically only spent the last couple months ""being pregnant"", and everyone agreed that my parents would raise him including me. I was pampered like a surrogate mother and that was to be it, I was going to go back overseas. I said I didn't want to get married and didn't want a future with my boyfriend.

My parents kicked the boyfriend out of their house (somewhat understandably). And we've been almost completely out of contact since. I went overseas and was all alone. Completely alone. After 8 months of something so intimate as breast feeding and being connected to my son daily 24 hours a day.

I got the wrong job by unwanted referral (it was an amazing job but just the wrong environment) and the wrong kind of guy heavily pursued me and got into a relationship with me for a year plus. I left the job because it was so lonely. And the relationship because he was just all wrong.

I'm not in Japan which is the only place that feels like home and can't find a reason to go to Japan, I'm not a citizen... I'm 24 and I feel like there's no hope. After years of abusing myself with lack of sleep and lack of eating, I look terrible and that won't help me get a job or anything. My parents think I'm a drug addict and insane because of my appearance and I may have picked up some weird habits (like getting claustrophobic all the time and constantly needing to escape, or being obsessed with not eating ""unhealthy"" things).

tl;dr; Only place I felt I even slightly belonged was Japan but not a citizen. No job anymore. Parents took my kid by mutual agreement. And years of self abuse made me look like an insane drug addict. I want to die."
1w0zeg,1,2014-01-24,this fatigue,lk09nni,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1w0zeg/this_fatigue/,"I called in sick this morning. I feel bad for the nice lady at my internship, she takes good care of me and wants to teach me things, but I just couldn't get up. 

I need to eat something but I don't know what. Eating is nothing but a chore, and I don't feel real hunger. Some friends took me to a restaurant yesterday, they still seem to care about me a bit. But I could see from their faces how I was bringing their whole dinner down, how they must have been hoping I'd have said no. I forced the wine down so I wouldn't be so boring and quiet, but instead all my words came out broken and embarrassing and wrong.

I don't want to die. It's been ten years since my last suicide attempt and many days, I am so incredibly glad I failed. I try to remember how good I feel when I'm ""up"". I try to remember all those nights when I lay sleepless in total ecstasy, making wonderful fantastic plans, when I have enough energy to pull together magnificent projects, move half across the world, and make everyone laugh. And then this fatigue hits me again - I remember how bad I can get, how dreams crumble in my hands, how I embarrass myself and become a burden to everyone around me. I think about how much easier their lives would be without my toxic presence. All of the meds and therapy took the peaks off it, but I'm still like this, I might never be normal, I'll always fall back and forth between these extremes.

There's a wedding dress in my living room. It's so pretty but it just makes me want to cry. I know he wants to have a baby with me, but I couldn't raise a child when I'm like this. I tell him to leave me, to find somebody easier and lovelier and less disgusting, but for some reason I've tricked this beautiful wonderful man into thinking I'm not a fucked up crazy mess. I can't leave him, I've tried, but I love him so much and I keep hurting him so badly. 

And then, somehow, removing myself from it all seems like the kindest thing to do, under the circumstances. It'll hurt them in the beginning, but I can't but help thinking they'll feel some relief, too. And that he'll find someone new who can love him better. I don't want to die, but I have no energy left to live. I'm so tired. I'm just so tired.

New grad - is this offer too low?,2therealworld,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1w16md/help_new_grad_is_this_offer_too_low/,"I'm graduating this year with a computer science degree. I have 1 year experience doing web dev internship for a large multinational company. 

I've been offered a position as a web developer / UI designer with a small company in Toronto (Canada). The position itself sounds good - they have told me that I will be the first UI person in their shop and will have relative creative control. The people I interviewed with also seemed nice. I talked with the HR person about my salary expectations being high 50s - low 60s, but they came back to me with an offer for $52K with no paid vacation and benefits only after 6 months of service. 

My concerns are: 

- this is lower than what we'd discussed

- this is a contract ""intern"" position, though they say they usually hire to full time after

- since I'll be the first UI person, I am expected to be the expert and carry most of the UI stuff, which I don't mind doing, but I feel like they're paying me like an intern and expecting full time work.

- since I live just outside of Toronto, I will have to either move to Toronto for an easy commute or have an expensive, long commute to work every day. Both options are expensive and will most likely eat up half my salary (along with taxes).

My question is: do you guys think this is a low ball offer, given the location, my experience, and the amount of work involved in this position? Would it be a good idea to counter saying I was expecting something close to $60K?

(Paid IT internship or unpaid IT Security internship),plaguepoop,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/1w2a3x/which_internship_to_accept_paid_it_internship_or/,"I am graduating this Spring with bachelors and would like to get an entry level IT Security full time job.  I am currently taking an IT Security class and am getting Security+ certified in a month or so.  

Fortunately, I have two internships to choose from:


Option 1:  Unpaid IT Security Internship:  Company is a large well known clothing company.  It doesn't seem like they are the type of company to hire interns based on the number of interns they pump in and out.  I'll work directly with the Security Architect.  Exposure to SolarWinds, Footprints, SAP, wireless auditing.


Option 2: Paid IT (general) Internship ~$13-15 hourly: Company is a well known company related to entertainment.  Seems possible to continue my hours after graduating.  I'll work with helpdesk most of the time.  Requires a little SQL experience to work with MS SQL (which I have and am experienced with).  Some exposure to SAP.  

My gut is telling me to stick with the unpaid internship but I need some advice from people in the industry.  

Thanks!"

Considering I don't expect to graduate for 3 more years, I have a lot of time to build an impressive resume &amp; portfolio + I already have an on-campus job in web development/tech support.

I do not want to live in the city I currently go to school in under any circumstances and I've been told that companies prefer to hire local grads. Assuming that I will be graduating with gobs of relevant experience and an internship or two will I be able to move to a different location (i.e. San Francisco or Seattle) and not have a hard time finding a job?"

[Will it always be free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey18o9?context=5)|Our primary mission is to end HIV/AIDS.  In order to accomplish this goal the vaccine has to be free.  There are far too many people who are living with HIV who could never afford a commercial drug.  Therefore the answer is yes!
[I've got no question, but I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing. Here's wishing you all the very best!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1mnf?context=5)|We really appreciate your support!  Please remember to donate at [Link to pledge.immunityproject.org](http://pledge.immunityproject.org)
[Why have you provided no sources or scientific background on your website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0oiy?context=5)|We have submitted our manuscript with our animal data for publication in a PRJ - we will link to the article as soon as it is released!
[What about previous research that informed this project? It would be nice to see what you are basing it on. Would you consider adding a more sciency FAQ for researchers who want more background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1fkl?context=5)|Jain, S., D. O'Hagan, and M. Singh The long-term potential of biodegradable poly(lactideco‑glycolide) microparticles as the next-generation vaccine adjuvant. Expert Rev. Vaccines, 2011. 10, 11 DOI: 10.1586/ERV.11.126.
 |Thanks for the suggestion!  For sure we need a more science-oriented FAQ! We will get to work on that.
[If I may ask, what journal? When did you submit? It seems a bit fast to move on to human trials before the animal trials are published.  (Speaking from personal experience in extremely cautious publishing/funding schedules\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0xcf?context=5)|We have submitted to Vaccine.  Our funding is not dependent on the publication. We aim to start FDA Phase I clinical trials this year. 
[If you don't mind. Who are the first and last authors on the manuscript?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1ab2?context=5)|No problem!  I am the first and Dr. David Heckerman is the last!
[Just wondering why, if this is a potentially revolutionary vaccine, it's not in one of the holy trinity journals? Why not aim high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey2onj?context=5)|Great question!  Nature, Science at al cover science broadly and need articles of general interest to scientists across disciplines as well as non-scientists.  Our work to date is more relevant to speciality journals interested in the vaccine and drug-delivery domains.
[If this was compelling enough, wouldn't it be easy to get the Gates Foundation behind this? Seems like small money compared to the problem and if the case was strong enough, I'm sure he'd put up the cash.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey2kkf?context=5)|I have spoken with them and they are really great people!  Like the NIH, with some positive human clinical data we can get them interested in our approach.  We need crowd funding to get us to that point.  Hence, pledge.immunityproject.org.  Thanks for your support!
[1\) How is your approach different from other HIV T cell-inducing vaccines (Link to www.plospathogens.org Link to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Link to www.plosone.org among others\) that likely include the same conserved regions that you intend to target?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey35jz?context=5)|1) We are targeting a single, specific epitope.
[2\) If your immutable region of the virus proteome is small, what is the likelihood that the majority of the population will have HLA class I molecules that can bind peptides derived from this region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey35jz?context=5)|2) The epitopes in the vaccine will be HLA restricted - we will need a master vaccine ""cocktail"" with enough epitopes (maybe two dozen) to cover relevant multiple HLA types.
[3\) What do you mean when you say the vaccine will be free? That there will be no royalties or patents? That it can be manufactured by any group free of charge without licensing? That all components of the vaccine will be gifted from the supplier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey35jz?context=5)|3) We want the vaccine to be free to the end-user.
[4\) From 2000-2010, there are hundreds of articles describing HIV-specific T cell responses in general and immune responses mounted by HIV controllers in particular. How is your approach distinct from and superior to these studies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey35jz?context=5)|4) We are developing a vaccine that will be able to make essentially anyone a controller by creating killer T cell clones that will attach HIV at the same points favored by the controllers.  Thanks for your questions!
[3\) Couldn't the same claim be made for anything whose delivery to end-users is completely subsidized by someone else (e.g., I want to build a ""free cell phone"", but it is only free if someone else pays for it\)? Can you also comment on licensing? Are all the components of the vaccine free-to-use and manufacture by anyone, including generics manufacturers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3yza?context=5)|3) Yes.  We hold the IP and will make sure all licenses are provided for free all the way for the end consumer.
[Wow, first AMA where I saw the author reply to the follow up questions.  Wow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey922f?context=5)|I try! :)
[Why are you forgoing NIH funding and focusing on crowdsourced funds? You realize this looks a little sketchy to the medical community?  Also, are you publishing anything soon in a peer-reviewed journal?  Edit: your website has some great design; I would just like a little more science.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0j5v?context=5)|HIV vaccine research, including that funded by NIH, has largely been based on neutralizing antibodies.  We are taking a different approach – we need to generate some human data to get funders like the NIH interested in our approach.
[I'd like to see some more published research before getting excited about this. Good luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0qxw?context=5)|Thank you for your support!  We've submitted our manuscript and data to Vaccine and we will link to the article as soon as its published.
[Flow Pharma is the inventor of the vaccine - they are a FOR PROFIT angel backed company. Why do they need crowdfunding?  What is your exact relationship with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1q06?context=5)|Hi opendomain, thanks for your question!  I am CEO of Flow Pharma, Inc and Immunity Project.  Immunity Project is a non profit initiative in partnership with Flow Pharma, Inc.
 |Yes, Flow Pharma is a for-profit company and we have developed all of the delivery technology for the Immunity Project HIV vaccine prototype.  While Flow Pharma is a for profit entity, our HIV vaccine is a 100% non profit project.  To facilitate this we setup a fiscal sponsorship arrangement with HIV/AIDS focused 501(c)3 Until There's A Cure.  What this means is that any funds that are donated to Until There's A Cure via our crowd funding campaign for the Immunity Project are then given to us to use solely on our HIV vaccine project.  And we must operate our project in a 100% non profit manner.  The reason we did this is because we wanted to partner with an existing, well regarded 501(c)3 vs. setting up our own, and we wanted to expedite our work (setting up a 501(c)3 takes a long time).  To be clear I am required to operate Immunity Project as a non profit in every way, and to distribute our vaccine worldwide for free.
 |We need crowd funding and donations because our project doesn't have a profit motive so we cannot finance it with venture or angel capital.  Our mission is to end HIV/AIDS and in order to do that we need to give our vaccine away to the world for free.  Please let us know if you have any other questions!
[Realistically, how close do you think you are to developing a working HIV vaccine that can be mass-produced on a workable scale, meaning cost and resources don't limit quantity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0jmg?context=5)|We are raising money currently for the final experiment before we approach the FDA. This experiment will help us see how close we are now to having a working vaccine.  We are designing the vaccine for manufacturability from the get-go.  We plan to use the same manufacturing process for large scale manufacturing by building more of the same spray-drying modules we use today. 
[Loved the idea so much I donated on the first day and shared on every possible social media available.  If everything else fails, you are at least revolutionizing medical research funding: you are the second non profit on YCombinator, and you're using crowdfunding. What do you think the future of medical research funding will be? Will these new methods (or other innovations\) be the main source of funding, in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey2ma8?context=5)|Hi rjtavares, thank you for your support!  We in the medical research community need to focus on solving problems.  There are millions of people living with HIV who could never afford any commercial medication.  Therefore why even both trying to charge?  Our hope is that Immunity Project serves as a model for other researchers with the same mission driven focus.  If there are any researchers who want to pursue a similar approach, we would be more then happy to help them in anyway we can!
[Follow-up question: I'm a big fan of Paul Graham and YCombinator, but their experience is far from this particular field. What do you think they can add to the project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey32zx?context=5)|Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit, Sam Altman and the entire team at Y Combinator have been absolutely incredible.  They have by far the best experience on how to build great organizations, and focus on whats important whether the goal for profit, or non profit, biotech or not.  Without their help we wouldn't have setup pledge.immunityproject.org!  We are honored to be a part of the Y Combinator W14 batch!
[Is this something that can be used on current HIV infections or is it solely a preventive measure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey150l?context=5)|Thank you for your question!  We need to test this but our vaccine may have the potential to be therapeutic.  The approach lends itself to that possibility but testing is required to confirm our hypothesis.
[Seeing as the cold chain poses a considerable obstacle to vaccine dispersal, is this vaccine stable at room temperature? I'd imagine distributing the vaccine in warmer climates (Africa, parts of Asia, etc.\) where continuous refrigeration may not be available would prove difficult otherwise. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3zwg?context=5)|Our vaccine is being designed in a nasal dosage formulation (as opposed to a needle injection)  This means it will be in powder format, inert at room temperature, and will require NO refrigeration at any time.  Pretty cool, huh?
[Do you take bitcoin donations? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey4dy7?context=5)|We certainly do!  [Link to www.immunityproject.org](http://www.immunityproject.org/bitcoin)
[Assume everything goes as planned and you are able to start distributing the vaccine worldwide. Are you concerned you'll meet the same resistance that the Polio Vaccine is meeting in the Middle East and Africa? And if so, what do you think can be done to avoid this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0llp?context=5)|Controllers have been followed for many years now and their ""immune system strategy"" keeps on working.  If we can successfully copy their approach, hopefully resistance will not be an issue!
[Why did you choose HIV/AIDS to cure.  Do you know anyone with AIDS personally?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1m2a?context=5)|I was an intern in medicine in San Francisco in 1986.  I had unusually good training in immunology for the time at Stanford where I actually got to use one of the first FACS machines (cell sorters) in Dr. Leonard Herzenberg's lab - now commonly used in immunology research.  Despite all this, we could do nothing to help any of the inpatients with a diagnosis of AIDS.  Although we don't routinely see young people among us dying of AIDS, the problem is extremely severe in places like Durban.  Immunity Project represents what I think is the best IT/Biotech collaboration in history.  This is a great opportunity for me to leverage my medical and computer science background to make a safe and effective HIV vaccine.
[As a microbiologist with infectious disease background: You guys are awesome. Take my money!  Question: What's a best- and (semi-, we don't want it just plain not ever working\)worst-case estimate of when this will be available 1\) In the western world and 2\) In sub-sahara Africa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0mfp?context=5)|We can begin testing in Sub Sahran Africa about 6 months after the US FDA clears our IND (due to the African regulatory authority review process). Phase I, II testing should be done by 2016 or early 2017 - may be possible to start Phase III in late 2016 or early-mid 2017.  Phase III could be completed in a high-infection rate place like Durban in two years.  Best case scenario for approval in the US would be probably 2019-2020.
[Have any companies tried to stop you guys yet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey2rbg?context=5)|With all of your guys help and support, no one can stop us!  Thank you for helping us make Immunity Project happen!
[Good afternoon, Doctor! Thank you so much for coming to reddit.  I just one simple question. Do you have any thoughts on string cheese as a snack food? Do you enjoy it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0iny?context=5)|My kids love the stuff and send me to the fridge hourly to gat it (we buy the really large packs from Costco) - I often grab one for myself!!
[I'm curious, what are the estimated monetary and time costs to develop the vaccine? I understand these would be very loose numbers. Just generally curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1nsv?context=5)|We need less than $500K to finish this experiment, $25MM to complete Phase I (if we really squeeze the buffalo off of the nickel!) and another $20MM to complete Phase II.  Phase III will require an order of magnitude more funding to complete.
[But if you get to phase III, won't the Gates Foundation back you up to a certain degree, making the funding a non-issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey75tl?context=5)|Absolutely.  Once we get to Phase I, foundations such as the Gates Foundation will come into play.  They've already expressed interest, but want to see initial Phase I Human trial data first.
[*Controllers have detectable levels of HIV virus in their blood. Therefore, we don’t know if we can prevent transmission.*  I don't want to sound callous when I say this, because I really want to see a cure for HIV. But if controllers can infect others with HIV and never get AIDS themselves, aren't they the most ""dangerous"" of infected individuals? By creating a treatment that creates more of them, is there the risk that HIV might spread even more: even though you might relieve suffering of some, not everyone might be able to afford or get access to your treatment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey58xx?context=5)|It's a really good question!  Controllers are born with some (small) number of T-Cells pre-programmed to hit an epitope critical to preventing the evolution to AIDS.  I want to see if our vaccine can set up a more ""potent"" immune response resulting in more T-Cells going after targets. We now know that an HAART blood level in an HIV negative person can prevent HIV transmission (to them).  Maybe a fast, robust T-Cell response to an acute infection would do the same thing.  We won't know without clinical data.
[Has this been tested on any humans yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey16jw?context=5)|Hey riveroaken! We have performed an ex-vivo test with human blood.  The experiment we are crowd funding right now will test the vaccine in human blood in an external environment (humanized mice).  We aim to test in live humans this year during our Phase I Human Clinical Trials.
[Thanks for the response. Do you see any big pharmaceuticals jumping on board to fund?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1o56?context=5)|Not at this time.  It may be difficult for Big Pharma to get their arms around a non-profit effort like this - but maybe not!
[When/if this reaches FDA approval who will this be targeted to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey2lt8?context=5)|Our goal is the end of HIV/AIDS so we want to reach everyone starting with those at highest risk for HIV infection worldwide!
[How close are you to a cure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey1a5h?context=5)|Our vaccine is being designed to upgrade your immune system to give you the same power as HIV Controllers.  There is a possibility the vaccine will also function similarly to a ""cure"", acting therapeutic for those already infected with HIV.  Thank you for your support!
[Quite possibly the greatest thing i've read all year if true. How close are you to ""creating"" it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey0jjm?context=5)|If we achieve our funding goals for the Phase I clinical trial (separate from the experiment we are raising money for now) we can be testing in humans this year!
[Reid, how many mice are you planning on infected? Are you planning on doing a series of infections or just one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey105d?context=5)|Hi Surf_Science, thank you for your question!  Our plan is less then 50.  We are vaccinating the mice, taking the blood out and then infecting the CD4 cells.
[Do you think this approach can be used for developing other drugs useful for mankind in the future ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey36ds?context=5)|Absolutely!!  We are solely focused on HIV at the moment, but are very excited to explore this in the future.  
[Do other scientists/researchers believe you will succeed? How will it be decided who gets it, if it's free how will it be paid for (I'm assuming the crowd funding is for the research?\) Last one isn't a question but a good luck, I hope it works out message instead.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3kp0?context=5)|We are getting tons of great support from the scientific research community.  We are targeting anyone and everyone for the vaccine, but may start in regions with the highest infection rates.  It will be paid for by everyone who wants to see the end of HIV/AIDS.
[Who or what is your biggest influence in regards to your career path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3mpm?context=5)|My father, who said ""the greatest opportunity occurs at the interface between two disciplines"" which is why he became a doctor and lawyer focused on patient safety.
[This may sound like a stupid question, but how do you even know this will work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey6vbr?context=5)|Not a stupid question!  We think it will work because we are trying to copy the immune system behavior of HIV controllers - individuals who get the HIV virus infection but who do not progress to AIDS.  
[Fair enough. Will it cure the virus completely and make people immune or put it into a state of remission for those who have it already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey7b2x?context=5)|We are hoping that people living with HIV who also have a healthy immune system (e.g. people on HAART meds with normal CD4 counts) will benefit from a vaccination with our vaccine - ideally be able to stop taking HAARTs.  No way to know this without careful clinical testing.
[What happens if the vaccine is unsuccessful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey4780?context=5)|We are designing the vaccine to be as safe as possible.  We are tuning the formulation using animal models to have the best shot at getting an immune response in Phase I.  I have a lot of confidence in the target selection - hence a lot of confidence in success as we go forward!
[You all are brilliant... Serious question... Can I get your autographs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3mcq?context=5)|This is the first time someone has asked for our autographs.  Crossing this off the bucket list!  Yes absolutely, please email us @ team@immunityproject.org!
[Do you fear that the whole idea of it being free could go wrong, like some big pharmaceutical company making a huge con and try to make profit from your vaccine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey34za?context=5)|Hi blocodents, thank you for your question!  We are fearless!  We are firmly committed to making our vaccine free no matter what curve balls are thrown our way.
[What's you favorite color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey26ut?context=5)|Green, obviously! The color of my scrubs!
[Are you gonna get to work on herpes and other viruses after HIV/AIDS is taken care of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey5pcd?context=5)|Great question!  Sure, if there are controllers for herpes or other diseases we may be able to help there as well.
[How are you today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3lsf?context=5)|Doing pretty well... really excited about the $150,000 we raised yesterday on pledge.immunityproject.org!  How are you doing?
[No too bad! How do you think the world will react when they hear this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey3oaj?context=5)|They'll probably ask for a Reddit AMA ;)
[Do you think, drug manufacturers/governments will give you a hassle or make your product harder to obtain in any part of the world for releasing an HIV immunity vaccine? and if they do, what could be a few good reasons why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey4r02?context=5)|No one has given us a hard time so far.  Maybe I'm eternally optimistic but I think we are in a big tent with a great technology and I would personally welcome anybody in who wants to help us!
[If you had the funding of one of the top US drug manufacturers, how would you change the way they run and what they do? (you don't have to answer this one to protect the innocent\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey4r02?context=5)|Making an safe and effective HIV vaccine is the Mount Everest of pharma development projects.  When we make some forward progress with human clinical testing maybe we'll get some interest from Big Pharma for the world's biggest Pharma give-away!

Our vaccine is being designed to guide Human CD8 killer T-Cells to attack HIV at the same targets favored by the controllers.  We are not providing a physical blockade to HIV entry as seen with CCR5.

[When you are finished with this vaccine how do you intend to mass produce it(price and actual production\).

If you would answer this i would be very greatful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey15pl?context=5)|We will manufacture Phase I and Phase II supplies.  We may also manufacture Phase III doses with our team.  We may look into partnerships for mass production.  We will be looking at our vaccine from the standpoint both prevention and possible benefits for persons living with HIV in our clinical studies.
[So how do you test the efficacy of your vaccine? Do you infect the subject somehow? My question is what happens if ones vaccine doesn't work and ends up with a lifelong disease?  I saw a vaccine a few months ago for HIV and had the same thought. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey6krb?context=5)|All vaccine studies (including our planned Phase III human clinical trial) basically rely on natural study designs where half the subjects receive the vaccine and the other half placebo.  The study volunteers are followed over time and the infection and complication rates compared between the two groups.  All participants are told that they may be in the control group (and that, if they are in the vaccine group that the vaccine may not work), and that they should take all precautions to prevent infection during the trial just as they were before.
[Great cause. One question: I keep seeing ""need more human data"" ... does this mean the test would be to give someone your vaccine, then inject them with HIV to see if it accepts the virus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey5g04?context=5)|No!!  We need to do natural studies by vaccinating large numbers of at-risk individuals and see over time if protection from the vaccine is better than control.
[How does your vaccine work?  CD4? CCR5? CXCR4? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey5i54?context=5)|We are copying the behavior of controllers by getting CD8 killer T Cells to attack at specific targets which force the virus to mutate into a state where it doesn't cause a progression to AIDS.  This is not related to CCR5 and is related to CD4 in the sense that we are trying to protect the immune system from attack by HIV.

Why not make it without a day limit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey6pgh?context=5)|I thought the month-long campaign would add a sense of urgency.  We also want to complete this experiment by mid-March so we can move faster with our FDA approval process.  Of course we'll always be accepting donations to fund our research further.

[How exaxtly is your approach different?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey8fzn?context=5)|The novel aspect of our approach is that we are developing a vaccine to direct killer T Cells to target the same epitopes favored by HIV controllers.  These epitopes were identified by Dave Heckerman at Microsoft Research who I met 20 years ago when we were both graduate students at Stanford.
[Howcome you and your ideas aren't competitive through those routes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey8fzn?context=5)|NIH funding has been directed largely toward neutralizing antibody HIV vaccine research.

We are trying to copy what controllers do.  They target specific (HLA restricted) epitopes such that, when HIV is attacked at those points, it is forced to mutate into what I would describe as a dormant state resulting in the host not progressing to AIDS.  Other approaches have presented the immune system with multiple targets (e.g. with whole dead virus) which have resulted in decoy targeting: hitting sites that the virus can easily mutate away from.  Our approach is only possible because of the work of David Heckerman who reverse engineered the controllers' biological processes, identifying the epitope targets they favor.
[What's the delivery technique for the epitopes, and how is it that you're able to synthesise this HLA-specific sites? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey5qk4?context=5)|We are using biodegradable PLGA microspheres (containing the epitopes) and adjuvants (MPLA and CpG).  We are getting are epitopes from an analysis of the HIV targets favored by HIV controllers.  By knowing the HLA types of the controllers we studied, we can understand the HLA restrictions on the epitopes.
[How close are you to completing this vaccine?

We are just trying to do some good science with alternative forms of funding.  We need to work on more visual explanations of what we are doing - thanks for the suggestion!
[Pardon my ignorance with the medicine and biology field, but is this vaccine to be *only* used on currently HIV positive humans?

It may only require one dose (we need to do human clinical studies to determine this).  You would NOT need to be HIV positive to get the vaccine.
[I just had one last question. Like I said, pardon my ignorance, but if you vaccinate someone who *didn't* have HIV originally, would that mean they *now* have HIV?  However, with it being a weaker virus than it originally is, the human body could now fight it off... with relative ease?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w29dx/we_are_creating_the_hivaids_vaccine_to_give_away/cey9w3g?context=5)|Our vaccine design has no live virus - a vaccination would NOT mean that you would now have HIV.

[Hi there! High school student here. Our class has been reading about HeLa cells, and I just wanted to know what type of cells do you use for testing!

* Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - I'm interested in joining and participating in two ""Special Interest Groups"" which are ""Build"" and ""Code"". In SIG Build they are working on a big monitor wall, CUDA Machine, and a Supercomputer. In SIG Code they are working on programming projects using Haskell.

* Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) - They haven't had their general body meeting yet but definitely something to do with robotics. 

* American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) - As far as I know they have a subgroup to do with electronics, as well as building and competing their own plane and rocket.

* Chicago Engineering Design Team - Design and build robots and compete with them. I think new guys get a starter kit and you go from there.

Does anyone know of any internships for CE or EngPhys majors that arent on indeed or found by googling? I want to put my name out everywhere possible because I'm desperate.  I will travel anywhere, but I'm located in Missouri.  Honestly, my dream town is Austin, but with only a 3.3 gpa, I don't know that I would get anything down there as of now.

From what I understand, the only reason RIM even exists is because of their higher encryption standards. This is a corporation that does many classified government contracts.

Graduated in November, had two internships under my belt (one was QA role at a financial firm, the other was C dev. I have done very well in school and have participated (with moderate success) in topcoder and other such 'competitions'. I would say I have very strong theoretical foundation in CS (algo, ds, etc.), but when it comes to actual development I am very weak.

I was able to obtain a role as an SDE at a very lucrative position, and I have been here a month now and I am still struggling very much, to the point of having made only minimal contributions. I was able to pass the interviews due to my solid knowledge of OO, algo, etc.. but when it comes to actual development I don't know how to implement these principles on larger projects and I dread going to work because I know I will just be banging my head for 8 hours, maybe contribute a minimal amount, and go home.

It is getting to the point where I am considering leaving this position and either going back to the military or finding other employment. I see how effective and intelligent my coworkers are (especially at SDE 3+) and I don't know how I will ever be able to measure up. I don't want to make this a career if my ceiling would be a pityful SDE2 or something.

On the other hand, I would hate to spend even more money on a laptop that I don't utilize to it's fullest. I will be starting graduate school in the Fall semester, but I can't imagine that I will absolutely need to run my heavier programs on a laptop since there will be labs, and my desktop. Not to mention, and I understand that it is not a big issue since you can buy a USB keypad, but I really love to have a 10-key numberpad.

So anyone who has shared a similar predicament, what was your opinion on the subject? Any advice, regrets, or suggestions?"
1w7jiz,3,2014-01-26,How do I gain experience?,Zennistrad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1w7jiz/how_do_i_gain_experience/,"Right now I'm in my junior year of college studying for by Bachelor's degree in computer science, which I plan to use for an eventual career in software development. I'm having a bit of a problem, however.

See, I've looked at job listings in my area require at least three years of experience. I've considered that I would need experience for a future job, but I have no idea how I'm supposed to go about getting it. 

I've considered internships, and I've applied to a few over the summer, but a single summer internship before graduating won't be anywhere near enough. What am I supposed to do when I graduate?"

There was an invisible management tag not set! I had configs properly set, but it still wasn't working... was ripping my hair out for hours. Thank you for the help -- I appreciate it a lot. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm setting up a sandbox on our network with two switches: a Cisco 3750 and an HP ProCurve 2520G. But I only have one wall socket, and I need both of them to be reachable on their own IP addresses for management. 

Obviously, I have to daisy chain on some level (I know this isn't a good practice). I could find another rj45 socket on the wall and use that, but I'm an intern and this is sort of a learning project, if you will (I'm working in a lab and need to learn how to manage these damn switches effectively). Frustrated and banging my head against the wall at this point. Anyway... 

Here's a little diagram of the physical setup: http://imgur.com/IkP4C3Y

They're both on the same subnet, and the HP should sit on x.x.x.28 and the Cisco on x.x.x.29.

How do I need to configure these? On the Cisco, obviously I want ge-0/1 to be a trunk. On the HP, don't I want both ports 1 &amp; 10 to be trunks too? 

I have no idea if I'm 100% on VLAN configs either... both of the VLANs where the management IP (.28 for HP &amp; .29 for Cisco) are enabled for trunk access mode. Shouldn't that be enough though? 

The HP was easy enough to set up, and I have access to it now... so port 10 is configured fine. But I'm not sure about port 1, since that goes to the Cisco and I'm unable to reach it.

On the Cisco side... it should be as simple assigning the IP address to the management VLAN (2), and enabling trunk mode on that port... correct?

Anyway... I'm way off track here and looking to get these guys set up so I can start testing some stuff. Any help is appreciated. I can post screen caps of the running configs for both, just let me know what section you need to see.

1w877z,6,2014-01-26,Importance of CS Vs. IST Degree?,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1w877z/importance_of_cs_vs_ist_degree/,"Title basically says it all. I'm currently 1 1/2 years into my CS degree. At the current rate however, I have another 3 years at LEAST. I've had an awesome software development internship for about 14 months know and I love it. My school now offers a IST (Information Science &amp; Technology) degree online. It's a new program that is also self-paced where you can take the assessments whenever your ready. This means I could finish my degree much sooner, and much cheaper! I'm just trying to weigh the difference between an IST &amp; CS degree. Does anybody have any advice?"
1w897i,9,2014-01-26,"A former employer giving false/contradictory testimony, a Claims deputy disregarding protocol, zero response on appeal; Unemployment legal advice please!",UnemployedNoBenefits,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1w897i/a_former_employer_giving_falsecontradictory/,"(Throwaway because former co-workers know me on here, potentially former employer as well)

~~I will try to keep this short~~ (*I failed, it's long as shit, my apologies*) but thorough. The company I used to work for was bought out last Summer, and the supervisor of my department (Content Management for a network of online retail stores) was the wife of the former owner/president. She assigned a lot of my work, was there to answer questions/offer correction, and managed the department. I had no previous experience in CM, or working in e-commerce at all, prior to that position (at the time of the buyout, I had worked there for 2 years), but had acquired the position because I demonstrated an ability to write creative and engaging product descriptions, as well as an eye for grammar and spelling in editing our site, mailers, and other posted material (of course, I am almost assuredly going to leave an error in here somewhere). Since it was a small company, prior to my employment, the owner's wife was the only person doing any type of CM, and that was only in her spare time because she was also head of art &amp; design, as well as a major part of customer advocacy and account management. I served as an extra pair of hands to do task-assigned work.

After the buyout, the owner and his wife left the company. The new owners did not bring in any new supervisor for our CM department, they worked off-site (their office is in another state and they made infrequent, short visits), and I was given no new job description or update to my job duties (despite several requests). As the months went along, I found more and more of the work that my supervisor previously handled (photographing new products, designing SEO campaigns for new product lines, and the overall management of the department) began to slide across my desk. I tried my best to keep up, but quickly realized that there was no additional help coming. I was not given a raise, a promotion, or any other clear expansion of my duties. 

As the workload increased, well beyond my skill and knowledge, I became concerned that I would not be able to meet their expectations; especially as we approached the holiday shopping season which, in the years previous, has been our busiest time of the year by leaps and bounds. I would send emails with questions (regarding how to do something, asking for clarification, etc) that would go unanswered for weeks, and usually never answered at all. 

In November, I requested a meeting with the new owners to express my concerns and seek a solution. The one owner expressed, both to me and our warehouse manager, that he felt bad for how 'neglectful' (his word) he had been of me during the transition. I told him that there were several aspects of my position, which had formerly been handled by my supervisor (a part owner of the company) that I was not qualified to do. Most specifically, this was in the photography side of things and in managing SEO campaigns. I had been attempting to fill the role of photographer (over 2 1/2 months I had taken photos of the same 12 products numerous times, sent them to the new owner's intern who was supposed to do the editing necessary to get them site-ready, only to be told they weren't good enough for various reasons, each time I would go back and try again but run into different criticisms. Meanwhile, those 12 items were listed without images, and not selling, on our site. I had been doing html and other classes on codeacademy.com, but was very much a beginner. And I had been working my way through an extremely large book on SEO (the only resource I had been given by my new employers), but again was very much a beginner as I had previously done specific and assigned tasks in that realm.

When I first started with the company, I had worked both in the Warehouse as a picker/packer and in the office for several months before transitioning into a full-time office position. During the November &amp; December months, I would return to a Warehouse-heavy workload because I had the experience, and our order volume would be so high. I set several records for fastest picker, most orders picked in a day, and accuracy during those times. During the rest of the year, I maintained an active connection to the warehouse as I was responsible for data-gathering on new products (dimensions, weights, materials used, care instructions, artist/maker) which required me to be an active part of the receiving process. The former owner had hired someone to handle the hands on, data collection so that I could spend more time on the CM side of things, but the new employee left shortly after and those responsibilities returned to me.

Given the expanding size of the company under new ownership (new owners also owned another e-commerce company and, in the 1st meeting in November (during which I was sick with the flu, and came in just to make it to the meeting; they were aware of my illness), suggested that I would be expected to handle Content Management for that company as well; products I had never worked with before and the company was located across the country) and the lack of a replacement in the supervisor role, I felt that the job was quickly expanding past my abilities, knowledge, and skill. I expressed this in our first meeting, and explained that not only was it an issue of know-how, but also time constraints; as I was still responsible for handling every new product that came through receiving to gather relevant physical data, still responsible for keeping the UPCs in our system up to date and scannable (they often changed as manufacturers made small changes/updates to their products), on top of editing mailers and promo emails for grammar/spelling, and writing product descriptions for new products as well as continuously updating older listings, improving meta keywords (previously only relevant for internal search functions as opposed to SEO, as far as my input was concerned), I did not feel that I would also have time to be the full time photographer and head of SEO campaigns for our whole company on top of another company in a market I had no experience in and on top of this all taking place during our busiest time of the year.

I felt that I could best and most consistently contribute to the company if I was working under someone with significant experience in the CM field, or along with a team of people who possessed the experience and skills that I did not, and offered my ability and experience in working in the warehouse as an alternative to the hiring &amp; training of temp workers for the holidays. This way I would still be able to do the CM work that I had previously been responsible for, but also be an asset in other areas. They were very dismissive of this and kept saying that I simply needed to be willing to learn these new roles. I expressed that I had been very willing to learn, reiterated the steps I had already been taken, but that I was concerned that there was not time enough to learn and master these skills in order to run the department on my own, especially during such a busy time, I also expressed my concern over the lack of responses to my emails regarding these new projects and the absence of a definitive and clear job description. The meeting ended with the one owner assuring me that they would be much more responsive and available to help and that they would draw up a clear-cut job description so we could re-address the issue on the same page.

I returned to work 2 days later to find that not a single email awaiting answers had been answered, the job description was 'still being worked on', and there were 60 new products awaiting photographs and needed to be taken care of ""ASAP so that they can sell during this holiday season"" (remember, the original 12 products had still not been properly/successfully photographed despite 7 prior attempts and exchanges with their intern who was to edit the photos). 

I emailed the new owners again, and in clear terms expressed that I felt many of these new duties exceeded my knowledge and skill (as they had previously been handled by the head of the department, a part owner of the company who had worked in the field for a decade+) and that, while I continued to utilize all assets provided and those I had provided on my own to learn these skills, that time did not allow me to learn, master, and cover these new duties during our busiest time of year, especially working alone. I stressed that I felt it was important for someone with experience to be running the department and offered, again, my abilities in the Warehouse as an option to make the fullest use of my time as I learned the ropes of this expanding position.

I received no response throughout the day, and when I logged on to a video conference call regarding the Content Management needs of their other company ( a previously scheduled call) I was kept on the line and not informed of any problem. 20 minutes prior to end of day, I was called and told that I was being let go because I didn't display enough enthusiasm and eagerness for my position, and that working in the warehouse was ""simply not an option for you"" despite the Warehouse Manager's previous request for my help, despite my stellar performance record in that area, and despite my offer to take a 20% pay cut to account for the change in duties.

This is so long. I apologize and I am so very grateful if you are still reading, believe it or not, I am summarizing quite a bit!

During my claims interview for unemployment, I explained this situation to the 'Claims Deputy' who stated twice that he ""did not know what 'content management' was, and did not understand what the field entailed"", to which I explained as best as possible. After giving my statement, I was told that he would call my employer and then bring me back on the line to hear their statement upon which time I would be allowed to present a rebuttal if necessary.

I was left on hold for approximately 15 minutes, upon which time he returned and informed me that an employee named Magda (their office secretary with whom I had only one previous interaction) had informed him that I was fired because I had insisted on being given the Warehouse Manager's position (completely false, the WH manager had actually been helping me write and proofread my emails to them regarding my concerns) and had refused to do my job (also untrue, as I did my job to the best of my ability up until the moment of the phone call). The Deputy asked me if I had a response, and I explained as I just did how false those statements were.

A week later I was denied my unemployment claim and the reason given was that I had ""refused to do my job, refused to take on duties that my employer had every right to expect of me given my field, and had refused all training"". I had never refused any training, and had told the deputy about the training I was involved in; I never refused to do my job; and I am confused as to how the same man who stated he did not know what my position was or entailed could then make the judgement that my employer had fair expectations of me in that position. The claim of me insisting upon the WH Manager's position was absent.

I filed my appeal within the allotted time period explaining all of this, and reminding them that I have the emails from my final week that show the concerns I did present and show that I never refused work or training.

4 weeks have passed since filing my appeal and I have heard no result. Any attempt to reach the office by phone (last attempt was calling all 3 available numbers, twice an hour from 11am-4pm) has been met with an automated message ""Thank you for calling the reemployment office, due to the high volume of calls we can not take your call at this time"". There are no phone tree options regarding appeal status, and the website directs you to a page with the 3 phone numbers that I had and guides you to call them for more information.

I don't know what to do. From my point of view, my former employer gave a provably false testimony, the claims deputy broke protocol, and yet I was still denied my initial claim and since filing a thorough appeal I haven't even been given a verdict. I don't even know how to take the next step or if there is a next step. I can't exactly afford to hire a lawyer (if I could, then getting my unemployment would probably not be as important) and I'm not even sure what the case would be or who I would pursue a case against. If anyone has any kind of advice or can point me in the right direction, I would be immeasurably grateful. I am located in the USA, NJ if relevant."

It's almost exclusively what I use as an intern... is this something that other folks are using? It's an odd tool (written in .NET, so it's pretty Windows-y), and okay for some things... but the overall amount of effort required to learn the tool and build automation routines seems to defeat the purpose of saving time.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! 

EDIT - (In case anyone else has a similar concern) I did get a good internship. I applied literally everywhere I saw an opening. Left my GPA out unless mentioned. The hard part is getting a call for an interview. Once you pass the resume screening, the GPA doesn't seem to matter as much (in most companies... in some it does, and in a tech giant I was made an offer that was later rescinded when they asked for my GPA) "

[Do you (still?\) believe in the integrity of the democratic process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezrq1t?context=5)|There are still some good members out there that want to work with others on either side of party lines and pass good legislation. However, because of the heavy lobbyist influence on the Hill this is the minority. I don't think the integrity of the democratic process can be restored without campaign finance reform.
[They tried campaign finance reform dozens of times. In the end, the complexity of the rules only served to shut out third parties to the process. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/ceztlbe?context=5)|There has to be a way to do it. I don't think they were ever really committed to making it work.
[How realistic is House of Cards? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezumtx?context=5)|Realistic in some aspects and unrealistic in others. Backdoor deals among politicians? Absolutely, thats the name of the game. A whole lot of shady sexual shenanigans? You betcha. People getting murdered? Not so much. Or hey, maybe I was just far too low on the totem pole to know about that...
[What are your thoughts on the recent government shutdown? Is congress really as inept as the media is portraying? What is a typical day like? Thanks for doing the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezrvhh?context=5)|It was f'n ridiculous but I wasn't at all surprised. They are pretty inept - especially on the House side. It doesn't take much at all to get elected as a member of the House these days and it shows - I was shocked at some of the ignorance I saw on a daily basis. I think gerrymandering is partly to blame - and this whole craze of electing 'joe plumber' with zero experience in government.
 |Hm, typical day varies - for me, in session, it was getting in around 8 30 am along with other women in the office. The male staffers would show up around 9 15 - 9 30. The kid whose parents contributed to the member's campaign would show up around 10 or 10 30. Our chief of staff, who knows when. Tons of answering calls, listening to constituents vent, calming the crazies, writing letters or legislation, meetings, committee hearings, trying to find the member, trying to get the member to show up to meetings on time, having a heart attack trying to get the member his/her speaking points on time, dealing w/ asshole colleagues, etc. Non-stop craziness until 6 or 7 pm. Eating lunch at your desk if you're lucky.
 |Now compare that to when we are out of session - you have next to nothing to do all day. Staffers would go to two hour lunches. Yogurt breaks. Coffee breaks. Anything to fill the time. Summertime is basically a paid vacation for everyone on the Hill.
[Sometimes when I get down about my job I like to walk through the tunnels over to the House side and watch the staffers frantically run through the corridors. It reminds me that things could always be worse. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf035d7?context=5)|Yes, enjoy the privileged life on the other side of the tunnel. Must be nice.
[Do you think that with the recent negative press they are worried about reelection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezscc0?context=5)|Probably. But they are *always* worried about reelection.
[How much of an impact does letter writing and calling our reps actually have?  Is it a waste of our time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf04hu5?context=5)|A lot of the time it can be - but sometimes, in crucial moments, it does make an important impact, which is why we as constituents should continue to voice our opinions to reps. Calls that come in from constituents right before a vote needs to be made on a bill or amendment are particularly persuasive - if a member is going to vote for a bill but all of a sudden gets a large number of calls from his district telling him not to (and none in support), he is going to perk up &amp; take more consideration on his vote. I would say large, mass letter writing campaigns - where constituents send in the same sample text of a letter with just their name added on - are not effective at all. However, personal and well-thought out letters and phone calls can make a member potentially change his or her opinion and I've seen this firsthand. The member of course does not read letters personally or answer constituent calls, that is the staff - but staffers can and do bring calls or letters to the member's attention if they feel they are important.
[By campaign finance reform, would you continue to make it illegal for someone like Dinesh D'Souza to funnel money to the campaign of a no name candidate? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezscxd?context=5)|Yes, any campaign contributions that are made under falsified names and reports should be illegal.
[What do you think of groups like Wolf-PAC and others who seek to amend the constitution or find other avenues to get private money out of the electoral process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezt9ir?context=5)|I'm very supportive of groups like Wolf-PAC and their goals. Unfortunately, I don't think private money will be out of the electoral process unless we amend the constitution to ensure it stays out. As someone who witnessed the lobbyist influence on a day-to-day basis for over three years, I can safely say nothing less than a constitutional amendment would keep these people from polluting the process.
[So how influential do you think oil and gas money is when it comes to investigating things like the contamination of wells from fracking? Is there any other explanation for why the EPA flipped on their decision regarding the safety of the water in Dimock, PA? When it comes to environmental issues, can science stand up to money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezti0u?context=5)|I think the oil industry is one of the largest and most influential lobbying groups out there - from my perception, they are up there with the pharmaceutical industry and AIPAC as the monster-size lobbyists. I worked on environmental issues so the oil industry was always a pain in my neck - even working for a liberal leaning democrat, i had to make my case time and time again for the member to support science-based env't policies. I think science can stand up to money but it is like David and Goliath. You are definitely the little guy in the fight and everyone expects you to lose...hell you probably will. But you have to come at it 100x harder with the hope you'll win one day.
 |Sidenote - was a lot going on with the keystone pipeline when I was in congress, a lot of dems even supported it...including the White House. I was pretty disgusted, given the clear scientific evidence for the env't impact of the project. But that just clarified to me how influential the oil  lobby truly is.
[I've seen you mention a few times in this AMA about campaign fiancé reform. From what you have seen or heard, is it pretty much just a bribe? Do you think we actually have a functioning democracy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezvr5u?context=5)|We may not have a great democracy but we have a functioning one - the truth is we as citizens could change things if we were united in our aims and if we protested strongly enough. But we don't do that. I genuinely believe if enough people pressured their elected officials to support certain policies, you could effectively sway the power from the hands of the lobbyists to the hands of the people. But individuals are frustrated with our democracy (myself included) - for many legitimate reasons - and usually become apathetic. It is when apathy exists that an elite few can easily take hold over any democracy - and then of course you don't have the appearance of a functioning democracy. So in order to have one, we as citizens have to have a certain level of awareness and willingness to challenge the status quo.
[I was actually randomly compelled to post an AskReddit today for anyone near positions of power/influence/economics/war/etc. to reply with anything they think the public should know about the world that they probably don't with all of the information overload/static we're bombarded by.  So I'll ask you! From what you've experienced/learned, is there anything the public should know that most of us don't already? Is there anything we suspect but don't have first-hand confirmation? Is there anything the public has hope for that you know we're most likely fucked on? Feel free to speak on some of that.  It doesn't have to be specific (though specific is great!\), it can even just be perspectives on general outlooks/attitudes and how things really are versus how we might suspect/want them to be.  So... are we fucked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezx99c?context=5)|I think most are aware of the sad state of affairs in Congress, so not sure if there is anything I could enlighten the public on. But just to confirm, it is very much reality that politics have become more about survival - how to stay in office - as opposed to accomplishing anything of merit while actually *in* office. And a lot of members feel just as hopeless and frustrated with the situation as the public at-large are - I think many members do come into office genuinely wanting to make a difference, but unless they have backbones of steel, they become jaded fairly quickly. 
[Wait, so the whole thing really IS a clusterfuck?  I guess I'm not surprised. What a mess.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf076nq?context=5)|That's my take on the House at the moment. The Senate actually cranks out a lot of meaningful bipartisan work but then of course you face that challenge of getting it passed in the House. I don't even think Republican leadership in the House feel that have much power to do what they want - they are under immense pressure from the far right and face the fear of being outed by Tea Party candidates if they are seen working with dems or as not being sufficiently conservative. Nobody really wins in the current situation.
[If your opinion, has the Tea Party done more harm than good? Will it take a Democratic takeover of the Senate AND House before this mess we're in cleans up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf081xq?context=5)|Definitely more harm than good. And possibly, if Rs lose control of the House then they may shed this extreme wing of their party and become more moderate in order to regain control. One can hope at least.
[Why'd you leave The House? What are you doing now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezs0pq?context=5)|I had my feel for it and after 3 years I couldn't imagine myself there anymore. I also worked in a very male-dominated and passive aggressive office and it was starting to get to me...my mental health was probably at an all-time low during that job. And my office had never promoted any woman past a certain position so I knew I had to leave. I work at a non-profit now doing policy and love it - the working environment is a complete 180.
[Don't know if you'll get to see this, but if the head of the office was an overall good person, why wasn't the internal issues raised and the bad seeds brought out? I know it can be dodgy so I'm sure it just happened that no one brought it up to them but I'm curious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf0cc04?context=5)|My member had a very 'hands off' attitude towards staff disagreements or management issues. He/she did not want to get involved with any office drama or politics and chose to let our chief of staff and legislative director deal with these concerns. The problem was, however, that these two individuals were the main problem in the office, so as you can see it was never going to get resolved. Also members are generally quite close to the chief of staff and legislative director and 'trust' them more than other staff - they are more privy to any secrets the member may have or other information that isn't normally shared with the full staff. They have a closer bond and thats where our member's loyalty was.
[How old were you when you got the position and how did you manage to get it over others? I ask because I am about to graduate college and was thinking of doing some sort of internship soon, so any other advice is also greatly appreciated ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezrlx3?context=5)|I was 21 when I graduated college and moved to DC. I actually wanted to intern at a nonprofit and had no interest in the Hill - but my uncle actually knew a member's chief of staff quite well &amp; convinced me I should give Congress a try - which is how I got my starting internship in a House member's office. I then got hired by another office three months later as a 'staff assistant' aka staff ass - the 'beginning' position on the Hill so to speak. I knew their office was hiring one so I basically badgered them until they agreed to interview me.
 |So any connections you have to get your foot in the door will help tremendously - thats just the nature of the Hill. Or if you have worked/volunteered for a member in their district office back home - thats also a good stepping stone. I knew a lot of people that moved from the district office to DC.
[Ah that was what I figured, you had a family member who knew somebody. I feel like with politics ( and I suppose much in life \) this is a pivotal thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezrx5e?context=5)|Yeah its a shitty cliche but its true in my case. However, we had a lot of interns that came to us through college programs and the like or were referred by programs at their college - you may want to try that route? It is totally possible to get one w/o a connection but you may just have to be more persistent.
[Where'd you go to college? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezxo9c?context=5)|To a state school - could not afford to go out-of-state, let alone anywhere private.
[Have you (over\)heard any of the congressmen/women privately say things completely contrary to what they say in public? Especially their political or religious beliefs? *Especially* flip-floppers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezx9y6?context=5)|I've definitely been privy to conversations where a member has expressed that he or she actually agreed with a certain policy position but could not publicly admit to it or publicly had to take the opposing position because of their constituents' views. I imagine that happens fairly often. 
[Do you see marijuana legalization happening on a federal level within 3 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezsc17?context=5)|No, I don't sadly but there is a lot of support for it with some of the more liberal leaning members of Congress. Overall however, there are just too many conservative members on both sides of the aisle for this to happen so soon. I think we'd first have to have a lot more states passing de-criminalization or legalization and then have years to see the actual results from such laws before federal legislation could ever stand a chance.
 |There is this great guy on the Hill though - this marijuana cowboy character - who goes from office to office lobbying for legalization with a cowboy hat and a pot t-shirt. He'll probably keep at it if/until it happens.
[How would you work a Political Science Degree being fresh out of college?  What should be my first step to get into politics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezv7yv?context=5)|I would probably recommend getting your feet wet in politics by becoming involved in a political campaign at the local level first. I don't think there is any better crash course in the political process than campaign work, and unfortunately I did not have that type of experience prior to coming to DC...so it was a bit of a baptism by fire for me to start working on the Hill right away. I think getting involved in a campaign is your best bet for knowing whether or not you truly want to work in politics...and it will give you an edge on other applicants if you do decide to work for a politician.
[What was the stupidest thing you overheard there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf0akhs?context=5)|Probably when one senator continuously referred to Russia as the USSR or Soviet Union in one meeting. He seemed pretty blatantly unaware that the country hadn't been called that in over two decades.
[You mention crazy political gossip. Care to share any, without mentioning names/parties/districts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezy8ki?context=5)|There is one particular Congresswoman that is a monster to her staff. I'm talking calling staff at 2 a.m. in the morning and cursing them out kind of stuff. Throwing things at them. Publicly shaming them. She is especially vicious to female staffers, god knows why. Her staff turnover rate is sky high, not surprising.
 |There is a former committee chairman that sexually harasses any female staffer he comes into contact with just about. And this isn't some young gun - the man must be in his 70s at least.
 |I know about a few ongoing affairs between members and staffers, some that you wouldn't expect. At least one that resulted in a child that a member does not acknowledge. 
[Longworth, rayburn, or cannon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezuv1e?context=5)|I was in both cannon and longworth. But as for my fav, cannon definitely wins. 
[Rayburn wins with me just because they usually have better food in the cafeteria. Only problem is that it's so damn easy to get lost in that building.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf00jzb?context=5)|Its a g.d. labyrinth. 
[A. How did you get that job? What sort of qualifications do you need to do that? How important are connections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezvp5v?context=5)|A. I got the job by interviewing - I was already an intern in another member's office, and I knew another office that we regularly communicated with was hiring a staff assistant (which is an entry-level paid position). I gave their office my resume, had the office I was interning for recommend me for the position, and interviewed then with the office's chief of staff. The next day I was hired. I had no connections whatsoever to the office I was hired as a staff assistant for and that I would then subsequently work at for three years. I did have a connection for my internship. I think connections certainly help you get your foot in the door and oftentimes they are the reason individuals are hired. However, I also think gusto and determination can be equally effective. To work on the Hill, you need a college degree minimum. Some people may have masters or even higher - this is more likely in the Senate or if individuals are working on committees. I have seen people in very high positions who have no more than a B.A. and people in very low positions that have M.A.'s - so it really varies.
[B. How do you feel about Macklemore winning over K-Dot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezvp5v?context=5)|B. I may be showing my age by having no earthly idea who K-Dot is. 
[So if I want to get into this work would it be good to continue interning in my rep's DO for the next couple summers and then try to intern in DC and get a job off that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezw9v1?context=5)|Definitely, a lot of staff make the move from the DO to DC. I would continue to intern locally then try to intern in DC. Just being on the Hill will make you more aware of opportunities that arise for paid work. But DC is expensive and its difficult to live here without a paid job, so thats something to consider as well. I also knew a lot of staffers that worked as paid staff in the DO then came to DC. Thats also something to consider.
[K-Dot is Kendrick Lamar, who I, and many others including macklemore, think he deserved the best rap album grammy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezw9v1?context=5)|Got it! Well, I can agree Macklemore is overrated...and also slightly obnoxious.
[Oh hey!  Thanks for doing an AMA I am actually interested in!  I'm a campaign guy so I'm more interested in what your member did back home to bring in the bacon.  If you had to guess, how much $ did your member steer into their district? edit: like per year/cycle...Did you have to do any BRAC stuff?  Any good stories of governance/campaigns intersecting aside from the lobbyists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezvmcn?context=5)|There was a lot of money brought back to the district from what I heard and I know our office released press each year about bringing 'millions' back home pre-earmark reform - so I would say it was consistently about that amount but I couldn't give an exact number per year/per cycle as I did not oversee appropriations. Every approps process I know our Legislative Director tried to put any requests in that he could for district projects. And there was definitely BRAC stuff handled but as I didn't work on defense issues I didn't oversee that either. There probably are some good stories but going to bed now - and will try to post any that come to mind tomorrow :)
[In your opinion, who is the dumbest member of the House? Personally, I think Gohmert is scraping the bottom of the barrel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezz65r?context=5)|Gohmert is pretty intellectually challenged - as is Steve King. It would have to be a tie between those two in my book. 
[What type of hats do you like to wear?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezxcvr?context=5)|Pillbox - I like to keep it classy.
[I'm always curious/dumbfounded - how does someone as dumb as Gohmert become a judge? (that's what he did before getting elected to congress\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf08bo9?context=5)|Well local politics are a whole other can of worms...
[How often did you actually meet, see, or talk to the congressman you were working for?  I have friends who have worked in MP offices here in Canada that only met the guy they worked for all year a handful of times.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezw8fe?context=5)|I saw and spoke to my member every single time they were in the office, so about several times each day, 5 days a week when we were in session. In addition to just seeing them daily, I also spoke with them often when staffing them for briefings and whenever I staffed them for meetings with constituents and/or lobbyists. We also had a weekly meeting with the member and all staff. (Using them here to keep the gender neutral). I can't speak for every Congressional office but ours was fairly informal and it was no big deal to talk to the member. I know in the Senate it is far less frequent to see the member or in some cases even have the member know who you are. I can't imagine working for someone you rarely ever see, but I know it isn't out of the norm.
[Are staffers for tea party members as inept and misinformed as their bosses are?   Any good stories about this new ""class"" of politicians?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezx2z2?context=5)|I've definitely come across a few that have startled me with their ineptitude...i.e. despite working in the legislative branch they were still ignorant of how the whole 'legislative process' thing works. Something most of us got a handle on during our earlier years thanks to Schoolhouse Rock, how a bill becomes law, etc. And I regularly ran into one tea party staffer in particular that seemed to be intoxicated all the time - but perhaps she was just insane. In all fairness though, there are lots of inept and misinformed staffers so probably not fair to single out the tea party ones - although they can be quite special.
 |Hm, I had an intern yell 'you lie' to Rep. Joe Wilson when he saw him across the hall in an elevator once - lucky for him the elevator doors closed after he did so and he got away scotch free with that one. The most interesting thing concerning the tea party that I witnessed was the TP march on washington in 2009. I've never seen anything like it since - completely surreal. These people were the craziest s.o.b.'s to ever swarm the halls of the Congressional office buildings (and thats saying something) -  to look out your office window and see hundreds of them lined up outside shouting at you and holding their absurd signs and waiving their tiny american flags was something else. I greeted some into our office that came straight in, looked at a painting we had on the wall and remarked 'hm, thats a scary painting' - it was a self-portrait that an African-American student/constituent did for the Congressional art fair. I guess to them a black male was something they defined as scary. Classy.
[Did you know that most of the under 30 crowd in DC avoids you all at bars like the plague?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf01lqz?context=5)|Yes and I don't blame them - I avoid staffers too. That was true when I was one and now that I'm not one, even more so. 
[Ah, so they're like lawyers. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf0f537?context=5)|Ha, exactly.
[What was the congressional gridlock from your perspective?  Was it like a foregone conclusion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezupla?context=5)|Pretty much - gotta love spending weeks on end working on bills and amendments knowing they would likely never get past committee. Thats just a given in the current situation 99% of the time.
[It's hard to imagine the best and the brightest choosing to stay in that environment.  Which leaves ...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf09wyu?context=5)|There's usually an expiration date on any staffers' career. I wouldn't say those that choose to stay aren't the best and brightest, but I can't for the life of me understand why - not in this environment. Some are just very committed to their members and their jobs I suppose.
[Favorite item in the Longworth cafeteria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezwe8v?context=5)|Mines from the 112th - forgot to turn it in when I left! Hm, god, I tried to stick to the salad bar mostly, as the grease from nearly everything else could oftentimes be nausea-inducing. I did like the wraps though. And on rare occasions would treat myself to the BBQ - consistently good. I usually preferred the Rayburn Deli and the 'make your own' whatever at the Rayburn caf though.
[I'm guessing they changed the color scheme of the badges for the 2nd session of the 113th. I've never seen a peach colored badge. Then again, I haven't set foot on the Hill in a couple of months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezwe8v?context=5)|Also I saw mice in the Longworth cafeteria on several occasions...so I tried to steer clear when I could. But I guess mice are rampant in all the congressional office bldgs from what I've heard.
[My dad was involved a lot with the pro life caucus. What is the general opinion on those people among other staffers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf040h8?context=5)|Well there is no general opinion of any caucus among staffers as staffers' political views vary greatly. I know for the staff in our office, which was for a pretty liberal leaning Dem, any member focusing on pro-life policies weren't particularly popular. But I imagine they are pretty revered among conservative staffers.
[Hey thanks for the AMA! Quick question. Do you think something like a twitter sit-in has any chance of reaching members of congress? Or do they not even check/ care about their twitter accounts at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezz5er?context=5)|Sure! Hm, interesting question. While I highly doubt many members personally handle their own twitter accounts (though I could be wrong on that), I would have to think they would care if they were being bombarded with tweets from their constituents on a particular issue. The staff would notice and then relay to the member. This could be an effective way of raising attention around a certain issue - although our member was just beginning to have a twitter presence when I left the office, so my experience dealing with that medium as a staffer in a Congressional office is limited. I would have to thing they would care if they were being tweeted a large number of times if those messages were coming from their constituency - if they were coming from random people outside of the member's constituency, it is less likely it would make an impact.
[Cool, Thanks for the response! I agree that it is more likely that respond to their constituency, but my hopes are that if you get enough national attention behind a civic protest like this they will have to respond regardless.  Anyways I guess there is no way to really tell, unless someone tries. Have you ever heard of anyone trying something like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf03dxr?context=5)|I haven't but I imagine someone out there has done something in this realm before. And agree that you don't really know unless you try - and I think its definitely worth a try.
[Did you have any bad experience while working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf0bcgt?context=5)|Yes, quite a few but also a lot of positive experiences. Like any job it has its moments. My member was fortunately very nice to staff so there was never any time I felt disrespected by him/her. On the other hand, our chief of staff and other high level staff could be very insensitive, condescending and back-stabbing at times. There were quite a few meetings where I had to sit complacently while another staffer took complete credit for my work. And working on the Hill in general can be unpleasant some days just because of the type of people that work there - they can oftentimes be brash, rude, arrogant or self-obsessed. But plenty of upsides and don't regret working there at all - you have to take the bad with the good.
[What do you want to do next?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf05bhg?context=5)|I have worked in a non-profit doing policy work for about two years now. I would love to go back and school to get a master's - I feel it is necessary to move any further in my career. Most higher-level positions at non-profits, think tanks, etc. require a Master's.
[How did you/your Congressman deal with the press, if there was anything bad that came up? Do members of Congress hate talking to reporters as much as I feel like they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezxdp8?context=5)|Some members abhor talking to the press while others down right revel in it. It really depends on the member. But make no mistake, the ones that you constantly see as guests on Meet the Press, etc. are on there because they want to be - they live for that sh*t. Our member didn't mind talking to the press but also didn't seek it out. We mostly tried to steer the member away from the press, however, as he/she weren't the best public speaker.
[How did you get the iob? What is the best advice you can give someone hoping to get into politics/government? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezxgmq?context=5)|I answered this q above but I was interning already on the Hill and then interviewed in another office for a paid position. The best advice would be to try it out at the local level, preferably in a campaign, to get a solid grounding in politics and then consider working on a larger level. And to develop thick skin, the sooner the better, as there is a lot of ugliness in the political world.
[What's the most bizzare thing you've un-intentionally overheard as a staffer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cezxm7q?context=5)|If you want to hear some really bizarre things, I recommend shadowing interns when they give constituents tours of the Capitol - so many well-embellished 'facts' about the Capitol's history, it's pretty priceless.
 |As far as something I've un-intentionally overheard, I definitely overheard a fight between a member and a staffer where the member screamed and threw her phone at said staffer. They were at one side of a hallway and I was at the other. They didn't see me and I didn't intervene as I was just completely gob-smacked by it. 
[I don't have much to add other than I've worked in the city council of one of the most notorious cities in the United States.  I don't know how you did it.  All the other staffers were low paid and would knife you in the back in a minute.  I can't even imagine what Congress is like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w8y2t/iama_former_congressional_staffer_ama/cf04syo?context=5)|I don't know how I did it either. It was pretty harrowing some days and the pay was not high enough to justify the intensity of the job. However, I am grateful for the learning experience, and it certainly made me a lot tougher in the long-run. So there's that. Agree! I work in a non-profit now and can't even dream of going back to legislative work...don't miss it one tiny bit. Once you're done, you're done I guess. Sidenote - was it Chicago where you worked?

Two years ago a family member of mine stepped on my laptop screen. http://imgur.com/AZnJNvc
Despite always being extremely careful with my notebook, shit happens you know... Since then the solution to my problem was the big monitor i bought and hooked up to my notebook.

Well... In a few weeks im gonna do an internship in a country far far away and I need to bring my notebook with me. So I was wondering if you guys could help me finding a solution for the broken display.

I'm not really an expert when it comes to repairing things like this and I am just a poor student. 

This notebook is from ASUS. It's a K73SV-TY081V 17,3"" (1600x900) HD+ LED Backlight.

What I want is to buy a Notebook Display that can replace this one and have a friend of mine install it for me. 

So do you, computer geniuses, know somewhere I can get that screen?

Thank you so much! Eirreg from the Netherlands!

Edit: Just to make it clear, when it's all fixed and done. I'll come back to give reddit-gold to the one who provided the link I used to buy the display."
1w9xi9,2,2014-01-27,"Bachelors in Civil Engg, I want to get into Software/android development. Which of these options would be best?",sahildave1991,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1w9xi9/bachelors_in_civil_engg_i_want_to_get_into/,"Hi,

I've posted here earlier with some wonderful responses. Wall of text but please help.

.

Backstory:

I've completed my **Bachelors in Civil Engineering** (in **Summer 2013**) through one of the top 15 colleges in India. I did a project using Java for Building Sciences, did my research internship with Cygwin as platform and **got a job placement in a construction company** providing good salary and other perks. But due to the bad economy, they've delayed my joining to Summer of this year. So, with almost an year in hand, I went back to my **passion of programming** in Autumn of 2013 (~October). I revised Java, joined few courses on Coursera, etc. got in some Facebook groups and also started learning Data Structures &amp; Algorithm through resources advised in this sub. From the last two weeks I am in a dilemma. Not that I am not able to understand DS &amp; Algo, or finding it hard to learn Android, but I am starting to doubting myself. I have now layed out **3 broad options** which I think I can take in the coming future.

.

Options:

1. **The original plan was to master DS &amp; Algo and start applying for jobs in Feb**.  
I have almost completed DS and half of Algo through resources like nptel, Stanford Online, Algo by Sedgewick etc. I think I would need a month more to master everything. The hindrance was two major sickness I faced in the start of the month (1 week) and another I am facing right now (~1 week). The problem with this is I think I may get late for any job openings as companies tend to hire in Q1 of any year (?).

2. **If plan 1 fails, get in the software development as intern or rely on Google Play Store as Android developer.**  
In plan 1 I think of applying in both big ass companies like Amazon etc and also nation-wide companies. If this fails, I would like to keep on travelling the Android road and rely on Google Play Store by making apps. I have ideas for productive apps but I think this options doesnt generate that much money. I want to be independent so that when the company in which I got the placement calls me for job, I can tell my parents that I dont want to continue in civil, this is the major issue. 

3. **Go in for MS in Computer Science in Europe or US or Aus.**  
I have searched in many universities but almost everywhere ""Bachelors in CS"" was mentioned as the eligible criteria. Are there any other method that would help me get into a CS school. Moreover, would it be helpful?

.

""Follow your passion"" is easier said than done and in my case I have to convince my parents that I would throw a job in hand out of the window and follow something that is uncertain. I may not get a job, I may not get into a Masters college, I may land up in shit."
1wakz8,1,2014-01-27,Networking with people I have nothing in common with?,purple_orchids,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1wakz8/networking_with_people_i_have_nothing_in_common/,"So last semester I changed my major to business, specifically Energy Management. I'm taking 16 hours this semester and so far it's been going pretty well. 


However, the college I go to is overwhelmingly Greek. It seems like everyone around me has already formed into cliques based on their sorority/fraternity. I'm already a little socially awkward, so this is kindof becoming hellish. I decided not to join a sorority because it was just not something I wanted to do...at all, really. 

So yesterday I went to my major's student association meeting, which is really important because that's where students network, learn about internships, and what-not. I didn't have any friends to go with, so I felt pretty awkward because I didn't know anyone. Country music was playing also, which isn't my cup of tea.  When I sat down, I was surrounded by a few frat guys who were talking about how drunk they got last night, which I don't have a problem with, just kindof made it hard to strike up a convo.

I was just finding it a little hard to fit in, which has led me to think that maybe I should be in a different field? It's been hard for me to pick a direction in school.  Maybe I just decided to sit next to the slacker members of the group (there were like 200 people there)?
Has anyone experienced this and have any advice on what to do from here?"

Any tips? Thanks so much.  "
1wavou,2,2014-01-27,I about to make a life changing decision and I'm not sure what to do,10qw,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1wavou/i_about_to_make_a_life_changing_decision_and_im/,"I am about to face my fear of confrontation, especially with superiors, and tell my boss I do not want to follow the plan that I feel he has placed on me, but I'm not sure if I'm making a mistake.

So, here's a little bit of background about my situation. I was originally studying physics in university and enjoyed the program I was in. However, due to poor study habits mixed with anxiety my GPA wasn't in good shape and I was forced to withdraw. I ended up enrolling in a community college for computer engineering technology with the pursuit of fixing myself, increasing my GPA to be readmitted into university and to gain some engineering tech. related work experience during my time in college.

Fast forward 1 year and my GPA increased significantly, more than enough to be readmitted to university. I also managed to get a job at my college campus as a lab technician, which has become more of a burden rather than a benefit. My boss is an advocate for internships and I feel that he has created a plan for me to work full time for him over the summer causing me to delay my graduation (and potential readmission in to university) by one full year.

I feel that I have lost any input into this matter and that I feel that he is pushing me into this situation rather than allowing me to choose for myself which has made me even more depressed and unmotivated since withdrawing from university. I see the situation of me working under him an end to my life goals. However, I am conflicted because this can possibly be an opportunity that will allow me to become employable in the future.

The question is: Should I confront my boss and tell him how I feel and ultimately fulfilling my goals or miss out on an opportunity that could benefit me in the future "

[Hey Derek, it's your English Teacher!! I enjoyed seeing you live on SNL and I hear your music all the time on the radio.  When do you think you'll be back in South Florida for a concert? Ms Ditaranto ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07gm2?context=5)|Ms. D! So good to hear from you. Definitely planning to play in South Florida sometime this summer. Would love to have you out to a show sometime.
[Hi Alexis and Derek, can you guys settle a bet?  What the hell is the first line of Infinity Guitars?!  Every site has it as *deaf chords, dead ends*, but I swear to god, the second part is ""deaf **hens**"". I know that might not make as much sense, but that's what I hear every time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06php?context=5)|You are right! It's ""deaf chords, deaf hens, sling set can't meet the demands..."" Chickens with hearing loss.
[I...I think I just got trolled. I honestly can't tell because *that's what it sounds like!*  ¯\ (°_o\) /¯  So uh...it really *is* ""dead ends?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06wte?context=5)|No it's ""deaf hens"" for real! You were right.
[Are you ever watching tv and you hear one of your songs on a commercial and it's like ""wow that's me""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06qjl?context=5)|AK: It's definitely exciting. I think my mom get's the biggest kick out of it. She always texts me after she hears Rill Rill on the iphone commercial.
[Long time fan, I was wondering where are your A machines and where are your B machines at this present time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf075tj?context=5)|Could be anything but I'll stick to equipment...A) Hot pink Jackson USA Soloist from the custom shop (what up, Mike) and Teenage Engineering OP-1 synth. Great tools. As far as domestic products...I bought a blender and a juicer. 
[Hey Alexis and Derek!  I attended one of your shows about a year and a half ago in Boston and had a great time. I wanted to thank you guys for providing us with sweet music.  My question to you guys is have you ever considered adding a couple musicians to tour with you guys? I thought the one thing that would've made the show more awesome is if you guys had a live drummer. On some songs especially! Thanks!  PS... Are all of those Marshall full stacks actually turned on when you guys are playing live? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06pgj?context=5)|We added a live drummer. His name is Chris Maggio, he is a maniac. Come see us in the spring/summer!
[What is the inspiration for many of your lyrics and.  How has fame affected you Derek?  Thanks so much! She can't wait to see your reply! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06s3g?context=5)|Ms. D! Amazing she is the best tell her I said hi. We hope to play West Palm on this record. I'm terrible when it comes to explaining lyrics...they tend to be abstract, which is how I prefer it. I'm not really a famous guy, so I don't think it has affected me at all. I make records and play shows. I'm in love with music. Miss you, Ms. D. 
[One of my favorite episodes of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations was the Austin, TX episode featuring you guys (along w/ other great groups\)! Was Tony a chill dude to be around? Sleigh Bells + Anthony Bourdain = out of this world combo. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07heq?context=5)|My dad used to say Anthony seems like the type of guy you'd want to have a beer with...and that totally turned out to be the case! It's not an act, what you see is what you get. Great dude. Hope to run into him again some day. DM.
[What is your favourite girl-boy duo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf073lh?context=5)|AK: I love all of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell recordings. As far as contemporary duos I'm a big fan of Purity Ring.
[What do you guys think of M.I.A?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf070ds?context=5)|She is rad. We haven't spoken in a while but she gave us so much confidence in the beginning. Still a fan x DM.
[Hi guys, love the new album, and I saw you in DC a couple months ago and the show was absolutely killer! But I just wanted to ask how come you guys usually only play for like an hour? I feel like you left so much great material on the table!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf071pe?context=5)|AK: Thank you! We love playing the 9:30 Club. For now 60 minutes feels like a good set length for us. The more material we have the longer we'll play. You gotta remember when we started we were playing 25 minute sets so 60 mins feels like an eternity :)
[What is the record for how many Marshall Half Stacks Derek has used at a show?  There were around 8 the last time I saw you in concert in Dallas.  Edit: Related question: Will that badass leopard print robe from the Bitter Rivals video be for sale at shows? I must have it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf0706p?context=5)|I think I played with 27 cabinets in Copenhagen on the Treats tour. We called it ""aesthetic volume"" cause only half were in use!
[Hey Derek and Alexis.  Where would you say is the biggest inspiration for your varied sounds? When I first heard Treats, I felt like I hadn't heard anything else like it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf078vw?context=5)|Thanks! The band is maybe an attempt to reconcile the different sounds we grew up with and currently love. Genre has always been a non factor. 
[Massive fan, can someone acknowledge my presence so I can die happy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf074b7?context=5)|AK: Your presence has been acknowledged. But please don't die :)
[What song from Bitter Rivals are you planning to release as the second single/music video?  P.s. I'm a HUGE fan :\) You're one of my favorite bands ever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06q3o?context=5)|Thank you! Currently deciding/working on it.
[DEREK, what tattoos do you have??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06z0e?context=5)|They are all totally random. I got my chest tattooed first when I was 19 or 20...it's a hardcore lyric, surprise! I have the Challenger shuttle from the FL license plate, a diamond, Jaws, FL state outline. My good friend Jason Boyer, who played guitar with us, tattooed an eagle with a lightning bolt on me. They happen randomly. DM.
[Hey guys! First, Sleigh Bells is a go-to when my friends and i decide to have our ... ""dance"" parties. So, thanks for doing us a solid and providing sweet sounds for our bodies and minds!  My question is, i recently read that Lorde has cited you (Sleigh Bells\) as an influence to her music. Do you have any thoughts about that? What about her as an artist?  Also, if you could only eat one food for the rest of your life what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf073af?context=5)|Lorde is totally her own thing. Crazy amount of talent, really happy for her success and glad she is a fan. I love ""Royals"" like the rest of the planet...I have her record but haven't spent time with it yet. I'm working on news Bells music so I haven't been listening to much else. One food forever: Alexis likes bananas, I would go for chicken wings x DM.
[Hey guys! I've been a huge fan for a while! I'm so stoked you're doing an AMA! Anyways, how would you describe the direction the band is going in? All of your albums are distinctly different, but still amazing! Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06py1?context=5)|Can't give away too much at this point, but we have been writing for months. New stuff feels really, really good! 
[Alexis about two years ago at a show in Detroit my friends little brother asked you to prom and refuses to listen to your new album until you call him. Whats it like breaking a 16 year olds heart?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07b79?context=5)|AK: Wow I really am a terrible person aren't I. Damn. My bad.
[What was the inspiration behind creating a basketball jersey in the likeness of the Chicago Bulls? A play on words - Bulls/Bells? Anyhoo, I bought one. I love it. and I love your music! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07iwg?context=5)|I'm a Heat fan, but I'm also a massive Jordan fan. The Bulls/Bells thing just worked. Thank you for listening x DM.
[Will you marry me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf074ep?context=5)|AK: Haha very sweet but I'm going to have to say no. Dallas is always incredibly good to us. The Granada is one of our favorite venues.
[Going off of Reign of Terror, Bitter Rivals is much cheerier and poppier in comparison to the previous album. I know Derek was going through some very heavy stuff during Reign of Terror, which was the result of a much darker album. What kind of space was the band in during Bitter Rivals? Do you think light and upbeat will be the route the band takes going forward or can you see yourselves going back to something harder and darker like Reign of Terror? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf0785o?context=5)|New stuff feels different from the other three. I wouldn't call it light or up beat, no. Sorry to be vague. It feels really strong and affecting. I couldn't be more excited about it. Thanks for listening. DM.
[What's your favorite Pop-Tart flavor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06zp2?context=5)|Strawberry Frosted for sure!

[Have you considered letting fans vote on the setlist for an upcoming tour? Maybe not all the songs, but at least a portion of the show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf0772q?context=5)|AK: That's not a bad idea!
[Hey guys! So excited for your AMA! I have a question for Alexis: I've coveted your awesome hair/bangs since I saw them in the ""Rill Rill"" music video a few years ago. I've had bangs here and there since but never could get them to look quite like yours. What's your trick? Or are they just naturally incredible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf074lh?context=5)|AK: Thank you! I've had bangs my whole life so I'm pretty sure they are just permanently stuck in one position. A good flat iron helps too :)
[Which city on tour has the best food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf0787h?context=5)|AK: I absolutely love the food in SF. Austin is a close second.
[Oh shit! Just want to say I saw you guys at Big Day Out last year and you were by far the best performance of the day. You two are just too fucking cool. Can't wait to see you again at Firefly!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07498?context=5)|AK: Thank you so much! We love touring Australia. Currently my favorite song to belt out in the car is Beyonce's Drunk in Love. I'm a big fan of her new record.
[My question, what is your favorite song to belt out in the car while driving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07498?context=5)|Thank you! The Four Tops ""Baby I Need Your Loving"" or something by the German metal band Acme.
[Oops, i have a second question that i forgot to add earlier.  What advice do you have for a teenager hoping to eventually get a job in music management?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06ya6?context=5)|Our manager is actually sitting on the couch next to us right now. He says ""You got two fingers and laptop?!"" But seriously, an internship at a music management company or record label is good start for your high school/college years -- look on the Facebook page of bands you like for management contacts and email them!
[Can you tell us when and where you're touring again? Aside from the awesome festivals!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06syp?context=5)|We'll be doing dates around the festivals already announced -- more details to come in the next month or so.
[Oh man, I'm so pumped you're doing this. You guys are my favorite. I've been listening to Bitter Rivals on repeat since it came out. Anyway, I have two questions.  1\) In Reign of Terror, you included lyrics in the booklet that came with the CD. But I noticed there were no lyrics in the insert for Bitter Rivals. Was there a reason for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07lxk?context=5)|1) We decided not to publish lyrics for Bitter Rivals because we felt they were much more audible and decipherable than the lyrics for Reign. 2) My favorite cereal is called OH's. They are really hard to find. I grew up in New Jersey. Maybe they're a Northeast thing...
[Thank you guys so much for doing this. You're awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07lxk?context=5)|AK: Thank you for your support!
[Hey, are you guys touring the UK this year? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06rgg?context=5)|We're currently working on European dates in July, more soon.
[Hey Sleigh Babes - Do you feel like there is still a big divide when it comes to loving your music? Or do you feel with each progression of the records, people understand it more? I remember Derek saying in some interviews that people seem to have polar reactions to it.  Kerissa ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07nxj?context=5)|What up Kerissa we miss you! Three records in...I know enough to stay as far away from whatever conversation is happening around the band as possible. I'm human, when I read negative shit it frustrates me. I've learned to close my laptop and interact with whoever or whatever is right in front of me. It's a great way to live. Hope you are well x DM.
[Just want to say your albums help me a lot in the gym, and keep me motivated on the treadmill or whatever. You with some other bands helped me lose like 20lbs so far, so thanks! Also cant wait to see you in concert, you coming to LA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07jh3?context=5)|AK: Hell yeah! Congrats and glad we could help. We played LA in October so I'm not sure when we'll be back. Coachella?
[Hey Alexis and Derek! It's the twins from Chicago &lt;3 What was the reason to bring back To Hell With You from the EP? Did you find it difficult to rewrite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf077wu?context=5)|AK: Hi! Since we recorded the demo back in 2008 we were interested in reworking it and making it stronger. It came to us pretty quickly especially once we decided to speed it up. I'm super proud of how it turned out. Take care guys. Xoxo.
[Alexis, what is your favorite pop tart flavor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07iek?context=5)|AK: Wow this is proving to be quite a popular question. Strawberry Frosted for sure!
[Ryan Primack is a cutie. Will he be my prom date?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07b22?context=5)|Absolutely.
 |AK: You should come to a show and ask him. I'm sure he'd be down!
[Hi there guys! This question is for Alexis: have you felt any sort of pressure as a woman in the music industry? I mean, I figure that there is a lot of pressure in that area anyway, but are there more focuses on looks than you thought it might be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07fzj?context=5)|I feel as a woman in music you often have to work harder to prove yourself. Unfortunately people tend to obsess over your looks and not focus exclusively on your music. There is no doubt that women in music are perceived and judged differently than men. Women have to learn to rise about the pressure and not succumb to industry standards of beauty. Fortunately I think women in music have more freedom than ever to be who they want to be and not who some record executive thinks they should be. 
[Is there a meaning behind 96 power in Never Say Die? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07vye?context=5)|Miami's Power 96 circa early 90's was a big influence on me. Stole the title from The Goonies. Lyrically it's all over the place I think. I hadn't heard it in a while, but I listened recently and still really love it. Take care x DM.
[Hi guys! Any chance to see you in Moscow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06q5j?context=5)|We'd love to get there. No definite plans now but maybe sometime next year.
[Hey guys, saw you at the Union Transfer in Philly this past November. Beyond awesome. Wanted to see you guys play with Danny Brown in NY but couldn't make it up. How was it playing with Danny Brown? Did you guys chill after at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07u1m?context=5)|AK: It was a blast. His energy is insane and we were psyched to have him on board. We only got to hang out a bit. He's a wild man!
[PS - thanks for being a style icon of mine AK. Every time I talk about what style I'd like to have, I mention you. Except I rock the teacher-chic in my real life. Lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07cte?context=5)|I'm glad I have been able to inspire you. I have tremendous respect for teachers and I would love to find myself back in the classroom someday. No matter what anybody says teacher-chic is HOT!!
[Saw you open at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert a few years ago, you guys rocked it! How was touring with them? And how cool was Anthony Kiedis? Thanks for doing an AMA! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07hur?context=5)|AK: Awesome! We had an incredible time touring with them. They treated us like gold and were very gracious. Kiedis was great and Flea would often come hang out with us in our dressing room. He never put his bass guitar down! Those guys are so committed to their music, it's truly inspiring.
[Hey! Huge fan from the Philippines here! Love your music, especially Demons. How'd you come up with the name Sleigh Bells? And where exactly does inspiration for your music stem from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf07wpy?context=5)|Totally random/meaningless name. I used to write it on CDR's around 04/05 when I was recording music on my own. Originally it was ""Slay Bells"" but we went with the slightly less ridiculous ""Sleigh Bells"" and we are stuck with it. Thanks for the kind words x DM.
[I just wanted to say I love your music so much, been a fan since Treats was released. Would love to see you come back to the UK some time soon. Any plans for that to happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wandg/we_are_alexis_krauss_and_derek_miller_of_sleigh/cf06zp5?context=5)|Thank you! It's happening, working on it now. Look for dates in the next two or three months. We love coming over there x DM.
[I've been hoping to catch you at a show in Arizona since I first heard Treats, but I've missed you each time!  I've got a whole bunch of people wondering when you're coming back to our state. Is it on the tour for this year?

1wb49k,1,2014-01-27,Most important web development skills,killahbeeyall,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1wb49k/most_important_web_development_skills/,"I'm in my last semester of a Computer Science degree (not web-related per se) and I'm hoping to find work after school that allows me to travel. It seems as though my best options for a job like this are either to freelance or work with a company that allows me to be remote.

I really enjoy full-stack web development (although my design skills are not the greatest) and I would love to find a job where I could work in that capacity. My issue is that this kind of development includes such a huge amount of technologies that it seems like an insurmountable task to become an expert in all of them.

Through internships and my Honours project I've become familiar with a number of technologies like ASP.NET MVC and the [Mean](http://www.mean.io) stack but I would not call myself an expert in either. On top of this, there are so many other options like Rails and Wordpress that are in high demand that I've barely even touched on yet.

My question is: should I focus on becoming an expert in certain areas like NodeJS or should I keep expanding my repertoire of ""basic working knowledge"" technologies so that I can appeal to the most potential clients? Furthermore, if I focus on one area, like Node, should I stick to certain frameworks or should I try and master a bunch of them?

There just seems to be such an overwhelming amount of possibilities that I don't even know where to start."

I'm having some troubles deciding.  I have a potential offer from a startup (that has already received funding from venture capitalists if I'm informed correctly).  I met with the CEO today and he really liked me because I have two years of prior CS (self-taught python, VB.net, and some Go).  My family really wants me to go home this summer..  The start-up is where my school is (out-of-state).  I really like what these guys are doing, and I'm pretty sure they want me to come onboard and work with data-mining (which is what I want to do, in fact I have been working on it a bit in my free time). But I really don't want to hurt my families feelings, and I feel putting hours in on this project would definitely be something good (he [the ""CEO""] even asked me if I'd be able to work during the school year).  

I'm meeting up with the head developers this weekend.  He told me to go to my career fair, but keep his company in mind since he feels they're a better choice.  And I definitely feel I'd enjoy doing what I wish to do (data mining) instead of doing some low level job at an insurance company.  

Plus I have situational anxiety and often times it is brought up around my father since he likes to bully me often for being a ""computer nerd..."" but he is helping me off with college.

THUS:  how do I go about this nicely/ anecdotes of similar experiences are welcome!  I'm sorry for such a wall of text.

tl;dr:  Don't want to pass off what seems as a really good chance for an internship in a field I like but don't want to ruin relations with my parents.

Just to clarify I am a first year in college pursing a BS in Computer Science."

I apologize for adding yet another one of these threads, but it seems like a lot of people get extremely valuable help from them.  

Background:  I've been a freelance web designer for over 3 years now, and am back in school going for a computer science degree.  This is the first time I've created a resume for a job in the field.  I'm just looking for anything entry-level, or an internship as I'm new to programming.  I used the template from here: http://www.careercup.com/resume to get everything in place.  I may tweak it more depending on the advice here.  I have more work experience than what is listed, but none of it would be relevant.  In fact, most of my positions aren't even relevant.  I listed my education, but I left out any MOOC courses, is that a good idea?  

For the programming languages listed, I just put things that I know, and what I am currently learning.  Initially I had it broken down to ""Experienced"" and ""Familiar with.""  Should I keep it like it is?  From what I've seen in other threads, anything on the resume is fair game to ask questions about.

Any critique, harshness, tips, tricks, etc... are all welcome.  Here is the resume: [Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ru9sgy9iwrju225/Reddit%20Resume.png)

So a little bit about myself:

I'm about to graduate this December with a degree in Management Information Systems from a four year state College. The program is highly ranked and I feel it has granted me a decent readiness for the field through internships and a very technical course curriculum. In addition, It is treated as a business degree at my school so I have also had the business core (accounting, finance, econ, marketing, etc..).

Some of my skills: C++  C#  MySql  Java  asp.netMVC  and general project management/methodology

What types of wage ranges should I be looking at for particular geographical locations?  I'll have a fair amount of loans to pay off so a decent income is highly desired. I'm interested in both the fortune 500 stuff, and the little niche job where I can have a higher stake in the company off the bat. (Think ""Walmart"" vs ""Mom and Pop Software Consulting"")

My uni does a decent job of networking the students to potential careers for the southeastern US, but the further away you get, the bigger the names have to be before you can really network.

What should my strategy be?  and does anyone have any suggestions for where/how I should start looking?


I've made a Linkedin, but it seems like you have to pay for the service to really have the power to search deep into job listings.

Thank you for any tips you can provide me, big or small!

I'm enrolled in Business Technology Management as my major, as well as in the Co-op program associated with it.  The Co-op program incorporates 3 semesters of full time, fully paid internships into my studies.  These work terms will most likely be IT/MIS focused, carrying ""Business Analyst"" titles.   

From reading a few posts in this subreddit, I understand that the jump from IT consulting to management consulting is difficult to make.  It's not that I'm not interested in BTM, it's just that I am more interested in management/strategy consulting in the long run.

After finishing my bachelor's degree and working in one of these Business Analyst roles for a year or two, I want to get an MBA.

Long story short, if I want to get an MBA and pursue a career in management consulting, should I add a major in Management to my existing major in BTM?  It would have no effect on my Co-op program, just on the amount of time I spend on my bachelor's degree.

For example:

* Every time there is a group project, I vote for doing the bare minimum, and doing the easiest option. On the other hand my friends want to go above and beyond, and do more than what is required.

* Ever time I have to do assignments, I use the solution manual, while my friends do them on their own.

* A lot of my engineering peers join clubs and societies, but I don't want to do any of those because I want to spend my free time playing video games and watching movies.

* Even during my internship, I worked with another intern that always wanted to work and stayed late most days. But I always slacked off and just did the minimum amount of work my boss wanted.

After graduation I want an easy job without a lot responsibilities, and with decent pay.

&gt;I'm a pretty social person but I have no idea whatsoever how to make friends. If I meet someone new even if I get their phone number and say something like ""yeah we should hang out sometime"" I never call them to hang out because I have no idea what to do with them. I haven't made a new friend in a really long time, a lot of my friends from college/highschool have moved away or involved in their own lives/girlfriends, so I have no idea what to do. When I'm not at work, the gym or with my girlfriend I just sit at home because I don't know what else to do.

I'm pretty good at talking with people, I have a history of shyness but have really improved on it and now if I can talk with someone for like 5 minutes it usually goes away completely.  So that's not a problem for me.

The problem is that I just can't make friends.  Once I get someone's phone number I have no idea how to hang out with them.  I used to go out to the bars a lot but don't really do that anymore, due to financial reasons and because I have enough trouble waking up in the morning haha.  I spent all of last year studying for two huge tests which I did great on but absolutely annihilated my social life.

My life right now seems so busy.  I work full time, go to the gym 1.5 hrs 3x/wk, volunteer with a community organization and hang out with my girlfriend.  This is pretty much my entire life.  On weeknights after the gym, eating and showering it's like 7:30 already and I usually go to bed at around 10 so I feel like my day is already over.  On the other weeknights if I don't have anything planned, I usually just sit around with my girlfriend, take her dog on a walk or do errands or something.  On weekends I don't really do much, I feel like I'm always trying to catch up on stuff I couldn't get done over the week.  We spend a lot of time together on the weekends too, and we'll go out to a movie, walk the dog, get brunch with friends, sometimes go out at night to the bars.  I don't know.

I don't really have any interests right now to relate with other people.  I'm focused on doing well at work, working on securing an internship at a new company, working on getting to business school (but I don't even apply until the fall!).  I have a guitar, but I've had it for like 15 years and never was interested/committed enough to learn.  Same thing with a nice SLR camera and a motorcycle that I've been telling myself for the past year and a half I'm going to rebuild.  I was thinking about getting a piano because I've always wanted to learn to just play random stuff on it, but that's not really a social thing.  I guess the gym is a hobby but I hate going with other people.

It was so easy back when I went out to the bars.  Just call someone up and meet up with them at the bar and hang out and drink.  It was even easier in college of course.  I just have no idea what to do.  I can easily meet new people, but once I get their phone number or something how the hell do I build a friendship?  What am I supposed to call them up to do?

This is killing me.  I feel so anti-social and like my life is so boring.  On Facebook people post all about how they go out and do stuff: camping, vacations, etc. and I'm not doing anything with anyone.  Ugh"

[What do you think are the odds that we get any substantive policy plans tonight, and more importantly, what are the odds that any substantive policy plan that he lays out would get through Congress?  Along similar lines, what do you think he will say about the NSA &amp; FBI and what do you see happening there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0ytbp?context=5)|I am actually excited by the news that the president will sign an executive order lifting the minimum wage for federal contract workers. It only applies to new contracts, going forward, but it could potentially help 2 million workers, according to Demos.
[Hi Joan, let me be first to say thank you for doing this.  What are your thoughts on the President bypassing the constitution to pass his policies ""with a stroke of a pen""?  It is my belief that we have checks and balances in government for a reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf1011a?context=5)|Actually, executive orders are part of our system of government, and Obama has used them much more sparingly than other presidents. As of a year ago, he'd used them less than any president in 100 years. Reagan was a master of them. He is certainly not bypassing the constitution!
[For better or worse President Obama has been getting a reputation as unable to get any work done with Congress. For example, this morning NPR pointed out that only two of the dozens and dozens of topics the President asked for at last year's SOTU have been passed.  How much responsibility should the president bear in bringing his STOU initiatives to successful legislation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0z0x8?context=5)|I really think this president has tried to work with Congress, even on things progressives don't like -- such as his attempt at a Grand Bargain that might have cut Social Security and Medicare in exchange for tax hikes. I think Republicans from Mitch McConnell on down have been public about their desire to thwart him. So I don't blame him for getting so little through this past year. I just wish he'd gotten tougher, earlier.
[What do you think about ""Obama's"" persecution of the wealthiest Americans?New Holocaust? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0yyg2?context=5)|I find it amazing how thin-skinned so many one-percenters are!

[Hi Joan. What unique challenges would Hillary Clinton face as the first female president? And what do imagine Bill would do as the first FHOTUS. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf10pft?context=5)|I think the country has changed even since HRC ran the first time. Then, she apparently thought the high hurdle was being seen as ""commander in chief."" Unfortunately, that led her to emphasize her (real) hawkishness and even refuse to apologize for her AUMF vote, which led to her defeat. I think she will still face enormous sexism -- oh, hey Rand Paul! -- but I think the sensitivity to it, and the rapid-response capacity of social media, makes it different from 2008.
 |Bill Clinton as First Spouse. Wow. He should do an AMA seeking advice about that. I'm gonna leave it alone!
[Hi Joan - Thanks for coming onto Reddit!  Love your work, and I enjoy your appearances on MSNBC; you always have something great to contribute.  I'm starting to see Millennials get involved in the political process more and more; slowly but surely they are occupying positions at the local level (Scott Resnick in Madison WI comes to mind\) and they're also running for federal office (Sean Eldridge in NY-19\).  Will this be a more frequent trend in the near future, say after the midterms?  What do you think Millennials can bring to the table that might differentiate them from others in political office?  Keep up the awesome work! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0zgxy?context=5)|One of my worries about Millennials, particularly those who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, is that they'll become discouraged by the political process and the glacial pace of change. I think that's one actual deliberate intention of GOP obstruction: convince the emerging ""Obama coalition"" that voting makes no difference. So I love seeing this generation try to take on the system themselves.
[Hi Joan...Why won't the President call out Congress and/or Supreme Court for the damage they have done to the US? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0yyif?context=5)|Well, he's famous for critiquing Citizens United at a SOTU! I think he has criticized both, but traditionally SOTU isn't a place for Congress-bashing, although maybe it should be! 
[Hello Joan, welcome to reddit! What kind of access does the press get to these kinds of events? Do you get any face to face with the players or are you on the fringe? Any good snacks available?

Maybe some day!
[Thank you for a lovely answer. Do you miss the involvement of being editor-in-chief, or are you glad to be done with the accountability/responsibility? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf10uk7?context=5)|You know, I don't miss it. I think being followed by great EICs made it easier for me. I am grateful for the years I spent in management, but I feel like I did my time! Never say never, but I'm happy, right now, to be only in charge of myself (and my dog, sort of.)
[Do you think President Obama will address filibuster reform and judicial nominations? Especially now that the CBC is ramping up their criticism of his nominees?  Also, recommendations for an internship application?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0z827?context=5)|I don't think he will touch the CBC's criticism of his judicial nominees -- which IMHO is justified. He has picked very cautious, even conservative, judicial nominees, trying to get them past Republican obstruction, and folks are unhappy about them.

[Do you think the misogyny of the GOP will ever have any ramifications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0zcz6?context=5)|I think it's already having ramifications. Terry McAuliffe won the single-women's vote in VA Gov. race by something like 40 points. The gender gap is widening, and I wrote last week, Mike Huckabee didn't help: Will the last Republican woman turn out the lights?
[Joan, what are your thoughts about the president's past SOTUs?  it seems like for such a great Orator that he is, they all seem to have fallen flat, not to mention the fact that the recent ones have no teeth due to the congressional intransigence.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf10gne?context=5)|Someone tracked how he pivoted to deficits in 2010, way too early, and I agreed with that. I thought last year's was really good. But honestly, everything they are saying about learning their lessons of 2013, well, I would have thought they'd learned those lessons, at minimum, a year ago. I am encouraged by the talk about a new toughness but really, I thought I heard that last time around. So we'll see.
[Hi Joan, with the stroke of a pen, besides the federal minimum wage increase, what program / initiative / change would you like to see Obama do first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0zphe?context=5)|Well, he can't do it alone, but I would really like to see universal early childhood education. Also, I'd like to see him say: We are working with the states to figure out how to start building public universities again, instead of requiring that people become debtors to get a college education. 
[What do you recommend for a young reporter with a few years writing experience who wants to work full-time at somewhere like =cough cough= Salon.com?  This is not at all tailored to me at all.

It's for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0zjvo?context=5)|Well ""John,"" it's tough, but I think it's important to carve out a niche you love, communicate pleasantly but persistently with editors you respect and just be energetic about pitching ideas. We have hired people over the years who began as freelancers. Josh Eidelson, for instance, just kept pitching (and doing) great labor stories until we were able to carve out a beat for him (inequality generally, not just labor now). It's a tough time financially for all pubs, but that ""job"" didn't exist. So it happens!
[If you could sit down with any mayor who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0zx01?context=5)|What a great question. I think Atlanta's Kasim Reed is interesting. I got almost an hour with Bill De Blasio last summer because he was behind in the polls and not getting that much media attention (before Weiner imploded!) It would be fun to check back in again with him.
 |Who do you think I should sit down with?

[Marty Walsh.  He's taking the reins from Menino, who was mayor for twenty years.  That's a big legacy - and shadow - to work under.  You can talk about Walsh's vision for Boston's next 20 years, how he wants to differentiate himself from Menino, and your shared interest in surnames.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf106gz?context=5)|How did I forget Marty Walsh? I hope I am thinking of the right Marty Walsh, unlike Joe Biden! Boston is the only place I ever visit where people regularly tell me I have a great name, so I knew Marty was a shoo-in.
[What is Noras most embarrassing childhood moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf15jpv?context=5)|She had a perfect childhood that was embarrassment-free.
[There is the GOP caricature of Obama as anti-biz, deficit-growing, soft on terror, uncompromising when the opposite is true. Meanwhile, his approval ratings have plummeted to the negative side. Why do you think the President, the great speech maker, has been unable to convince non-Democrats of his accomplishments and unable to give lie to the GOP's talking points?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0zczy?context=5)|I missed this question earlier. I think it's an amazing communications failure, but it shows the GOP's power to drive the narrative. The stock market cruises to all time highs but he is still anti-business?
[Were you ever involved in student council as a kid because I'm the student council president of my school and I'm really interested in politics.  Btw.. Tell the president the president of discovery middle school says hi!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf13drg?context=5)|I was on student council my senior year in high school!
[Hello Joan, I hope the president is ready to tell the American people what he can and will do to address some critical issues using Executive Power i.e. raising minimum wages for FederalWorkers to name one.  What else can he do regarding gun control, immigratation, infracstructure, etc...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0z182?context=5)|You know, the federal contractors one is the big one. He's done a few already on gun control but I'm not sure there's much more there. On immigration, there are a lot of people who think he's still detaining/deporting, at his own administration's discretion, a whole lot of people -- but the criticism hasn't changed anything. I'm not sure what more he could do, alone, on infrastructure, let me think about that one.
[Thanks Joan Wouldn't it be great if after the announcement ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States,"" Pete Seeger's 'This Land Is Your Land' came up loud and clear under our applause for our President. I think Barack's smile would broaden w/ that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0z563?context=5)|I would truly love that. One of the high points of my life was seeing Seeger and Springsteen sing ""This Land Is Your Land"" at the 2009 Inauguration concert -- with all the verses!
[Would democrats object if some republican states dropped out of the federal system? That is they declared themselves as the home of self reliant, honest, hard working people. Implemented rules that restricted imports from China, immigration and required a balance budget.  Would democrats launch drone attacks against such states? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf10vvo?context=5)|Honestly, since red states get more from the federal government, in tax dollars, than they contribute, while blue states give more than they get, I don't really understand why it's red staters who so often talk about secession.
[If you put out a book named, 'What's Wrong With Black People? Finding Your Way In The Next America. How quickly would you lose your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wdktp/author_political_commentator_and_editor_at_large/cf0yuvl?context=5)|I get that question a lot. But never from folks who have read the book. The title has a lot of different meanings, but it does not bash white people. I'd love for you to read it and then we could talk.

I graduated with an M.S. in biomedical engineering in May 2012.  I had a job (converted from an internship to a full time position) at a small local company doing embedded software and systems control work, but I left that job to pursue a pet project of mine. Well long story short the patent fell through so I am now going back into job search mode. 

My problem is I feel I have a very broad skill set. My masters thesis was relating to in-vitro experiments where I used image analysis to quantify cellular adhesion (endothelial cells and WBCs/platelets) under various stimulated conditions. 

My only real engineering job I worked with python, C, and Matlab to develop an embedded control system to optimize the growth of cyanobacteria.  We also did electronic design work (with the help of a consulting firm) and I did quite a bit of 3D CAD using solid works to design sensor housings and system components. 

I have always wanted to work in the medical device industry developing new diagnostic techniques, but it seems all of these jobs require 5+ years experience in this industry. 

I feel my best skills are computer related yet I am not a programmer, I have a moderate understanding of python, C++, objective-C, and Matlab, but I would not say I am an expert at any programming language. 

Sorry for the wall of text but with this information can anyone make recommendations on where I should be applying? Also what are the best tools to use for finding engineering jobs? I am primarily trying linkedin but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"
1weigq,5,2014-01-28,[Help!]Problems communicating with the database,internRedShirt,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1weigq/helpproblems_communicating_with_the_database/,"**Bottom Line Up Front:** Several new workstations have a working connection to our database, verified that they can communicate through ODBC connection to our SQL Server. But for some reason when trying to use our company's in-house program that pulls info from the database itself, they are prompted with a logon window. Every username or password input into the logon fails. 

**Further Details:** The SQL Server hosted on a Windows Server 2003 server, and SQL Server 2008 R2, and I'm able to remote to the server from my workstations, adjust the permissions and add users/etcetera just fine, but when trying to communicate through our program I am prompted with a logon screen and none of the credentials work.

Other programs on these same computers can query from the Database just fine, but for this one particular program I am lost. None of the setting seems to be any different from other computers that still can communicate and connect without the logon prompt.

**Summary:** Would anyone have thoughts on which direction I should go to troubleshoot? I'm pretty much out of ideas. I understand that because it is an in-house program (written in visual basic, hah) that is kind of a frankenstein piece of work, specific instructions to my situation are impossible. But if you have any thoughts or ideas on things to troubleshoot please let me know. I am tapped out of all my resources/skill on this problem (I am an intern, and those resources are limited).

For clarity, I can query from the SQL database fine from every other in-house program, this particular program that cannot communicate has no unique settings that can really be changed, and is asking for a logon to the specific server, database, asking for a logon and password. When I create a new login name and password with specific permissions for this database, and input these new credentials into the prompt, it still cannot connect.

**Update 1** 
It does not appear to be related to the 32 bit/64 bit ODBC settings. But that's a cool one."

Currently in Calc 1 and Discrete and feel like I'm in over my head, especially when I look to future classes in the curriculum. Discrete seems fun, and I actually enjoy writing proofs so far and testing my logic and problem solving skills, but I'm clearly struggling with my math while everyone else obviously comes from a better background, private schools. I feel like I'd do much better in a more applied program where we spend most of our time coding and learning design practices.

I go to a small liberal arts school and get free tuition up to seven hours because I work here full time. But the CS dept is incredibly small while the business programs are really good, one of the top in our region. I'm thinking of switching to ISM which isn't so math heavy. But at the same time I worry about limiting my options in my career.

I work as a technician here, so I've got that plus grabbing an internship or two during the summers would look great on a resume. I've got three years or so left until I graduate.

I'm at a loss. I've been here five years (working), and I just want to move on. I want to make decent money doing something that I really enjoy. But I'm really not sure the best way for me personally to get there.

I'm a junior CS student in the northeast, currently deciding on internship opportunities for the coming summer. I've had one previous internship, which was last summer, at a Rails company. I definitely enjoyed it, and I'm open to the possibility of working with Rails after graduation, but it's certainly not the only thing I'm interested in.

At this point, I was offered an internship at a .NET company, company A. This would be new experience for me, as I don't have much professional experience with Microsoft technologies. However, I also think it's unlikely I'm interested in working with .NET as a career.

I have another opportunity at a different Rails company, company B, for the summer. My concern is, isn't it worthwhile to obtain as varied experience as possible before I graduate? I do not want to pigeon hole myself into any one area, and though I liked Rails development, there's certainly other areas I'm interested in exploring and working with. 

Is it foolish to work at a second Rails company, or foolish to work at a .NET company if I'm not that interested in working with .NET professionally? At the same time, these are concrete offers, and I'm only at the beginning stages of the interview process with other companies that use other technologies.

Really, I'm interested in working with newer technologies like Hadoop/MapReduce/NoSQL. But these things do change. I'm most interested in relocating to the Bay Area/L.A. after graduation, but it's harder logistically to intern there, though I am applying. I don't want to limit my career opportunities by becoming too concentrated in one area, or have a waste of a summer. 

Am I being completely foolish?"

I'm a high school student (self-taught with Stanfords CS106A and a 4 on the AP Computer Science test) that  is looking to find a strong and flexible programming platform. I'm looking for a platform *on Linux* that can handle graphics and isn't completely mired in specialty, one that's excessible. I've used Eclipse, but it's not very robust and you have to use LWJGL which isn't very appealing. I use IDLE and python and am very pleased with it, but it doesn't have any graphics capabilities and the only library I've found attempting at graphics, but it's not very common and extendable, so in general I use Python for more mathematical uses (projecteuler.net). Visual Basic looks appealing, but I'm not a big fan of C# (Visual Basic lol) and the Linux counterpart to Visual Basic (MonoDevelop) isn't well supported. In summary I'm looking for

* An interface friendly platform

* C++ or Python-based (C# and Java are okay too)

* Robust graphics support

* On Linux

I've also programmed quite a bit in Objective-C and XCode, but that's on the mobile phone side and only through my school (I don't have access to Macs at home).

Lastly, I'd like some general advice on how to get into Computer Science. Everyone says ""code, code, code"", posts a link to an online course or codeacademy, and then sets you on your way. I'm interested in AI and crypto especially, and am taking Crypto 1 on coursera.org and going through AI by Berkeley on edx.org, but luckily both these courses use Python for their programming assignments. As a Junior, I'm also looking into possible summer programs and internships, although that has been frustrating. Lastly, I participate in CTF's with my school hacking team (its a fun time) and doing some rudimentary work with that (using Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson). 

Any advice? Please point me to resources if you have them."
1wg2af,2,2014-01-29,Trying to dual-boot Fedora on on Macbook Pro,DeltaEks,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1wg2af/trying_to_dualboot_fedora_on_on_macbook_pro/,"I would like to be able to install Fedora on a partition on my Macbook Pro. I successfully partitioned an 80GB FAT32 section. After installing rEFInd, I tried the live CD option; but something went wrong during boot, possibly a hardware failure with my CD drive since it has been acting up lately. I instead tried the Live USB option, and that boots into fedora perfectly as long as basic graphics mode is enabled.

Now for my problem. I want to be able to install Fedora straight onto my Linux partition. However, the installer only recognizes my flash drive as compatible for installation. It doesn't even list the other hard drives. Me being a computer science major remembers what I learned during my internship working for IT and searched through the /dev directory and I notice there are a few drives titled sda1 through sda4.  I tried mounting these disks with the ""mount"" command and checking to see if the installer picked it up, but with no success. One time the installer mentioned it was probing disk, but it never resolved and I got impatient. When I run ""fdisk -l"" I only see that the partitions from my flash drive are listed.

How do I get the installer to recognize my partition on my root HD? Is it even possible?"

It's about two days after the last episode and not much has changed. Earnest is still working here, despite the heads-up I shouldn't have received. There's a loaded pistol under lock and key in a filing cabinet under my desk, in case Earnest gets violent. 

I realize that this may seem stupid, childish or paranoid, but at the time there was a recent workplace shooting that got my attention. Several people died after a disgruntled IT worker shot some of his co-workers. 

Anyhow, I've got the double-whammy of tech support- I've got a home visit and I'm on call for the entire support IT department. 

I've got to debug a problem for an employee who only works from home. Of course, the ticket is vague. 

'Need Support. Mac is broken'. 


A phone call to the user gains me no additional information other than the instruction to come to the back of the house. She doesn't have the patience to do any troubleshooting.
I let the help desk ticket assigner know that I'm unavailable for the two hours I'm expecting for this call. 

I pack my car with anything I may possibly need- spare G3 PowerBook, tools, ethernet cable, install disks and a current copy of the image.

I get to her house. Clearly I'm in the wrong specialty. Her house is big. Not like big house big, more like 'could be mistaken for a small warehouse' big. 

I wander around to the back. The user is there, on the phone. I wave to her. She ignores me for a few minutes while I cool my heels. 

Finally she deigns to let me in. She's still on the phone, but is waving me to another room, where a PowerBook G3 sits. I take a look at it. It seems to be opening apps and documents fine. There's no obvious Ethernet here, but there are valid modem settings. 

I wait a few minutes for her to finish her phone conversation. When she's done, I walk out to find her. I walk her back to the laptop.

me:""It seems to be working for me. What isn't it doing that you want it to do?""

User:""It doesn't work""

me:""What doesn't work?""

User:""The video doesn't work""

me:""The display works""

User, getting frustrated and reaching for a DVD case containing some kid's DVD:""No, it doesn't""

me:""The DVD doesn't play?""

User:""Yes!""

I look to the card slot- this particular PowerBook used a PCMCIA decoder card. Which is now missing. 

me:""Have you seen a small black metal card? About yay big"" (holding up my hands to show the size of the PC card)

User:""No""

me:""Did this laptop ever play DVDs?""

User, clearly annoyed:""No. As I said, it's broken""

me:""It's not broken. We didn't buy any of the DVD encoder cards"" 

User:""Well, order one to fix my computer"".

me:""Do you just want this so your kids can view Barney DVDs? I'll put in a request in with purchasing. Your supervisor has to OK the purchase"" 

User:""Just get it done.""

I throw my gear back into the car. I've spent an hour and a half to figure out that someone wants a corporate children's toy that I maintain.

I'm fuming until my phone rings. It's Neil. He wants to warn me about ""Something they found at my desk"".

Shit. I'm going to get fired for bringing a gun to work. I'm sweating. I drive back to work. 

I come back. Nobody's in my office. The filing cabinet is there and the pistol is still there. 

I hear a key in the lock. I quickly close the cabinet and push the lock in. 

Neil:""LT- you're in some trouble.""

Me:""What about?""

Neil:""check your email""

I pull my PowerBook out of my backpack and plug it into power and ethernet, then login to my mail.

There's an email to the entire Service IT department from Tran, the VP of IT.

To All IT staff:

It has come to our attention that some IT staff have constructed servers for the purpose of sharing music. This exposes $Company to lawsuit. Any such server must be shut down and erased IMMEDIATELY or termination will result.

Tran, VP of IT.

I had built a MP3 server from a spare 1 TB raid and a G3. I used my access to the backup server to copy any mp3s from the backups of servers and desktop machines that we backed up. I then gave access to various 'cool' users and IT staff. Within a month I had maybe 200GB of music. An intern was given the job of curating the collection. 

I look at my other email. I've got two additional emails from Tran- one telling Neil, the Windows admin and I to close Earnest out of all systems at noon tomorrow. 

There's another email from Tran:

LT- Can I have a login to the MP3 Server? Give me the weekend and shut it down Monday. Tran.

So my situation is this: I will be graduating in May with a double major in CS and mathematics up in Burlington, VT. I have not yet had an internship in CS, and frankly, I really haven't done a lot of CS work outside of school. It's not for lack of want, it's more I have less time than I'd like and other interests I actively pursue. This summer I'd like to get some of job, but an internship is okay. This is my question: having not had any experience with internships, would it be better to do at least one of those or just jump in and see what kind of jobs come my way?

I am frustrated because nothing in CS has particularly piqued my interest, so I'm really looking for a direction more than anything. The only thing that I've really enjoyed was working with database systems, I'm very organizational-minded.

I just constantly worry about not having enough experience and I know I can do good work and find something good, I just would like a little guidance is all.

tl;dr With no internship experience, should I get one of those or just go for a job? I don't think my chances of getting a job are super-good without any internship experience."

1wh7j6,1,2014-01-29,Probably got screwed over by incompetent HR employee - what to do?,NiGGoW,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1wh7j6/probably_got_screwed_over_by_incompetent_hr/,"Hi everyone,

I'm 25 years old, one semester away from graduating from a highly ranking Tech University in Germany and recently applied for a internship / traineeship at a Computer Magazine focused on Games in my home town. 

Knowing that they would get a TON of applications for the position I drilled deep - they were asking for 2 articles with about 3000 characters and a little motivational write-up. My application had 1 article with about 16000 characters and was built up like a big main front page story. Rather then just sending it in as a plain text I spent a lot of time to copy and rebuild pretty much every detail of the magazins design, layout, color scheme and overall feel. Same amount of time went into researching and writing the article. Not to toot my own horn too much, but the finished product looks legit like the real magazine.

I had it professionally printed and bound to a magazine, sent the whole thing in via certified mail (got there the next day) and started waiting. After 3 weeks I shoot the contact person an email to inquire if it arrived -&gt; no answer. A week later I call in about 3-4 times one day a couple of hours apart -&gt; nobody picks up. Couple days later I call in again and miraculously the lady picks up. I ask her if they had received my application and she says no, there is nobody on her list with my name and that she hasn't seen it plus the job is already taken by now and that the negative replies would go out today. I asked if she could check with the reviewer person if my app got in and she tells me she'll contact me via email same day -&gt; never happened. 

Now 2 weeks after that I receive my application back in the exact same way I packed it, with a standard negative reply dated 27th of January so 2 days ago while she said all negative replies would leave 2 weeks ago.

I feel like my application just got lost somewhere in the office and nobody ever took a look at it. Now that I inquired and she apparently found it after all this time, she's just covering her own ass by sending me a standard negative reply. 

The question is what to do now? I would love to work there, pretty much everything about the job is perfect for me and I don't want to mess things up for me in the long run with them. On the other hand I'm really pissed and very suspicious of the lady messing up with me being the one getting shafted. Should I try and contact someone else there or maybe ask her to tell me who the reviewer was and email him directly? Thanks guys!

TL;DR: 

* Sent out finely crafted application got no answer for a long time 

* after inquiry a highly incompetent HR person tells me they never received it + job already taken 

* two weeks later out of the blue I get my application plus negative reply back 

* HR person very suspicious, prob. just covering for her mistake

* what to do now to still get a chance for a job in the future?"

I have successfully obtained a second interview for a paid security internship at a large company. I am rather nervous because I have no idea what to expect.

Is there anything else I should brush up on? Also there is so many more people with a better technical understanding then I currently have, will this really hurt me?

Short intro about myself:
I graduated in June last as bachelor in applied computer sciences. During my internship and 6 months employment now I've been working in a Java EE context. Yet I want to move more to web development. And because Java isn't that fun for web development, and after looking at the job market, I decided to pick up PHP.  I looked at a few frameworks, and I realy liked Laravel from the start. Good quickstart, good documentation and easy to pick up.

I created my first project in PHP/Laravel. It's a basic CRUD app. It centers around ""Item"" objects. As I'm planning to move out of my parents home soon, this app will help me to keep an inventory of what I already have (furniture, kitchen equipment, ..).


I'm looking for feedback towards good practices mostly, regarding to Laravel, PHP or web development in general. The project can be found here:

[I saw you live in Boston twice, you guys were hilarious! I was wondering how you got an editing career? Did you go to quallege? I'm a year out and wondering how you made your transition from a nobody to a professional editor. Preach.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whj8d/im_doug_lussenhop_aka_dj_douggpound_editor_writer/cf1zwq6?context=5)|I went to quallege and it was pretty much a waste of money. I got a job as a wedding videographer in college and learned everything I needed to know at work. It should be easy to become a professional editor because they seem to be in demand.

I used to love it when he would throw stuff off buildings, and the stunts. His show seemed kind of punk rock. As far as the guests, I remember Charles Grodin really standing out. He would seem all pissed off about being on the show, I thought that was so funny. Look up some of his 80's Letterman appearances.

It's amazing the way that your editing choices allow events to appear incidental when they in fact bear weight or contribute in any number of ways to the arc of the story. How much of the final product is born from happenstance or spontaneous choices during editing versus calculated/deliberate choices? Surely you have a working method in practice, but does the final product more often surprise you or appear more or less like you planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whj8d/im_doug_lussenhop_aka_dj_douggpound_editor_writer/cf20sz0?context=5)|Hmm, a LOT happens in the edit. Most of it.

I asked him to do my [Big Fish](http://youtu.be/7rxElFqPs8Q) show once but he never did. Eventually, we did a show together and I think he liked what I was doing and we hit it off. We had lunch one day with Johnny Pemberton and came up with a premise for a video. The next day, we shot [Bean Bag](http://youtu.be/Zq2fuQZpfkY).
[After immersing yourself so heavily into the realm of absurdism, do you find it difficult to sit back and enjoy, say, an episode of some network sitcom? Some actors seem to straddle both worlds, but it seems like once you go far enough down the Poundhouse/Tim and Eric road, there's no turning back. Watcha think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whj8d/im_doug_lussenhop_aka_dj_douggpound_editor_writer/cf21rnk?context=5)|I never watch sitcoms but I'm a sucker for reality shows like Fast n' Loud. I like watching dudes build cars for some reason. Not even a car guy.
[Hey Doug, before I ask my question I just wanted to point out that we've met several times and have best friend potential. Probably one of my favorite memories together is the time we were lounging in Nevada City and we started talking about Boz Skaggs. Or that time at the first awesomecon where I asked if you could play ""a new you"" theme song but I dont think it was in the playlist. OOo, or that time I posted a video to your facebook wall a few years back, and you liked it? Theres a lot more where that came from best friend.  Of all the intense things you've edited (i.e eric andre finale and what not\), which scene has taken the most time to edit into its final appearance? Are there certain scenes that end up taking a lot longer to edit than intended to match what you're visualizing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whj8d/im_doug_lussenhop_aka_dj_douggpound_editor_writer/cf21qw7?context=5)|Pound House takes the longest because I'm editing myself and that is difficult.

It really is one of my favorite things to watch, and I'm glad it's back.  On Tim and Eric Nite Live, you won a contest where the prize was your own show. I like to think of Pound Pound House as that show you won.

1whzza,6,2014-01-29,This is my LinkedIn Summary. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1whzza/this_is_my_linkedin_summary_any_feedback_would_be/,"**Edit: New version at bottom**

""Considering the dynamic nature of our modern economy, I believe that a well-rounded education is extremely valuable. And in no sector is this truer than in energy, where a solid understanding of technology, economics and public policy are all critical to understanding the sectoral challenges and potential solutions.

That's why I have studied each of these issues in detail through my bachelor's and master's degree programs. With strong quantitative skills and a wide breadth of knowledge regarding innovation and the deployment of new technologies, I am seeking a career helping to shape the future of our global energy system. 

My professional experience includes 3+ years in analytical roles ranging from hands-on engineering functions to working alongside top US policymakers on science and technology policy issues. I am a skilled analyst with adept computer skills and a knack for translating convoluted data into actionable information. And as my history shows, I have a proven track record of working effectively in cross-functional teams to accomplish difficult goals under demanding time pressures. 

Furthermore, in an ever-shrinking world due to globalization and advancements in communication and transportation, I feel it is of utmost importance to espouse a global mindset on business and life. Through international experiences studying and living abroad in diverse regions of the world, I have amplified my cultural awareness and prepared myself for a global career.

If you're interested in learning more or talking about any of these topics, please do not hesitate to connect with me. I can also be reached by email at myemail@gmail.com.""

**New summary:**

""I am a multidisciplinary professional who is passionate about contributing to our world's energy solutions, seeking to advance my career in a role which requires strong quantitative skills as well as a solid understanding of economics and public policy. 

My professional experience includes 3+ years in versatile roles working on technical and non-technical issues in the energy sector. With a graduate degree in international science and technology policy and over a year of government and non-profit sector internship experience, I am knowledgeable about a range of economic, financial and policy issues regarding the deployment of renewable energy. 

With this knowledge, along with my ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams, I have accomplished difficult goals under demanding time pressures. For instance, while at the Think Tank, I led a team of 10+ professionals to publish a major report on climate finance and release it at the Policy Conference. 

Furthermore, with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and nearly two years of experience as a test engineer in the smart grid sector, I possess the hard technical skills needed to solve many difficult problems. Throughout my career, I have used my expert MS Excel skills to translate convoluted data into actionable information. While working as an engineer, this meant building functions in VBA to analyze binary data and identify software bugs. More recently, I utilized these skills to analyze economic data for that one NGO.

Armed with a unique skill set and a desire to effect positive change in our world, I am ready to contribute across functional lines and help develop the energy solutions of the 21st century.

Dear Hiring Whoever You Are,


My name is Rob and I will be the best employee you have ever had. I realize you have probably been told this as many times as I have been told not to use the first person “I” in a cover letter. Likewise to your reaction, I am inclined to ignore formalities. I have done a great deal of things you might call work experience with which I consider myself sufficient if not an expert in. If you are looking for a well rounded employee with significant firsthand knowledge in diverse skill sets including multimedia production, stage and set management, scheduling, broadcast media, project planning, live and studio board operation, lighting, sound, archive cataloging, performance rights management, marketing, product screening, guitar instruction, nonprofit business consultation, event production, wildlife management and conservation, music therapy, writing, editing, back end web design, social media development and optimization, exterior and interior home renovation and design,  and retail, with a Bachelors Degree and honors from a well recognized private liberal arts institution then look no further! If you made it through that list and are still reading then you are beginning to understand my frustration.


I have written a similar list, give or take relevant topics, twice a day for the past five months with the idea that experience was what mattered to employers. Can you even imagine where I would have gotten that idea? Additionally, in respect to the U.S. economy I have taken every offer, every volunteer opportunity, and every learning experience with the utmost professionalism and ethic. I worked multiple part time jobs simultaneously, was president of a club, and was a member of honors societies, all while averaging eighteen credits a semester and committing hours to outside internships and volunteer organizations. You know what? I feel great about it. I have such diverse social, economic, and business perspectives I cannot help but be youthfully eager to work eighty hour weeks guided by this American Dream I have heard so much about. This may sound like it is bordering on sarcastic, but I can assure you all I really want to do is work my ass off and have it appreciated. Unfortunately, none of your hiring practices are helping.


You want a professional resume and cover letter? Fine, read it. You want individuality, insight, and creativity? Fine, read this instead. I have wasted hours and hours writing cover letters and editing resumes only to submit them to the online trash bins you call employment pages. Applicants try to be honest and relevant, then all they get in return is an automated email thanking them for totally wasting their time. I consider myself among the intelligent, and demand to be treated as such. We know exactly what you are doing. I believe the social media acolytes whom you seem so desperate to hire would call it trolling. The magically overqualified person for the obscurely specific job posting which has been on your webpage for the past nine months is not coming. How about you hire a skilled young professional with potential and groom them into the exact employee you need? No, that would be too much work so there is no real need to even interview those people. That is what temp agencies are for anyway. 


Here is the deal. I understand the entire narrative behind why things are this way. I was raised by a family of international corporate executives and successful private business owners, who honestly never shut up about the socioeconomic forces driving industry development, and the adapting educational and governmental standards manipulating local and national business economies. What is the point? It really sucks to be in your mid to late twenties and severely overqualified to be making the ten to fifteen dollars an hour you need to try and have both auto, and health insurance. My demographic will do just about anything a manager tells them to remain employed so quit abusing that fact, and start using it to develop future business leaders lest we fall into the ever growing pit of despair which I have been warned our country is headed towards. 


My resume and contact information are available upon request as the automated rejection emails expressing your sincerest thanks and assurance that you will keep me on file have been marked as spam. If you really took the time to read this, I like you. I would love to grab coffee sometime and philosophically discuss agreeing and dissenting opinions on any range of subjects. Is that not what hiring is supposed to be about anyway? Sitting down with someone and using innate human instinct and nonverbal communication to assess their character? Well call me old fashioned but that is how I think it should be. I could spend two hours writing you a formal cover letter and resume, then an additional hour submitting it on your terrible website, or I could tell you about this in twenty minutes over a beverage of your choosing and use the rest of that time to address more concerning matters. 


I am willing to travel, and up for a discussing relocation if the price is right though most of my professional contacts are located in the Midwest, specifically Minnesota. If you think this has been disingenuous, excessively honest, or that I am just plain unemployable then please do not contact me as you have so thoughtfully done up until now. I can assure you we will not work well together. Granted my experience may sound excessive for my age, I can provide the references of many industry professionals, examples of previous projects, specifics on work history, and I am willing to put my skill sets and resourcefulness up against that of any other professional. I am willing to discuss any type of employment opportunity and will solely judge its merits based upon the potential, creativity, and integrity with which it is presented in person. Unlike Corporate America, I believe this is the correct way by which to gauge people, employees, and partners.



With sincerest gratitude for reading the previous in its entirety,


RoB

[I have a theory that difficult and unforgiving early MMOs were only successful because they were the only ones of their kind. Now that the market is flooded and fragmented with instant-gratification solothons, gamers have been conditioned to be less patient concerning MMOs and players who grew up on harder MMOs don't have the kind of time to dedicate to an unforgiving game, how do you plan on obtaining a large playerbase?  What aspects of an MMO do you find make it most immersive and feel like a world rather than a game? Do you plan on doing so with Pantheon? How?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23kuh?context=5)|&gt; treestick: While we're making a challenging game, but you won't need to grind or camp or do a dungeon for hours on end. Most of Pantheon is designed to be played in 1-2 hour increments.
 |Immersive to me is an open world, grouping with others, a massive world to explore, and very different zones.  Memorable encounters, barely surviving combat and talking about it later with my friends.  A true sense of accomplishment.  I could go on and on :)
[Is there a chance for an alternate rule server that will have more of a grind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23uut?context=5)|If the demand is there, sure.
[Hi Brad! Will there be a Necro Class???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23oas?context=5)|We will be revealing details about our pet class soon(tm).
[Hi Brad - The griffin quest in Vanguard is probably my favorite MMO experience. It took months to complete, had solo components and group components, and the reward was awesome. So I have 2 questions for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23ppj?context=5)|Yes, in fact our focus on quests will be the epic style ones. The game is not filled with quest hubs and a bunch of tasks to do.
[1\) Will Pantheon feature epic quests a la Vanguard's griffin quest? 2\) Will Pantheon have flying mounts? There's no better way to explore a large immersive world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23ppj?context=5)|Flying mounts, if we do them, would come after launch as part of an expansion.

[*The game is not filled with quest hubs and a bunch of tasks to do.*  Best thing anyone has said ever. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24qgg?context=5)|Yeah, we went that way with Vanguard, but now, looking back, we prefer the EQ 1 style quests over the lots of little mini-quests.
[Will there be a large amount of gear to, find, earn, loot? What I love about mmorpg's is beeing unique and having gear that almost noone else has, especially at endgame.

Loot earned from overcoming challenges is a big part of the sense of accomplishment we want our players to feel.
[Speaking of beeing unique. How far do you think you will go in creating unique classes? Will they be more unique than Vanguard? And will you shun the Rift system where you can ''hotswap'' between talent trees, which really killed the immersiveness and roles.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24cpz?context=5)|Vanguard classes and EQ 1 classes have a big influence on our class definitions.

[Hail, Aradune-  One of the pledge rewards is a very early access to the game as a tester.   Can you provide an estimate as to how early that would be?  1year from now?  2 years from now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23sis?context=5)|We are looking at a three year development cycle, with the last year also being the beta test, broken up into phases.  Alpha would be before that, but I can't go into timeframes on alpha now -- too early to say.
[Hi Brad, I'm a big MMO gamer and followed the development of Vanguard pretty closely. My question is... a lot of the promises you're making and designs you're talking about we've heard you pitch before (with Vanguard\). Ultimately, they never came to fruition. The issues with Sigil have been well documented, but what is going to be different this time? Why should we believe that you'll be able to come through now where you didn't before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23rbk?context=5)|I don't think we are promising nearly the features we did with Vanguard (which was a mistake -- announcing features that didn't make it into the game).
 |I've learned a LOT about myself and MMO development thru the Vanguard 5 years of development. 
[Hi Brad, how hands on with Vanguard were you? There were a lot of rumors that you'd left the team (for various reasons\) part way through development. Are there any truth to those? For those of us considering donating money to the kickstarter, how can we be sure that won't happen again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23x4z?context=5)|I let the stress of the regime change at Microsoft, where the team we were working with left, and the new team assigned to us didn't really want to do an MMO.  So we left MSFT and got help from SOE and I was on the road a lot talking to investors.
 |I know myself a lot better now and with my experience and others' experiences, we're setting things up a lot better and smarter this time around.
[Do you foresee an issue with lag with a large raid force? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24aky?context=5)|It could happen and would hopefully happen in beta so we can address it through any number of means (client optimization, server optimization, game mechanics, etc.)
[Brad - a problem with many MMO is the world doesn't matter, the gear doesn't matter and the lore doesn't matter. How will you make the world matter again, thus creating a place for gamers to play for years to come? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23yv1?context=5)|It's an open world.  There will be a lot of lore to be found that impacts quests and the like.  Gear will not be obsoleted quickly -- you'll be able to take pride in your gear.  You will need different types of gear relative to different climates (we call it the situational items).  And anything and everything else we can do to make this more of a home than a game.
[Does that mean armor dyes with more than 1 or 2 colors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24ltu?context=5)|It means likely no dyes at all.  What you wear is what people will see.  A high level player walking into town deserves to be gawked at.  We want players to go, ""wow, look at that guy!  i want to be that powerful one day"".  That said, there will be more ornamental or cosmetic items that you can wear, say in a city or village, to express yourself.  Their stats will likely suck though, so when you leave the city you'll want to put a different Outfit on.

[Two questions: 1\) can we expect corpse run? I dont know why but i miss it 2\) some backers postet a video of the possibilities of weather effects of the unity engine .

That said, I think we're going to make it :)
[You can also do pledges on your website to get some initial funding were KS to fail. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24ad4?context=5)|Yes, but our focus is on KS right now.  Please help us out and pledge.
[Why would a professional investor fund you if your kickstarter fails?  A failed kickstarter is proof that there is no product-market fit, so why would a professional investor risk their capital to fund a failed campaign?  Have you ever raised seed/institutional funding?  How long do you think your $800,000 in kickstarter funding (should you reach it\) will last you in a cycle of development?  Then what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24kx0?context=5)|The amount you raise and the number of people who pledged is what is important to investors, even if we didn't make the $800k (and I think we will).  It would buy us plenty of time to reach out to investors, publishers.  It would allow us to continue building the game and have more tangible assets to show off, etc.
[What one thing that you learned from working on Vanguard do you want to bring over to Pantheon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23qn8?context=5)|I know myself so much better now and how to handle stress.  I let the issues with Vanguard towards the end of the project really get to me -- I was in a dark place.  But I've learned a lot about myself and will do better with Pantheon.
 |How to build a team based not solely on their skills or experience, but also on whether they work well in a team environment.
[Brad,  As someone who began playing EverQuest in 1999, you were the reason I got into game design and production, eventually getting a bachelor's in game design.  Norrath was a world one could become incredibly immersed in and passionate about and Vanguard was spectacular.  I'm extremely excited to see you stretching your creative muscles once more, particularly with those like Tony Garcia and Noel Walling. Are there plans to expand the team or take on interns?  If so, where would one apply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf248jd?context=5)|Right now we're looking at veteran MMO developers -- if we want to get the game out in 3 years, we're going to need them.  That said, new blood can be a good thing too.  If you'd like, shoot me a resume at aradune@hotmail.com.
[Hi Brad.  A few other old-school MMOs are being reimagined (CU, SotA\), but with some twists.  What will you be keeping from EQ and VG and what will be changed/removed?  Also, a 3 year development time seems quite ambitious compared to the normal 5+ years.  Is this due to the modularity of Unity and it's community of developers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23rm5?context=5)|Lots of great stuff from EQ &amp; VG, plus some modern mechanics and features as well -- too many to list now.
 |I don't think a 3 year cycle is unrealistic.  The scope of the game is smaller, the team is lean and mean, Unity allows rapid development, and EQ 1 took 3 years and ~23 people to launch under my management.
[Brad! Very happy to see that the Brotherhood system will be in Pantheon. What other features are planned in Pantheon to generate that old school feeling of Community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23o6j?context=5)|Groups, guilds, lots of mechanics to help people find each other and get together.  Offline travel (Caravan system).  
[Will spellcasters have reagents and fun spells like in old EQ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23rk5?context=5)|Yes on the reagents and fun spells.

[Why are you raising capital through public funding (kickstarter\) rather than professional investors (Angel or Venture\)?  Is the reason to keep a higher ownership percentage of your studio rather than being diluted early?  Have you tried pitching these professional investors and what did they tell you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf2494g?context=5)|Kickstarter funding gives us more freedom and allows us to hear from all of you and make the game with your input.

[Brad: Tim here from Marginal Boundaries. Great to know that the Brotherhood system will be in Pantheon. Loved that from Vanguard (was Thanon Rockguard, leader of the Haven guild in beta for 18 months and on the Florendyl server for live\).  One of my biggest loves was the combat system in Vanguard: the individual combos, but also the triggered sympathetics that could happen within groups based upon whose abilities were triggering others within the group dynamic.  From what I've seen in your videos, you plan on having this type of complex system within Pantheon.  One thing I was really encouraged to hear last night during the live development video was regarding the classes like Monks, which were very unique and filled a very niche role within the groups, and how each niche class served a very unique purpose within the group dynamic and then the raid dynamic.  That being said, do you have an idea at this point in terms of how large you will be capping the raid force (12 players, 24 players, 32 players, etc.\), or will you be implementing scalable content that changes depending on the size of the group?  Also, will there be more complex sympathetics that grow in complexity depending on the size of the group? I.E. a 3-man chain that can expand to a 6 man chain that can expand to a 12 man, then 18 man and etc., for very large, massive debuffs or damage to mob bosses? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23t6k?context=5)|Yes on complex sympathetics.  Not positive on raid size yet -- what we want to do is have content for different raid sizes.
[Thanks for EQ. I never had so much fun playing a game. I still talk to a lot of the friends I made on it, even though I haven't played for over 5 years.  Qeynos or Freeport? When you look at how EQ has evolved over the years, are you happy with what Sony has done with it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24622?context=5)|Thanks!  I am happy and humbled that the game is still going on 15 years later.  I'm not going to criticize decisions though -- not my place to do that.
[Will camping for ultra rare loot make a return in Pantheon? Example: super low spawn/drop rates of things like Fungi Tunic, Ancient Cyclops Ring, Glowing Black Stone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24lvf?context=5)|Yes. We aren't ruling out a scenario where you can stop and pull mobs, waiting for a rare spawn.  Hopefully most of the content will be such that it is more efficient to travel around.  'Camps' may also move around or have different spawn locations.  Obtaining the Glowing Black Stone is a great example.  Quillmane is another great example. 
[Is the experience / leveling curve intended to be closer to EQ1 (circa Kunark\), or EQ2 (current\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23x0r?context=5)|We are actually looking at doing less levels, with more content and advancement per level.
[So, content aside, the level process itself will take longer then the levels were use to right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24814?context=5)|Yes, so there will be more content per level.  But there will be lots of ways to advance your character within a level... watching your skills go up, finding new spells and abilities, achievements, AAs, and more.

[$800k is a ridiculously low-sum for an ambitious MMO. I mean $4 MILLION was not enough on it's own to accomplish the non-MMO game Broken Age, the developers had to fund out-of-pocket to ship.

If for some reason only the minimal funding via Kickstarter is achieved, where will the additional necessary funding come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23vik?context=5)|More crowdsourcing, investors, publishers, etc.
[We're / Are you a Magic the Gathering player?  Does that or other non video/pc games influence you in regards to game mechanics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf245w1?context=5)|I am a HUGE M:TG player.  Some of the ideas behind the combat system and the essence system, where you find rare abilities and spells while out exploring were influenced by M:TG.  For example, an experienced M:TG player will have cards in his deck not just based on his deck theme, but also as answers to what the other player(s) might do.  Having 'answers' in Pantheon's combat will also be very important.
[Brad, one of the highlights of early Everquest was the community and having to interact with each other. With that said the EC tunnel for example was a HUGE part of helping with that, will we see something like this return, with real bartering and not everyone going afk to sell or auction housing items?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24eij?context=5)|Yes.  If we have auction houses, it is unlikely they will be global.  And if something emergent happens like the EC tunnel, then we'll likely place a local auction house there to make things easier for the players.  We don't want global, however, because we want a person to be able to take an item from one end of the world to the other and be able to sell it and make a profit.
[Are female characters going to be overly sexualized (made that word up\) in Pantheon?

I wouldn't assume at this point.  More on this later.
[Have you given any thoughts about separate regional monetary systems where different coins would need to be exchanged? If not, How about regional auction houses.

[So far the videos we have seen have been with placeholder graphics. When will you show off the ""good stuff""?  I did see Vu creating a dungeon and some terrain at Link to youtu.be and it looks amazing, but a coherent ""trailer"" using the new stuff would be awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf245pk?context=5)|At some point I would like to do another intro video, but it does take a lot of time and effort from the team (we're not video experts, we're mmo development experts).  So I can't say at this point whether there will be another intro video.  I can say that you'll see videos showing off new stuff, like Vu's dungeon.
[Do you have plans to implement anything close to what diplomacy was in Vanguard?  That was one of the most interesting things in any mmo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24z8o?context=5)|Not planned at the moment.

[Hard content or timesinks.  Looking back, the pain and reward to EQ was a lot of waiting for spawns.  What can be done to make a challenge fun? Also, the pre alpha gfx on the kickstart vid, understandable but scary.  With your relationship with SOE, do you think licensing an existing game engine like ForgeLight will speed you up and let you concentrate on the game instead of the tech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23s2f?context=5)|We're using Unity, which definitely speeds us up and allows for rapid development.  As for ForgeLight, I don't think SOE has the time to support third party developers right now -- all their efforts are on Landmark and EQN.

Any games that helped inspire Pantheon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24jx8?context=5)|Pantheon is a more focused game with a targeted audience. I can't speak to EQN's audience specifically, but it seems more broad.  I think both will co-exist just fine.
[Will there be a server for those that want a more traditional MMO experience without features such as mentoring, cross server play, and brotherhood system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23ueg?context=5)|Depends on how many servers we have.  I am a huge proponent of alternate ruleset servers (pvp, RP, hardcore, and more).  The more players we have the more we can do this sort of thing.
[Brad, are we going to be able to 'Hail' NPC's and PC's alike?  And will we be able to get drunk and have races through wood elf tree top cities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23yrd?context=5)|Yes, you can hail, especially NPCs if you want to find out if they have something worthwhile to say.
 |Drunkenness I would like to see, especially since we're using a robust physics engine and could do some hilarious things with it.
[Brad, firstly thank you for doing this, the 2 games I loved most in the MMO genre since I started playing them have been EQ and VG, and I've played a lot.  My question is, I know you're a supporter of multiple ruleset servers (me too\).. of any theoretical rulesets you could come up with what would you personally find the most fun/interesting and want to play on primarily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23vcz?context=5)|For me personally, I like RP servers.

What I will say, however, is unlike Vanguard at launch, Pantheon will be playable.  With Vanguard we got crazy into the latest tech and it hurt us bad.  The game was released early and unoptimized and we do NOT want to make that mistake again.
[What's the one thing that you could say that separates this game from other MMO's? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24628?context=5)|Challenging, open world, planar, group based exploration and combat.
[Brad, can you explain how Pantheon will be zoned. More specifically how the dungeons will work? Will dungeons be their own zones like EQ1? Or will they be built with in the outter world like VG?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf244ho?context=5)|That's a hard question to answer because we're not at the point yet where we have a huge zone and have populated it with mobs.  Until we get some metrics, I can't answer that yet.
[One of the things that made EQ immersive for me was the lack of fast travel and maps.  How will these be handled in Pantheon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24lr2?context=5)|By controlling fast travel, while still helping people find groups.  Likely limited in-game mapping, as you explore.  
[Brad - do you envision this game being as large geographically as EverQuest was at launch?  Thinking the Qeynos to Freeport run, the sheer breadth and distance between players, significant numbers of alternative zones to adventure in during specific levels.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf25uh4?context=5)|Absolutely.  I loved the daring run from Qeynos to Freeport!

[Barbarians (humans big brothers of the North\) will we have them in the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23qf5?context=5)|Not currently planned.
[Will items have min lvl req or something similar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23uww?context=5)|Probably not.  We're not keen on no-trade items either (unless they are quest components).  Now this means some mudflation, but we have some cool ideas on how to slow that down.
[Hail, Aradune/Brad!  How are you feelings about the way Sony/SOE handled EverQuest? Were you upset seeing the way things went with Luclin, and so forth?  P.S. pretty excited for Pantheon!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24kdw?context=5)|Not my place to critique SOE or any other developer.
[Can you tell us a bit more about what kind of information will be provided to Gamepedia to put on the wiki? I'd like to see lore, class/race and ability information there, but I would hate to see detailed walk-throughs of all of the content in the game (EQ2 as an example\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23rkw?context=5)|No spoilers will come from us.
[What kind of server setup can we expect.  What I mean by that is, will we have EQ1 or WoW type servers with a few thousand people on them or large EVE online servers with the entire population in one place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24stj?context=5)|Multiple servers ala EQ1, WoW, etc.
[When will we get to see some concept art for the races in the game?  I hope the ogres look like the original EQ ogres rather than the ones that came out with Shadows of Luclin. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24lo1?context=5)|I think we're doing one more environmental piece, and then moving to characters -- I will check with our art director.
[Aradune, will rangers get tracking eventually?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23x16?context=5)|Yes.
[Any chance that we'll get Rallos Zek/Sullon Zek/Discord types of rulesets in Pantheon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf243ip?context=5)|If we have enough servers I don't see why not.
[How much time have you personally put into the game at this stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23vqt?context=5)|My wife would say too much :)
 |The entire team works 10-12 hours a day, if not more.  We've got things turned up to 11, that's for sure.
[You've stated that Pantheon would be the ""spiritual successor"" to EQ1, but will be playable in 1 - 2 hour chunks.  Does this mean you will have a group queue system or something similar to avoid the ""lfg"" spam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24id1?context=5)|We will have elaborate and powerful features that support grouping.  More on this later.
[Will you implement a Data feed API so community can build great websites and apps such as Magelo profile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24xjj?context=5)|If we do, it would only be after people have obtained the item in-game, or mapped an area out themselves.  We know we can't stop spoilers, but we can also avoid making them too easy.
[This has greatly piqued my interest.  Perhaps this kind of news might generate more eyes on Pantheon? Who knows.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf2572b?context=5)|Yes!
[Are there plans to design the game world in such a way that there are good reasons to visit/hang out in a location even after you have outleveled the primary content there -- avoiding the ""theme park"" feel of modern MMOs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24187?context=5)|Yes.
[Brad, How will a player wanting to be a Cleric go about specializing as a Battle Cleric or  a Curate in Pantheon?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24gan?context=5)|One way is through finding Hero Essences that would give your cleric special abilities and spells, making him or her a bit different from other characters of the same class.
[This exactly.  I can still remember the names of everyone that was in a very tense almost wipe / CR in the Froglok King's Room in Guk.  Something that happened 13 years ago. 7 survived where 24 could not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24y71?context=5)|YES!
[This is the kind of magic that has been missing from the genre, please bring it back for us Brad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf25ckf?context=5)|Agree totally!
[No question. I just really wish I had more money/resources to help you realize this dream. Wishing you all the best of luck with the project! You have an incredible knack for this stuff.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23rvu?context=5)|Thank you!  No worries if you don't have the funds now -- help us out by spreading the word to your friends, former guildmates, etc.
[I've been thinking about this lately. How I would love for Common Tongue to just not exist at all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf251ik?context=5)|That would be something we'd probably do on an RP server.
[From the Kickstarter page.  Dual targeting--attack your target while healing your allies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf24xq2?context=5)|Yes, and possibly other ways to group players and mobs together.
[Indeed; if you check the video they did on the Rob and Dan show last night, they were talking about the niche classes and the roles they filled, like monks FD pulling for splits with the ranger tag-pulling (Ranger here in EQ1!\) and how they plan on using that with Pantheon. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23z5q?context=5)|Yes!
[Hi Brad would love to hear more about the dynamic weather system you plan to incorporate and the possible effects on characters as they adventure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf23yej?context=5)|We'd like to see things like Call Lightning.  We'd like to see some abilities or spells work differently depending on weather; some worse, some better.
[True or false : there is PR guy vetting your answers right now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1whvd2/i_am_brad_mcquaid_one_of_the_creators_of/cf240eq?context=5)|No, but teammates are on skype with me in case I need some detail about this or that.

[Any really bad moments you can share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27hxy?context=5)|Yeah I was in China and had been sent to another city on a job. After hair and makeup they asked me to strip off to just undies and no top. I was pretty upset because my booker had never told me there was any element of nudity on the job and the client should've told the booker that. The client has to pay a much higher rate if there is any element of nudity so I got the translator to get my booker on the phone and talk to the client about either paying me more for the time I was basically nude or I wouldn't do it. Sounds petty but I felt like I was being taken advantage of and was feeling really uncomfortable about the whole thing. Also when this happened..

[Could you be an air hostess in the 60's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27dxi?context=5)| 
[~1:35, although I'd recommend listening to the whole thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf285iy?context=5)|Hahaha fantastic. they are the bees knees.
[Describe a typical day on a gig?  What are the ups and downs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27fgj?context=5)|On an ideal job, a good day would be around 8 hours and a decent lunch break because I can't concentrate when I'm hungry! Shooting on location is fun but can be too cold or too hot seeing as they shoot winter clothing in summer and summer in winter! I did a rad shoot in China where I got flown to Xiamen (a little island near Taiwan). I stayed the night in this cute wee hotel then had a call time of 6am the next morning. They did makeup and hair for an hour or 2 then we shot to get the morning light and travelled all over this little island to different locations shooting different outfits. The clothing was actually nice which makes it easy! The island was gorgeous and I had been living in Hangzhou where it had been snowing so it was a welcome getaway. Generally I dont mind getting my makeup done if it's good quality (I've got majorly reactive skin to the bad shit). I hate getting my hair done, I literally dread it and am in cold sweats haha. They pull it so hard!
 |A bad job has been in studios with zero heating in the middle of winter, shooting shit that's just crap quality and uninspiring. They hurry you eating lunch because they want to get their moneys worth. However in saying that, everyone is just trying to do their job and get in get out. Compared to so many jobs this one isn't exactly 'hard' but it's not as easy as it's percieved and not as glamorous either.  Most of time I do really dig test shooting (usually not paid) because everyone has an input and I enjoy creating wicked images. The jobs that are just advertising aren't necessarily but they make you the $$. Like any job, it's got ups and downs!
[When in a photoshoot, do you have to act a little bit or posing/facial expressions come natural to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28g6z?context=5)|It comes naturally to me most of the time. Although I have to act a bit if it's like, more sexy or something. I'm not as comfortable doing that.
[Do you get hit on a lot outside of the job? Like in clubs or in general? Are men intimidated to approach you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28g6z?context=5)|Yes. I have had a BF too for almost 4 years which I always mention to guys if they seem like they're hitting on me. I am a naturally chatty friendly person and this seems to get misconstrued. I think what bugs me the most is when people don't respect that I have a BF and continue to act the same way. That really shits me! I don't think they are intimidated, I'm not crazy tall or anything so maybe that's why. Plus I'm a bit of a goof ball so I don't think I send an intimidating vibe?
[What do you do when not modeling for income?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28g6z?context=5)|I work in retail, teach dance (I have a degree in contemporary dance for the VCA in Melbourne, AUS which is what I am actually aspiring to do with my life! I'd love to lecture, choreograph and make films and perform. Here's my first attempt at a film :p [Link to vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/79639864) I also am about to start some casual work caregiving in a rest home. I really dig looking after the elderly :)
[When is the last time you had a chicken wing, french fry, pizza, ice cream type meal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28e0k?context=5)|I had KFC last Thursday! popcorn chicken chips and gravy. had fried rice a couple of nights ago!
[I believe the fascination young girls feel for being a model won't change even if someone tells them the downside of the job. May I ask what don't you like about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf297cg?context=5)|I think you're right. People have a 'I want to find out for myself' attitude and that's fair enough, I also share that. I guess I don't really want to steer people off it, but I would like them to make an informed and educated choice. After all, who am I to tell somebody what to do and how to live. I am merely going on my own experiences.
 |I don't like being objectified and treated like I'm not a person. I don't like when people talk about models being not real women because they are small, I can understand both sides of that issue though. I don't like the obsession around people wanting to look like photos of models that arent actually photos, they are full scale productions.  I do however, love creating beautiful images that I am proud to be part of and working with lots of creative and talented people. 
[Ty. Insightful Ama.  Note: In the case someone here is rude to you don't be offended. I've seen ppl being rude in many AmAs so I fear is just a question of time. Good luck with your project of working in contemporary dance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2a2zv?context=5)|Yeah was kinda a spur of the moment thing doing this, im kinda afraid of the same thing. Won't take it personally!
[Not for nothing but isn't everyone a ""model"" in this ""Instagram/Model Mayhem"" world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28rtc?context=5)|Haha good point. Depends if you're getting paid for it and your definition of 'model'
[If your getting paid and represented by a legit agency then you're a model. Congrats.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28w3r?context=5)|Cheers :)
[Where are you from originally, just so i know where to look for a wife?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27ju7?context=5)|Haha NZ.
[You're from NZ and didn't recognize Flight of the Concords lyrics? I thought those guys were like co-Emperors of that place. Shame on you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28tv0?context=5)|They are but I've been living out of the country for the last three years. Shame on me, they are brilliant.
[Do you feel that modeling pressures women and turns their figure into a sexual object?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27dzv?context=5)|I'm kind of in two minds about it.  Some modelling/depending on what the job is and what product you are advertising definitely turns the women/ or man for that fact, into a sexual object. Not all jobs do this. When I was modelling in China it was a real eye opener to the industry. You are not a person, you are a product. There is nothing special about you, you are just another money maker. As harsh as that sounds it's important to realise that in this industry. The sooner you stop letting your looks define you, the better. There are so many more qualities about a person that should be admired but for obvious reasons in this messed up world, aren't!
[How often do they edit/photoshop you on a computer and to what extent? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27fpa?context=5)|A lot! There's a photo on the link I provided in proof where I'm in a red dress for a look book shot. They shaved my calves down considerably. I am a contemporary dancer, so have a muscley physique naturally. I was kind of gutted when I noticed that. But hey, if they want to spend the time doing it then I'm not phased. To me it's a waste of time, but by that point I've done my job and have no control of what happens after that. It does bug me though, that people look at that and think it's real. Modelling is pre production, post production etc, so the end picture isn't a photograph- it's a production 
[Have you had sexual offers made in exchange of a sweet gig? If yes , is it a common occurrence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29uhe?context=5)|No. Well actually not directly and said in as many words but I've defs talked to an editor of my fav magazine which I was pumped to shoot for and then he ended up hitting on me way too hard and made me feel really uncomfortable. Fucked me off cos it was arrogant on his part (I said I had a bf 5 times) and now it's put me off the mag.
 |I know a girl overseas who apparently sucked d to get gigs.
[Why do you model? What's the interest/appeal and where did it stem from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27u3q?context=5)|I love photography and fashion etc so it's a cool way to be involved in creating cool photos. Also, I thought if I could make money from it then why not? I generally enjoy it. It's not a lifestyle either because I only do it part time. There have certainly been times where I've questioned it, due to photoshopping and the message it portrays to society etc.
[What does the other part of you do? (sorry if this has been asked/answered\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28e8l?context=5)|It has been but that's ok! I work in retail, teach dance (I have a degree in contemporary dance for the VCA in Melbourne, AUS which is what I am actually aspiring to do with my life! I'd love to lecture, choreograph and make films and perform. Here's my first attempt at a film :p [Link to vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/79639864) I also am about to start some casual work caregiving in a rest home. I really dig looking after the elderly :)
[What is your favorite thing about modeling?  How do you feel about being photoshopped?  Favorite food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29mhk?context=5)|Creating wicked cool pics! Love being part of a creative team. Getting paid for it is awesome. Don't love being photoshopped, I can understand skin stuff etc but as soon as it's manipulating size, height, proportions, is pretty fucking weird! Food, I love chips so much. I don't really have a sweet tooth, more like platters of nibbles omg droool. Fav meal is duck confit.
[Are models such as you put through rigorous eating and workout routines? If so, what is it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29t2i?context=5)|Personally I am not, no :)
 |Some girls if they start at 13 etc when they are a waif and havent gone through puberty might be after they do and their bodies change but I'm not too sure. I'm guessing it happens though..look at this [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHh2cpLGzIA)
[What is your favorite book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2afm8?context=5)|Gahhh tricky. Just lookin at my bookshelf now.See Naples And Die by Penelope Green was great, Eleven Minutes by Paulo Coelho, and The Alchemist. I've just been reading James Herriot (he's the vet in yorkshire). A Fine Balance by V.S Napul (i think). Can't chose just one.
[What was/is your favorite subject in school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2afm8?context=5)|Was, haha. Loved painting and English and Bio.
[Any model(s\) that inspire(s\) you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2afm8?context=5)|Freja Beha is raaad. And Gemma Ward.
[A Fine Balance - Rohington Mistry? IF so this is an awesome read and well worth it. Very telling about a darker side of India... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2itgp?context=5)|Yes! Whoops V.S Napul wrote An Area of Darkness. Such a good book isn't it!
[An Area of Darkness is another fwalkin awesome read. Heavy but so rewarding... Its stories like these that always stay with me and trigger me at such wierd times in my life.  Anyway sorry to hijack your thread - you could pm me or talk over at the r/books thingo if you like!  Tah,  Ray.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2jmgm?context=5)|Yeah I started reading it a while back and never finished because it's quite heavy going. I'll have to start over now because I can't remember what really happened. No worries!
[How does it feel to have won the genetics lottery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2aa7p?context=5)|Lucky. That's all it is, just luck. I wish I was a touch taller though for this job!
[What is your favourite type of makeup to wear? Are you a MAC fan or is drugstore make up just as good in your perspective? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf339zh?context=5)|To be honest I really dislike MAC foundation, my skin reacts to it and blows up and goes puffy. That said, I like their eye shadows and nail polish but that's about it. It's got too much crap in it! I wear Clinique foundation, it's a light coverage dewy one. Elizabeth Arden or Max Factor Masterpiece mascara is my favourite. Lakme (an Indian makeup brand) do unreal liquid eyeliner. And thin lizzy is my favourite bronzer by far. The ads for it are hilarious and it's pretty cheap but it's grand! For lip balm I always use Vaseline, cheap as chips and skin doesn't react to it. Skincare I use Kora Organics by Miranda Kerr, Biotherm, and Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion is amaze! Otherwise for blush, eyeshadow etc I don't care what brand. Cheapest is fine! The only reason I'm careful with the other stuff is my skin is cray sensitive and I get eczema otherwise.
[Are you a chameleon ? You just look super awesome in all those different set ups !](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2ci5y?context=5)|Looks wise yes. Personality wise no. Thanks! It is fun to see yourself in lots of diff ways.
[How is like living in NZ ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2ci5y?context=5)|NZ is great, although I'd been living in Melbourne until the end of 2013 doing my degree which I graduated in December. I used to visit home lots anyway. NZ is such a beautiful country and I love the outdoors as opposed to huge cities so it's nice to be home.
[Hi Nicola, Why would you say that the industry isn't as sweet as it looks?  Also, I am not sure that posting a link to a profile is enough proof. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27m5c?context=5)|Just due to the pressure that's put on women and men in terms of weight etc. If you're not one of those top few then it's not all glam!  Yes another person said this- I posted a link to my tumblr that is about being on both sides of the camera (I like taking pics too) I'm not sure if that's enough, don't really know how this proof thang works i'm new to it all [Link to nicolacollie.tumblr.com](http://nicolacollie.tumblr.com)
[Yeah I am sort of new too. Thx for your response! I'll check out your tumblr. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29m17?context=5)|Groovy.
[What sort of workouts or physical activities are you into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28tz8?context=5)|I'm a contemporary dancer so I do technique classes a few times a week and do yoga too. I love reformer pilates and used to be a competitive swimmer so I do a bit of that every now and again. Rollerblading is super fun! And I enjoy running but don't do it heaps because it feels quite harsh on your joints, plus it's seriously hard haha.
[Do you watch ANTM would you try out for it or any other model reality show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27o97?context=5)|Na. I used to when I was younger but it seems like the focus has shifted to pure entertainment anyway so there's no reality to it.
[Do see a lot of eating disorders in the industry? What are some crazy eating or exercising habits you see in some other models?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27o97?context=5)|Yes I lived with a girl in China who was Bulimic. I tried to confront her but there were a million excuses. I felt extremely sorry for her because the agency were putting pressure on her to lose weight or threatening to send her home. She went from eating vegetables and water one day to totally binging the next. So many models start so young that they don't have that education about nutrition and work of fiction not facts so it's a pretty dangerous cycle.
[I'm sorry but can you please post more proof that the model on that page is indeed you  ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27vm1?context=5)|Sure, [Link to nicolacollie.tumblr.com](http://nicolacollie.tumblr.com) this is my tumblr. does that count? Not sure how else to do it! First time I've used reddit sorry.
[The tumblr doesn't mention this AMA, nor is there any proof that the tumblr is run by the model featured in it. A picture of you holding up a piece of paper with your username on it would be ideal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2hlrf?context=5)|Does now!
[Do you still have to keep your normal job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27uyf?context=5)|Yep! I work in retail, caregiving, and teaching dance.
[Are you naturally thin or do you have to constantly watch what you eat in order to stay the size you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27ok0?context=5)|Naturally thin. Super dooper lucky on the genes. My parents are both small and quite athletic so I'm not a stick. Alas, I also inhereted their shortness too so I'm only 167cm which is a big set back with jobs!
 |I don't eat a lot of crap though, I like eating well. Makes you feel better. I'm a sucker for a $5 pizza hut pizza every now and then though!
[Your website listed you as being 170 cm tall...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29cve?context=5)|Yep, to get an agent I had to say I was 170cm, I am 167cm but in proportion so people don't really question it! On another agency website my measurements (hips, waist, bust) are listed as slightly bigger than I am because they market here is for more an NZ size 10 than a 6. Differs everywhere you go depending on the market.
 |Kinda messed up huh.
[Are you scared that one day you'll get old and lose your looks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2meb4?context=5)|That's going to happen whether I be afraid of it or not, so might as well just chill and not worry. Since this isn't a fulltime job/career for me and I have other plans then I'm not too phased. Although I'm careful with my skin because I want it to look good for as long as poss!
[Yea I mean it's gonna happen to us all, but I wonder how it affects someone when their income depends on it..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf3hmqo?context=5)|Since it's never been by main source of income or what I want to do as a career then I'm not particularly reliant on it. But I imagine if you were it could be a bit stressful!
[How did you get into modeling? Like, did you call the modeling agency and told them that you're interested in modeling for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29kz1?context=5)|I entered this funny wee modelling competition, and won it when I was 16ish! it was pretty small but I enjoyed it so after I got in touch with an agency by sending in pics and then they got back in touch.
[Why does it say ""Polaroid"" when they aren't Polaroids, and don't even look like Polaroids? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2btgi?context=5)|It's an old school industry term. They are digis.
[Are eating disorders in the industry a huge issue? Any stories of people you knew going through that sort of stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2b67m?context=5)|Yes a girl I lived with overseas was bulimic. 
[Could you paraphrase your diet and exercise routine? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2kvpu?context=5)|I don't have a set routine as such. At the moment things have been all over the place so it's been hard to settle into a routine. But i'll do my best! Brekky is usually: porridge made with rice milk, frozen blueberries, sultanas, seasame seeds, organic yoghurt. (This morning I had corn fritters and bacon :P Lunch: I made a huge batch up pumpkin soup this week so that's kinda what i've been having. Or I'll have leftovers from dinner the night before because I suck at correct quantities when I cook! Dinner: this week I've had, noodle stirfry, lasagne, fried rice, vietnamese beef salad, nachos, thai green curry.  I love food so I cook to what I feel like, I don't have a strict diet by any means. I have been trying to avoid eating much dairy and gluten though because it flares up my eczema which I'm trying to get rid of permanently through what I eat, chinese herbs and acupuncture. I don't have it crazy bad but it's annoying and I'm over steroid/cortisone  creams! Exercise wise I do yoga twice a week and dance technique classes three times a week. I do rollerblading, running etc occasionally too.
[Thanks for your reply! One more question. What do you plan on doing after modeling? Any great interests? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf37tdd?context=5)|How annoying is it! I have found the avoiding gluten/dairy really helps big time. And tomatoes/strawberries too. The chinese herbs are rancid tasting but work so well, you should try it! Since it's not my main job, I actually work managing retail, as a caregiver and teach dance. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Dance (Contemporary) so that's where my main interest actually lies. Currently I've moved home to save and work and am heading to Europe later this year to intern for a company in Brussels. I want to be a dancer, choreographer and get into film making :)
[What are some of the major differences you have seen, if any, between how female models are treated to their male counterparts? Thanks for your time!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf28dvz?context=5)|Ummm I'm actually not too sure. I have worked with dudes a couple of times on shoots in Aus and we have been treated really equally. I would be speculating if I said anything else. Thanks! :)
[Hey Nicola :\) What are some of your best tips for taking a good photo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29qrc?context=5)|Be natural! Ha um I'm not sure, just be yourself unless you're a really great actor ;)
[Where at in India? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf27naf?context=5)|Chandigarh just randomly when I was actually working volunteering in the rural punjab.
[Well Namaste.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29dxk?context=5)|Namaste :)
[Is there any talk in the industry about computer graphics displacing jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf29tgs?context=5)|I haven't heard of that but sounds interesting.
[How much money does a shoot typically pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2c8i8?context=5)|It really varies but I'd rather not say.
[I understand, I'm just asking because I'm told I should go into the industry quite often and I'd be a little more interested if I had a concrete idea of what I might be getting into.  Let me ask a different way, if you did it full-time would you feel you'd be able to support yourself comfortably? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2fd1t?context=5)|Probably not. I mean I have a friend who works quite a lot in Melbourne but she says she probably couldn't support herself if she didnt live at home. If I do a half day for a department store catalogue (4hrs) I get $800 before tax and agency, so $600 in the bank. If you get a campaign you're in the thousands. A few TVCs ive gone for (Bonds, Holden etc) where paying anywhere from $2000-$7000. You get more for speaking roles. These are really hard to get and don't come often though and you get asked at castings/auditions if you've been on the air in the last 6months. If so then that lessens your chances of getting another one because it might be with a competition brand etc. So while it sounds good, it's a pretty unstable source of income. Why don't you give it a try and see what happens? You can always quit if it's not your cuppa tea :)
[Thank you for going so in-depth with that. I'm definitely interested if not just for the life experience. Only thing is as a guy I'll probably have to get into a bit better shape and hell if I can't do that I probably wouldn't cut it anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf336kx?context=5)|Haha yeah you do need to be in good shape. For a dude you've either gotta be crazy skinny for runway or semi built for commercial. Do it anyway, it's a good excuse to get fit and healthy! God I sound like a wanker saying that but it's tue.
[Did you keep your day job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2bgc8?context=5)|Yep.
[What other qualities do you have apart from your looks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wi8km/iama_part_time_model_ama/cf2ao8n?context=5)|I'm a good contemporary dancer. I just graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, Aus with a Bachelor of Dance. I'm pretty empathetic, like writing and taking photos and generally just enjoy being a decent human being!  Hopefully that answers your question.

1wixk8,4,2014-01-29,I'll be a college grad in a few months. I am not confident in my skills to get a job in my field.,throwitveryfaraway1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1wixk8/ill_be_a_college_grad_in_a_few_months_i_am_not/,I'll be graduating in May with a BS in Information Science. I have a good gpa (3.6) but I don't feel confident in the skills I would have acquired from my studies. I look at job qualifications and I just don't feel like I would stick out. I've programmed in C++ and Java and HTML and Javascript and I struggled with each one beyond the basics. A networking course I took was pretty bad as well. I'm not good at one thing but eh on a little bit of everything. I have one internship under my belt but I don't even think that helps. I'm terrified of not finding anything. Anybody go through the same thing upon graduating college?

[Hey Jason, thanks for doing this. Huge fan of CGW. What's it like working with such a diverse group of people on the panel? What do you do to prepare for an episode? Think I can get a job at CGW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1up0o?context=5)|Thanks for watching our little TV show. It's kind of a Star Wars bar, CGW - but I think that's the idea. Trevor, Katie, Kosta, Georgie and that TV legend Regis - everyone has such a different background in experience and opinion and we never ever have to force the conversation. I think our best shows resemble a wacky dinner party. With maybe a little bourbon.
 |Can you get a job? Send some ideas, buddy! Stranger things have happened! I'm new to this, too!
[Hey Jason. Where do you see professional cycling in the US going from here? Do you think it moves more towards cyclocross (maybe even MTB\) in the future, or do you think road cycling continues to grow? Do you think we've hit a peak?  P.S. Thanks for being a big advocate for cycling in NYC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1ur2o?context=5)|Thank you for asking a cycling questions! We feel very lucky to have a desk at the Journal that allows us to get a lot of cycling coverage - and I would be remiss if I didn't mention Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell's groundbreaking (and later best-selling) coverage of Lance Armstrong's cycling downfall.  The pro scene in NYC, as in Europe, is dependent on sponsors, and we all know sponsorships were put in peril by financial crises in the back half of last decade. There's a sense that it's beginning to lift, and more money is available, and there of course are great scenes like Tour of Cali and US Pro. It'd be great to see continued growth and TV support as well. But I see the heart and soul of the sport being the grass roots, always.  Cyclocross is just one of those things that if you see it or try it, you're a fan for life. Like red velvet Twinkies. A great, great sport. 
[I appreciate your efforts to cover pro cycling. It can be very hard to find event results and commentary anywhere outside of the cycling press - ESPN doesn't even mention cycling on their website, even under the ""More Sports"" heading, alongside rugby, poker and MMA - and yet surprisingly often I can open the Journal and find a column about Katie Compton or the Giro d'Italia. It's quite refreshing.  My question is this: Do you face any pressure from your readers or your editors to decrease cycling coverage, and if so, why do you think that is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uyzo?context=5)|Never had one lick of pressure *ever* from Journal editors to not cover cycling, or anything else, for that matter. They just want you to care about what you're writing about, and it's a tribute to them that they are willing to let us run off and cover smaller sports and athletes we're passionate about. That doesn't mean I don't ask. Like last year, we were right now amid Super Bowl mania week - when it's basically all football all the time - and I wanted to write about CX Worlds, which were in Louisville. I was like, ""are you guys surrre you're cool with this."" And they were.  And the best part? There are so many cyclocross nuts out there that the article weirdly surged to the WSJ.com top 10. That's a thing that I think the WSJ editors realize: that niche sports often have so much passion and excitement that any coverage plays quite well. You write about the Super Bowl, that story can get drowned out in the noise. Write about someone like Katie Compton, and I can assure you everyone who's into CX is passing that story around on-line. 
[What is your typical writing process like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1wmhg?context=5)|My process is: by any means possible! We have a 10 month old at home so I try to sneak in writing when I can. Best case scenario: Have an idea before bedtime, maybe write a little bit, then hit ground running in the morning. Doesn't always happen! Real life and sports news intervene all the time. But when crazy things happen, that's usually the best. I like a fast breaking story, having to react on fly.
[With such a large readership like WSJ, do you find yourself tailoring your commentary/jokes/satire to what can be considered a ""mainstream"" audience?  Do you have a twitter? I don't know about anyone else here, but I'd follow you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1wmhg?context=5)|Definitely try not to think of the WSJ's readership as one identifiable bloc, because in my experience, it's a real range of people and experiences and ages and backgrounds. Readers surprise me all the time, which is one of the true pleasures of the job.  I'm not big on advice stuff - I am wary of even suggesting what works for me will work for you, because half the time I feel I have no idea what I am doing (not kidding) - but it has been useful to simply use my own self as a compass. Meaning: just write what I truly think. Not what I think people want to hear. Be honest in your opinion. Even if your honest opinion is: I don't know. 
[Hey Jason. Big fan. What's it like working for the WSJ? What was the most challenging column you ever had to write?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1umky?context=5)|Thank you. Most challenging columns invariably are deadline columns, having to file something that doesn't resemble mental oatmeal. Super Bowl, weirdly, is hard. Usually filing something moments after the final whistle. (*At this point we should very clearly say that there are very few, authentic ""challenges"" in the world of sportswriting, which is a very lucky profession to be in...akin to getting paid to sit in a Jacuzzi. So take any sportswriter ""challenges"" with a grain of salt)
[Hey Jason!  As a hockey fan, I love the WSJ because it is one of the few newspapers that really goes in-depth with the NHL and reports a pretty significant amount on it.  Other newspapers, and especially news networks, pale in comparison.  How do you see hockey evolving in the US markets in the next few years?   Will it pick up more publicity, or stay relatively stagnant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1xlne?context=5)|I agree with you, the Journal's had some really excellent hockey coverage in the paper (by others - I can take responsibility for somewhere between zero and zero percent of it.) Hockey seems to be in a place where it's trying to find the comfortable financial position between serving its deeply loyal base, and growing the game. The best advertisement seems to be the game itself. The Playoffs are the best in sports. Ideas like the Winter Classic have to help. The Winter Classic has to be the most brilliant out-of-the-box idea in a major sport in years. It's such a smash. 
[Jason, you're my favorite WSJ columnist, but I'm sure you can agree that your style and work covered tends to differ a bit from what one expects in the WSJ. Going from Marketplace to one of your less-serious columns is quite contrasting. Could you talk a little on how you made it to the WSJ?  Also, since you're a huge cat fan, when will they be taking over the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1unb2?context=5)|Thank you! To be truthful I try not to think too hard about that contrast; I'm awestruck by the rest of the WSJ and the incredible work my colleagues do. (Sometimes I feel like I'm driving a little yellow clown car.) But I *think* the people in charge want the WSJ to be a broad reader experience - you can see the range every day - full of surprises. I love hearing from Journal readers who at first were sort of horrified by my column and gradually came around to it. I feel very lucky to be in a paper like the WSJ. I know that makes me sound like a suck-up but it's true! 
[I think they hit it right on the diversity part.  When I first started reading your work, it reminded me of Dennis Miller. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uyzg?context=5)|I didn't answer the cat question. But you know the answer already: Cats have already taken over the World. 
[Congratulations on the book announcement! Can you tell us more about it? Most importantly, will it include tennis commentary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uvqe?context=5)|Thanks! The working title of the book is LITTLE VICTORIES and the publisher is Doubleday, editor Bill Thomas. Thrilled to have finally gotten an idea together and so happy that Bill and Doubleday are behind it.
 |The basic idea is an advice book, with personal essays. It may have something in common with ""Rules"" columns I've done in WSJ, but there's no old material or reprints. All new stuff. And it will range outside of sports coverage, it will have chapters on family and parenting and travel and style and all that kind of stuff. I want it to be a book you can give your Mom and your kid and your Dad and your Cat. Maybe even your Dog. Though dogs are notoriously slow readers.
 |Hopefully, yes, it will have some tennis - maybe not commentary, I don't know if anyone wants to hear what I thought of Andre Agassi's acid washed shorts. Or maybe they do? I need chapters! 
[Who do you see as being the breakout athletes for the U.S. in Sochi? It seems like Gracie Gold and Mikaela Shriffin are getting a lot of attention on the female side. Any other names to look out for? Lastly, what's your take on the current security issues? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1w894?context=5)|Hey thanks for the note. I was typing this and accidentally deleted it! I think there's an obvious storyline with Mikaela, she's already a star and the comparisons to Vonn are intense (maybe too intense. She should be allowed to be her own person) As far as other women athletes, I am definitely looking forward to seeing the US Women's Hockey Team, for a partly selfish reason: they practiced in my hometown of Belmont MA. I would have loved to have gone to see that. I'm bummed I missed it.
 |On the Games and security: look, it's hard not to see the pre-Olympic coverage and the headlines and not feel a little wary. I try to assure myself this is always a conversation before the Olympics - or any major sporting event, for that matter, in this era. To be truthful, I'm a little worried that the Games will be on such security lockdown that you don't really get to experience the host city and country, which to me is a huge point of going to the games. 
[What's my next step?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1urqb?context=5)|Brr it's going to be cold at Yankee Stadium for tonight's game. Though it does look amazing. Hats off to the NHL for creative thinking.
[Is that going to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1urqb?context=5)|As far as making a living as a writer, I really just advise: stay with it as long as you can, don't get discouraged by setbacks, and allow yourself to get lucky. It can happen. I've had so many ups and downs -- sometimes in the course of one day ! - but sometimes all it takes is just one person who is willing to open a door and give an opportunity.
[ am I just prolonging whatever it is I'm doing right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1urqb?context=5)|I think the good news is, as volatile an environment as publishing is, there have never been more platforms to be published. There are so many exciting new publications and web sites and opportunities, I have trouble keeping track of it all. I'm a believer* and an optimist.
[How do you make a living out of writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1urqb?context=5)|*Believer. Not Belieber. 
[Was there any ""oh man, we're getting cancelled"" moments on the show where, justifiably or not, you went home and just kept looking over at your phone waiting for a call from someone saying it's over? I'd imagine with any young show there has to be times like that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uyoq?context=5)|Not really. We are a new show on a new network, and we know we have a lot of competition. We're grateful to have producers and bosses willing to take risks and let us develop a chemistry, and over time we have built a very gratifying, loyal following. And authentic chemistry. You hear that word a lot in TV - ""chemistry"" - and I always assumed it was just some nonsense TV people say. But in this case it's real. It's a fab group to be part of. Except when Regis throws wine bottles at us. Okay I made the part about the bottles up. 
[What's the hardest part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1v06d?context=5)|Spelling Krzyzewski.
[Jason, as a loyal reader I really appreciate you answering questions here. WSJ Sports always seems to have interesting, outside-the-box statistics. Where do you go to find these? Is this your own doing or is there a bored intern hopped up on coffee and donuts scouring the internet for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1w5ww?context=5)|Thanks I definitely am *not* the person behind the out of the box stats, that credit goes to editors Sam Walker and Darren Everson, Jim Chairusmi, Geoff Foster...they're the ones doing the pushing and scouring and development of those ideas, which are my favorites, too!
[Who's your pick for the win?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1upex?context=5)|I like the Maple Leafs in 4.
 |Oh the Super Bowl? Going to hold off to the end of this on that one...
[Weak sauce.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uybj?context=5)|Ok Ok i have a feeling about 12. How is that. Feels like the year. 
[Who will bring home the gold in Curling this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1utwl?context=5)|At the risk of offending Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole, Canada.
 |But the Norwegian men's curling team was on the TV show the other day and those guys were charmers! They're motivated to get gold. 
[Is there any faint hope that the TV coverage of Sochi will actually show some sports instead of the endless ""up close and personal"" bumph?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1x44m?context=5)|Yeah, the up close and personal coverage is really a triumph of formula and there is real genius to it - there's a reason why they keep doing it, the audiences are massive, and in this TV day and age, that accomplishment is not to be taken lightly.
[I'm better off than most because I get the CBC on my cable system, but that might mean endless broadcasts of curling.  (Although I will get the hockey as well!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1x44m?context=5)|But yes, unfiltered coverage is amazing. In *any* sport. I often wonder if someone is going to come around one day, in the a la carte TV era, and offer a companion broadcast to football or basketball or baseball that has no announcers, just a live feed. I bet there's a (small but loyal) market for it. 
[To dream... the impossible dream...  \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1xaep?context=5)|Ha i know it sounds impossible but I truly believe as TV migrates to mobile it will be viewer and option driven and audiences will have choices like never before. My kid is going to watch the NBA in a totally different way than I watch it. (Though he will still be mystified by the Knicks) 
[Which sports writers provide the strongest ""takes?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1w2w9?context=5)|That question make me laugh. Yeah: there's definitely a culture in sportswriting that leans to ""strong takes"" or ""hot takes"" and I do appreciate what places like Deadspin do to take some of the hot air out of them. I definitely can get agitated about stuff in sports -- the price of beer, for one - but I don't ever want to get agitated as a performance. That just seems silly. 
[Given what we now know about brain injuries stemming from football playing, isn't the ethical thing to do to shut down football in America ASAP, NFL profits be damned? Shouldn't we not knowingly cause all those kids playing junior, high school and college football to damage their brains, just so we can kill some time on a weekend afternoon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1wx04?context=5)|You raise a question that sounds dramatic but truly feels to be gaining momentum in this country, maybe not at the professional level, but certainly in the grassroots. Head injuries are a topic on the mind of many parents whose children either play or have the opportunity to play contact sports, and we are already seeing some attrition of enrollment. That is the seedling of a real issue in terms of the future of the game.
 |I hear more and more from parents uncomfortable with their kids playing and also from people growing uncomfortable with even watching. I admit I still watch football like a maniac, which seems to require one to disconnect the ugly side of the game playing out in front of our eyes.
 |Having been on the field during high-level football, the contact on the field is astonishing, sometimes frightening. I've heard coaches liken it to cars crashing and it's not that far off...
 |But this country remains so passionate about the sport, and I love so much of it, too. I have to figure it's going to take not a couple years but much longer for the nation to consider disconnecting from it, if ever.
 |All good questions you raise, thank you. 
[Jason, love the new commercial.

Well yes the WSJ Commercial (youtu.be/oac1JtYSyPk) is now running in TAXIS ALL OVER THE WORLD (or maybe just NYC). The intern scene took several days and required 34000 reshoots and voluminous CGI.
 |Took about 20 minutes.

[Food taster? TIL that people want to kill Regis Philbin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1xezg?context=5)|No, everyone loves Regis. Don't get the wrong impression. I merely taste his food to see if it's up to his legendary standards. Regis eats the same thing every day: Filet Mignon in a giant waffle cone. 
[Jason, I always enjoy reading your columns. You place “obscure” sports in the spotlight and really seem to understand them. While I’m guessing tennis is your favorite sport (at least to play\), your coverage of the Tour de France is the best around.  You already answered the question on the future of cycling, but do you think doping ever end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1w6xt?context=5)|Thanks very much! On doping: ugh. I mean, I can't imagine it *ever* ending, in any sport, at anything resembling a 100 percent clean rate. There's just such a human tendency to seek advantage, and then it becomes exponential when money and livelihood is involved. The way that the science of performance enhancement is changing makes it seem very very unlikely you'll ever come up with some kind of foolproof anti-doping system. It seems ridiculous to expect that to ever happen.  What you can hope for is a cultural shift, and in cycling, it seems you're seeing it, at the younger levels. You definitely don't have a fully clean sport, but there's less tolerance among younger riders, strong opinions about people getting caught, sponsors declining to look the other way. Again: there's too much bad history to suggest this or any other sport will be fully clean. But progress seems to be a worthwhile goal. 
[Hey Jason. Big fan of your work. I thoroughly enjoy the journal's take on sports. Attached to WSJ sports is also my favorite podcast. When are you going to visit, Geoff, Jim, Darren and Adam again on the Sports Retort?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1w5b2?context=5)|I believe I am banned from the Sports Retort for being under the influence of too much Diet Coke. I would like to appeal that ban.
 |Thanks for being a WSJ reader! The Retort definitely has a following, and they deserve it! it's a great podcast. 
[Big time Knicks fan. Big Chris Herring supporter. Obviously he's a brilliant beat writer, works super hard on all his pieces. Where do you see his career going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1vdjq?context=5)|Seriously: i don't know if Chris sleeps. I think he watches tape in the morning with his cereal. He obsesses about the job. And in a very very competitive hornet's nest - the Knicks beat might be the toughest beat in the city, even when the team isn't competitive - he's an essential read.
 |He did go to the University of Michigan but don't hold that against him.
[With all the weapons Denver has do you think Richard Sherman can be a real factor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uru8?context=5)|It's a good question and clearly Denver will try to stretch and exploit the field where Sherman isn't, primarily using Demaryius Thomas as the draw. It's essentially what San Francisco did with Crabtree. The difference will be that Manning, as we all know, is a virtuoso. Remember how Kaepernick was able to bust up the middle quite a bit for long gains? Look for Denver to work that part of the field with Welker and Decker, not to mention Moreno. Key will be red zone. That was an issue for Niners. 
[Thanks for the response. I agree, Seattle's secondary is pretty solid. It's all about spacing them out and working between the numbers. First one to 100 rushing yards will win the game, in my opinion. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1viid?context=5)|You're onto something there. Yesterday at Media Mess Day - wow do I not enjoy Super Bowl Media Day - I could not help but look at Marshawn Lynch, standing there, silently, behind his sweet Garbo-esque Vuitton sunglasses, and think: That Dude is the key to this game. He really might be. If Marshawn is Marshawn -- it will be a good night for Seattle. 
[What's with the textured ties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1urcj?context=5)|This might be from my mom. Hi mom.

I like doing those columns. The first season of them - Thanksgiving rules, Gym rules, etc - was a blast. When we talked about doing them again, I wondered if it was overkill, if it was just a bad sequel. But then there was a gratifying response. I love the idea of it developing into a tradition. This year a number of readers sent in photographs of their own family games - that gesture really really moved me. I know it sounds corny but I am incredibly appreciative of the idea of anyone reading anything I write, and the idea of them sharing it with family is super fun. 
[Has your name ever been involved in a gaffe like the hilarious Tyson Gay gaffe back in 2012?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1wqil?context=5)|Can you remind me of what that is? I have a vague recollection.
[A website had a filter that removed any use of the word ""gay"" and replaced it with the word ""homosexual"", so Tyson Gay's name was changed to ""Tyson Homosexual"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1xd69?context=5)|Oh that. No, I haven't had that happen. That is nuts. I have had situations where I have sent people emails, and they've never received them, and they later learn the email went into spam because of my last name. That is so stupid and depressing it just makes me SMH.

[Hey Jason, big fan, been reading your stuff for longer than I can remember. What was the last event/moment that tapped into you at an emotional, fan like level, where you had to take a moment to regain your professional, journalistic hat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1uylw?context=5)|Ha thank you for the nice note. I've never tried to put a steel barricade between my emotions as a persona and my obligations as a sports writer; I obviously want to be fair and responsible, but I don't want to be robotic about the environment that i am in. But to answer specifically (and emotionally) I had never been to Wimbledon until the 2012 Olympics. I grew up with a dad who coached high school tennis (Still does in fact - 41 seasons! Crazy) and have such vivid memories of Wimbledon in the early AM, of Borg and Connors and McEnroe and beyond, and so when I walked out to Centre Court, just seeing it, the real thing -- I had to take a moment. It transported me back to a very lovely part of my childhood and made me realize how lucky I am to have this job.
 |And then I called my Dad and told him where I was. 
[Hey Jason! Masters student in journalism here who's looking to become a sportswriter after I graduate. Just wondering any advice you would have for somebody about to enter the field. Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wgzl5/this_is_jason_gay_im_a_sports_columnist_for_the/cf1wt0n?context=5)|Write all the time! I know that sounds blisteringly obvious but I just feel it's like any kind of exercise or activity - the more you do it, the more natural it will feel, the more enjoyment you will take from it, the more opportunities will come.
 |Also: don't get too discouraged or listen to people who tell you there's one way of doing this. You will have your own path.

First day on the job, I'm placed in document duty. Problem here is that another intern before me tried this and failed miserably. So I have to write up 900+ customers in a well organized directory.

* Have a clean directory. Files A-Z, each filed with last name organization. 

* Each person (Gonzalez, Ernie) would have their own folder within their appropriate folder. (E:\G\Gonzalez_Ernie).

* Each persons folder would have a text document named after the machine fixed, the text document including what work was done. Which would allow for one person to have multiple machines within their uh... name?

&gt;
&gt;E:\G\Gonzalez_Ernie\Toshiba C55-A5300.txt

&gt;    Replaced memory
&gt;
&gt;    Flashed BIOS
&gt;
&gt;    Installed Windows Updates
  
Now here comes the super tricky part. What I want to do is set up 3 computers, (Home, Shop, Laptop) AND an external HD that would all have copies of the directory. I'd like for each computer to sync with the hard drive when it is plugged in. That's the tricky part. How would I go about doing that? I'd prefer not to use a cloud, but I will if I have to.

I've been having a lot of doubts lately with my decisions of higher education. I graduated last summer with a B.A. in Communications-Public Relations and I've been having a tough time getting interviews for jobs and internships a like.

One thing I've always loved is exercise and to be healthy. I enjoy exercising about five times a week and lately I've been thinking about going back to school to get my B.S. in Exercise Science.

I've talked to a few people about it and they have some differing answers to me. I know I could go to some National Athletic Training sites and get my athletic training license much cheaper, but is having the B.S. in science better? I might even consider going to Grad School after, but I just want to focus on this for the mean time.

I just keep going back and forth on the decision and I'm only 23. It would take me 2 years at my state school to get my B.S. in Exercise Science.

Any advice would be great!

tl;dr: Would it be smart to go back to school to get my B.S. in Exercise Science when I already have a B.A. in Public Relations? Very indecisive right now.

I will graduate next year (June 2015) with a masters (MEng) in computer science.  Right now I'm facing two problems, any advice pertaining to either would be awesome.


1.  I need to find a lab to do my MEng thesis.  My school has a program where I can get my tuition paid for if I find a professor willing to sponsor my thesis work.  From what I understand this is pretty common, but finding the right professor doing the right kind of work is something I'm struggling with.  There's also no formalized way of finding these positions.  I've been emailing professors out of the blue asking to meet but haven't had any success thus far.  I'm having a hard time narrowing down what I want to do; I haven't really had many projects outside of school that have given me a clear direction, I'm interested in a lot of different things and would be happy doing my thesis in a number of different labs provided the problem being worked on is interesting.  While I'm okay with this, I'm worried it may lead to me being passed over in favor of students who have more specific interests in what the professor is working on.  Any advice on how to narrow down which professors I want to work with, how to approach them, etc. would be great.  Also, how hard should I be trying to tailor my masters work to a career?  So far I've mostly been taking classes because they sound interesting and it's led to me learning a lot in a lot of different areas but I haven't really had a focus.  Is this a problem?  Is there something I can do to make myself a better candidate for a software company? (and thus make more money and have more options for what company and team I want to work for)


2.  I need to start setting myself up for a job when I graduate.  It's a long way away but I want to make sure I'm in a good position to look for jobs when I graduate, both in terms of having the right resume and skills but also knowing where I want to work and what I want to work on.  I've had internships at both Google and Apple and was kind of underwhelmed.  The companies themselves were great but the problems that I was working on were kind of boring.  I'm guessing that this was mostly because of the team that I ended up on but I don't have enough perspective to say that for sure.  Because of my experiences with these big companies I started looking at smaller places for this summer, until my uncle pointed out that it might be a better career move to stay with the bigger and ""more prestigious"" companies.  How much truth is there to this?  Since this is will be my last summer internship I'm looking for something that would set me up to transition to full time after the internship.  Would it be worth it to suck it up this summer and work on a project I'm not that interested at a big company rather than do something more interesting some place no one has ever heard of?  If I wound up working on a bad team at one of these big companies, how easy is it to move to a team in the same company that's working on more interesting problems?  What can I expect the pay difference will be starting at a big vs a small company?  What would the career differences in 5-10 years look like?

This was for a software engineering intern interview. I talked about the need for some sort of a buffer at the front with fast write memory, something behind that to quickly tag the raw data with meta data, finally send of the records to a database for later processing. All steps should have redundancy built in. 

My answer felt a little lack luster, and I'm curious what you all might add/change. Specifically, is one type of database better suited for fast writing? Would it make sense to direct the data to something like a hadoop cluster for processing instead of going straight to a database? Is there something I'm completely missing here?

1wnt7b,5,2014-01-31,I suck at interviews and algorithms. Looking for advice and direction.,Heaven_Piercing,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1wnt7b/i_suck_at_interviews_and_algorithms_looking_for/,"A little background about myself (I apologize if this is long and uninteresting, but I felt like this is somewhat necessary for what direction I should take):

I was in a different major and was about to declare but decided that I don't want to go to grad school (yet), so I tried out computer science about a year and a half ago and loved it, even though I had no coding experience whatsoever. Since I invested so much time in my previous ""major,"" I had to rush, catchup, and try to finish computer science around the end of my senior year. However, I was undergoing depression, so even though I really liked computer science, grades were barely passable, and, in addition, there is an aura of intimidation in my school since everyone seems much more knowledgeable and have more experience than me when it comes to coding. I started to get myself together within the last semester, but grades were still barely passable. Even though that was the case, I feel like I'm improving in understanding and time-management.

However, I have a difficult time to catch up between applying for internships and doing school at the same time. Just had an interview today, and I froze and was unable to think. I took Algorithms last semester, and even though I learned a lot from that class, I still feel like I suck. I plan to get a math tutor for it soon, but if I do, I feel that I wouldn't be able to handle internship applications, school, and tutoring all at the same time due to taking a really intensive project course and another project course. The reason why I'm worried is that I plan to graduate next semester, and I would have no experience during my college career to put in my resume. So I was wondering, should I quit applying for internships for the time being and focus on school and prepping for interviews, or should I continue to apply for interviews anyways? Also, can someone pinpoint me a subreddit or website that has potential interview questions? I would like to attempt to solve those questions from time to time and prepare myself. I'm aware that the amount of time that I put both class and my own interests is the only way to improve.


*TLDR;* Noob decided to take CS a while ago and finally attempts to try and get his shit together last semester but still feels noobish. Currently worried about the future between school and internship applications. Appreciates additional resources to help him for interviews."

If I explain this to the company, will it be less harmful than if I had reneged in order to just be an SDE at another company?"

I just finished up an internship that was a combination of bench tech/network engineering work. I actually enjoyed it as a change pace from the logic level work I did in classes, however, since I'm still new in the employment game, I don't want to potentially lock myself into the networking side of things if I decide I actually would rather take more of an engineering direction with my career. Long story short, if I got the PE license, would that increase my chances of being able to move from one field to another? Thanks in advance for the advice, everyone!"
