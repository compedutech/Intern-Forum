I asked a friend for advice and he linked this sub as the best advice he could offer me.


**A little about me:** I'm a 25 year old Freshman (rising Sophomore) pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I currently work at a decent paying job that has nothing to do with CS. I can afford to make less money at an internship as long as it pays something and helps me get the right stuff on my resume. I've taken only 1 CS course and will be taking 1 more in the Fall and another in the Spring. In my spare time lately I've been working on learning Python and Java.


**My question:** How early can I get a paying internship? Are there Sophomores getting good internships?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks

There seem to be several opposing opinions being posted on many new posts regarding employment, these are:

- There is a ton of demand for software devs.

vs.

- You likely won't even get a dev interview without an internship or other CS work outside of school. 

Looking through Dice and other posting sites there seems to be an abundance of Developer positions available, I am sure most of them are mediocre but even if only 1/4th are desirable that still seems like a good amount.

The second point has been coming up more and more these past few months as college grads/students are looking for work. This seems ludicrous if the first point is true, especially when you consider other professions where internships or outside involvement does not seem nearly as expected or required. 

Just something that has piqued my interest, and I am curious as to what you all think."

Something saw me, and I'm afraid to go back.",thesistergeek,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fg5pm/tonight_i_babysat_at_a_gilded_age_hotel_something/,"I was just watching some kids for a wedding.  I swear to god, Stephen King had to have stayed at this place before he wrote the Shining.  It was so well restored, if you were by yourself it was easy to get lost in what time you were living.  In some areas, there were old fashioned locks on the doors, not the swipe keys most people use these days.  Don't get me wrong, it was breathtakingly beautiful and well appointed.  But it was so well done, it just felt... off.  Like it belonged in a novel or a movie, not real life.

I'm babysitting just trying to make extra money while I'm working on an internship for the summer.  Things are really tight right now, and the parents offered me a premium to drive half an hour and to be there on such short notice.  They're in town for a wedding, and only found me on Wednesday.

The kids were great, a 8 and 11 year old who loved Doctor Who and the Avengers.  After a month or so of sitting nothing but toddlers, it was a welcome break.  We spent most of our time playing basketball on the tennis court, long vacated by the elder crowd who were now more interested in fine dining than being outside.  We also explored the hotel and the grounds, learning some history about the place along the way.  I love kids at that age, even when we were sneaking into areas we weren't supposed to they were super excited.  I think stealing soda from a wedding reception with a couple kids makes me a pretty kickass babysitter, from the kids' perspective anyway.  Not sure about the parent's.

At about 10PM, the parents returned from their rehearsal dinner and paid me.  I thanked them and said goodnight to the kids.  Everything was great until I was making my way back to the elevator.

Their room was the last one in the hall, and the stairs were about halfway to the elevators.  It was a really long hallway, and it had two turns in it, making it impossible to see all the way down.  I made it around the first turn, around the ice machine and wheelchair ramp, and was staring down the longest section of the hallway.  From around the next corner walks a woman in a flapper dress, complete with period appropriate hair, makeup and shoes.  I stopped dead, thinking she was either a pretty hot ghost, or a member of the wedding party who was dressing for the location.

She walked over to the door nearest her, between me and the stairs.  Then, she just laid her hand on the handle.  And didn't move.  She just stood there, staring down slightly, completely casual.  I decided she was definitely a member of the wedding party, and probably drunk.  So I started walking again.

Suddenly, her head snapped to the side and she stared straight at my feet.  I jumped about 10 feet because of the sudden movement and stopped walking again.  I watched as she grazed her eyes from my feet to my face, her lips spreading in to a smile that got wider and wider.  It took a few seconds before I noticed it was unnaturally wide, spreading from ear to ear, completely out of proportion to her face.  Her dark red lipstick and short bob hair framed large white teeth in a smile that shouldn't have been possible.  Then, she started running and screaming, straight towards me, with her long arms stretched out.

I'm not sure why I didn't run.  You always think you'll choose fight or flight, but I didn't.  I completely shut down.  I turtled.  I dropped to the ground, pulling my knees up to my face and my arms over my head.  And I waited.

I'm not sure how I expected to die, but I obviously didn't.  When I got the courage to look up, I was alone in the hallway.  I decided to take the stairs down, and sprinted to my car.

I don't know what to do.  I need the money, they're paying me $15/hr and I'll make like $135 tomorrow if I go.  But I'm not sure what I saw, or if it'll happen again.  And I'm also sort of curious.  If I do go, I will report back, but would you go back /r/nosleep?"

1fm394,20,2013-06-03,Voyeur,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fm394/voyeur/,"I had always been chubby, but in college I gained a freshman thirty instead of fifteen.  My second semester, I decided to work out, but the gym was always full of muscle bound guys who sat on benches and wouldn’t let you through, and sorority girls in yoga pants who snickered at me as I puffed on the treadmill.  Thankfully, my dad was an alumnus, and recommended that I check out the old fitness trail.

It had been built in the 60s, but was pretty well unused since the new tracks were built by the fitness center back in the late nineties.  I’d see one or two students, a few professors there, but other than the days the Golden Sneakers Club from the senior citizen center downtown would come to walk, I wouldn’t bump into anyone.  It was a 1/8 mile trail with signs all along it, telling you to do sit ups and push-ups, with basic bars and platforms to help you work out.  For me, it was perfect.

The whole campus is sort of on a hillside, and the trail is elevated above the three freshmen halls, somewhere level between the second and third floors.  The halls there, where I lived at the time, were those blocky style dorms built in the seventies that had as much aesthetic as a LEGO building, all square and made of cinder block, designed to hold as many kids as possible for the least cost.  No one really closed their blinds, and I’d find myself glancing over as I walked my little workout.

There were pairs of mirror image rooms all down the way, all the same with just the slight differences made from what the residents hung from the walls, but a sort of soothing symmetry none the less.  I noticed it, but didn’t really look, for some time, until one day something got my attention.  By one of the windows, two students were going at it.  

She was sitting on the desk, back arched against the wall behind her.  Her leg, jeans still slung around her ankle, was up against the window.  He was in front of her, leaning forward, arm braced against the wall for support.  The thing that struck me most strange though, was the window next door.  In the next room, a guy sat at his desk just opposite the wall, clicking on his laptop, and looking bored, perhaps slightly pissed.  I saw him glance over his shoulder to the ceiling—sound travelled so strangely in the cinder block room, no doubt he couldn’t tell which room the couple was.  But from my vantage point, the wall blocked by the window frame, I could see how close they were, just three foot or so apart.  I could almost convince myself they were a strange threesome.  

The whole thing fascinated me, really.  I pictured how easily he could have high fived the other guy’s outstretched hand.  And strangest of all, none of them were thinking how close they were to each other.  

How would they feel about it, I wondered?  Would they see it as an interloper?  But it was, in some way, my secret that they had that third right there, so close! But were clueless.

I was hooked.  I started planning extra time in my workout, taking off at the end to stand and watch the drama in the buildings below.  

There were three buildings to choose from, I always had a window where some little drama was playing out like a silent film below.  I’d laugh when I saw a kid battling a microwave fire, or someone struggling into too tight pants.  There would be balloons, a birthday party!  Or maybe a half dozen kids sprawled across beds, smoking pot, laughing.  But I especially loved when a room had a weird interaction with the one next to it.  I saw two rooms, each with a kid in it battling with sticks like light sabers, oblivious to the fact that their neighbor was doing the same.  I saw a nerdy looking guy bored on a bed, picking his feet, not knowing that on the opposite side of the wall he was facing, two co-eds were dancing about in their underwear.  I saw it all.

Then one day, I saw something that confused me.  In one room, a kid paced.  He was agitated, talking to himself, shaking his head and flapping his arms as though trying to shake off something stuck to him.  I watched him for a moment, wondering.  Then I noticed the next window.  A girl stood, her face obscured to me, watching him.  

But she couldn’t really be watching him, could she?  There was a concrete block wall between them.  No, it was impossible, she couldn’t see him.  But, I couldn’t shake the feeling she was monitoring his every move.  He would pace away from me, and her whole head would turn with him, her brown hair sliding across his shoulders.  He would move towards me, and she would turn her head with his every step.  He’d stop, and she would stare right at him.  

Feeling weird, I tried to notice things about them each.  He was easy to describe, blonde, tall, and scrawny with an agitated face.  But she was more difficult to describe.  Her room must have been dark, I couldn’t make out features.  Just dark hair, a white shirt or some sort.  But with a month of experience reading people, I could sense more.  Anticipation of some kind, glee maybe.  She stared at him with so much intensity, it almost seemed violating.  It freaked me out, and I jetted out early.

The next day, I saw the guy again.  He was on the front page of the newspaper.  He had left a strange, rambling note, stripped naked, and walked in front of a bus.  The paper talked of how he had been acting erratically for a few weeks, schizophrenia becomes active in the late teens, we should watch for warning signs for others, etc.  He had died an hour after I saw him.

Finals were coming up anyway, and I decided to cut out my workouts for the rest of the semester.  But I was back that fall, walking and watching.  It was my same routine and nothing unusual for months and months.  

Then, one day I saw movement in one of the windows.  A fight!  It was only my third or fourth really good fight, and I sat myself down on the grass to take it in.  Two girls, a Blondie and a girl with darker skin, Hispanic maybe?  Blondie was screaming at Hispanic girl, she had something in her hand she was waving in front of her, gesturing, then threw it straight at her head.  Hispanic girl dodged it, motioning towards something in the corner, and Blondie had her hair, and they started grappling back and forth.  Oh, this was good!

Somewhere in my periphery I noticed the next window, and my breath stopped for a moment.  There stood creepy girl again, staring at the wall towards the fight with what could only be described as excitement.  She was practically quivering with it, tracking the movements of the girls as someone burst in the doors, pulled them apart, and they screamed at each other. 

I stopped watching that drama unfold and stared at the girl.  She was still in a partially dark room, and I could still make out nothing but that white shirt with dark hair.  But why was she there?  Holland Hall was very specifically freshman only.  I saw her in a first year dorm the year before, she should be a sophomore and out of there by now.  An RA, maybe?  I felt uncomfortable about her, and left in a hurry.

Creeped out, I watched the papers the next day.  Nothing.  I was relieved.  I let it slip from my mind, enjoying a good afternoon’s workout the next day with no issues.  Then, a week out, the Hispanic girl’s face was on the front page.  After a fight with her roommate, the roommate was moved to another room, the article said.  

Believing she had left something behind, the blonde roommate had come back and broke in the room.  Another fight ensued.  Hispanic girl was stabbed to death.

Normally, the dorms are on lockdown, but there was an impromptu memorial, and I joined the people pouring into the dorm to leave flowers and cards outside her old dorm room where she was killed.  I stood back and watched her friends hug and cry, but then noticed the next door.  It would have been the room where creepy girl stood, I realized.  But the sign on the door said “maintenance”.  I pushed the door open.  It was the AC unit, a pile of mops and brooms.  And no window.

I didn’t workout up on the track for the rest of the year, too afraid I would see creepy girl again.  It was depressing in a way.  Without my little alone time up the hill, my walks and my little viewpoint into other’s lives, I felt disconnected from the world.  

I spent that summer living with my parents, working an ice cream stand all day.  I’d come home and sit on the back porch and watch towards the neighbor’s house.  They fought a lot.  I hadn’t noticed it before that summer, but they would argue every night, voices raised, and vague shadows of angry figures on the curtains.  He would storm off to a room on the back of the garage and watch TV, his man cave, I figured.  She would end up in the bedroom, which was at an uncomfortable angle to my parents’ house, and only visible if I walked up the loft of my dad’s garage.  She’d sob into her pillow, and sometimes he’d come to bed.  Other times he just ended up sleeping on the uncomfortable looking futon in the garage.

She was hanging out wash the one day when I got home, and I did a double take.  She had a shiny black eye, apparently their fights had turned physical when I wasn’t watching.  The next week or two, I was sure of it.  In the kitchen through the roman shades, he threw her against a cupboard, in the bedroom he hit her so hard she fell across the bed unconscious.

And then one night the fighting was louder than ever.  They were in the bedroom, floor scattered with suitcases and trash bags and clothes, and she was yelling back like never before, words muffled by the wall.  He hit her, and she grabbed a phone, waved it in her face, and he stormed off.  She disappeared further in the room, the bathroom, I always guessed. 

I went inside to pour myself some lemonade, and stood back out on the porch.  He was in the man cave, storming about, still yelling.  And there, in the gloom of the garage, was the creepy girl, staring at him, watching as he pounded and raged.
I froze.  I had to do something.  I would call the police.  But what would they say?  How would I explain it?  No, I would go over there myself, charge in like a white knight and warn her, separate them, save them.  But could this even be stopped?  I couldn’t decide what to do!  I finally fled into my parent’s basement, turning on the TV as loud as I could to drown out my thoughts.  I didn’t hear the gunshot.  I didn’t hear the sirens.

It’s my senior year now, and they ask me what I want to do with myself.  I have a good major, good grades, I mention graduate school and internships vaguely.  But I know specifically what I need to do.  There are good schools in the middle of the city in Philly and Atlanta and New York.  I can get into at least one.  And in the city you can eat and watch out the window at all the people.  Better yet, those schools will house you in lofty high places, where you can see hundreds of windows with a decent set of binoculars.  You can find park benches that afford decent views and even some offices will let you see lots of people.  I can even still work out in gyms with treadmills set up in front of windows.  Oh yes, as I visit colleges, I’m seeing how many places I can watch.  And when that girl shows up, staring in her weird way, I will be waiting and this time I’ll do something.  I will act and stop the violence from happening and I will be a hero and save the day.  Just wait.

I've done research as well as community outreach. I won't say that I'm ""outstanding"" or ""talented"" as far as coding goes, but I am competent, eager to work, and eager to learn.

I applied to nearly 20 positions this summer, and have received nearly 20 rejections. No interview, no phone interview, just rejection or silence.  I honestly don't know why this is the case, and everyone else from my classes has been able to secure an internship.

Can anyone offer any advice? What do I do? I'm already behind since I'm lacking internship experience this summer, will I be unemployed forever?"

I have an internship in my field, which is also awesome. 

So here's where it gets fun. I found out about so-called ""social cues"" during my first year of college. That's right. Before, I took what people were saying for face value. If they had intended something malicious, I had no idea. I was completely oblivious. Now, I believe I am reading too much into what people say. 

Most of what I have been reading into has not been a big deal, fat joke here, dumb joke there, whatever. But what has me worried is my future, and me wasting the prime of my life. My family (mother specifically) has been giving me hints that I should be trying to find women, instead of wasting my time on video games (or whatever else I do).

One of the occasions went like this: A friend of the family was over for memorial day. We were having a pleasant conversation, and we stumbled onto the topic of video games. I guess at this point I should say that talking about video games to a non-video game player is really hard/awkward; as such, I try to avoid it. But these guys were relentless. They even went so far as to ask if any of my co-workers played video games, which I answered ""Yes, the guy in the cubicle next to me plays suchandsuch, blahblah."" So my mother responds, ""Does he have a wife?"" I just couldn't believe it, I was speechless. She's made more subtle hints in the past, but I just didn't know how to respond. I shutdown. Wen't downstairs and queued up a game.

Before I thought things were O.K. with my mother, you know, the sort of unconditional I live in your house sort of love. Did my mother imply anything in her statement? Or am I just paranoid?"

My first instinct refuse to do it, after my last askreddit I've decided to give it a shot before talking to my supervisor about if its going to work or not. 

I was told he gets pretty agitated with too much free time. He brings some sort of ball that he squeezes and that's a pretty good indicator of whether or not something is wrong. I was informed that if I hold his hand when he is agitated it calms him down pretty quickly. However, this kid is BIG and this makes me nervous that if he gets upset that he could get violent.

Anyways, just looking for some general FAQ or some tips that might be helpful for me working with him.

After two years I was forced to hand in my employee badge for Pandemic Studios, a broken man.

I was taking 4 vicodin a day to dull the pain of a herniated disc in my lower back. Wrist braces adorned both my arms to help control the repetitive stress injury induced by long days of playing Star Wars: Battlefront and typing. The herniated disc – acquired on a rare crunch time day off as I stood up from my couch at home – gave me a bit of a limp, and as I hobbled through the halls of Pandemic Studios you could hear the painkillers rattle in my pocket.

I was heartbroken. I was rejected. I could not fathom why I was let go from the team I had sacrificed so much for. In time, I would grow to understand the incredible gift I had been given in my two years of industry experience at Pandemic. But at the time I was too immature, too angry and too disillusioned to process my experiences clearly.

I was a student during my entire tenure at Pandemic and still had a few semesters left on my degree. I sat in class, unable to take notes without feeling a deep burn in my forearms and I seethed. I had no idea what I would do after I finished college. I could not imagine the physical pain a desk job would cause due to the herniated disk and RSI. I would be unable to do any job that involved standing up for long periods of time. My future looked hopeless.

“How can I make them pay?” 

In the months following my layoff this thought popped up. A lot. It was a very soothing fantasy to imagine I could somehow extract my revenge upon Pandemic. Luckily I did not act upon this immature instinct, because my now 10 year career in the industry was built on the foundation of that first job.

I can certainly empathize with the [tale of Nathan (RC) Peters](http://kotaku.com/i-freelanced-on-halo-4-its-time-for-gamings-contract-510353357) and his time as a QA contractor on Halo 4. I worked at Pandemic Studios for two years. The first year I was an unpaid intern working 2-3 days a week and full time in the summer. The second year I was a paid tester, earning $10 an hour, working 3 days a week during school and 80-100 hours a week during the summer that coincided with Battlefront’s crunch. I was laid off as part of the natural team contraction after the game shipped. I walked away with a broken heart, repetitive stress injury in both arms, persistent pain in my lower back and legs and a Lead Tester credit on a massively successful Star Wars game.

Eight and a half years later the injuries have healed. My bruised ego has mended. I have worked for game developers big and small, have lectured on game design around the globe and have contributed to over 30 shipped games across every platform. I left EA and [co-founded a game studio](http://quarterspiral.com/). Whether our title [Enhanced Wars](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/05/23/enhanced-wars-developer-demo) is or is not a success, as long as it is launched I will have accomplished a major life goal. I have a long career in videogames to look forward to.

Of course, I couldn’t see any of this when I handed over my employee badge. Or when I packed up my car, drove across the country and moved into my parent’s house in the suburbs. Or when the job working on websites with a childhood friend I moved home for collapsed. How could I see then that I would be able to make my game design dreams come true? As I stared into the void of an unknown future, fantasizing desperately about extracting revenge, all I could see was a pink slip.

I did not work at Certain Affinity. I did not work on Halo 4. I cannot speak to Mr. Peters’ personal experience. What I can do is share some things I’ve learned over the past 10 years that I wish I knew back when I was killing myself in the QA job that is the foundation of my career.

The first thing I wish I knew was EA Chief Creative Director Rich Hilleman’s “Shit in the bag” anecdote. You can hear it firsthand in [this spectacular conversation and lecture between Rich and Warren Spector](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVnkI_F6KKA&amp;list=SPC4AF467F9391D767&amp;index=13) at about the hour and seven minute mark. I had the privilege of working for Rich and this frame of understanding the workplace is one of the most important lessons from my 4 years at EA.

In the talk, Rich explains what it’s really like for leaders on a game team to be in charge. “They have a bag of shit. You can’t smell it, you can’t see it, but it’s there. And I guarantee you they know it’s there. And for the most part, your relationship with them is defined by this bag. You’re either putting shit in the bag or you’re taking shit out of the bag.” 
Rich goes on to explain that the secret to success on a game team is to make sure you are removing shit from your boss’s bag. Asking the lead designer to let you sit in on design meetings? That is putting shit in the bag. People are busy, crunch time is tense, and no one wants an unqualified QA guy wasting everyone’s time by “contributing” to a design session when he should be using that “down time” to perform unglamorous regression tests.

At Pandemic I was constantly trying to prove my worth, hoping for that moment when someone would “see my genius” and convince me to give up college and start working there full time. What I didn’t realize was that my enthusiastic attempts to impress were not helping. I spent a lot of time embarrassing myself without knowing, handing out a bunch of stinking turds to busy people with far too much shit in their bag to care about a lowly QA guy.

The second thing I wish I knew is that getting a job on a game team, especially an entry level job, is all about your portfolio of work. I thought I deserved a job on the level design team. Why? Because I worked 80+ hour weeks, hand shredded hundreds of discs, ordered and picked up team dinners, made sure new builds were waiting for people when they showed up in the morning and had some ideas for a tutorial level involving blowing up Ewoks. 

The true path to that level design job I thought I deserved involved building levels. The tools of game design are cheap and plentiful. If I had any sense, I would have spent all my free time modding Dark Reign 2 (a Pandemic game) until I had a built and released a large number of multiplayer levels into the player community and had tangible proof of my ability to a) use Pandemic developed tools and b) make fun multiplayer maps that players responded to. Then, perhaps, I would have deserved that interview for an entry level design job that hundreds of others would line up for.

The period of my life after being laid off from Pandemic was one of my darkest (which alone, shows what a privileged life I have led overall and that I really shouldn’t be complaining about anything). I spent 2 years at Pandemic and am grateful every day to the many people who allowed me to be there despite all the stinky turds I’m sure I left in every corner of the office. 

QA can be a shit job. QA is monotonous. QA is unglamorous. QA is thankless. But work is work; no one promised this would be easy. I owe my career to QA and the people and company who gave me that job. I only wish that back then, I had perspective instead of vicodin to help me ease the pain of one of life’s many inescapable setbacks."

On my outer layer, my life would seem pretty good. I have a successful internship at a big media giant. I'm proud about that. I'm a junior in college. I'm talking to a wonderful girl who I would do anything for. She's so beautiful and sweet.

But..

But there's so many fuck-ups of my character I would never tell her. I have the most wonderful parents in the world. Thanks to a marijuana habit, I've stolen over $2,000 from them since age 15. I've lied and cheated. I've lost all their trust, but they're the closest people in the world to me. It's going to be impossible to win back their trust so I don't understand the reason to go on here in life. My parents did everything to give me a wonderful life and I've just repaid them by lying, stealing, being a terrible 19yo son.

They're ashamed of me. I see why.

My inner layer is messed up. I'm a liar who's fairly addicted to his craft. I've made a lot of progress in the past few years, but I still catch myself in a lie once in awhile. And it disgusts me. Even if I change, the people closest to me won't be able to see it because a liar is all they know.

I would slit my wrists but I don't want anyone close to me dealing with a body. Bridge is probably the best option if it comes to that. I hate myself, I hate who I've become. I am such a selfish person so would the selfish act of suicide really be that much of a stretch for me? Seriously.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Felt good to type this out, I've been crying this morning and now that feeling faded."
1fkeo6,4,2013-06-03,I want to thank you.,MsLT,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1fkeo6/i_want_to_thank_you/,"Dear Mama Mac,

You were always there for me. I started out kind of shy, a little plucky, and totally full of nerves. I wanted to badly to perform, and you let me sing for you. You accepted me into the choir and helped me grow. You (and Mr. Harris, and the directors) gave me a shot on the stage for the school musical. Me, a freshman! A lead role! I was so excited.

I was bullied there, too. At first, it was brutal. I can't prove that you did, but I think you talked to the older kids. Asked them to ease up-- and eventually, I became part of the musical ""family."" Suddenly, the jokes weren't on me anymore, I was part of making them. And they were never aimed at anyone after that.

As I grew, you guided me. I came out of my shell and stopped being so shy. I started to stand up for the things that mattered to me. You were the only teacher in the whole high school to ever send someone out for bullying-- you would NOT stand for any of that shit in YOUR classroom.

You went above and beyond for me. When I stupidly mixed up the audition times for two different events, and thought the later one came first (when, of course, it was the earlier one) you took the entire damned school bus full of kids to my house, banged down my door, and got me onto that bus. You got administrative hell for that one-- and I will never forget it. I will never forget the gratitude I felt for having that audition. And for you, I made it. Into all state choir! Because of you. For you.

You made sure I was part of the musical every year after that, and you let me audition for the select choirs. You made me a part of something special for the first time in my life. You let me go accept our choir's award on our big competition trip-- myself and another girl who had been in choir all 4 years, and who had sung our hearts out. And we were so proud of ourselves, and you were so proud. Always, so proud of us. Of me. I called you ""mama"" even in class.

When my mother would forget me after select choir rehearsals ended, you would take me home. I would wish you Happy Mother's Day every year, and you treated me so nicely. I was never used to having someone be proud of me. Someone to teach me when I was wrong, and help me grow to be right. To stop being so angry, and start accepting other people-- even if they were wrong. Even if I couldn't change their opinions. You taught me to love my peers, even after being so numb to them. After they had hurt me so much. You helped me grow.

After high school, I went on a choir trip touring Europe. Guess who got me that audition, too? Of course it was you. My savior. You got me out of my house for the summer. Nobody would forget me in Europe, nobody would leave me behind.

And when I came to you, a year out of high school, and I told you about what had happened. The pregnancy, the abortion. You cried for me. You held my hands and told me that everything would be alright, and yeah it sucked now, but that I'd be okay. You taught me that it was okay to hurt, and it was okay to be sad. You hugged me. You cried for me. You told me to learn from it, to grow, and to follow my dreams. My passions. What made me happy, instead of what my parents wanted for me.

I've visited you since. Now, I'm a senior in college. Theatre major-- and I also owe that to you, because originally I was going for psychology. I hated it. You gave me the strength. I've visited your house, accidentally crashed dinner parties with other high school teachers. You invited me in, anyway. I've gotten coffee with you. I've laughed and cried with you. You've even met my most recent boyfriend-- who's been around 2 years now, can you believe it? You approved of him, and that meant a lot to me.

Without you in my life, I'd have no motivation. Nobody to strive to be more like. No goals, because nobody ever pushed me before. Nobody inspired me. Now, I'm working an internship that I never thought I'd get. I beat out other people-- me, with the shitty grades and worse self esteem. Because I could just hear you in the back of my mind, going, ""Well, Lauren, if you don't TRY you'll never get anywhere. Give it a shot! Worst that happens is you don't get it, and then try again somewhere else."" I could hear your voice, your inflection. I figured, well shit, it's good advice. And I nailed it. It's mine-- and when I told you on Facebook, you were so happy. So proud of me. You wrote me a heartfelt reply.

I'm gonna stop by the high school tomorrow if I can. I don't live in the same state anymore, so it's hard to visit you. But whenever I'm back in the hometown, I try to catch a glimpse. Sometimes, I leave a note in your mailbox when you're gone and school's out. Or I get a ""guest pass"" and just go straight down to the music wing, where I'll hear you plonking out notes on the piano and singing with the choir. I get an ache in my heart when I realize it isn't my home anymore.

But home is where the heart is, right? So, Mrs. Mac, I owe it to you that I've even got a heart anymore. You gave me something to love, and a passion to pursue. 

I can't wait to see you tomorrow, and I hope you continue to inspire other students. I know I'm not the only one.

You are the most amazing woman I've ever known. I hope other teachers strive to be like you, every single day. :)

Love, always,

Your most stubborn pupil,

Lauren"

1fol1b,95,2013-06-04,My roommate is creeping me the hell out.,horcruxslut,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fol1b/my_roommate_is_creeping_me_the_hell_out/,"NOTE: update #1 can be found here
http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ft5z6/my_roommate_is_creeping_me_the_hell_out_update_1/

Okay so this all started a couple weeks ago. I really don't know what's going on and it's really started to freak me out, to the point where I've just started ignoring him and avoiding him whenever he's around me.

So anyway, some background...I moved into a small house with 5 other people as part of a program we all got accepted into. We all have full time jobs, and work all day, but we eat dinner together several times a week and we're all pretty close. There's three bedrooms; myself and the two other girls share one room, two boys share another room, and our intern leader has his own room in the back of the house. 

A couple weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night cause I really had to pee, so I got out of bed quietly so I didn't wake up the other girls, and I walked down the hall to the bathroom. Usually before we all go to bed, we make sure all the lights in the living room are off to save energy and stuff, but I noticed that the lamp in the corner of the living room was on, which was unusual but I just figured someone just left it on or whatever. 

I went to go turn it off, and as I rounded the corner, one of my roommates, Scott, was just sitting in a chair we have at a table in the living room. He wasn't seated at the table but just kind of in the middle of the room, in a big rolling office chair we have. He was sitting wearing his big bluetooth headphones, and he had his eyes closed. He was sitting so still, like a freaking statue or something. Eye closed, mouth pressed together in a thin line. I couldn't hear any music or anything, so I have no idea what he was listening to, if anything at all. 

I know it doesn't sound really scary, but when it's like 1 AM and you're full of pee, seeing someone sitting there like that is really creepy. Also, Scott is a very heavy sleeper, and goes to bed kind of early, sometimes 9:00 PM. So the fact that he was awake at 1 AM was already weird enough.

Anyway, it creeped me out, so I just went to the bathroom and went back to sleep. I thought maybe he was meditating or like, praying or something. Maybe he couldn't sleep and needed some relaxing music? I dunno. The next few nights I woke up anywhere from 1-2AM. I almost always wake up multiple times in the night, so this isn't unusual. Scott wasn't out there the next few nights, but one night in the middle of the week, I woke up really thirsty and got up to get some water. I noticed the lamp was on in the living room again, and Scott was out there, headphones on, eyes closed. He was still sitting in the middle of the room in the black chair, but this time his mouth was wide open. He was just sitting there with his mouth wide fucking open. I swear, it looked like he wasn't even breathing. I counted to ten and he hadn't moved an inch. 

It freaked me out too much, so I just went back to my room and shut and locked our door. I decided I was probably just overreacting, so I hadn't told anyone else in my house yet.

Fast forward about a week later, which would be about a week ago. Things get weirder. Woke up for no reason (stupid body), and just laid in bed for a while. Honestly, I didn't want to walk around the house or anything in case Scott was out in the living room creepin' up the place. So I just laid there a while, trying to fall back asleep. Then I started hearing this really low sound. It sounded like someone talking. I got out of bed and opened our door and poked my head out. There was no light on, but the sound was coming from the living room. I walked out there and saw Scott. This time he was sitting indian-style in the middle of the room. On the floor, no chair. The headphones were gone, and his eyes were closed. He was sitting there very still and straight-backed, mumbling something really weird. It almost sounded like a different language. I didn't say anything for a minute, but decided to finally call him out on it, cause this shit was so creepy.

I walked a little closer to him and said, ""Scott, what are you doing?""

The mumbling continued, he didn't move an inch.

""Scott, knock it off, I'm trying to sleep.""

...nothing. I reached out and touched his shoulder and his eyes flew open and snapped right to my face, and you guys, I swear to god his eyes were black. Just all black. He stared at me for a second and I stared back, almost ready to scream. Then he blinked, and his eyes were back to normal. He looked up at me and stood up, looking around like he didn't know where he was. 

I took a step back and asked him if he was okay. He just looked at me, and then smiled so big that I could see all of his teeth. It was so creepy. Without dropping the creepy smile, he just turned and went straight into his room and shut the door behind him.

That's the last thing that's happened, and now it's June 4th, and I figured I'd write this up, in case you guys have any advice or anything. It's really freaking me out and I have no idea what's up with Scott. 

I'll keep you guys updated if anything else happens."

 |When it comes to picky people, men overpower women. There's a few women who are particular, but by far men are more picky about their makeup and hair.
 |A scene that's 15 seconds in a movie can sometimes take up to 4 hours to shoot!
[I assume that's because of the whole, ""I'm a man, don't make me look made up"" thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cac2njb?context=5)|Yeah, and not feeling comfortable. I try and make them as comfortable and attended to as possible :)
[As a male, I have no experience or knowledge of make up at all. However, I have keloids on my chest and back (skin infection that causes bad scaring\) and unsightly deep pores on my face. What can I do to cover/clean this up to feel more comfortable in public/take my shirt off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabv2lu?context=5)|There's some primers that are meant to fill in pores for a smooth surface. A primer is applied after the moisturizer and its applied everywhere, except the eyelids. If you are comfortable wearing any makeup, there are some good tinted moisturizers and now they even have lines that are targeted for men! As for scarring, depending on the color of the scar, you can use a correcting concealer and then a normal concealer over it. If your scars are red, you'd use a green correcting concealer. If they are more purple, go with a yellow correcting concealer. There's a concealer called ""full cover"" by makeup forever and it was designed for covering scars! It's waterproof and dries matte :)
[What bout just using BB Cream? Skin79, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabwwa0?context=5)|That works if you have good skin to start with!
[I was surprised when I met a make-up artist that they got into the field via art, as opposed to just being really good at make-up.  Whats your background? Have to say what you guys do is freaking amazing , and not just the injury/scar stuff - just the 'natural' makeup is really genius sometimes. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabv0ie?context=5)|Hey thank you! I actually am not much of an artist outside of makeup! I never painted or drew or anything. I didn't really think of makeup as being my career but I knew college wasn't for me and I liked the thought of doing makeup for runway shows and high fashion magazines. Little did I know that that side of the industry is horrible and doesn't make me happy! I then started working on film sets and even with the 12-16 hour days I love what I do and can't imagine doing anything else.
 |Doing beauty makeup is actually harder than one would think. It takes a lot of skill to do a ""no makeup"" look. I personally think it's one of the hardest looks to do. I also really love doing men's grooming. It's similar to a ""no makeup"" look. It's like a puzzle. You have to cover blemishes and bags but make it look like its their skin!
[In what way is high fashion and runway horrible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabxad9?context=5)|The attitude of people and the cut throat mentality isn't something that encourages me and makes me happy.

[Assuming you're in LA, any word on upcoming PA gigs? It's been a little slow lately...  Also, mad respect for the make-up crew. I've seen some pretty amazing work. It truly is an art. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabv4a0?context=5)|Thank you! Unfortunately I have no clue about PA work, but if you're willing to work for free even just for a little, that's a great way to get in with a production company and show you're really interested and not just in it for a buck. And yes, LA. It's been crazy busy!

[What if any formal training do you have?  Also, is there certain training required or expected of makeup artists?  How competitive is your field?   Are you in high demand, or are there tons of MAs and you just have to network and hustle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabwilu?context=5)|I have a certification, but no license is required. It's extremely Competitive and there are so many people who want in! I've found that the better you are, the more work you'll get. So being on high demand is a person to person basis :)
[How long does it normally take you to give somebody a full makeover?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabwnef?context=5)|Anywhere from 40-75 min.
[Do make up artists have most of the input into the look of an actor or are you guys given specific instructions to go for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabwi3j?context=5)|Half and half. They usually give us freedom unless they have a specific visual in their head, but even so.. We get a lot of creative freedom.
[Do top celebs really have someone to do just their makeup that travels with them full time? If so what does this person make on average per year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cac0hxu?context=5)|Yeah personal makeup artists are semi common. Maybe 1/2 of all A listers have one. Oh man, they make a lot haha I don't know the actual number but to give you a gauge, if you're with an agency, your low day rate is $1200/day. So when you're traveling with someone non stop I would imagine it'd be double or a little more.

That was pretty cool and not to mention they pay well :) I've also worked with some cool people on smaller sets, like James Cromwell, Biff from back to the future, and a lot of young hollywooders.
[BIFF!!! Casino Biff was the best.  I think you're thinking of Thomas Wilson if it was Biff from Back to the Future.  Link to en.wikipedia.org.  Anyway thanks for the reply.

How did you get your start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/caca97p?context=5)|I went to a makeup school, and it was great, but I don't think it's necessary unless she wants to do the special fx side. Get an internship and take everything in. Learn while you can mess up without big repercussions. If she does want to go to makeup school there are TONS of options!
[Also, how long do you have to spend on set? seeing some actors are up at 4am and recording all day do you have to be around til they finish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabx428?context=5)|I have to be on set before actors arrive and until they leave. The longest day I've had is 18 hours. That sucked. I have control of continuity because its part of my job :)
[How did you get yourself your first movie make-up gig? Did that lead to others quickly or did it take a long time for follow up work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabwdfr?context=5)|My neighbors best friends girlfriend needed makeup for a movie and boom! My first movie :) I get a lot of jobs through word of mouth.

A lot Of productions don't want to pay for good CGI and effects so they pay us! I haven't ever lost out on a job to a computer (yet!) but I would be surprised if makeup artists completely disappeared. Digitally Doing things, even if done well, still looks like its done digitally!
[I have issues blending my eye shadow up by my brow bone, like going from my crease color up. What type of blending brush do you recommend that won't break my wallet? I have heard good things about the MAC 217, but would like to know what you would recommend. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabxn0x?context=5)|I personally don't like MAC brushes. They're overpriced and low quality. Check out sigma brushes! They are really really excellent! Also, get a blending brush that has a pretty big circumference .5 inches. That'll Help spread the color up.
[Have you ever had an actor have a reaction to a make up?  Maybe they were allergic to it, or they were angry you used a make up they had moral objections to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabxawu?context=5)|Oh yeah, one of my girls has a severe latex allergy, I mean even the natural latex in fruit.

It has to be ""perfect"" but you don't want to see it. Especially with HD films everywhere now, you see EVERYTHING. Every day makeup has more variance because you aren't being watching by thousands of people :)
[Not to get to off topic. When I retire from the Army I plan on seeking a career in   Law enforcement.  3Rd grade teacher.  Working in the movie industry helping with the sets.

Go to an aesthetician who won't do a pretty relaxing facial, but really clean your skin. I would give that a month to start seeing a big change and if the problems still persist, you could always wear a tinted moisturizer or spot conceal (only put makeup on the zits)

I have some actors that don't take care of their skin and smoke and party all the time. That's especially hard because their skin is so dehydrated that they can't hold makeup well and their skin ""eats"" it up. When I see it on TV I cover my eyes and then it usually turns out great!! But those are the most nerve racking moments of my job.

Photoshoots on the other hand.. I book 8 hour full days and anything more is extra. I don't enjoy photoshoots as much so, I'm less willing to work without overtime.
[I feel like we are always waiting on hair and makeup and wardrobe.  It boggles my mind, because they have the least equipment on set.  If we can puke the whole 40, push all our carts to set, build staging, light the scene and still be waiting on hair, something is wrong.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fn5du/hey_everyone_im_a_makeup_artist_currently_on_set/cabx05g?context=5)|I agree.

1fqkwr,2,2013-06-05,"Changing career paths from medicine to CS, should I pursue an MS or a BS?",PursuingCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fqkwr/changing_career_paths_from_medicine_to_cs_should/,"(tl;dr @ end if you prefer :))

Some background about me: I am 24 y/o, have a BS in biology, and just finished my first year of medical school. A few months ago I realized medicine was not the best fit for me. I was making passing grades (I hovered around the 50% of my class), but to say pursuing my goal of becoming a doctor was making me miserable would be putting it lightly. I found medical school to be memorization olympics, which I was never good at wrote memorizing to begin with and quite frankly hated doing. What was more troubling for me was I started to lose interest in taking care of patients. I found  ""patient interactions"" to be controlled and routine, time with patients to be very limited, and little autonomy for how I wanted to treat patients. Once I lost interest in being a doctor, it became very stressful for me to keep going.

I am now planning to pursue a career in CS. I've always had an interest in computers and programming. I took an AP Java class in high school (which I enjoyed), and built a few websites using HTML and joomla for fun while in college. I made my best grades in classes which required math and analytical thinking (i.e. Calc 1, physics), and found them MUCH more enjoyable than my biology classes which were mostly pure recall. I just recently started watching the MIT CS-6.00 Introduction to CS and Programming classes, and I actually like watching these lectures (going to lectures was a chore before).

I am thinking about either pursuing a BS or MS in CS at my state school. Here are the costs/time I could find for each:

BS: 2.5 years to finish (transfer credits fulfill the gen ed req. classes), $5k per semester, scholarship opportunities for second year and beyond if I do well in my classes
MS: 1 year of remedial courses + 1.5 years of grad school, $5.4k per semester, financial assistance for being a TA/research assistant if I get through the remedial classes

So, essentially, time/cost are a wash. The main contrast I see with a BS is I will get a broader, more general base of knowledge, and have opportunities to do internships in the 2 summers off. With the MS, it would be more narrow and focused in a specific area of CS (cryptography, informatics, AI, etc.) that I will have to do a project on. I think the BS might give me a better opportunity to try different things to figure out what I want to do within CS, but the MS might carry more prestige/higher income in the job market.

My plan right now is to enroll in the fall as an undergrad and start taking some of the required classes for the graduate program, and then decide along the way if I want to pursue the MS or stick it out with the BS. 

tl;dr: Should I pursue an MS or BS in CS? "
1fq2g0,4,2013-06-05,Am I screwed? (CS student),lavalampz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fq2g0/am_i_screwed_cs_student/,"Hello, I'm another stressed CS student (go figure, right?)

I'm entering my senior year of a comp sci BS program this fall, and I graduate in May 2014.  Like many others, I enjoy coding in my free time and regularly work on small projects outside of work/school.  I want to go into software development.  

I'm concerned about my lack of experience.  I've had a summer/winter break internship at an IT company (paid) for a couple of years now.  I don't do any programming - it's your general network administrator/technician type of gig.  I'm soon getting moved to a branch of the company that does customizations for an ERP system, but up until now I have done no development here whatsoever.  I previously had a web dev internship where we worked on a startup site/application using ASP.NET MVC4, but it didn't go far due to lack of leadership.

I'm really afraid that my lack of experience in development is going to hurt me.  I have a 3.45/4.0 GPA as a CS major with math and biology minors.  I enjoy doing small coding projects in my free time, but I lack any ""real world"" experience in programming.  I'm doing this internship for the rest of the summer, which will hopefully move to more development-related areas soon but I'm unsure what to expect.

As I go into my senior year, I'm at a loss for what to do.  I've drafted a résumé to send out to companies in the NYC area for the upcoming year, as I go to school in Long Island NY.  I can't help but feel I'm going to graduate and be totally screwed.

Does anyone have any insight?  Thanks."

I have a plan to expand my knowledge of CS, critique it please.

Step 1: Learn HTML &amp; CSS and some JS
Step 2: During the summer follow Stanford's iOS lectures on iTunesU on developing iOS apps and learn some ObjC on the way.
Step 3: Take my AP CS class next year which covers Java.
Step 4: Inter at a local software company before college.
Step 5: Attend University of Utah majoring in CS and intern at local companies while there..

This is a barebones version of my ""plan""
Developing on iOS is something I really want to do, however besides the skills I listed above are there any that would be valuable for me to pick up on the way? Any advice is much appreciated!"

1ft5z6,38,2013-06-06,My roommate is creeping me the hell out. (Update #1),horcruxslut,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ft5z6/my_roommate_is_creeping_me_the_hell_out_update_1/,"You can read my first post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fol1b/my_roommate_is_creeping_me_the_hell_out/

Hey guys, so I took some of your advice and decided to talk to one of my other roommates, Everett. I told him about the ""black-eyes"" thing, cause that part freaked me out the most. He said it was probably just a trick of the light or whatever, which I guess could be true, but the fucking creepy smile was definitely real. I couldn't have imagined that. 

I asked him if he noticed Scott acting weird or anything lately, since they're in the same room and probably closer than Scott and I. He said the only weird thing he notices is that almost every day during the week, Scott will get out of bed at like 4 AM and leave the house. He doesn't say anything to Everett. He doesn't let him know where he's going or anything. He probably doesn't even know Everett hears him leave, otherwise he'd probably say something, right? Everett said he'll fall back asleep and when his alarm wakes him up at 7 AM, Scott's back in bed, like he never even left.

Some of you have said I should try to record him in the middle of the night if something happens. I would do this, but my camera was stolen during a break-in we had last thanksgiving. They took my camera, my roommate's iPod, our intern's laptop, and Scott's fireproof lock-box. I was pretty disappointed. But I will try to have my phone at the ready if I see anything or hear anything in the middle of the night. Getting some video would be awesome, because I could show Everett and I won't look totally crazy.

Update as of June 6th:
Okay, so I wrote the above yesterday, but didn't have time to post it. But after I talked to Everett last night, we both went to bed. I was having a hard time staying asleep and pretty much was drifting out of sleep all night. Around 3:30 AM, I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep for some reason. I read my kindle with a book light for a while, but got bored with that. I decided to quietly step out on the front porch and smoke a cigarette, and maybe I'd catch Scott leaving and be able to ask him what was up.

I pulled on my shoes and grabbed my lighter and walked out. The living room was empty, and the lights all off. Scott must have been in bed, sleeping. Now, usually we lock up the security door and the main front door. Since the break-in, we had our locks replaced and now it takes forever to open the doors, cause there's three different locks, with two keys. 

We NEVER leave the doors unlocked during the night while we're sleeping, so you can imagine how shocked I was when both the doors were unlocked. I was a little scared, but sometimes Everett stays up really late to make phone calls, so I figured maybe he got up to take a call. 

Instead, I stepped outside to see Scott sitting on the couch on our front porch. It was pitch black outside. We have a light out there, but it was off. Instead of the headphone/creepy meditation mumbling routine, Scott was writing a letter or something. But he was scribbling like a madman, in the complete dark. I could barely see the paper, so I don't believe he saw what he was doing. He was also like, mumbling all fast and angry. It was terrifying. I don't think he saw me, but I did manage to record some video. He was so distracted that he didn't notice. The quality is bad, cause I used one of the first iPhones, but I'll upload it soon. I have a friend coming to stay with us this weekend, so I'll be busy, but maybe me and her can figure out something with Scott. I dunno. 

Thanks for reading and offering advice and stuff. Writing it all out, it doesn't seem very scary, but when it's happening in person, in the dark while everyone else is asleep, it's extremely unsettling. I'm going to talk to Everett more soon about it. Maybe he can find that paper Scott was writing on."

[Does money actually get you a lot of girls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadge42?context=5)|I hate to say it: but yes it does. 
[You said you blew all your money on ""expensive toys, trips, and bad ideas"" What was the WORST idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfmeg?context=5)|1) Buying a house. People always forget:     a.) a house is an illiquid investment so you cant get your money back when you need it most    b) there's millions of hidden costs when you buy a house    c) the bank owns your house. not you. When you sell your soul to a bank, you reap what you sow.    d) ""choosing yourself"" requires freedom. the white picket fence becomes a prison bar.
 |2) I put $2mm into a wireless device company that didn't work out. But in general I kept doubling down everywhere because it wasn't any one bad investment but a psychology that I needed MORE to be happy. Choosing Yourself requires a philosophy that LESS actually creates abundance in life. 
[If you have 15 million can't you just buy the entire house instead of taking out a mortgage, thus making so the bank doesn't own it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgvz0?context=5)|Sure. That's a different story. Thats less than 1% of people. But even then, you can rent fantastic places then, keep most of your cash, and be able to move whenever you want. I choose freedom! 
[On the flip side what is the best thing you used your money to buy and the most fun thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgigk?context=5)|The best thing I ever did with my money was just keep it in cash. Cash in the bank lets me know i can watch the river in the morning and not worry about money. Money doesn't solve all your problems but it solves your money problems.
 |More important to buy memories than materials. 
[I'm starting to realize that when you focus on how little money you have that you are never happy because you always think you need more. If you respect the money you DO have then it will respect you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgp5v?context=5)|Very true. Not only that, if you focus on building rather than spending, the money respects you even more. If you give, you buid.
 |But to give, you must be healthy. You must clean out all the pipes in the way I describe in the book. 
[With that Rationale, we should all rent?  I mean, what about the Equity gained when buying a home?  What about people that own their home outright? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgzbh?context=5)|The equity is very minimal. The average american flips their house every five years. And you are forgetting all the property taxes and maintenance that eat away at that equity.
 |If you believe in housing as an investment, buy a diversified REIT on the stock market.
 |If you want real equity that can go up in value, take the downpaymenbt you would've made, rent a house, and start a business. Opportunity profit is much better and you will build real equity. 
[I am asking why you specifically did not buy the house outright when you would appear to have easily had the funds to do so.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhgvm?context=5)|I think no matter how you buy a house, cash or leverage, its a bad investment. Sometimes using all cash is even worse than using leverage, depending on interest rates.I could've bought the whole house outright. But then I would've gone bankrupt faster and run out of money. Particularly when the housing market would've prevented me from pulling money out of the house.
 |Never have a good chunk of your portfolio in an illiquid investment. Cash is king. 
[What is your advice for someone who is a successful consultant but isn't bringing in the big money? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfsrb?context=5)|Your best new customers are your current customers.
 |Get a waiters paid.
 |Go to a cafe with the pad.
 |At the top of each page put the name of a current customer. Write down 10 - 15 ideas of additional services you can provide each customer. Even if it has nothing to do with your current biz.
 |Then offer those services. Be more and more indispensable. This will generate more loyaly, more money, and word of mouth will get you new customers. 
[Do you have any tips for someone going into the business world? What type of degrees would be nice, what colleges in the country are nice, etc? I heard the business world was tough but very rewarding. Please share how early life was for you when you were starting up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfrwr?context=5)|Forget everything in your question. Forget these words: ""business world"" , ""degrees"", ""colleges"", ""tough"".
 |Here's what you do: every day try to figure out ten ideas that will create value for people. You need to build the idea muscle or it atrophies like any other muscle. School doesn't do that. School atrophies your brain.
 |Don't expect your ideas to be good. After about six months they will start ot be good. Become an idea machine. help people. Eventually charge people to help them. Now you are in business. Take a fulltime job so you can get paid while you are building your idea muscle.
 |Introduce 2-10 people a day to each other who you think can help each other. Build out your network this way. Deliver value.
 |That is your schooling. Nothing else will ever work.
[I hate people and generally want to set them on fire.  Otherwise, this seems like valuable advice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgydg?context=5)|Fair enough. But find the people you don't hate and figure out what they need. I hate a lot of people also. So here's what I do: i never see them. They dont exist for me. 
[What was your biggest failure? Success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfnf1?context=5)|I've had many failures. The biggest. Was probably losing $1mm a week one summer CASH, in the stock market and other investments and spending. Until I was dead broke, begging for money from my parents, losing my house, my family, everything. I had to make it back from scratch.
 |My biggest success was finally figuring out what got me back each time I failed. Having a philosophy of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health which I am happy to explain further. I was on the floor putting craigslists ads up for simple human contact while I felt the whole world was against me. Getting up off the floor and not killing myself was my biggest success.
 |Financially I've sold companies for 8 digit figures but I don't consider those successes but a natural outcome of being internally healthy. It happens so fast its like magic. 
[To be going from millions to begging your parents for cash is pretty damn low. Fuck. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgcdj?context=5)|Then they refused to lend it to me. So I hung up and didn't speak to them. Then six months later I still hadn't spoken to them. My dad had a stroke and died. That didn't feel too good to me. 
[Can you explain, in a nutshell, how to go about becoming internally healthy? I feel I'm on the bottom right now and really want to get out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgud2?context=5)|Yes. i call it ""the daily practice"" but really its my practice. What works for you might be different. In the book I also describe a ""simple daily practice"" to ease into it.
 |I eat well - i sleep well. I used to never sleep. Sleeping is the key to ALL health - i dont drink. Drinking is a depressant and has a lot of sugar.  - i only engage with positive people. Even on this AMA i don't engage with people trying to bring me down. NEVER.  - i read every day. 2 hours. Books. not web.  - i write 10 ideas a day. Doesn't matter what kind of ideas. The key is to get the idea muscle going.  - I am every day grateful. if i start to slip into thinking about scarcity, i change to think about abundance. It is such a pleasure to do this.
 |Do all of the above for six months. I guarantee its like magic what happens then. Please try it. I dont care if you buy my book or not. Try the above. 
[How did you come to terms with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadh4rn?context=5)|I never came to terms with it. When I wake up, i dont think about it. I think: what can I do to help people today. Yesterday is over. 
[Remarkably similar to what a tibetan yogi told me one time.  Except he added yoga to the list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhelx?context=5)|Yoga is good. Worth noting that in ""the yoga sutras"" which is the main text for yoga, the physical part of yoga takes up only 1.5% of the entire text. The other 98.5% of the yoga sutras is about how to clean out all aspects of your life, not just the stretching of muscles. 
[That's rough. I hope you eventually come to terms with it. How about your mom? How's your relationship with her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadide6?context=5)|I think thats key. To let your kids know that disciplining is just about setting boundaries. Not about love or hate.
[As a parent you've given me lots to think about, like letting my kids know that my disciplining them or refusing them something doesn't mean I cut them out and they're always welcomed back. Also, will be teaching them to pull their own weight. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadide6?context=5)|One thing I listened to a few weeks ago was a talk by Jim Sheils about scheduling ""board meetings"" with your kids. Google him. It was very valuable info to me. 
[James - how do I get rid of jealousy and envy in my life?  I can't force myself to learn how to code - it doesn't interest me at all - but I feel like a low life for not getting my shit together and just learning it... But it's like pulling teeth. I hate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgbd0?context=5)|I sleep 8 hours a day - i dont drink - i dont eat junk food. junk food has jealousy in it, as weird as that sounds.  - i NEVER gossip - i read books. I write down ten ideas a day - i am always grateful for everything in my life.  If you do these things, what i call ""the simple daily practice"" in my book, then you wont have room for jealousy and envy. Another thing is to note (NOTE!) when these feelings arise and try to replace them with gratitude. 
[*i dont eat junk food. junk food has jealousy in it, as weird as that sounds.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadi7gx?context=5)|Try this experiment. Eat a bag of Doritos RIGHT NOW. Then go to the gym. Take notes on what you are feeling. Then report back here. 
[Would you give an example of what ten ideas should look like to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadi9xz?context=5)|Ok, ten ideas for a business right now off the top of my head:  A) set up your local businesses with FB fan pages and campaigns on how ot use them. Charge a small monthly fee.  B) Write a $1000 course on how to get rid of all your student loan debt C) Make a job site for local temp staffing. Nobody has done this D) Use twitter data for predictions like box office revs and charge the movie companies, record labels, etc. Or political data. You can find twitter data that correlates with election results.  E) the smart toilet - the toilet collects your urine, analyzes it using licensed tests, and sends you an SMS with the results (good for cancer analysis, diabetes, etc) F) take the top 100 public domain books and add ""with Vampires"" at the end. Slightly rewrite them all. Republish them on Amazon G) create a search engine of all shared economy sites.  H) make an uber for private jets I) make a stock exchange for books. bestselling authors IPO the books they are working on so you can get a piece of the royalties and they can get more cash up front J) smart refrigerator: knows when you are running low on critical items (eggs) and orders them automatically to be delivered.
 |Some of the above are bad. Some maybe ok. Who knows. The key is to exercise the idea muscle until your brain sweats. Every day. 
[What is one thing kids in this country need to know and to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgkib?context=5)|How to fail. We reward kids who get As in school. This is horrible. Kids need to know how to get a C- and what it means and how to learn from it.
 |Second, most kids have no clue how to sell an idea. How to communicate. Creativity is not nourished. 
[How do you come back from the failure?  When you have $143 how did you get traction and financing for the next company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfupt?context=5)|Coming back means ""delivering so much value for others that they pay me or deliver value back to me in some way"".
 |In that particular instance (the #143) instance I had to basically sell all my posessions to get a little bit of money. Then I wrote software to model the stock market. Then I used my software to write articles that I got paid for by financial sites and other hedge fund managers wanted me (my software) to manage their money and they paid me for it and it worked out well.
 |But it took a good six months or more of no drinking, eating well, sleeping well, ELIMINATE all negative people. (I'm going to say that again: ELIMINATE all negative people from your life. Do not engage with them at all while you are trying to survive), building your idea muscle, and being grateful for the abundance that is always huge in your life.
 |Then expect to build. I tell people if you do the above your life changes in six months. It does. Its magic what happens but jump on every opportunity. 
[*ELIMINATE all negative people. I'm going to say that again: ELIMINATE all negative people.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhyy9?context=5)|By ""Eliminate"" I simply mean, ""Don't engage"". They will always try to engage you. And your brain will want to engage back. It's fun. It's sport. But don't do it.
[Well, that escalated dramatically..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhyy9?context=5)|Btw, its not the neighbor across town. its the colleage, the family menber, the ""friend"", etc. that could be the most negative in your life. 
[Where is the legal profession heading and what is the best idea to profit from it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadft6y?context=5)|Lawyers are glorified secretaries who try to scare you into paying them high fees.
 |A) never use lawyers. be your own lawyer.  B) create more sites like legalzoom. Look at that site and see what you can improve. Create sites that are like ""quora for lawyers"".  C) study bitcoin. Bitcoin is NOT a currency. It's actually a digital replacement for contract law. Study how bitcoin can be used for everything from wills to escrow agreements, etc. Make a business out of that. 
[I've taken a very low paying job to start making ends meet. I have taken out several personal loans while I downgrade my apartment and everything else in my life that costs more than the bare minimum.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgyal?context=5)|Its very simple but I've seen it in action. If you follow it for six months it will change your life. You will choose yourself for success and nobody can get in the way. Please let me know how it goes. BUt light your own fire first. 
[What were the first steps you made toward getting your life back together? What about professionally? I never imagined that I'd be in this position, and I feel wholly incapable of rebuilding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgyal?context=5)|The first steps I had to make (and then the first steps i made the nxt time i succeeded and then failed, and then,...) was to light my own fire first.  I am talking a lot about this in this AMA but its the answer, and the only answer that worked for me. I called it ""the daily practice"". I describe it in the book, ""Choose Yourself"". I offer to pay people back after they read the book because I believe so strongly it can help you.
[Also, what's your opinion regarding B2B vs. B2C businesses?  I've heard that B2B startups have a higher success rate and higher average exit valuation compared to B2C startups.  But figuring out what other businesses need or have problems with is harder than coming up with consumer ideas.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadg5xe?context=5)|B2B has higher success rate because you can actually get customers who will pay you right out the gate. Focus on that. B2C is a crap shoot. Note the great example of Mark Cuban. First he sold a B2B software co for $10mm. THEN he started a B2C site he sold for billions.  Also, if you can't pick an idea, generate more ideas. It tells me there's some other blockage in your health. Are you around positive people only? Are you grateful? Are you healthy phsyically? Are you sleeping well? etc. 
[One of my friends recently attended a trade show and that seems to be a good way to network within an industry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadh2dx?context=5)|LinkedIn is a good way to network. And go to LinkedIn networking meetups. Even throw networking meetups. Lewis Howes is a great example of someone who went from scratch to using linkedin to become a networking master. check out his stuff. 
[I have never really heard you talk much about travel or having fun.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadg0gl?context=5)|I like to read and write and play games. Thinking about it - i like to do the same things I liked to do when I was six years old. Except when I was six I didn't like sex as much as I do now. 
[How long do you spend in front of your computer per day / week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadg3oi?context=5)|I wake up and read for 2 hours. Then write for 2-3 hours. Then that's it. I don't surf the web. Sometimes I play chess online. 
[Hi James, can you give a quick tl;dr about how you started your most successful business (capital requirement, type of business, length of business\) and what are the most important things you've learned business wise since finding all the other 19 companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgbi9?context=5)|A) I never raised a dime B) I had a customer from the first day C) I never put the company in jeopardy D) I was always willing to sell the business. I was never foolish enough to think I could be a billion dollar company. 99.99% of successful companies sell eventually.
[What worked, what failed, etc...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgbi9?context=5)|That's it. Oh, and also, if you arent getting customers and revenues, shut down the biz immediately or turn it around quickly. 
[Who is your hero? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgma6?context=5)|To be honest. I am my hero. I'm fucking alive.

[Hey James, love the blog, its definitely changed my perspective on quite a few things in life. Thanks for all the advice you’ve offered. My question is what is your opinion on American corporatism? Are corporations becoming too powerful and hindering capitalism by phasing out small business owners and the individual entrepreneur? Will new technological efficiencies continue to destroy the work force as operations people are replaced by computers? And if so, how do we fix it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfugh?context=5)|I am glad you have separated out the words ""Corporatism"" from ""capitalism"". Capitalism has created innovation in every aspect of our lives. Corporatism tries to enslave us.
 |Capitalism is ultimately stronger. Corporatism doesn't need any help to die. It's already dying a very natural death. Underemployment is skyrocketing because technology and globalization and govt regulation has hindered (and helped) corportations form hiring people.
 |Eventually the entire middle management (anyone who shuffles papers and sits in a cubicle) will be outsourced. Everyone will either become a temp staffer or an entrepreneur. Make sure you pick the right choice.
 |The word force wont be destroyed but the above choice will have to be made by everyone. 
[This always gets me.  If the working class kept the advantages that came with technology and globalization, we'd we working ten hours weeks or outsourcing our OWN jobs to India.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadh1l2?context=5)|Note: we have more leisure time than ever. A century ago the avg work week was 60+ hours. Now its 33 hours.
[In the past people used to wonder what we'd do with all our leisure time.  Apparently ""being homeless and scavenging garbage dumps"" never occurred to them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadh1l2?context=5)|BUT, underemployment is high. So we have to make our own opportunities now or the corporations will own us. 
[Have you ever screwed anyone over to make your millions? If so..what did you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfv79?context=5)|I have never screwed anyone over to make millions. However, value is in the eye of the beholder and fortunately some of the people buying my first and second company might have had a different value in mind than I had (a higher value). But I always tried to deliver to my best once I sold a company. I never wanted to disappoint someone. Sometimes I thought too much about that instead of trying not to disappoint myself. 
[What's the best piece of advice in getting initial (angel\) investment?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadftqa?context=5)|Get a customer first. Your cheapest money is revenues. 
[You said one of your best skills is reaching out to people (sometimes ones you've never met before\). What's your best tactic on cold calling and your best intro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfw8d?context=5)|A) idea networking. Introduce a person to ten good ideas they can use to improve their business. Give the ideas totally for free and in great detail.
 |B) permission networking. Think of two people who can help each other and why. Get their permission to introduce each other. Then introduce.
 |Just cold calling rarely works. You have to give. Or as Gary Vaynerchuk likes to say, ""you have to give give give"". 
[What's something(sector or industry\) you absolutely refuse to invest in? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfyex?context=5)|I'd invest in anything if people smarter than me show me how it's a good investment. I realize I'm not the smartest guy around so I always rely on experts to really tell me what information I should be paying attention to. The biggest mistake is to think one is smart enough that he knows what is a good investment. 
[What does the future look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhlzj?context=5)|Lots of old people. 
[Hey James, I'm a huge fan of you and your writing. I read your blog regularly.  If you could go back to any point in time and tell your younger self one thing, what would it be and why?  Who are your favorite entrepreneurs/who do you look up to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfuvp?context=5)|I wouldn't tell my younger self anything. But I would tell any other young person: don't worry about purpose, goal, passion, etc. Think about helping people. But you can't help people until you help yourself. Be a beacon of light. The way you do that is through physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health every single day. Without this, your beacon becomes foggy. Ships will crash. People will die. 
[What is your single biggest regret?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfuvp?context=5)|I have no regrets. I used to regret losing money. BUt that only means you will keep losing money. I am really grateful every single day for everything that has happened to me and the adventures I constantly have as a result. Thats how you create abundance.
[My question - You talked about all the different businesses you started and how much they varied by type.  Knowing how difficult and time-consuming it is to try and become an ""expert"" in that many topics before diving in, how would you recommend learning and researching a new businesses idea before starting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgczv?context=5)|Second, get a customer before you start.

[Do you think the world today is better off than it was 20 years ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadg1ev?context=5)|Yes, the world is better off. For instance, I can write a book and publish it without having a publisher.
 |My cost per unit of electricity I use is much less.
 |My choice of food in the store is much greater.
 |Lifespans are longer.
 |Infant deaths are down.
 |Is everything better? I don't know. There are more opportunities than ever. You and I can talk through continents without even knowing each other's names. I love this.
 |But...it has a downside. The opportunities are for individuals to take advantage of. Don't let the corporations take advantage of you. If you don't write your own rules, someone else will write them for you. And that won't be fun. 
[Your new book sounds a lot like ""Think and Grow Rich"", which emphasizes a certain mental state one needs before striving for riches - was that on purpose ?  How did you get out of your depressive phase and what do you think are the foundations of true and long-lasting happiness ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgry0?context=5)|In my book i described what specifically worked for me to get out of a depressive state (its the chapters on the daily practice) and how it worked for others as well.
[I have been trying to figure this out on my own, but have not yet reached my goal. Also, thanks for doing this - you are one of my ""heroes"" if thats a thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgry0?context=5)|I think my book is more practical than Hill's. I give very specific stories about what happened to me and others. In the book I describe the foundation for that success. Without the foundation, you can't hope to build the house.  Note: if you buy the book and read it, I will pay you back for the price. Please read the book and see if that helps you figure it out. I think it will. I am betting on it. 
[Do you believe the following?  ""All happiness comes from helping others"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadg57a?context=5)|No. I think helping others is a great thing but it comes second.
 |A beacon in the water doesn't guide ships if the lights are out. You have to make sure your light is shining as brightly as possible. I always write about ""the daily practice"" which helped me to do that. In my book I tell of stories of other people it's helped. Btw, i'm not trying to promote the book but the message. if you see in the first page of the book: I offer to pay people back who can prove to me they read the book. 
[Will you invest in bitcoins and bitcoin companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadg2y7?context=5)|A) not just be a bitcoin broker or miner. Thats a loser business B) they need to build merchant tools. Merchants ultimately will create demand. Not traders.  C) they need to be open to other cryptocurrencies than just bitcoin.
[Whats the best place to start when it comes to investing? Say you have 5 grand, where would you invest it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgjuf?context=5)|Dont invest it. put it in the bank. use the time that buys you to read and study industries that you think you can improve. Find things you like to do, see what you can improve. See who you can help.
 |When I invest in myself, the returns are in the thousands of percent. Thats much better than any regular investment. 
[What tips would you give to someone ready to start a new business for their first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfxib?context=5)|Find a customer. Find someone who would actually like to buy your product.  Make sure you have six months worth of expenses set aside or work full time while you build.
[You've written about working with Jim Cramer of ""Mad Money."" What is he like on set? Would you still listening to his investment advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhmtt?context=5)|Jim Cramer is incredibly intelligent at media and entertainment and branding.

[I recall reading one of your BLOGs advising against being a daytrader.  However, would you give me the same advice in my sich?  I am 55yo, and had a steady job for 30 years, was laid off in February.  Since 9 months ago I have quadrupled my Etrade account and all my accounts are up a net factor of 3.4.  I find medium swing trades with high selectivity for high probability multiple catalysts most rewarding, but need 24/7 focus to get out of those in a timely manner if new info surfaces counter to my thesis.  So trading while working full time is not as successful for me, but at my age full time trading could set me up better over the next 15 years.  Any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadghhk?context=5)|Yes, even in your situation. Daytrading is a much different world when there is low volatiliy like there has been in the past 9 months. The one thing that is sure to change: volatility is sure to spike at the exact moment you least want it to. 
[What do you advise to someone who is just out of high school and wants to be successful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgy7u?context=5)|I am jealous of you.

I've spent years of my life obsessing on it but I can't make it real.There are two big reasons for that: money(I spend everything on food,electricity etc\) and confidence(in order for my idea to work I need to step it up and be someone who can lead the company,the thought of that terrifies me\) Do you want to start another company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgzqf?context=5)|No. BUT. You can do it.
 |You say confidence is holding you back. Confidence has often held me back and held back many of the people I write about in my book.
 |Start to work on the basics: do you sleep eight hours a day? Do you eat well? Are you grateful for what you have? Are you around positive people? Do you dwell on the negative?
 |The negative is worth thinking about, but not worth obsessing on.
 |Health gets rid of obsessions.
 |You can do this company. BUt first build your foundation. Then build thehouse. 
[Why didn't you quit at any point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadgo5o?context=5)|I quit many times. Quit and folded and folded in half. Then in quarters. Then on the ground.
 |But then you have to get up. You hvae to live. But I had to figure out what ""living"" meant after I had messed up so many times. Not just my life but the lives of everyone around me. 
[Out of your 20 companies which one was the one you thought had the most potential but didn't make it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadfw6b?context=5)|One idea: crowdsourced ad campaigns. Search my blog for ""junglesmash"". It was a good idea and Procter &amp; Gamble and other companies were contacting me about it. But I got depressed and let it drift and just never executed on it. Its still a good idea.
 |Another idea: a dating site on top of twitter. At first I thought it was good and then I thought it was VERY bad and shut it down and returned the money I raised. 
[Over this last weekend I found a solid plan to fund a project.  This project is in a very saturated market with the biggest market shareholder pulling down a billion in sales annually.   What advice do you have for someone entering a market and playing against the big stick swingers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhm29?context=5)|Find an initial customer who thinks your product has an advantage over the market leader. If it doesn't, then find a new business. 
[This may a random question to some, but do you have any children? I don't want to say that kids can hold people back in life sometimes, although I think it can alter some endeavors making things more difficult to takecertain risks. Thanks for the AMA. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhmyu?context=5)|I have 2 kids. Kids are really hard, right? I hated it for a long time. It wasnt really right for me. But I love them very much. In that way kids can be a contradiction. 
[James - huge fan of your work. Thanks for all you do. I've recommended your works to basically everyone I know - and a lot of folks I know are in the same aimless-underemployed-frustrated-twentysomething stage that I was in. You're really great at helping folks figure out the signal in the noise.  There's not really a question here. Hm. Do you need an intern? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fssv7/i_am_james_altucher_founder_of_20_companies_17_of/cadhnm1?context=5)|Haha.

I'm rather rusty as I learned some C in high-school and I've removed a significant amount of rust the past couple of days - but it still isn't enough.

To be honest I'm having a bit of trouble understanding what is meant by ""alignment"" in the following description of the task:

===================
2nd Email Challenge
===================
Given *only* the following system calls/macros: malloc(), free(), realloc(), assert(), sizeof() please write an optimized library grade implementations of the below function prototypes:

PROTOTYPES

    void *aligned_malloc(size_t size, size_t alignment);
    void aligned_free(void *ptr);
    void *aligned_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

PARAMETERS

- size - size of the requested memory allocation.
- alignment - the alignment value, which must be an integer power of 2.
- ptr - a pointer to the memory block that was allocated or NULL.

RETURN VALUE

A pointer to the memory block that was allocated or NULL if the operation failed. ""

Another thing that's giving me a headache is Eclipse: I wasn't able to get the environment up and running for coding in C, and I'm only partly able to do so at the computer lab at my University (using the Terminal on the linux machines).

Anyway I would love it if anyone could shed some light on this for me and suggest a way to go about this. I'd really hate to miss this opportunity.

[What did Blizzard think internally over the company's complete and utter failure to support and co-opt DOTA, which was originally a Warcraft III custom map? I know that Blizzard tried to sue Valve and others when Dota moved on from WC3...  We WC3 players had been pleading with Blizzard for YEARS to provide official support for DOTA, to hire DOTA developers, and in general acknowledge the game's existence, yet none of that ever came about...and now League of Legends is several times more popular than WoW has ever been. What do the people inside of Blizzard think about this monumentally epic fuckup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad44pm?context=5)|Same thing you're feeling. A lot of people rolled their eyes and laughed at what they were intending to do with DOTA. I know a lot of QA people thought it was a joke, but we didn't get paid to have an opinion. I'll just reiterate this: SC2 devs are mostly dicks.

They can also come across as quite dickesh because they feel they can do no wrong. Mind you there are some very nice devs on that team that actually give a shit, but some of the more ""esteemed"" devs have a superiority complex for sure.

[Is there actually a Sword of 1000 Truths?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad2m81?context=5)|There was back in I think 2006. It was a PvP sword, but has since been renamed to something else, I can't remember what. 
[Did you ever busted any people using bots or gold sellers? If so how you dealt with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad41jd?context=5)|Oh yeah all the time as a GM. That was the best part, IMO. With bots you would get a report from a player, hop on the game to check it out, and get a Senior to visually confirm that it was a bot and then slam them with the ban hammer. Same thing went for gold sellers. Those were even more fun because gold sellers got their gold from compromising someone's account, taking all their shit and selling it, then taking the gold and selling it to other players. What we would do is follow the gold trail, through logs, and take back any gold, or items purchased with said gold, and recover it to restore back to the compromised player. Then we would give a nice fat action to the sellers account, which would usually result in them getting the boot.
 |That's what I think people who buy WoW gold never understood. The gold didn't come from Chinese farmers just using bots all day to get gold. No, it came from Chinese hackers who hacked people's accounts, stripped their character clean, and then sold the gold to you online at a profit. Shitty. 
[How close do you honestly think WoW is to reaching the end of its popular lifespan and competitive reign as far as MMOs go? It has to happen eventually.. Five years? Ten years? Am I correct in assuming that the next major expansion will be the franchise's last?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad4kmr?context=5)|I don't think WoW is going to stop anytime soon. They have a pretty strong thing going still, even with a loss of subscribers. I think it will pan out for at least another 5 years or so, but there's really no way to tell for sure. WoW is their moneymaker, so they'll milk it for as long as possible.
[Did you like working there? What did you major in?  Any plans now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad4gw6?context=5)|It had it's highs and lows, but overall it was a great experience. I didn't take it as seriously as other people did just because video games were never a passion of mine, but it was one of the best places to work. Mike Morhaime is a really nice guy too. 
[Speaking of mike morhaime, did you meet Chris Metzen at all?

He's just got that vibe about him like he's too cool for school, but I guess when you're the King of WoW, you can act however the fuck you want. I would.
[Are you happy with the direction Blizzard is taking with World Of Warcraft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad2i4y?context=5)|Honestly I never really cared about WoW too much, but since I actually just started playing again in over a year, I have seen the many changes they've made to it and I'm overall pretty impressed. Coming from the internal side of things and knowing how many issues we had to deal with as GMs with the old game, it's great to see how automated a lot of the issues have become. I like that players are now able to solve most of their issues themselves. I still feel like most of the issues lie within the GM department, though.

[That doesn't really surprise me, but at least most of them are better about obfuscating it when they're dealing with their player base.  Was he as much of a self-absorbed asshole in-person as he is on the fourms/on twitter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad31cx?context=5)|Oh yes he was. I can tell you a story of this time were our Customer Service department had a new policy where any new hires, no matter what department you were hired into, would have to sit with a Game Master for a few hours and see what it was like to be the face of Blizzard, and how hard our job was. Well they decided to include the executives on this one as well, and one day Ghostcrawler was scheduled to shadow a guy on my team. He basically spent the entire time on his phone texting, checking emails, or just leaving for long periods of time to make phone calls. He was so checked out from the experience that he left early because he was just too good to sit there with lowlife GMs. At least that's the impression we got.
[Can you tell us anything about tseric and what happened with him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad3o5z?context=5)|Never knew the guy personally, but I knew/know some of the people who work the forums and it's definitely a tough job that you need tough skin for. But I can also say that about being a GM in general. 
[To be fair, he probably had a ton of shit to do...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad5bej?context=5)|Yeah, I mean I never met the guy personally, but it's just the impression he gave a lot of us. He could be a really nice guy and just had a bad day, or maybe just had better shit to do. Meh.
[I know some GMs enjoyed adding a bit of personality to their interactions with players (For instance, I had a bit of a conversation with a GM about GnomeBall, a variant on football/soccer using Gnomes as the ball, with nets weaved with Dwarf beards\). How much leeway did Blizzard give you on this? Any kind of story that sticks in your head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad4060?context=5)|Yeah, back in the day we were expected to be ""professional"" and not get too cutsie with our conversations. We had a department called QC (Quality Control) in which their job was to review our conversations and give us grades on them. I won't even do into how horrible and useless that department was, but thankfully they don't exist anymore.
 |Anyway, later on we were able to personalize our greetings and have more fun with players, so the more creative GMs would create personas that they would use with players. It made things way more fun and a better experience I think, but there were definitely some players who didn't appreciate it lol. I do remember this one GM had some macro where they were a Gnome or something who would emote throwing glitter in your face. That didn't go over very well when they got an irate player who was not in the mood to have glitter thrown in their virtual face lol.
[I recall chatting with the ""glitter throwing Gnome"" GM! And IIRC, I think I gave them a perfect score everywhere on the little survey that they prompted us to fill in after each intervention.  Thanks for the answer, and thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad4ht2?context=5)|No prob! Also, a thing to note about that scoring system...it's pretty fucked up on the internal side. For example: Let's say you really liked your GM, but weren't TOTALLY satisfied enough to give the experience all 5's, so instead you give them all 4's, or maybe some 4's and 5's. Well GMs are graded on how many ""perfect survey scores"" they get, and are rated with a 1 or 0 point system. Basically if you get all 5's, you get 1 point, and anything else is a 0. Pretty fucked up right? Well if you get too low of an average score per quarter, you have the potential to lose your job. Yeah...and they think this is an improved rating system. 
[I have been in IT for over 20 years and I have seen a lot of customer satisfaction survey systems and that is without a doubt the most fucked up one I have ever heard of.

[Why the hell did starcraft 2 take so long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad2iah?context=5)|Lol that was totally up to the Devs for that one. I have no idea why it took so long, but I can tell you that while I personally wasn't working on it during that time, my friends were doing QA for it and it was basically hell for them. Working 14 days straight, 12-14 hours a day, non-stop. I feel like the devs wanted it to be *perfect* before they released it so they could prove to everyone that they were the shit. In reality, though, I just think they didn't have their shit together enough and couldn't collaborate properly to get it out on time. 
[I have never played WOW yet I constantly get emails from Blizzard saying my account has been disabled. I keep sending them all my info, but I keep getting the e-mails. What should I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad3l3v?context=5)|Those are likely phishing emails from China.

It creates a lot of heat. 
[What role do QA people play in decisions about the game, such as lore or boss mechanics?  Do you have a big suggestion box or have a random great idea that you can share easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad2nov?context=5)|QA didn't really have any say in what went into the game, or what was really fucking stupid and shouldn't be in there at all, but we did have a suggestion forum internally where we could post our ideas to the devs. The problem was that most of the devs were very full of themselves and believed that we didn't know any better, and we were just there to test the games, and apparently couldn't even do that right in their eyes, so most of our suggestions were laughed off.
[Do you think the majority of Blizzard views Diablo 3 as a massive failure and that it didn't live up to the hype?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1friep/i_am_a_former_blizzard_entertainment_employee_who/cad383s?context=5)|I think everyone was pretty satisfied with D3 because there were a shit ton of people who worked really hard on it, so bias comes into play with it. But all in all I feel like D3 was generally a success, although I know there were many people who felt otherwise.

I love talking about something I had the opportunity to experience that not everyone will have. :)
 |I do think that the devs want people to have a good experience, but I also think a lot of it is how to get more money flowing into their pockets. That game makes so much money it's ridiculous. The devs would get bonuses that were enough to buy a new car. I would say that there are a lot of greedy devs working there, but there are also a lot of devs who really love the game, what they do, and the fans they make it for.

The problem is that most gaming companies want you on contract until their game is released and the they dump you. That was the good thing about Blizz, they at least kept you on permanently. Unfortunately jobs in Cali suck balls and there's so much competition that it's hard to land a decent one. Still on the hunt, though!

I believe it was mentioned a few times during Show &amp; Tells back in the day when it was in development, and it looks like they found the official name for it too. There are so many different teams working on different projects that you don't really get informed of everything that is going on. Especially being in the GM department, you are the last to find out anything because the devs didn't trust us and thought we would leak information. Ironically info was leaked through their department, not ours.

I'm currently getting my BA in Politics and Communications with a focus in computer technology. I'm doing a research internship in Dublin next summer. My extended family lives in Ireland but I don't qualify for dual-citizenship. 

I'm planning on applying to masters programs in Ireland but I'd like to stay there since my immediate family has all passed away and it's hard to not have any family around me. I'm probably going to have about 20,000 USD in student loans and I'll need to take out more to attend uni there.

I have no criminal background and I'm fluent in Spanish and I'm currently in the process of learning German. I've interned at three different newspapers, know a variety of programming languages, and work as an administrative assistant right now. I also have a lot of experience with research, especially archival, political, and genealogical. I'm single and have no pets.

I've been many times before and I love it but I'm just wondering how I can stay there after my masters?

1fw3z4,0,2013-06-07,iPad vs Macbook Air for portable laptop,tequilaengineer,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1fw3z4/ipad_vs_macbook_air_for_portable_laptop/,"Hey!
So I really need a new portable laptop.  Currently I own a Gateway NV50a that's rather slow that I got for graduation.  It's rather heavy and has ruined straps on two backpacks (one was a High Sierra).  I've decided that toward the end of the summer I will reset the whole thing and give it to my mom since it still runs well enough for her to play games on.

I'm currently working an internship so I can get a new technology device!  I just bought an iPhone 5 in April so I'm slowly becoming an Apple fan(girl).  I am between an iPad/Laptop combo and a Macbook Air (or just an iPad).  I've done some research and some people say ""MBA is better because this"" or ""iPad is better because that"" and I've come to the conclusion that it varies on what you would use it for.

Personally, I don't game, and I barely type papers.  During the school year I use my laptop for facebook, reading textbooks that I've torrented, and listening to music.  Also the occasional session of aimlessly browsing the internet.  I spend a decent amount of time on the 4th floor of Engineering Hall/Grainger/various MatSE computer labs (when I actually study), so I don't need a huge computer.  However: I am a huge procrastinator so the lack of multitasking that an iPad has might actually be a plus for me.

Any suggestions?  I'm pretty sure someone here has owned one of these devices, any personal experiences?"
1fv3c9,1,2013-06-07,Business/Engineering - Offer from Two Companies - Internship of Full-Time?!,singhjar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1fv3c9/businessengineering_offer_from_two_companies/,"So I recently graduated from Electrical Engineering at a top university in Canada. I have been getting quite a few interviews, and recently received two offers. One from a large Canadian retailer for their corporate office, another from one of the Big 4. 

The internship will be as a Business Analyst, and is currently set to 4 months, but I was told by the interviewer that I can extend to 8 or 12 months (need to confirm from HR). I personally see myself going into this field, so it would be nice to try out. However, I am scared that I'll have to go through another job search soon after. Also, since it is an internship, I am considering delaying my graduation date so that I will have all the benefits of being a new graduate upon completing the internship.

The full-time position is an 3x8-month IT Rotational program with a 8-month stint in Business Analyst/ Project Coordinator (the only rotation that interests me...the rest are too techy). The pay is low, and I personally think the Big 4 name will be more beneficial.

TL;DR
I'm uncertain what to do:
a) Choose Big 4 Internship, not delay graduation
b) Choose Big 4 Internship, delay graduation
c) Choose Retailer for full-time position
d) None of the above

Any help would be appreciated :).

Basically the process is to separate different sized particles (on the scale of 1-10 micrometres) by putting them through a flat spiral, where Dean drag forces and lift forces affect the particles differently based on mass, thereby creating separate streams of particles. The streams are then collected by specifically placed outlets.

We have COMSOL, but according to the post-doc, it only models fluids, not different sized particle flows. Is there a software that could model this, or one that is best suited to model this? I am personally somewhat familiar with MATLAB (not to this advanced degree though), but I know COMSOL is based off of MATLAB sort of, so I don't want to go through hours of tutorials learning the ins and outs of MATLAB, when I should've been learning for of some other software.

1fu5hy,2,2013-06-06,Had one offer for an internship due to start in 1.5 weeks. Another company offers me an internship that's closer. Am I being unprofessional or burning bridges to turn the first one down so close to start date ?,Bigglyfarce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fu5hy/had_one_offer_for_an_internship_due_to_start_in/,"Hi, I'm a long-time lurker so I first wanna thank everyone in this subreddit for contributing and easing a lot of my concerns.  Here's the background:

I live in NJ.  I'm in my second year at university right now, and this would be my first internship.

**Company A**, a fairly large and very well-known industry leader in  travel/eCommerce (I'm sure you guys could guess which one), is based in CT.  In early May, after an on-site interview, they offered me a internship to do back-end Java development working on caching important information.  Reviews on Glassdoor praise the company's management and the strength of its business.  Since I'm only a sophomore, they offered me $16/hr, and I'll need to spend a lot of that for a place to live for the summer.

**Company B** is based in NYC and provides a digital trading platform and other financial services.  A recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn a week or two ago, and I had a very hasty and fairly disorganized interview process (all over the phone) that wasn't very rigorous or technical at all, leading me to have a bad feeling (but I told them I already had an offer due to start soon, so perhaps they just wanted to move things along).  I would be worked working on a Java chat client for their trading platform.  Reviews on Glassdoor praise the brilliance of the tech department but are fairly otherwise negative and especially critical of management.  They pay $1/hr a less than Company A but I could just commute rather cheaply from home.

And now my questions:

Which company would seem better for me in terms as a stepping-stone for future career growth?

Since this only a first summer internship, should I worry about the differences in management etc?  

How much attention should I pay to the fact to that Company A's interview was much more rigorous and technical than Company B's inteview?

Would it be unprofessional to spurn the first offer (Company A) a week before I'm expected to start?

Thanks in advance!

If I could land a job or internship as a stage manager, I would jump at in a second.

In the past couple of years, I've worked a summer internship doing technical theatre work which I didn't really enjoy as well as spending a small stint in South Korea as a teacher which did not work out and I've only just recently returned from.

While I was looking for work since being back I've been given a job offer to work as a floater for a security company with decent pay and a very high chance of being moved to full time in anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. I accepted the job and right now they are moving through with the process of background checks and the like, but I was told I may start this coming week.

I have also just today been offered an internship with a theatre a couple hours from where I currently live. I applied for a stage managing internship, but I was offered a technical internship instead which isn't exactly what I want to do. The internship would run until the end of september and would pay me $150 a week and give me housing.

The main issue I've encountered is that if I take the internship instead of the job, I will have to start job searching once I'm back. I also am worried about my school loans which I will have to start paying back in August.

I'm really unsure of which opportunity to take. Part of me says to just stay with the job and make some money and get some more work experience under my belt, which another part says take the internship and gain more theatre experience.

[Over the time you spent with them as their individual fame developed, did their personalities change? Did they start acting differently to people like your self who were around them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caep8fx?context=5)|Absolutely not. They have been the same genuine guys that I met about a year ago. The fame has done nothing to their ""egos"" or the way they interact with people. If anything, they have just gotten nice.
[What is Ryan's process of making beats? Does it take him forever to get everything right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeq0vb?context=5)|It does take him a long time and that is why they all sound so great. The way that I witnessed him doing it (mixing) was playing about 4 -10 second sections of the beats over and over, and honing it every now and then to make sure it had all of the perfect sounds and elements.
[Can you describe what it was like being in the studio with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerk7y?context=5)|Very cool. But pretty normal. Pretty chill. They did their stuff making music and being famous. I did my stuff being an intern and shipping clothes all over the motha fuckinn world.
[I'm not a big fan of his music, but one thing I have to say is he knows how to make some damn good beats. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetf8z?context=5)|Ryan Lewis makes the beats, but yes, they are damn good.
[Interesting! I've read that's one of the most efficient ways to practice anything- get all your pieces ironed out and then try to put it all together.  Any other cool work habits you noticed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesa4k?context=5)|Ben was very concentrated. When they were making music or he was doing verses in the booth there was very little talking that went on. He was in the zone whenever they produced together.
[You doin' it, man. Folding and packing t-shirts. Purchasing envelopes. Affixing postal stamps. Mailing that shit. That's what up, baby. You doin' it, man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesknc?context=5)|Helll yeah. 
[Yeah, people often underestimate and forget about Ryan Lewis completely.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeyem6?context=5)|It is very upsetting, but he recently mentioned in an interview that he doesn't like being in the spotlight that I could completely understand. But I wish people would just give him credit.
[Oh, that's good. I'm just scared because Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is becoming Macklemore, though they're technically a group.  I was originally scared that Macklemore would end up becoming a solo artist and Ryan Lewis working on the side (similar to many pop artists nowadays, others make the music and they just sing it\). But, from this AMA, I can gather that the two are too chill together to be doing anything like that.. right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caez605?context=5)|Correct. Very correct!
[Is Macklemore's cock really pink, long, big, strong and been known to dance like all night long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepau1?context=5)|Personally, I'm not sure. But why else would he refer to it as such?
[Are you a cold ass honky?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caep87o?context=5)|I am. I am an irish white boy that does not tan well at all.

There has to be one..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caep87o?context=5)|Neither of them are douchebags. They are some of the nicest guys I've met and the entire team is extremely open and accepting of anyone. 
[Well that's refreshing to hear. Usually people get a taste of fame and turn into the biggest divas alive.  And I feel you. My neck and head are burnt as fuck right now. I'm Italian, I shouldnt tan that poorly...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepacs?context=5)|If you ever get the chance, try to do a meet and greet or just say hey. They are super nice guys.
[Yay!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepafi?context=5)|Yay!
[Don't they do some annual meet and greet pizza party?  E. t not d :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerf9d?context=5)|They do. It's usually based on art of some sort. I went to that last December. 
[I would imagine because of the general civility of this whole affair.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeww1k?context=5)|Well, glad to hear it.
[How did you get the opportunity for a job like that? Just curious, was it a family connection or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caep9zh?context=5)|I know people say this all the time but I was literally in the right place at the right time and happened to talk to the right people. A couple of interviews later I was working for them.
[Huh, who was it you happened to bump into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepetg?context=5)|I don't want to reveal that just in case I shouldn't. All I can say is that if you ever get the opportunity, always ask questions because you never know where it could get you.
[Fair enough, thanks for the AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepgy1?context=5)|Of course. It's a blast to see all the questions!
[So Elmo and Big Bird were right: asking questions is a good way to find out things you want to know!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caevy5s?context=5)|Yes!! It works!
[Were you paid in second hand clothing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caep5g5?context=5)|No. I wish.
[Were you paid at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caestj8?context=5)|I was not. I was paid in college credit.
[Not even trident layers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetoey?context=5)|Not even Trident Layers.
[Sounds like it was an incredible opportunity! Do you still get to keep in touch with them? Also what are you studying at school; did you always want to get into the business or was this just something you decided to try out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqmow?context=5)|I do still keep in touch with them. I like to check in every now and then to see how their busy lives are treating them.
 |I am studying Public Relations. Never really thought about getting into the business, but now I am very interested. Thought it would be a cool opportunity to intern or work for them, that worked out, and I couldn't have asked for a cooler experience.
[On a day-to-day basis, did you call him Ben or Macklemore or Mack or some other nickname?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caes9p2?context=5)|Ben. His name is Ben, so I called him Ben, as I still do.

[Was there ever a time where you felt like calling it quits?  Anything that made you think, ""Is this even worth it?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqbku?context=5)|Never. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life in terms of seeing what it's like to do what they do and having them as friends to this day and hopefully for life.
[Did you ever touch his fluffy jacket?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerj6p?context=5)|Confirmed. Did touch the fluffy jacket.
[Was the DeLorean a *real* DeLorean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caet556?context=5)|Yes. It was very nicely taken care of over time and it was real. Confirmed.
[You really like saying ""confirmed"", dont you? :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caexhnh?context=5)|Perhaps.
[FIFY: Perhaps I can confirm this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeyic2?context=5)|Precisely.
[Previous? What happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caep581?context=5)|I interned for them last summer and had to come back to school. Couldn't continue the internship unless I dropped out and became full time. Thus not an intern. 
[Why did you not do this? actual question, sounds like a dream job to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer9rb?context=5)|Actual question. I appreciate it. I had always been a fan of the guys and I honestly was just hoping for the opportunity and really did not think it would pan out. I did it because it sounded like a dream opportunity. It was. And I certainly hope to work for them when I graduate. That is my actual answer.
[What was the most inspirational thing that you witnessed?  What did you learn about the business that you did not know before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer2ai?context=5)|Most inspirational thing I witnessed was hearing the sample of Same Love that Ryan played me. Having known that he put that entire thing together and hearing it played for the first time gave me the chills.
 |I had no idea that the business was so busy. It may be a dumb thing to say but damn, that shit is crazy. There is so much that goes on behind the studio doors and the traveling/shipping merch/customer service is just insane.

Like what kinda questions, anything special etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepspt?context=5)|The interviews were more like getting to know each other kind of things. Also with the job experience and what will you do with this, etc.

 |The team was pretty small. Myself, Ben, Ryan, Tricia (their tour and operations manager) and Zach, their manager.
[Since no one has asked yet, what kind of people are Macklemore and Ryan like? Also best/funniest memory from interning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqdk9?context=5)|They are both extremely nice guys. Very funny. Great senses of humor and just so genuine. They are both very real and tells it like it is. Very cool about them.
 |Not sure of a best/funniest memory - one day as I was leaving the studio I went to say bye to them and I reached out for a handshake. Intended awkwardness occurred on Ryan's part and Ben proceeded to do the same. A very genuine and friendly ""fuck you"" ensued and the awkward daps will live on in infamy. 
[I don't understand what you just said.  But I like it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer2vo?context=5)|What don't you understand? Help me help you.
[What I'm guessing is that you're more comfortable with handshakes than you are with knuckle bumps, while they prefer the latter - that's what's awkward right?  Please^be^right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerhbu?context=5)|They do the usual like gangster handshake, but they just weren't doing it that day. It's very hard to demonstrate via text.
[Was there anything that Macklemore didn't like about the job? Also, how much interaction would you have with the Macklemore and Ryan? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqf0f?context=5)|Didn't like about HIS job? Or mine? He loves what he does. It's what he has always dreamt of in a music career. As for mine, I don't know. They both seemed to enjoy my company and appreciated what I did.
 |I saw Ryan usually everyday, but Ben it was more scattered. They were at the studio at different times than I usually was and I just saw them whenever they were there. Usually daily. It was like any enjoyable coworker that you might have. We talked. We laughed. We enjoyed each other's company. 
[What is your favorite memory of your internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepfco?context=5)|Probably being present for the filming of the Thrift Shop video. Very cool to see how all of that was done.
 |That or being in the studio while The Heist was being produced. As loud as it was, the beats never sounded bad.
[Did you get a smug sense of accomplishment whenever you saw that video on TV? I have a friend who was involved in the taping of ""Breakeven"" by The Script, and he never shut up about it for about 3 months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caes9o1?context=5)|I don't brag about it or get smug, but I just find it absolutely mind-boggling that they went from somewhat nationally recognized musicians to worldwide superstars. My friends, family, and peers at school had never heard of them and now they all want autographs and phone numbers.
 |From where they were to where they are now is just an amazing thing.
[Are you as tired of Thrift Shop as I am?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqty8?context=5)|Kind of. It's a great song. It's a great message. But it is definitely overplayed. I am in the Thrift Shop music video though. Can't get tired of that.
[What do you do in the video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer49s?context=5)|I was just an extra int he back of one of the scenes. The amount of fans that were wooing over everything going on was very weird so I didn't want to be one of them...
[Which person are you in the video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer7nl?context=5)|I'm between Ben and Ryan from 1:25 to 1:29 in the red shirt. It's not a huge appearance.
[Where!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer8ou?context=5)|I don't make a huge appearance, but I am between Ryan and Ben in the red shirt between 1:25 and 1:29.

[Are you the guy that looks at the camera...?  There's a guy who looks at the camera that is decently tall, and I can never not see it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caez5ko?context=5)|I am not that guy.
[Who was the little girl in the video/song? I guess i dont mean a name, but was she just an extra or is she someone in bens life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeuqjc?context=5)|That would be Ben's niece.
[Are you in the sweet vest? haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerukr?context=5)|No. EDIT: Didn't realize what question this was in reference to, YES. I am in the vest.
[Were you with them/interning with them when they realized they were going to be big?  What was that like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerb6w?context=5)|I wasn't really. I was with them when they released Same Love and when they were going to put on their huge show in Seattle before tour. They got a lot more attention that they were expecting but I knew it was long overdue having known people that were so interested in their stuff.
 |They weren't expecting it. They were expecting the same fan base if not a little more people, but nothing like what they got. 
[Are you still in contact with them? Like, if you talked to him, do you think he'd talk to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqvyw?context=5)|I am still in contact with them. I reach out to them here and there and they do talk to me. lol. They are extremely busy though and I am not the first person on their priority list to talk to.
 |They came and did a show at my school back in February or March though and we went to the mall to get Ray Dalton's ears pierced and we got dinner. So yes. I am still in contact with them.
[That sounds like a pretty awesome day.  Is Ray Dalton as incredibly lovely as I assume he is?  Please say yes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caez0q7?context=5)|He is one of my best friends. So yes.
[What are your thoughts on Same Love? What were Ben's intentions on writing and putting out the song? It's so uplifting to hear this message out of this genre go public. An absolute anthem... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerfop?context=5)|I love that song. It is absolutely beautiful.
 |From what I know, Ben wanted to be one of the first rappers to be in support of same-sex marriage and the legalization of such. He wanted to open people's eyes and he wanted to make a change in the way that society operates. 
[BTW- Could not stop laughing when I heard American. Funny yet... Brilliant! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetbxj?context=5)|That's a great song. Have you And We Danced? Castle?
[Dude! All of them! I'm bummed that I hadn't heard of him prior to this success. I've been listening to a lot of his earlier stuff, and it is absolutely genius! He has a great combination of humor, wit, social awareness and power with his words. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetese?context=5)|I don't understand how some people don't like him and his work, but I guess everyone has their own likes and dislikes. He just has so much talent.
[Do you think Macklemore wouldn't be were he is today if it wasn't for the Youtube community specifically the CoD montages that used his music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerecx?context=5)|The CoD montages are the majority of his fame. Definitely. The Youtube community has certainly had an affect on his (and Ryan's) fame. The fact that Thrift Shop, Same Love, Can't Hold Us and many of their other music videos have been so popular is a big reason for their being known across the globe.
[How long did you get to work with them? What are you majoring in? Do you think you'll go back after you graduate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqymv?context=5)|I worked with them last summer (from about May - August).
 |I am majoring in Strategic Communication, Emphasis in Public Relations.
 |I am very much hoping to go back and work with them. We will just have to see where they are at when I get back.
[Nifty, you were actually working with them when thrift shop came out. Did you get to hear the song before anyone else when it was released on YouTube?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerp9c?context=5)|I was. I heard it one of the first days I was in the studio. Ryan played me the whole album to see what I though.
[Any sex/drugs/rock n roll stories ? groupies??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepf1s?context=5)|Not particularly. They don't really have ""groupies"" like many other major artists. The people that are with them are usually photographer friends or other musicians, everyone of which is very talented.
[Do they have fans that follow them to every show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer42l?context=5)|I'm sure they do. Every band/group/singer has crazy superfans and these guys probably have the same.
[Where about's in Ireland are you from? Maybe you can get them to come over again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqroo?context=5)|I guess I said that wrong...? I'm not actually from Ireland. I come from Irish heritage. I am Irish. I am not FROM Ireland.
[In your opinion, what do you think has has the greatest contribution to their success? Also, what would you consider to be your favourite song of theirs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqz2k?context=5)|Dropping their album at the time that they did with so many people wanting more music was what did it. Certain songs (Thrift Shop, Same Love) took off and that's what has put them where they are.
 |I'm a fan of everything that Ben and Ryan have done together. Ben's earlier stuff is great as well.
 |Irish Celebration. Otherside. The Town. Same Love. Can't Hold Us.
[I LOVE ""American"", ""white walls"" and ""and we danced"". ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetk83?context=5)|White Walls is a great song. I love just about all of their songs. 
[Did you ever meet any of the artists they worked with? Perhaps Schoolboy Q from White Walls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeu05a?context=5)|I did not meet Schoolboy Q but I have met some of the other artists that are on the album. All very cool, talented artists.
[Do they use gay slurs? Is Same Love just a publicity stunt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caernua?context=5)|Hell no. Hell. No. They are all for same-sex marriage and its legalization. 
[What sort of music was generally being listened to by and around them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caese25?context=5)|They listened to all kinds of other music. Ryan more so than Ben, but it was all over the map. No one genre in particular.
[Also, any interesting quirks or habits they've got that we may not suspect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caese25?context=5)|I can't think of any quirks...Ryan smokes. Ben doesn't. 
[Smokes... what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeu2du?context=5)|Cigarettes. E-cigs. 
[Were you paid a living wage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqr3t?context=5)|I was paid in school credit. That is all.
[Does it annoy him when people call him Mackle-more, instead of Mack-le-more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer813?context=5)|I don't mind. It was destined to happen with this much exposure.
[How tall are they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqtia?context=5)|Not sure on exact heights. For reference, I am about 6'1"" and I am taller than both of them. Ben is almost as tall as me. Probably 6 foot or 6'1"" and Ryan is not as tall as Ben.
[Any more candid shots of Ben? For science.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqiw8?context=5)|Will add. Check the top.
[What about candid shots of you doing interny stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caermxx?context=5)|I don't know why I would have taken those or why anyone else would have taken those. They are non-existent.
[Could you see all the success changing them at all? Either in their personalities or music style?  Do you still keep in touch with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqkmc?context=5)|Not at all. If anything, I think it will make the music better because they know that they have a larger audience that they will be affecting (which is very cool). Their personalities are the same, if not nicer than before.
 |I do try to keep in touch with them and see how their very busy lives are treating them. They just don't seem like international superstars to me..
[What are your top favorite 3 songs from them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer6u5?context=5)|VERY hard question.
 |Otherside.  The Town. Can't Hold Us.
[In the song castle what is the whole part about eating a coyote about? My wife and I love that song and the whole album but eating a coyote throws me off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesbch?context=5)|It was a completely random song. Very much just crazy and no real story line. Very similar to [And We Danced](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhf5cuXiLTA). Basically an And We Danced 2 for the most part.
[How long have you been a fan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer8tp?context=5)|I was a fan probably 8 years ago, if not more. I listened to Language of My World. VS. Can't Hold Us originally. 
[What's your favorite Professor Macklemore song?  Have you ever called him that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetmzq?context=5)|I have not. Of his earliest songs, The Town. 
[But you do know about Professor Macklemore, right?  I was talking specifically about Open Your Eyes--his first album. The Town is really good too though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeylxy?context=5)|I do know about Professor Macklemore. Of course. Open Your Eyes is a great album.
[Also, how do I meet Macklemore?  I've been listening to him a while now. Finally saw him live for the first time at Skate and Surf fest. Awesome show, I wish his set could have been longer. I was happy that half his set was stuff not on The Heist though. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeylxy?context=5)|How do you meet him? Go to shows. Hope for a meet and greet. Run into him? It's hard, but I believe in a fellow Redditor.
[Did you work with (or at least meet\) any other Seattle hip hop groups?  Blue Scholars?  Common Market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqvrt?context=5)|I didn't. I was really hoping to, but the time frame of the internship was so small that I was really not able to do anything but work work work. I'm hoping to get into the scene when I get done with school and make my way into meeting most of the peeps.
[Is their a song of theirs that you know of that does not get as much attention as you feel it deserves? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caepl35?context=5)|Great question. Many of Ben's original stuff, or the early stuff that he and Ryan worked on is just so overlooked. Otherside, for example, or the Otherside remix are just powerful. I feel like more people need to hear those songs and more people need to know what Ben is all about (other than the thrifting).
 |Also - I'm a huge fan of most of Ben's original 'Language of My World' stuff. Penis Song, of course. Ego. Inhale Deep.
 |Being from Seattle, The Town will be one of my all-time favorites.
[The vs EP is legendary! Irish Celebration is also a very good song in my opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqluq?context=5)|One of my favorites as well. I like all of their stuff, just some more than others.
[Does he really have a big cock, or is he just pumped to buy something's from a thrift shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caermpt?context=5)|Probably both. Can't say from personal experience.
[Did you get to drive the DeLorean from the thrift shop video? Was it well taken care of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesasj?context=5)|I wasn't there on the filming of the DeLorean or the intro scenes. It was a beautiful car though. Very well-manicured.
[What was the job itself like? You said you worked merch and got school credits for it. What were the hours like? How many days per week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeri2b?context=5)|I worked every day of the work week for about 6-7 hours. It was so fun and so busy.
 |I was in the studio when I filled orders on the computer, got the actual merch into their packages, post office runs, south seattle runs for more clothing. VERY BUSY.
[Assuming you attend a university or college, what school do you go to? And how did you make the proper connections to land yourself this amazing opportunity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerqn5?context=5)|I go to Northern Arizona University and I was in the right place at the right time and talked to the right person. That's literally all that happened. Keep in mind they were not worldwide superstars when I interned.
[Hey, Go Jacks! Thanks for all those football wins vs. Arizona.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesjsu?context=5)|Kiss my axe.
[What did you spend most of your time doing as an intern? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqs9q?context=5)|Answered this previously but it was mainly shipping merch and organizing merch pickup/manufacturer stuff. Customer service. Filling orders. Seems like nothing, but very tedious and busy work.
[Did he think it was cool that people were using his music to make CoD videos? Did he ever watch any? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesb89?context=5)|I'm sure he has watched a few, but I don't think he is up on his CoD gameplay watching.
[How did you come to work for them, and what sort of things did you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer0hm?context=5)|I ran into the right people at the right time. I can't say names, but just never let anything stop you. Ask questions and always strive for what you want to do. Seriously. I just tried and it happened.
 |I shipped merch, filled orders, did customer service, worked with clothing manufacturers, watered plants here and there. The usual.
[Can you shed some light on how they keep everything together? As in them doing the independent thing and having to book your own shows, handling money, etc. and how exactly did you help them? What were your duties? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesdrg?context=5)|I'm not sure how they keep everything together in terms of handling money. I know that it is a lot more work for them to make sure everything is done right and in an orderly fashion, but I don't think there are really any tricks to the trade. They are just (moderately) smart with their money and they know how to run the business. Zach Quillen, their manager is also extremely good at what he does (booking, etc.)
 |I shipped merch out, filled orders, maintained customer service and emails, worked with clothin manufacturers, watered plants.
[Man, that's awesome! As far as Thrift Shop vocals, are they providing a grounds for other local artists to record and develop talented projects together? (Makes me wish I lived in Seattle.\) That's crazily humble of them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetl1v?context=5)|They are going to try to work with other artists in the future, but nothing has really happened with that as they have been so busy on tour and being famous. You know. They do try to work with as many artists as they can (as in collaborating) to get their names out their as well.
[Again, thanks! Also, sounds like a completely awesome experience for you. Best of luck with your future PR endeavors, they're lucky to have a person like you on their team. (Especially with the success and good word put into this AMA.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetl1v?context=5)|Thank you so much. Very glad this went so successfully. 
[OP, have they ever farted around you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caetdyn?context=5)|Probably. I was with them a good amount of time.
[Did you get paid as an intern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesaah?context=5)|In school credits, yes,
[Did they actually buy a broken keyboard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesca9?context=5)|Yes.
[Any chance the Thrift Shopper himself needs a new best friend? You did say it's always good to ask.. Don't let me down mister ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeqxdd?context=5)|I'm probably not the guy to ask. Find Ben, ask him, and see where it goes from there. 
[How did you get this internship? I live in Seattle and would love to have an opportunity like this. What an experience!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caer9cd?context=5)|I talked to the right people at the right time. If you get the chance, just ask. That's all I did and it worked out for me.
 |Soak in that Seattle sun. I miss that bitch.
[Did you tour with them full time then? Also, did you get to meet some other artists while interning? Sounds like a really awesome experience!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caerbsq?context=5)|I did not tour with them, I just went to OSU at the beginning of the summer because it was during the internship and we road tripped down to Oregon.
 |Unfortunately I didn't meet many of the artists on the album, although I did meet a few.
[Did you guys know Thrift Shop/ The Heist would be such a big break for Ben and Ryan? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caeshhf?context=5)|I don't think anyone knew it would be a break at the caliber that it was. Nobody was expecting it, that's for sure. 
[When making a song, is the beat made first, and Macklemore raps to that, or are the lyrics written first and the beat added afterwards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesict?context=5)|They have made songs both ways, whether Ben writes the lyrics first or Ryan makes a beat. It all works pretty well, apparently.
[Did you get to know the 2 on a personal level? Or were you are no name intern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caesk9i?context=5)|I got to know them on a personal level. They both know my name.
[How much do you have in your pocket right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fxbks/iama_previous_intern_with_macklemore_ryan_lewis/caes7ke?context=5)|$9.

1fxgt0,2,2013-06-08,How achievable is finding a job in this field?,maybe2,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1fxgt0/how_achievable_is_finding_a_job_in_this_field/,"Hello everyone I have been lurking in this sub for a while and I just made up the courage to post something here. I am done with my first year of college ( Computer Science ), and have to have an internship in my 3rd year.

I see a lot of people saying that they work in this field, so I was wondering, is it achievable to get an internship in a game-development oriented company / entry-level job in such a company at the end of your studies?  

Bonus question : Can you have internships only when the college requests you to have an internship , or can you have it anytime (I'm not referring to your ability to apply for one, but do recruiters accept people that apply for internships, yet they aren't at the end of their studies. Also I'm curious about this one : Can you apply for an internship at companies that don't have displayed an available internship position?

I am trying to rack up as many projects under my belt as possible, having had made 3 small games so far, planning this summer to learn another language in which to make another small game.

My brain feels like mush constantly, and after ~4 hours I feel completely useless (even more so than the general feeling of uselessness). This is more exhausting than physical labor, but without any of the reward at the end (quality sleep, satisfaction). 

I am getting doubts about spending my adult life sitting in front of a screen, and am starting to think that just about anything would be better, although I am certain the grass is always greener applies."
1fx4x8,1,2013-06-08,Should I continue college after getting a misdemeanor?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fx4x8/should_i_continue_college_after_getting_a/,"Hello Reddit. I need some advice, but I can't seem to find anybody that has any experience or solid reasoning for my situation. I really need some help, and any insight or information would be greatly appreciated.

I returned to college after 10+ years of not being in school, working toward a degree in an information technology major. I struggled initially with going to class as I have bi-polar disorder. My doctor misdiagnosed me with depression (his words), and put me on some rather powerful antidepressants. He explained to me, after my incident, that antidepressants are bad for those with bi-polar because they can enter a super-manic state, which can put a person in a really bad state of mind and can have serious consequences. My consequence ended up being a misdemeanor criminal mischief conviction.

I have never been in trouble with the law in my life. I'm one of those people that can't handle waiting for someone in a fire lane for even 20 seconds because it is against the law and it would bother me.

I recently applied for an internship but was rejected because of this conviction. I have a year left of college, but cannot graduate without an internship. Even if I graduate, I am very worried that I will never be able to get a job in my field because of this. I wonder if I should just drop out now, as it is expensive and time consuming, and not worth that waste if I won't be able to get a job.

What should I do? Where do I go from here? I am struggling with daily life as this weighs very heavily on me. Help me Reddit, you are my only hope."
1fx2en,2,2013-06-08,Just got a coop offer. not sure if i should accept,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1fx2en/just_got_a_coop_offer_not_sure_if_i_should_accept/,"Hey everyone, never posted on here before but I'm currently at a crossroads and would like input from 3rd party, non-biased group of people.

Recently I got a job offer from GE oil and gas to work as a co-op during the fall 2013 semester. I interviewed with then last October (fall 2012) and it was a general interview for spring/summer/fall internships. When i hadn't heard back and no one responded to my emails, I assumed I didn't get the job. I did however get a job offer from Solvay chemicals and am currently working for them as a summer intern in one of their eco plants. Most of my supervisors seem to really like me so far and really want me to apply for full time when i graduate. I wouldnt want to risk my chances with them if they found out i went to a different company which i might not even like working for.

On one hand, even though I already have an internship for this summer, there's no such thing as too much experience and a coop with GE is a really good opportunity. Ill get to travel to a new place, and work for an entire semester with a different company and in a different culture. It would also build my resume significantly and help me network with really important people.

On the other hand it's just a one term coop, and I would have to push graduation back a whole year. I'd also have nothing to take the next spring since all my electives are out of the way and our courses are blocked in by semester. When I come back to regular chemE classes after that I wouldn't know anyone in my classes. My friends, study groups, peers that I've taken classes with the last 2 years will all have graduated and i wont know anyone in the year below me.

I would also need to consider the cost of living there by myself for 4 months... and figure out how I'm going to get around since i don't have a car. Also from the job description they sent me its seems like more of a lab setting as opposed to a plant setting which is where i would rather end up. Ill be doing r&amp;d-type work which really isn't what I want to do after i graduate.

I also just got elected as president of our Omega Chi Epsilon and Aiche chapters. Both leadership positions i was actually looking forward to having during my final year. (remember, i thought the possibility of a coop was out of the question)

Basically.... Take the job for the sake of Work &amp; professional life or Decline the job for the sake of a social life and hope that I can still get a decent job offer with what i already have on my resume.

Facts i left out: just finished my junior year of chemE at LSU, have a gpa &gt; 3.5, active member of AICHE, OXE, TBP, EWB, &amp; the LGBT advocacy group at our school. Only classes i have left- Unit operations (F), Reaction Kinetics (F), Process Controls (F), UO lab (S), Materials (S) and Plant design (S). (IM SO CLOSE I CAN TASTE IT)

Just let me know what you guys think. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been in this position.

Call me uppity.",JamesJohnHardy,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1fwz9v/this_new_unpaid_internship_craze_i_will_not_work/,"I go to a third-rate public university because I don't come from money and I will **never** accumulate a six-figure debt before even owning anything but a rag with a prestigious emblem. To shit with the supposed job opportunities that come with said rag; quite a few young people are graduating from private universities, even in STEM fields, and heading right back to McDonald's. School is not everything in the real world, and that's what our ignorant elders *keep failing* to *understand*!

My university email account gets a constant barrage of ""job posting"" messages. That's supposed to mean FUCKING **JOB** POSTINGS, not these outrageously infuriating unpaid internships! Also, I occasionally look for gigs on Craigslist, and at least half the postings there are invariably unpaid. And yes, I am looking in a Reddit-vaunted STEM field as well as in writing, which I can obviously by this post at least do with competence.

Corporations are shameless. Thankfully, my university doesn't require us to take unpaid internships for credit as all too many schools do. Doubtless these schools are receiving decent compensation for sending so many gofers their way. Nonetheless, I am constantly barraged with messages about how internships are necessary for getting a job.

[They are illegal](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm), but go on unchecked. What in the fuck do you think an intern's purpose is? I'll tell you what it is. It's to be as good a boy or girl as possible so you can impress your potential future employer. It's to fetch coffee and file papers. It's to prove that one day, you might get a reference from your boss if not a job from him or her. But that day never seems to be today.

I refuse to participate. I'll never give any of **MY** time and **MY** effort without fair pay. I already make OK money freelancing, so if I have to go through an unpaid ""trial period"" to get a job, I won't take your fucking job just to make some Ivy League MBA jerk even richer; I'll keep doing what I'm doing. I won't work for someone who does no work of his or her own, opting instead to drink in his or her plush office and delegate tasks. I know all too well these ""manager"" types; they talk like they work 25 hours a day dragging a cross through the building, but this is a Machiavellian PR tactic; they really just drink in their office, delegate all the work to their subordinates, and take all the credit while passing down all the blame. They hold ""meetings"" in country clubs and upscale restaurants. They don't work; they live it up on the fruits of our labor!
__________
Oh, and (trigger warning) I came across [this video](http://youtu.be/zs_Hld6Wj8U?t=2m42s) in which Kevin O'Leary says exactly what I'm saying: that unpaid interns are there to impress their boss through hard work, and their only compensation is that they *might* get a job later on.

Fuck that country club Republican, silk-curtain Irish blowhard in the ass. Obviously he's taking his hollow rich WASP businessman act to the outrageous extreme with his libertarian fuck-everyone-but-me rhetoric. We've seen what unbridled capitalism did to your people 100-odd years ago, working long hours in miserable conditions for pennies, and he wants it to happen again. And it is happening again through the modern internship craze, the decline of unions, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
__________
**EDIT:** A couple of commenters are indignantly huffing about how most unpaid internships in fact *are* legal according to my link; they're ""working interviews,"" in fact!

Look at [this Craigslist section for New York unpaid writing gigs](http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/wrg?zoomToPosting=&amp;query=&amp;srchType=A&amp;addThree=nopay). If you want an example, look at [this ""Blogger Internship"" post](http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/wrg/3858737854.html). Clearly these people are looking for free workers, offering nothing but résumé padding and/or a potential job there in the future.

Now look at the Department of Labor link above. Note the line about ""no immediate advantage."" I am not a lawyer, but give me a break on this one. Of course there are some internships which provide training and not exploitation, but don't act like I'm ranting about a fantasy. Notice Kevin O'Leary's statement above as well. This is how businesspeople think, unfiltered and unadulterated. Prove me wrong."
1fwrve,1,2013-06-08,Is there any way to stick up for yourself as an intern?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fwrve/is_there_any_way_to_stick_up_for_yourself_as_an/,"My supervisor started out really nice, but as the weeks have progressed, she’s become ruder and ruder to the point that I don’t want to work with her anymore. Nothing I do is ever right or good enough for her, and she treats me like I’m about two inches tall. The most maddening thing is she will get angry at me for not doing things that I was never told to do. I’ve never had a problem with a job or boss in my life, but she makes me so nervous that I’m going to slip up – and I always do, according to her – that going to work is no longer enjoyable when she’s there. She even called my work useless once. She will say these things within earshot of the whole office, and they probably all think I’m an idiot now. I don’t know what to do.


I’m honestly starting to think that she’s doing this on purpose, and am super paranoid now when she asks me to do anything because I just know she will find things wrong with it and then make me feel as stupid as possible. There is no way to make her happy. 


She is well established and good at what she does. As an intern, I have no power, not even to say “Excuse me, you never told me this.” I absolutely understand about “paying your dues” and all that, but it’s the principle of the thing. Is there any way I can stand up for myself?"

Most of my education has been very theoretical but I make up for it by exploring languages in my free time. I currently have a summer internship at a large corporation doing application development in Java/JS/SQL. However, I think for next summer (and after college) I want to try and work for a company that specifically hires CS/Math talent.        
    

I've heard (mostly rumors from fellow students) that these areas are good for CS/Math double majors: Financial Algorithms, Computer/Cyber Security, Higher learning/university research    
    

Can anyone point me in the right direction? Not looking for the most lucrative area - just one that CS/Math double majors may fit well in. It seems really hard for me to find information on such a specific question like this, so I figured I would ask here. I hope this hasn't been asked yet - I used the search function and couldn't find much.

I'm finding my intro ArcGIS course really didn't do much to prepare me for real-world work applications except teach me what the buttons are and how to trace borders it seems.

I find myself in a bit of a pickle in my internship this summer: I'm working for an ecological restoration organization and my boss would like me to *update a data dictionary* for a TrimbleXT Geoexplorer 6000 by adding a few items to the drop down menus associated with the map. He would also like me to *learn how to create data dictionaries for future mapping needs.* I shouldn't say ""he wants me to,"" because *I* want to. I really like this company and would like to demonstrate I can do this.

I can make maps with existing data collected using the Trimble, but I have zero clue how to make a data dictionary because it was never taught to me. 

I have access to: ArcMap (10.1, i believe - i'm home for the weekend now) ArcCatalog, and ArcPad (on the PC). Also, Excel and Access. They do not have Pathfinder, and while I am able to open the file on ArcPad/Catalog on the PC, I seem to be unable to edit on either one. Perhaps there is a wizard or edit functionality I am missing somewhere?

Can any of you guys help me out by offering instructions or point me in the right direction to links with instructions that don't require Pathfinder?

Please excuse my semi-ignorance, I'm motivated to learn this but can't spend an extended period of time on the phone with ESRI in the office because I'm in the field 90% of the work day.

[Who had the idea to add the Simon &amp; Garfunkel music in Season 4?  Goddamn brilliant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeeir8?context=5)|I believe it was Mitch Hurwitz' idea.  After all, he is a genius.  I did get to arrange the Mariachi version of Sounds Of Silence.  It was a fairly challenging assignment.  Listen to the Simon &amp; Garfunkel record.  Especially the tempo changes in the first four bars. Classic!
[David Schwartz, why don't you... share the song Getaway, full version Getaway, catchy tune Getaway? We're hopefully hopeful!  PS: Thank you for making this great show even better, I love your music!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedopp?context=5)|I too am hopefully hopeful.  The song should be up on the Netflix blog anytime now.  Gabriel Mann and I will be creating a full length version that will be available on the after mentioned.  
[Annyong Mr. Schwartz! Welcome to reddit, the unofficial Arrested Development fan club. Thanks for taking time to answer our questions.  1\) Your music encompasses just about every style, so who would you say are your influences?  2\) Do you ever hang out with other TV/film composers, like Post or Zimmer?  3\) Aside from bass, did you play any other instruments for AD? Was that you whistling in the opening theme? Because that is some damn fine whistling.  And speaking of the opening theme, (can't believe I'm about to link this\) how badly did I butcher your piece?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedqmw?context=5)|I love your re-orchestration of the theme!  Awesome! My influences are varied.  Like any composer it's a total sum of my life's musical experiences. Early on, as a bassist, I played in almost every style imaginable: Orchestra, jazz combos, rock bands, Glen Miller orchestra (as a sub for two weeks, way after the departure of Glen), country bands, soul bands.  It gave me a lot to draw on as a composer. Although I've met Mike Post and Hans, unfortunately we don't hang out...yet, i'm still hoping. Besides bass, I play other instruments as needed.  I try to get other players as much as possible.  Special mention goes to George Doering, guitarist, ukeleleist, and one of the best all around musicians I've had the pleasure to know. Also a great guy! The superb whistling is my good friend and musician James McVay. He calls his style, Merry Milkman. 
[How many ukeleles do you own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedgbn?context=5)|You can't have too many ukeleles, but I've been getting close lately. I have a variety of different ukes  I love my Mya Moe 6 string and resonator uke.  My first uke was a KoAloha and is still a favorite.  The arrested signature uke is actually a tahitian ukelele from Bora Bora and has four double course (strings), all the same gauge fishing wire.
[Did you write all of the fictional songs too, eg Getaway, or just the link up/background parts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedlgu?context=5)|Yes, I've written the great majority of songs for the show. It's something we started with the very first episode. It's pretty unique in television and I have a great time doing it. Gabriel Mann has been a co-writer and singer on many of the songs.  As has been Lucy Schwartz and Larry John McNally.  All great singers.  Interestingly, we usually start and finish the songs in one night, often starting around 10pm, that way I can write score all day and get a boost of energy when we start the song. There's definitely some songs we wish we could've made longer versions for, but there's rarely the time.  I usually have a week or less to do score and songs for each episode of Arrested D. 
[Was it your idea to give each character's episode in the new series it's own unique flair? I absolutely loved it and have always loved the music on the series. Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caee9jy?context=5)|When we started this season, Mitch felt it should be some how different.  Especially since each episode is usually more about a single character.  I think he came up with the idea of adding something for each character.  The woodblock solo performed by jazz great/drummer Peter Erskine, is a personal favorite of mine.
[Did you arrange the ""gothic"" version of the Final Countdown as used here ( Link to www.youtube.com \) or did it already exist?  If a certain musical cue is used in a situation (as in this example\), is it up to you or does the script call for it or how does the process between you and Mitch Hurwitz work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedynk?context=5)|Yes the arrangement was mine.  Mitch, writer producer Jim Valley, myself and the music editor, Jason Tregoe Newman watch a rough cut of the show and discuss all the spots where we would like to have music.  There's often a lot of back and forth and a great deal of laughter.  Mitch is funnier in the room than anyone I know.  We also decide what we'd like the music to do. A lot of this can change when I actually start the composing process. 
[How do you feel about the Timocil song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeexwc?context=5)|I feel great about it! Especially when I'm on my meds.
[What inspired the ukulele theme? I liked the derivative that netflix used for their bumper. Was that your composition as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caee0d2?context=5)|Right before we started the original series. I had just returned from a trip to Bora Bora, where I had found a Tahitian Ukulele.  A wonderful Polynesian gentleman who played uke in the hotel bar helped me find one from a luthier friend of his.  Mitch Hurwitz the incredible creator of Arrested D heard the uke on a short cue I did and asked if we could use it for the theme. It was definitely a break through moment and helped define the music for the series. Almost every episode has a old style swing tune composed for that episode. Using the use of ukuleles gives it a unique flavor. 
[Just want to say this scene has one of the best bits of music. I don't know why, but the music fits so well with the looks on Gob's, George's, and Franklin's face. Also, are you the one or did someone else come up with ""It Ain't Easy Being White?""-Franklin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeer33?context=5)|I miss Franklin.  I'm hoping for a Fox spin-off next season.  That song was particularly fun to write.  I crack up whenever I hear Will sing it.  His relationship with Franklin always touches me.  
[Andale Hermano is awesome!! Do you have a version of it longer than 20 seconds??  Link to www.youtube.com ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeigrv?context=5)|I wish! It actually might be a little bit longer. We wrote that at 1:00am and then talked Antonio Soul into coming over to sing it with Gabe. Everyone's voice was totally blown out from singing and laughing. Bravo  Hermanos!
[*Balls in the Air* is my absolute FAVORITE. Just sayin'. That is all.  Actually, EDIT: oh my god. Is it just me, or does the version of 'Getaway' on your site include the lyrics ""Your tricks, they got no magic..."" ?! :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caehs12?context=5)|Get Away – Arrested Development By David Schwartz &amp; Gabriel Mann Oh, there’s nothing to ya Yeah, I see right through ya You’re losing it, you’re losing it You’re laughin’ but you’re tragic Your tricks they got no magic You’re losing it, you always miss Why don’t you go away Get away Far away Stay away You’re hopelessly hopeless Get away Why don’t you go away Get away Far away Stay away You’re hopelessly hopeless Get away.
[Who were the session musicians for the intro and credits?? The band sounded really tight.  Also, how much do you end up composing and using live musicians? A film composer friend of mine (sci-fi network movies mostly\) uses almost all samples ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caee0nb?context=5)|I'm lucky enough to have access to some fantastically talented musicians.  You can listen to theme on my website [Link to www.davidschwartzmusic.co](http://www.davidschwartzmusic.co) All the musicians for the theme should be listed there as well.
[Do you ever use your last name in reference to Spaceballs to raise the sexual tension in a room full of ladies?  Because I hope you do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caee4bt?context=5)|I wish I had thought of that!  May the Schwartz be with you!
[ off let me say I love the show and your music. I have a few questions if you are not already overcome with too many.  How long does it take to get the end product for the show, from start to finish and how long does the studio give you to complete it?  Also I am very interested to know what the studio tells you when they request a piece, do they give you any guidelines as what it should sound like or mood it should evoke in the listener?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeeeb4?context=5)|Turnaround is often less than a week.  It can vary greatly depending on what's going on in post production and air dates. Arrested is very unique in that we don't have a formal review process of music.  I'm honored and it also inspires me to write from my first instincts.  Of course we now have a huge library so we have some options for the final dub / show mix.   Also, I like to be on the stage for the final mix if the schedule allows.  This is generally NOT the norm in television.  
[Thank you very much for answering my question, however in doing so you have rustled up my curiosity. You said how Arrested Development is ""very unique"" in the sense of music and how it doesn't have a formal review process of music, in what other ways is Arrested Development unique? and do you mingle with the cast well or to they tend to kept to themselves and you yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeeyk9?context=5)|I think everything in Arrested is unique as it all comes from the unique mind of Mitchell Hurwitz.  Composers are usually kept locked away in a dark studio. It's unusual to meet the cast. Although I'm not hanging out with our fantastic cast, or mingling on a daily basis, I have had some opportunities to interact with them.
[Did you make the Motherboy theme and who is the singer?  Also, did you create the Hung jury?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeiisr?context=5)|Yes to Motherboy. A personal favorite. Gabriel Mann is once again the singer and co-writer. Of course, I was thrilled to be working with Mr. Hung.
[Do you get to meet the cast a lot? Any interesting stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedi7d?context=5)|I actually have met the cast a few times. They are as funny and as bright as you might imagine.  Interesting fact: Jessica Walters' dad was a great bassist and bass teacher in NYC.  As a bassist myself, it's something we can bond with. I also worked with Will on ""Running Wilde"".  I was in NYC visiting the set, Will was there in a smoking jacket and gave me a personal tour of the mansion that they were shooting in. All in all quite surreal. 
[What are our odds of getting a full-length mariachi ""Sound of Silence""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caehzaa?context=5)|I'm in - if Paul Simon is.
[I've always found the music that goes along with AD to have that ""comedy"" vibe to it. Two part question. Was that your intention? And if it was where do you draw inspiration to write a funnier upbeat style of music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caee746?context=5)|I may have said this before, but I always try to write music that is fun, as opposed to funny. It's very much about pace and timing. I like to reference feel good music.  There's a lot of television music from other shows that the music is there to tell you that it's funny. Wah-wah-wah waaah...pizz pizz pizz... With Arrested, that's not necessary.  Sometimes playing the scene very seriously or over the top mock-drama can be extremely funny. 
[Will we ever hear a ukelele version of ""Christmas Time is Here""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caef2hf?context=5)|That's a good idea! Although the original Vince Guaraldi version is a classic.  
[I only have one question.  Need an intern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caefsb6?context=5)|Not at the moment, I have a fantastic studio manager/assistant, Justin DiCenzo. Keep in touch, we occasionally do need an intern when it gets busy. 
[I'm probably too late for you to answer this, but there was a song on Arrested Development, I think Season 3, called Shot By Love which I've had stuck in my head for the best part of a decade. I can't find the song anywhere, and I just need to know if there is anywhere I can download it, or if you have it and can put it up on YouTube or something? Please dear God have it...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caegett?context=5)|""Shot By Love"" I co-wrote with my longtime friend, Larry John McNally. LJM sang it and it's one of my faves too. Sorry it has lodged itself in your head for such a long time. I will pitch it for the soundtrack CD.
[In the first episode of the new season, someone passes Michael and he says ""That guy thinks he's a musician."" Am I completely wrong or is that you passing him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeftjv?context=5)|Not me.  Jason Bateman's delivery of that line is pitch perfect. I did write the score under that scene called ""She's Cute"". Interestingly we made that song work in future episodes when the actors spontaneously sing a line of dialog.  Michael sings ""I've just a met a girl today"" and Tobias sings ""it's just a phallusy"" twice. Amazingly, without too much adjustment, I somehow found a way too use she's cute as an accompaniment to these ad-lib melodies. 
[Hey Mr. Schwartz, huge fan of the show! Who's idea was it to do the head down sad monologue so often? Did they have any idea it would be such a hit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caejyux?context=5)|That's Snoopy's theme (Christmas Time is Here) and was a brilliant Mitch Hurwitz idea.
[Whose idea to put ""Cry Love"" (John Hiatt\) in?  I'm not sure I've heard any other popular music in the show, right?  Good song.  Edit: Save ""The Final Countdown"".  But, I'd that's all part of the trick...no, illusion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeduyb?context=5)|""Cry Love"" has always been a favorite song of Mitchell Hurwitz. 
[David! I really enjoy the outro music and I think that the trumpet solo is really tasteful. I have a question- is there an edit in there or did the band flip the beat purposely? I noticed it sometime while I was watching the 3rd season. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/cael7y2?context=5)|That's trumpeter extraordinaire, Tom Marino. Tom and Rick Baptist have been my trumpet guys since the beginning. Two of the best. You have good ears. It is an edit.
[As a producer that's mostly written dance orientated electronic music, I'm very interested in branching out into film scoring and composing. Any advice for someone like me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedi25?context=5)|There is NO one way.  I got my break by writing a friends movie score that he self financed.  The movie never came out, but one of about 20 people who saw the film was Cheryl Bloch.  Two years later she gave me a chance to try to write something for Northern Exposure.  It became the theme and I got my first scoring job! It was incredibly fortunate as the show was both very popular and very good.  Josh Brand, creator of the show and the other producers were all extremely knowledgable about music and we would use different styles of music for every episode.  This was an incredible learning experience and entrance to a composing career.  One of the best ways to break in, is to work for an established composer, be a great assistant, and try to pick up everything you can while doing the job of helping the composer with what's needed. Also, take any scoring job that you can.  Student films also can be a great starting point. And that student director may turn out to be the next  Ron Howard.  Incidentally, Ron is as nice as you would imagine. 
[What is your drink of choice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caee6oc?context=5)|If you happen to be at my studio at 4pm, it's yogurt shake time! I find if I don't have planned interruptions and breaks, I don't get out of the chair for ten hours.  The 4pm shake break is very popular among my session musicians and assistants.
 |My scheduled 4pm yogurt-shake break. A favorite among my studio musicians and assistant! It allows me to step back for a minute, take a breath, and see the music in a new light.  It's also very tasty! If you're ever in Santa Monica, visit SPARKY'S YOGURT.  Sparky is my hero/lifestyle coach! 
[There was a big change with the way the show was shot between seasons 1-3 and season 4. Do you think that is kind of a slow transition into how the movie would be filmed if it were to be made? If that was the case, would the music change much or do you think you'll be able to create longer musical montages throughout?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caelbzm?context=5)|I think the change comes from a few different things. This season was shot almost entirely on location -- former seasons were mostly shot on set. The episodes are also quite a bit longer than the 22 minutes we broadcast on Fox. I do agree it's more filmic and I'm hoping it leads to a feature film in the near future. I'm sure when that happens, the music will change. When it does, I'll be asking for a 200 piece orchestra and a children's choir. Also, an 80 piece ukelele orchestra. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here.

But I don't really have any privileged info. I'm hoping there will be a movie next. 
[Fantastic tunes!  Your music IS an Arrested Development character!  Anyway, I noticed you had an overhaul to your website (davidschwartzmusic.com\).  The last version of the site had a Contact button where fans could send you messages directly.  I don't see that option on the new site.

[Was it hard to go back to the show and come up with the same style of music after you've been away from it for so long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeew1y?context=5)|It was a challenge going back after 6 years.  I think all of us on the show felt that we had to top ourselves in every way.  Once I saw the rough cuts, I felt very comfortable.  I do feel the show has advanced musically.  
[Hello David Schwartz! I'm a recent graduate from the USC Thornton School of Music with a Masters in trombone performance. How does one break into playing on scores such as yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeetz2?context=5)|Interesting.  My assistant Justin DiCenzo who started working with me this year happens to play trombone. He's quite good and he's playing on a number of cues.  That's one way in!

[What is your Favorite episode? And what was the hardest task you were faced with when composing Arrested Devolopement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedya4?context=5)|I love all Arrested D episodes.  The hardest task is getting enough sleep while composing 14 hours a day 7 days a week.  That said it remains inspiring to me. 
[Hi. Love the music choices in the series. There's a song that appeared a few times throughout the original--most prominently the series finale Season 3. The lyrics sound something like ""What could be better"".  What is the name of this composition and is it possible to purchase?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedbwx?context=5)|Good question, the name of that song is ""What Could Be Better"", it's a personal favorite of mine.  Hopefully there will be a soundtrack soon and I would hope this song is on it.  
[Are Raine Maida's vocals used in the ""what you trying to say to me"" track? It sounds so much like him, and I heard the two of you know each other. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caehufv?context=5)|If memory serves, that was Alia/Maeby singing. I know Raine a bit and he's a fantastic singer and artist - but he's not a 15 year old girl.
[Hey David! Thanks for reaching out to reddit. What is one of the stranger sound recordings you have used while composing your original music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedqmd?context=5)|My guitarist George Doering has a fondness for the STYLOPHONE.  Although he is a virtuoso on the instrument, I find I have to hide the instrument after a couple of tracks are completed.  
[Is your nickname really D. Fly or is that just imdb misinformation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedps3?context=5)|Yes, but here is the correct spelling: d.Fly.
 |People ask where the nickname comes from, but I will never tell.
[Did you write Getaway? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeidfb?context=5)|Yes.
[In the new season, there's a scene with George Michael and P Hound in a music room after the band walks out on them.  There are a few bars of music on the chalkboard that APPEAR more than just random background.  Can you shed any light on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeeyhy?context=5)|I was there when that scene was being shot at Occidental college.  The music was already up on the black board (green board?) when I arrived.   
[What are the chords to ""It Aint Easy Being White""?? Been trying to find it out especially when they play it with the hung jury.  ""...he's not coming back""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeljuz?context=5)|If I have time, I'll ask Franklin and try to get back to you with the chords next week. 
[I LOVE your music! Any chance of making a CD of the AD songs, especially those that weren't included on the DVD extras? Also, was that your own arrangement of ""Jingle Bells"" from the ""In God We Trust"" episode? Because that was fantastic!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caef31a?context=5)|Soundtrack is in the works.  I'd like to include as many songs as possible.  There's so much to choose from.  I actually don't remember the Jingle Bells arrangement. It could be me...asking music editor extraordinaire Jason Tregoe Newman.  
[Hello Mr. Schwartz!  I have 2 questions.  What do you like to draw on for inspiration?  How does composing for comedy differ from drama in your experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caefx7c?context=5)|See earlier answers for the answer to part 1. Comedy and drama can be very different. It's really about supporting the picture and the story. So in that way, every show or movie is unique.  Very often, I try to have the music provide an emotional element that's not on the screen. 
[With all the music you have written for Arrested Development, it must be tempting to use mostly existing music from your AD library.  I was relieved to hear new music from you for season 4!  Keep up the new music!  Thank you!  And now a question:  So much of season 4 seemed to be worked on at the same time (with Mitch directing and editing  episodes simultaneously\).  Were you scoring in much the same way for this colossal release?  If so, was it confusing or more difficult to your process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeffbl?context=5)|It's always my goal to write as much new music as possible. Mitch definitely has some favorites from the original three seasons.  I think he's also very afraid of me dying.  I also have that fear at times. So, with that said, I still try to write as much new stuff as possible. I'm having so much fun and I hope that will help with longevity. The interconnectivity of these 15 episodes definitely created some tactical challenges. Sometimes I was working on 3 or more episodes simultaneously and it could get confusing. The last 4 episodes answered a lot of questions for me.
[What's your favorite episode of *Arrested Development*? Favorite moment/joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caef7ln?context=5)|I blued myself is definitely up there.
[Did you write the song that plays over the final credits in season 4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caefb8n?context=5)|Actually, the end credits music existed in the first 3 seasons too.  It just wasn't played on the broadcast version, as they were busy hyping the next show.  Sometimes in Season 4, we played a full version of a song used in that episode. One episode we used a song by Gabe and me called ""You'll never hear from me again"" it's a classic R&amp;B song in the Philly soul style sung by Louis Price from the Temptations. The lyrics are pretty funny.  The last episode features Lucy Schwartz' ""Boomerang"".
[Also, I saw you wrote the theme for Deadwood. Can you talk about your inspirations for it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caefb8n?context=5)|I got the call to try and write a theme for Deadwood from producer Steve Turner.  They needed the theme in 24 hours. I said I was under the Eifel tower and there was no way I could do it.  He said they couldn't wait then I said it was the Eifel tower in Vegas and that I'd catch the next plane back to write.  I ended up having 2 days incorporating the producers and directors notes.  David Miltch said the music should show the possibilities of a new and wild frontier land. I also had the picture to work with.  All that provided, great inspiration.  Most TV themes are written before there is picture. It can be nice when you have the picture first. 
[OH MY GOD I LOVE YOUR WORK. Especially that little Eastern European tune that is Tobias's theme--I start laughing just after hearing the first few strums.  PLEASE answer this question, because it has been bugging me for years now. What is the name of the sultry saxophone time that plays when Lucille and Oscar get intimate during seasons 2-3?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caejz80?context=5)|The Tobias tune is called Tobias. There's a second version called Dr. Tobias. It's a favorite of mine too, possibly because I can't begin to figure out how the hell I wrote it. I love those kind of creation mysteries.
[How did you come to compose such brilliant music for the series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedgok?context=5)|Thanks I still haven't really figured that out. It's what I love most about my job. The great mystery that happens when you combine music and picture. Having a show as inspiring as Arrested D makes it a little easier. 
[I've never seen the show, should I watch it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caedtg3?context=5)|YES.
[Glad you're here! I just started watching Arrested Development last week (I know, I'm late to the party, but hey, I'm in Season 4\).  2 questions:   Did you write the little ukelele piece for the ""Netflix Semi-Original Series"" Season 4 intro with the Bluth stair truck? Because that 12 second or so piece of music has been stuck in my head for like 5 days.  What was your reaction when the show was first cancelled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caejs5b?context=5)|Yes the Netflix theme logo theme for Arrested is mine. Try singing It's a Small World 3 times to unstick it from your head. Or you could try singing Getaway - equally effective.  When the show was cancelled, it was doubly sad as I also had to look for another job. We really didn't become a hit until we were cancelled, so there's a silver lining somewhere in there.
[Hi, David! In the opening and ending credits, I hear a lot of similarity in the bass part to the style of Jaco Pastorius. Particularly this tune. Is that a coincidence, or are you a late-'70s jazz-fusion nerd like I am?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caekzob?context=5)|I did have a short fusion phase. Jaco will always be the greatest. Have you read Peter Erskine's new book, ""No Beethoven""? Excellent Weather Report and Jaco stories. A really fun read.
[How did you make that base line so catchy? It was stuck in my head forever. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caelcq9?context=5)|As a bassist and composer, that is my evil plan. Thanks!
[Do you have a musical touchstone, a piece you go to for inspiration when you've found yourself stuck on something? For example, I remember reading somewhere that John Williams has Howard Hansen's *Symphony No. 2 ""Romantic""*. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caek4hn?context=5)|When I'm stuck, there's rarely time to reference other music. You just have to tough it out and hope something comes up. Having said that, I find inspiration in different kinds of music from the Beatles and Beethoven, or Blake Mills. I could go on and on...Tom Newman, Motown, Duke Ellington. I think you get the idea - there are way too many to list. 
[What is your favorite vacation spot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caef1g1?context=5)|Anywhere where ukuleles play.

Their resonator ukelele is the bomb. I'm also a huge fan of Ko'Aloha Hawaiian ukuleles.
[Hey David, I'm a huge fan of the show! One of my favorite recurring moments from the show is the Buster/ Oscar daddy moments. I just love that piano. Is that part of a full song or was it just put together as a 3-5 second clip? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caek6ha?context=5)|Thanks! It's just a recurring motif. Mitch had this idea of setting up some huge unknown secret. I'm not sure what the longest version of it is.
[So I started playing ukulele this past December ... Can you show me how to play some of the AD licks? That would be swell. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeldri?context=5)|I would have to learn them again myself. I've seen some youtube videos of people playing the theme on uke...I think that would be a good starting point.
[Whose idea was it to have an instrument symbolising the character that each episode focused on in the new season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeeckg?context=5)|See answer to The Dark Doctor's question.
[Will there be another season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeiyzk?context=5)|I'd like that.
[Franklin D Bluth has the greatest theme song to any character on any television show ever.  Will you ever give us a full version to his funk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caekzci?context=5)|That is a lifetime dream of mine... and Franklin's.
[Have you worked with Troy Miller in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caekucr?context=5)|This is the first time. Troy's great. I think he and Mitch did a fantastic job together.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! How do you fit music to scenes? Are you told how long to cover, and make a form/set a tempo based on that or what's the process like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caekaw1?context=5)|The usual method is to get together with Mitch and music editor Jason Tregoe Newman watch the show and decide where and how long the music should be. Also what the music should say. Then I head back to my studio. I used to spend a lot of time trying to map out tempo. After doing this for awhile, I found that I could just feel the right tempo and go for it - more like a real time performance. I try to get a melody or a chord structure that goes through the entire cue while I'm still in the moment of inspiration -- then I can go back and orchestrate/edit the piece. This keeps me from getting stuck in the first couple of bars, although sometimes you've just got to take it bar by bar.
[All time favorite movie and show? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caejr6z?context=5)|Sorry to cop out - but that's too hard for me. The answer would change daily...hourly.

[I love the music you've made for the show! Are there any specific differences in how you composed Season 4 as opposed to the previous three seasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caejps2?context=5)|Thanks! I think I answered that below.
[Who's idea was Fakeblock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeewv7?context=5)|It came from the writing room. Probably Mitch Hurwitz.
[Bass player here, just wanted to give you huge props for the bassline on the AD theme. Tasteful, elegant, clever, perfect compliment to the tune.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fw4vh/i_am_david_schwartz_composer_of_arrested/caeeueh?context=5)|Thanks, I love bass player compliments!

I came to find that this meant using Microsoft Access to create the database. When looking around for internship opportunities, I never once saw Microsoft Access mentioned, so I'm curious as to how valued knowledge of it is in someone pursuing a CS degree. I'm a rising junior, so I plan on finding something for next summer as well and want to bolster my resume a bit. 

It's paid, and 6 weeks, so my first instinct was to suck it up. However, the more I think about the fact that I'd be dealing with something I'm not too keen on learning, coupled with a 4-5 hour round trip commute on top of an 8 hour work day is very off-putting. With that said, would doing this ultimately be a significant benefit, regardless of my reservations? 

I should mention that the killer commute is public transportation. If I can drive, it'll be half as much travelling, if that. I don't have my own car, though, but if I can borrow one without inconveniencing my family too much then the commute isn't an issue."

I would eventually like to get a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on Distributed Systems from a top-tier institution.  I'm halfway through my undergrad at Ohio State, studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering (basically a CS degree but we append the Engineering label because we're cool or something like that).  I really slacked off -- at least to my mind -- my freshmen year, and while sophomore year was an improvement, I still did not perform to the level I should have, mostly because I slacked off in a few classes that were difficult, but outside my realm of interest (Differential Equations, in which I received a C, being the most glaring example...).  I finished freshman year with ~3.25 and sophomore year with a ~3.43 cumulative GPA.  I do however have a 4.0 within my major, which I absolutely intend to maintain.  I'm currently working as a software engineering intern for cisco this summer.  

I would love to get into a top-tier grad school (in my field that would be Stanford, UC Berkley,Carnegie Mellon, MIT, U of Washington, CalTech, ect.); how damaging will my undergrad GPA be to this endeavor?  I would like to think that I can raise it to at least a 3.6, but, from what I've heard, that's still pretty low for the top-tier institutions.  Am I completely out of the running for acceptance to these universities or do I still have time to fix this?  I would like to think the latter is true, but if you think I'm out of the running, what tier of schools should I be looking at?

On that note, what other actions can I take to offset, for lack of a better word, my less than phenomenal GPA?  Obviously I should get involved with research.  What is the best way to do that?  Is it better to try to get a research internship next summer rather than another software engineering internship, or would researching during the school year and working in industry during the summer demonstrate versatility to grad schools?  Also, I plan to study my ass off for, and hopefully ace, the GRE.  What else should I be doing during my undergrad?

TL;DR: I have a less than incredible (but certainly not abhorrent) cumulative GPA of ~3.4 through my first two years of undergrad.  What can I do to combat this in my quest for acceptance to a top-tier PhD program."

I know [this](http://www.jamiebegin.com/how-to-become-a-successful-freelance-web-developer-and-not-kill-your-career/) blog advised against the 4-year option as it is infinitely less marketable to, say, a Comp Sci major or MIS grad. Then again, do ""worthy"" employers really care what an applicant majored in instead of his portfolio?

Discuss. I was initially studying computer science but the maths got to me and I didn't think I could do it, so I picked an alternate route. I am supposed to begin an internship for my 2-year soon and am -hoping- to get into the field soon."

This year I've learned the fundamentals of OOP and some algorithm writing, almost entirely in Python. I've been writing little pieces code for myself as extra practice.

I'm considering applying for a summer internship with my university's business department. They're asking for undergrads to work just 3-5 hours a week writing and using web crawlers in Python for their research. Does this sound like something I would be prepared for? I consider myself proficient with Python having about two years of experience, but I've never written a crawler before."

[Next, you need to understand the state of the economy. If you are in a small town over saturated with lawyers, it is time to put on your commuter shoes. I travel an hour each way to work. It sucks, but I get to live in a house and eat food. Furthermore, your whole five year plan for reciprocity is actually ludicrous. If there is no work in your area / state, study for another bar exam. The $600 test fee is nothing compared to 5 years of struggling. You know you can pass the MBE, hard part is over. If you need help brainstorming or planning, send me an orange.  You say you are applying for a lot of jobs. How many a day? I was applying for 20 a day before I found mine. You are not getting call backs? They are telling you that you are under / over qualified? Your resume probably sucks. Not the content, but how you sell yourself. Are you writing individual cover letters for each job you have applied for? If you need help with these things SEND ME AN ORANGE (are you seeing a pattern here?\).  How many temp agencies have your resume? Are you only applying in fields in which you want to work? Are you applying to jobs outside of the practice of law which you are educationally qualified for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafwroy?context=5)|I don't have the money for another bar exam, the living expenses during that time, or any connections in another city.  I have been applying to legal and non legal jobs.  I have been applying less when I am working temp jobs, but have never stopped.  I don't know precisely how many applications I've submitted, but it's probably over 500 in the last two years.  
[ I don't condemn you for any of those things.  I condemn you for being an arrogant, self-absorbed asshole.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cag1y4i?context=5)|If I had no evidence, I would agree with you, but I have had the personal experience of going back and forth with professors on public policy and political issues.  In addition, while we used blind grading, I'm sure that my essays were identifiable due to their content.  After reviewing a final with a professor extremely opposed to my ideals, I was told that she could see that I ""had mastery of all the black letter material as well as its application"", she just didn't ""like the way [I] phrased some things"", so she arbitrarily lowered the grade.  There were also some implications as to differences in our ideologies, but she carefully managed what she said as to not create an overt issue of discrimination based on political ideology.
[You're a ""genius"" who happened to be victim to politics and ideology disputes?  Bullshit, you wrote shitty finals.  You did everything right, like clerking, volunteering, and building your skills, but there were no positions available?  Did you ever consider that positions simply aren't available for someone with an attitude like yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cag1y4i?context=5)|I have always been courteous, friendly, and outgoing during law school and in situations around other attorneys or people in the legal industry.  Again, I never said I was perfect, and I am not doing this AMA in the same spirit I would an interview.  I am a very blunt person by nature, but I do understand etiquette.  Do not misconstrue my lack of bullshit on this informal forum for a poor attitude or failing to engage in proper social behavior and networking.  
[""The fact that I know who... should tell you"" - Telling people that they are too stupid to understand you will not help your cause.  Just say thank you for the advice, instead of mentioning how great you are because you know Zig Ziglar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafz6rg?context=5)|I never said I was great.  Coming from your post, I assumed you were in sales yourself.  I have never met anyone outside of sales who knew who Ziglar was.  I was only trying to evidence my legitimate sales credentials.
[If you have so many ""hats"" just call up some local shops - anyone who can do carpentry or landscaping will have a job within a week.  It may not pay a lot  but it pays the bills - your pride is becoming your downfall.  Also, There is no way you understand the ""Great Depression"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafz6rg?context=5)|You obviously think I'm an asshole for wanting to work in at least one of the industries that I went to school for.  I hope you are never put in the same situation that I am.
[What are the underlying motivations as to why you wanted to become an attorney? I ask this because surely someone as smart and talented as you must have known about the grossly over-saturation of attorneys/lawyers right now in the country as a whole, so why did you continue to pursue this career path with this knowledge in mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafqr4z?context=5)|This is no bullshit.  There is a time capsule buried at the elementary school that I attended.  Inside that capsule is a tape recording of my third grade class.  We each stated what we wanted to be when we grew up.  I still remember my words, exactly, ""I want to be a doctor, a lawyer, or a judge.""
 |When I was younger, I had a bit of a complex due to my intelligence.  When I was in second or third grade I found and read a book about Nostradamus my mother had lying around, and freaked out about the world ending.  Then, a few years later, the only thing I could think about was nuclear war.  Anyways, what I'm attempting to illustrate is that I was always a bit different than kids my own age, and I felt that because I was ""gifted"", I had a duty and responsibility to do something important for ""mankind"".  I was steered away from medicine due to the horror stories I heard about the treatment of med students and interns, and eventually found my way into law.
 |The precise way I found myself there was through a business law class while getting my MBA.  My professor had both business and law degrees, and I had never thought about combining them.  I talked to that professor and she told me to go for it.  I also was one of the few people that aced the class, and I really enjoyed it, as well!
 |As for the glut of attorneys, we were never really educated as students or prospective students as to job prospects.  Honestly, even if we were, I probably would have ignored it anyways, because I have always done extremely well, academically.  It wasn't until halfway through my first year of law school that I realized that the industry is fueled by nepotism and networking.  All one needs is to be admitted to the BAR and have an ""in"" with a firm.  Being technically proficient is all but irrelevant for obtaining an associate attorney position.
 |When I began school, a professor asked people to raise and keep up their hands if they knew an attorney.  Basically everyone but me raised their hand.  Then, the question was posed as to who had an attorney in their extended family.  Only a few people put their hands down.  Then, we were asked who had a parent that was an attorney.  Half of the people in the class still had their hands up.
 |The last time I checked, less than 50% of my graduating class was working as attorneys or other positions that *require* a law degree.
[This is going to sound silly, as you've probably already looked into this. BUt have you ever considered taking a direct commission into the Navy or the Army? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafrr9n?context=5)|Well, like I mentioned, I was in the military during my undergrad years.  However, times have been pretty rough for me since about the mid 00's.  At this point, I'd sign up for any branch's JAG program, but it would take 6-8 months of **hardcore** training to get back to the point where I could pass a PT test.  (During undergrad, I played multiple intercollegiate sports and was an amateur weightlifter/bodybuilder.  I'm still semi-active, but it would take more time and money that I have right now to recover from 5-7 years of a desk-borne lifestyle).
 |Let me just say that I understand that it is totally my fault for the disrepair I have allowed to happen to my body, but as you get older, life happens and priorities change; I'm no exception.
[Dude, I joined the ***Marine Corps*** at 27 with three months of PT under my belt and ten years such a sedentary lifestyle I may as well have been my desk chair. I understand that no one knows you better than you, but don't sell yourself short. I would say at least look into it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafrvur?context=5)|I'm not too worried about the strength and cardio.  I could probably get within regs in 1-2 months, if I'm not still there.  My body comp is uncomfortably high (for me), and I doubt I'd even pass a taping at this point.  It might be worth it to see if they have waivers for officers like they did when I enlisted.  I had to get a waiver even though I was 5'10"", 200 lbs @ 5% BF.  (I was hydro-statically measured that month, coincidentally, for one of my undergrad classes).  That, or maybe if they have a ""remedial PT unit"" aka *fat boy company*.  Anyways, maybe I will make some calls tomorrow.
[Question - Since you're a smart guy and have went through college, you seem like the right person to ask this question to. What are some finical tips you could give to someone who hopes to attend college?. My family and I have no money and no connections. I want to go to college but money keeps me from even steeping my foot in the door. I got the best job I can without a degree (working part time for barely above minimum wage\) and I barely make enough money to get through the month let alone save for school. Other than filling out a FASFA, what can I do? Any other options, places to call, people to talk to etc...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafr6m2?context=5)|Thank you for your sympathy.  I came from the same situation as you.  I was raised by a single parent of modest means.  Both my sister and I were able to attend and graduate college.  We both financed our entire educations, though she was a bit luckier in that she only obtained a BS.  I'm not entirely sure how you would go about financing your education without a FAFSA.  The primary method of financing college is through Stafford loans.  However, underclassmen are disadvantaged in that area, as Stafford loans do not cover the entirety of educational costs (at state system schools) until one is close to graduation.  (The amount one is able to borrow increases every year).  The student is expected to make up the difference between loans and cost with work-study, grants (especially Pell grants), Perkins loans, parent PLUS loans, and/or private loans.  Despite my circumstances, my advice to you would be to, regardless of price, find out what you want to do, and a handful of places you want to do it.  Apply and figure out where you will go if you can afford it.  Then, talk to that school's financial aid department.  Most places will bend over backwards to help the numbers work, or will at least provide you with information on what you need to do, or where you need to go.  While I may be suffering financially, I have a clean conscience that I have done my best to better myself and advance my academic credentials.  No matter what happens, no one can take those achievements and memories away from me.
[I'm beginning undergrad work this fall and am considering law school after that. Just how academically excellent must I be to virtually assure myself of a good job as a lawyer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafwx40?context=5)|You don't just need to be academically excellent.  It may be different in other schools, but from my experience, you need to almost ""play politics"" and express beliefs that your professors hold, regardless of your own ideology.  If you have a first year course where you question a professor's stance on such an ideological issue or express an opposition thereto, you can kiss goodbye the top 15%, and probably law review and moot court, as well.
 |However, even those academic credentials aren't that meaningful in comparison to having a personal relationship with an attorney at a firm which is hiring.  Unfortunately, networking trumps all in the legal field.
[Law school is a huge gamble. Even for the top 14 law schools (the best ones\) it's a risk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafx59q?context=5)|I read just about all the information I could get my hands on about law school before attending.  I probably read about 5-10 books about the subject, including One L, Law School Confidential, Getting to Maybe, 1000 Days to the Bar, and even Law School for Dummies, just off the top of my head.
[Did you not ever consider this possibility when amassing massive amounts of debt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafpheg?context=5)|When I finished my BS, I was unable to find work then, and had about $50,000 in student debt.  When I compared my debt to other people I know that went to other schools, they had twice as much debt as I did, so I figured I could go back to school and be on the same ground that they were, only with 2 extra degrees, one of which was an MBA.  (I went back to the same school, so I got full credit for my past undergraduate coursework).
 |By the time I graduated with the second BS and MBA, I was about 125,000-150,000 in student debt.  I wasn't planning on much more debt in law school except living expenses and books, but when the school changed its scholarships (there was no guarantee that the school would offer the same money every year), I was saddled with the extra ~100,000 from the last two years.
 |As I kept accruing more and more student debt, my earning potential always rose in proportion.  If I landed an associate attorney position, even in a small-medium sized firm, I could have everything paid off in 5-7 years.
[Good luck man dont give up .. I have a question which is about student loan, can you get rid off it at all? And how can you get 225k of student loan? That sounds a lot not sure how can u spend so much. In our country most people get education for little to no money. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafpl3o?context=5)|I maxed out the guaranteed undergraduate Stafford Loans, subsidized and unsubsidized, the rest were Graduate PLUS loans. 
[How is watching a video of a lame ass professor making retarded jokes for 3 hours helpful in learning black letter law?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cag179l?context=5)|No idea, but it worked for me.  I still remember how much I liked Rich Freer and the self-study method of BARBRI.  Like I said, it was just my cup of tea.
[you can buy outlines of black letter law from Amazon.com for $20 a piece](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cag179l?context=5)|Believe it or not, I was so focused on studying and doing my work, that I didn't find out about Emmanuel's outlines until my third year, when I bought a bunch.  I also was a bit sequestered in my studies, as I was turning 30 in a school with mostly young 20-somethings, and commuted from about an hour each way to school everyday.
[I know I'm late to this, but have you ever considered being a GM for a restaurant? You could make anywhere from 40 thousand to 60 thousand. That is just running one restaurant, with your degrees you could move up and make way more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafs42g?context=5)|While I'm almost to the point where I'd consider anything in the short term, I'm pretty much zoned in to working in law, IT, or general business as a long term solution.  While I wouldn't mind doing accounting or IT for the food service industry, that's about as far as I'd go until circumstances change.
 |I know that beggars can't be choosers, but I've put in a hard decade of schooling and still and am pursuing what I went to school for, even if I've had to widen my search parameters.
[Why show up here with your ""plight"" if you were planning on arguing everybody who is offering suggestions? You should head over to r/poorme.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cag2cmd?context=5)|Engaging in a discussion is hardly arguing.  I'm not looking for sympathy, and am enjoying seeing and debating both sides of the issue.  You did see the profession I am in, right?  :)
[What did you originally want to do with the Biology degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafpi8u?context=5)|I originally wanted to go into Sports Medicine, either the PT end, or as a doctor.  When I decided to go back to business school, I was also debating on going to medical school when I decided on business school.  I had spoken to people in the past that told me how med students were treated (before legislation changed the laws).  80 hour shifts and basically being a slave to the job is what changed my mind.
 |I realize that some of the big law firms are the same way.  While I would take any job in the field at this point, my aim is to work where I can have a normal work-life balance.

In fact, I considered taking the USPTO patent bar exam, but was advised against it.  The only area of the law that I strongly oppose and would not work in is IP law dealing with copyright infringement.
[I don't believe that OP is aware that he's ever made a less-than-subpar decision.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafxjev?context=5)|All I ever wanted to do was better myself and increase my education and marketplace utility.

It is a highly versatile degree.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cag16e7?context=5)|I also have an MBA and IT degree.

I worked in a IT position for about 10 months while doing temp doc review jobs.
 |Also, that low level IT position paid less than some fast food jobs, and I even had the wonderful emotional experience of dealing with a high school junior that came in to apply for the position I occupied at the time.
[Well after reading his reply to me it's plain that denial plays a big part in his plight. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafzt86?context=5)|Denial of what?

The way state BARs work with regard to attorneys from other states is reciprocity.  While I could be admitted to practice a single case on an emergency basis, I have to practice in my home state for 5 years before I can apply for reciprocity in other states.  Some states don't offer reciprocity, (such as CA, NY, NJ, LA), and I would have to pass the bar in those states to practice there.
 |Bar exams are not cheap.  The test itself was $600 for me, and there are study courses (which are practically required to take in order to pass), and those can run from $300-$4,000.
[*and there are study courses (which are practically required to take in order to pass\)*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafzcqh?context=5)|Really?  I found the review courses more valuable than law school itself.  I took BARBRI and multistate portion of Kaplan and think I could have passed the bar with only those courses.  I also think that I **needed** them, as my school's curriculum, (like most law schools), taught almost no black letter law or application thereof.
[That's not even remotely true. I'm barred in four jurisdictions, I took a prep course for the first one, and it's the most wasted time and money I've ever spent.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafzcqh?context=5)|Different strokes for different folks--and people learn differently, too.

[Hanging your own shingle straight out of law school or with years of doc review is a terrible idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g0zm4/iama_practicing_attorney_about_to_be_homeless_ama/cafx6ao?context=5)|I just explained to beranous about how I had clerked, but only received extremely specialized experience, and then attempted to link up with someone who would mentor me while I opened my own practice.

I got decent grades, which got me into a decent college (but one of the top film schools). I didn't work very hard in my college classes, either, because I was going to do film! Instead, I spent all my time working on whatever film I could while exploring different departments. I graduated with a degree in writing for film and television with a decent GPA. I ended up moving to Los Angeles and doing some work on films. I did casting for some unscripted shows. 

Now, I'm 24 years old. Everyone tells me I'm a go-getter, a hard worker that will go places. I have no idea where I want to go. Every job seems unstable. Every job makes me feel disposable. Every job makes me feel unfulfilled. These are at least only the jobs I can obtain! I've wanted to get into a top talent agency for a year now but I keep getting overlooked (not the right experience, not the right connections). I didn't do the right internships. I didn't meet the right people. I didn't do anything right in the time I was supposed to be setting things up. 

I thought about a career change, but the time and money commitment scares me. I've looked into some options in science and math. but because I went to a film school, I don't have the pre-reqs to obtain such a degree so a career changing plan would take more time than usual. 

I'm worried about my future. I'm worried about money. I'm worried about my future family. I'm worried about even finding someone because I can't seem to find my place in the world. I wish i could settle down and focus on ONE thing and aim for it, but I know myself. My passions and interests jump around. I'm very hot and cold, on and off. I have spurts of motivation or inspiration and periods of really low lows. I'm finding joking, ""well, if worse comes to worst, I'll just kill myself,"" but I'm scared that I may mean that a lot more than I jokingly say. 

I used to think things work out but they don't. They only work out if you put in the time for things to change. I didn't do it when it was easiest to mold my life and now it's so difficult and I don't know how to change things. "

1. I sent out an appeal for financial aid a month ago and haven't yet received a response. I checked online and it says they have received the appeal, but they haven't replied yet. What should I do?

2. How is Teleman in teaching Math 54? I had to sign up for him since the other lecture was during the CS 61A lecture. 

3. Which courses should I take that will be useful for internships? I have heard about CS 170 and CS 169. Any others?

4. I have little programming experience. I am going to learn Python over the summer in preparation for CS 61A. I heard CS 61B is taught in Java. I was thinking of taking CS 9G, the self-paced course for learning Java as I have had no experience in Java and don't want to be left behind. I have heard CS 61A teaches you Java, but that might be for more experienced programmers. Is it worth taking CS 9G? Also, I will be taking Math 54, CS 61A, Physics 7A, and an R&amp;C A. How many units should I take CS 9G for?

5. For CalSO they told us to bring syllabi of college courses we took to check if we can get credit for them. They never checked. When and where should I go to get credit for these courses?

Any and all answers are appreciated. Thanks!"

1g1g7e,3,2013-06-10,Girlfriend consistently bullied by her own family!,cowchee,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g1g7e/girlfriend_consistently_bullied_by_her_own_family/,"**TLDR**; Traditional uneducated chinese family can't see daughter is actually a very good person - instead considers her the worst daughter ever. Talking/explaining doesn't work because parents aren't logical.


My chinese girlfriend (22), Anna, is considered the trouble maker – the BAD girl – of her family. Particularly, it is mom, dad, and her older sister (sister #1) that gang up on her. As an example, yesterday Anna and I cleaned an entire floor of her home out of kindness – instead of receiving thanks, Anna was almost kicked out of the house for “cleaning wrong”. There is so much bias against her, anything she does is wrong! 

Except Anna is an absolutely a wonderful daughter. She’s frugal, she cleans, cooks, and never expects something back. I know this because I’ve dated her for 4 years in college, living with her for our last 1.5 years. We both graduated together with latin honors while picking up many great internships along the way. We’re getting interviewed by prestigious companies because we’ve been career planning ever since we signed our loans. She gave 1/3 of her campus job earnings to her parents and devoted a lot of time mentoring her younger siblings (which the criticizing older sister never did)

Out of 4 daughters (Anna is the 2nd) – I guarantee you Anna is best, not because I am biased but because I have gotten to know her family fairly well. It’s completely obvious to anyone, even her younger sisters (not older) acknowledge it. Unlike her other sisters, she doesn’t steal money from family, or steal period. She doesn’t cut herself and boast how her parents baby her as a result. She’s not a princess who demands Gucci bags every year. She didn’t flunk out of school and run away with her boyfriend. She NEVER parties and NEVER smokes or drinks (too expensive!). Now, I love all her sisters like my own, but there’s no doubt Anna should be the role model, not the punching bag.

Still, she is a horrible daughter in Mommy and Daddy’s eyes– and I’ve finally realized it’s a culture gap. Her parents are uneducated blue collar immigrants. They can’t understand that students need to intern for free these days and that bagging groceries gets you nowhere. They don’t know what a 4.0 is and frankly don’t see why I teach the youngest sister math every week. This is a traditional Chinese family where Daddy is always right, and all his children owe him and his wife for their existence. Because the older sister has moved out and the younger sisters are either depressed or too young, it is Anna’s RESPONSIBILITY to clean and mentor. And 1/3 of our earnings is mandatory. I said ours because they want mine too, like I’m purchasing their daughter (who they want to kick out anyway?) And yea, my 3 days cleaning not Anna’s stuff but actually every other sister’s stuff, even the one who moved out a decade ago, was brushed off because I’m supposed since I'm the BF.

What hurts me the most is that they say Anna is the worst when all her sisters actually doing the things normal families worry about. And when she does what a normal parent would praise, she is criticized. She is “stupid” for interning for free. Anna isn’t allowed to leave the house , nor do her parents buy her anything. But the depressed daughter (only 2 years younger) can drive away for a week and blow off a few hundreds on the moms credit card and her parents brush it off (then brags about it). Plus she gets a new SUV when Anna gets a beat up sedan I had to fix. And everyone PILES their junk in Anna’s room because she didn’t say anything about it at first – then she gets blamed for making the mess but I’ll clean it for her anyway! Now Anna has to clean the entire house when everyone else is going on vacation or drinking at parties. What the FUCK? /rant

 I don’t know how to help her. Moving out might work when she gets a job but she really would prefer to stay home and pay off her loans first. It also feels like running away because moving out doensn’t make them respect Anna.

As you can see, Anna's parents are not LOGICAL at all - that's why telling them has never worked. Even if you make them contradict yourself like Anna has, you are still wrong because now they're mad. I believe it has to be proven to them through feelings or something else that influences their decision making. In some sense I feel like the only way they'll see it is when the only daughter that actually planned her future can help them retire.

I have however a few questions and I hope you will have some answers for me !

First things first, I gotta say that my school is not at all focused on CS, in France, the best schools are teaching very general engineering (electronics, mechanics, physics etc.) and I only got a few classes in CS (Introduction to C, few Data Structures and Algos, Web Development and Networks), so I guess I have a lot less knowledge in software development and CompSci than US CS students. However, I have a strong will and am really motivated !

I have decided to take what we call a gap year before my third and last year at school (which will be more focused on CS, esp. Web tech), to get some internships and gain some experience.

I am currently working as a software dev intern at a small Parisian web startup, mostly doing front-end and Django dev, and I really like it !
I also got a second internship (6 months) at a bigger company, in Paris too, where I will also be doing front and back end.

That leaves me a few month at the end of this year to land a summer internship abroad, and I'd love to go the US/Canada.

**TL;DR: french grad student from general engineering school, mild knowledge in CS, pursuing 9 months of web dev. this year and looking for a summer internship next year**

So here comes my questions :

* Do you thing being french and having only mediocre school formation in CS is a big disadvantage for landing a internship abroad ? (this being said,I am already taking online classes on cs theory)
* I am not really sure if I want to work in Web, should I try to look for a 'non-web' internship ?
* What are the types of the personal projects I should show recruiters ? I know it is really important, but does it have to be very technologically deep ?

Thank you for your time !"

Help!",that_sea_the_gambler,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1g5dea/i_am_trying_my_best_to_find_a_job_but_it_is_still/,"I am sick and tired of being nonexistent to potential employers.

As a college sophomore majoring in finance and minoring in economics, I used to get a handful of calls and email responses from companies. I had occasional interviews. I didn’t land a job or internship, but I at least felt real. When the market tanked and junior year rolled around, I heard back from progressively fewer firms. By the time senior year rolled ended, my school’s “98% placement rate within three months of graduation” was in jeopardy. I had a degree, yet I heard back from absolutely no one. My GPA was almost perfect. I participated in a few extracurriculars and received an award for outstanding finance student. I couldn’t even get a single interview, let alone an email or phone response that showed I at least existed. I wandered for months, not knowing what I was going to do. Nothing came up at all. I decided to go to grad school to hone my skills in finance and make myself more marketable. Years later, I have a master’s in financial analysis and am a Level 1 CFA candidate. People around me in the exact same program are finding jobs. Yet it’s nothing I have done matters at all. No one is interested. The master’s degree hasn’t done a thing, and the only responses I get are “thanks but no thanks,” etc. The only interested and eager parties are the borderline scams, such as lesser known prop trading firms wanting capital and shipping companies looking for a means to ship illegal goods, and occasionally an unpaid internship that has nothing to do with finance. The fact that the collective hiring universe is receiving my inquiries, yet only scammers are responding, is very very depressing. That’s all I’m worth??

I was recently reminded of the Kafkaesque nature of my search when I sent in my resume (and a lengthy email showing how interested I was) to a small investment banking firm. One day later, I received this email:

Thank you for your continued interest in the Investment Banking Analyst Intern position with XXXXX. At this time we will be moving forward with other candidates for this position. 

We do believe, however, you are on the right track, but that you could benefit from more financial modeling experience. We would like to formally invite you to attend a free 4-hour online investment banking training session hosted by IB Edge.

There are so many things that upset me in this email. First, in no way, shape, or form did they inquire into my financial modeling experience. In no way, shape, or form was it mentioned in the application process. There is no way they could know my financial modeling experience, and it seems they don’t even care to ask about it. Who are they to tell me I need more of something that I might already have?

I’ve had pretty bad depression since I graduated from college, and it gets worse in times like these. I’m not doing okay. I cannot stand how hard this is for me, while less intelligent or less qualified individuals around me seem to have no problem finding plenty of leads and openings. 

My girlfriend used to complain when she would send in a resume to five different companies in a day and only get one response, from the one she didn’t want as much as the others. I could never make her understand how good she had it. No one I know has any idea how hard this is. Ten years ago, I would have no problem getting a high-paying job, but for some reason, not a single soul wants to even attempt an interview.

I have even tried to settle by applying at Target, Barnes and Noble, local coffee shops and bookstores, Walgreens, etc. I listed my availability as 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I thought this would bode well for overnight minimum wage positions, but I got emails back saying they weren’t interested. Not even one interview! I applied for a finance internship and got a response back saying, because I was graduating soon, they would be scared to hire me knowing that I might leave them for a bigger paycheck at a big finance firm. They wanted to hire someone younger so they knew they would stay longer. I said this would not be an issue, that I needed the experience, but it didn’t matter.

I’ve sent resumes. I’ve walked into companies (most of the time they tell me to apply online, and that there is no formal way for me to apply in person), I have tried calling people in charge of hiring, I have tried to do some networking. When I do reach someone, they say I don’t have enough experience, etc. I was even told this by some finance internships! Seriously??? That is my only means of experience. I recently had a three-month unpaid internship at a video editing startup. They liked me and wished they had the money to hire me, but they will give me a good review. I did “business development,” which was essentially just everything. I worked with their finances and tried to develop realistic projections. I found potential investors and early adopters and researched anything they wanted me to. 

Now I’m ready for a job. Something that pays me money and is somewhat related to my major. I think I deserve it, considering how much money I have spent on finance education. This is getting ridiculous, and my anxiety and depression are on the verge of getting out of hand yet again. I need ideas, leads, positive thoughts, etc. Thank you. 

Tl;dr: I can’t find a job. My credentials don’t seem to matter. My skills and intuition don’t seem to matter. It truly seems like I do not exist. I am very depressed and confused. Please help.

My first semester of junior year I did well in Discrete Math but did not so well in Systems and Programming.  I decided to put off retaking that class until later.  My second semester I took 3 CS courses: Programming with Concurrency, Theory of Computation and Data Structures.

We’re participating in a tech accelerator, and have received funding from the program. But we need a long-term technical co-founder. We have been making use of the developer interns, and have been considering outsourcing to an app development firm for the MVP, but I’m realizing that it’d be best to have a technical team member on board from start to finish. The new teammate would have the opportunity to work for equity in the company, which seems to have a high potential for growth.

We are looking for someone who is hungry and smart, and who wants to be a driving force in developing a great product from concept to creation. They should be creative, dedicated, and enjoy bouncing ideas around.

The startup, very broadly, is a gamified/incentivized personal finance app more powerful and comprehensive than any currently on the market, but simple and intuitive to use. The economic models portion of the program is already coded – we just need to develop the new interface using them. We will have a wireframe of the minimum viable product ready this week.

I can give more details if you PM me.

We’re considering just contracting the minimum viable product to an app development company, but I’d prefer to have someone on board from the beginning. We could just continue working with the development interns for the minimum viable product as well. Any advice appreciated.

I'm a rising sophomore at a very small 4-year university in Ohio. Majoring in computer engineering. I ended up there because I was rejected to my original college choices - this school was my safety. While I excelled in high school (valedictorian, well-rounded involvement and perfect grades, yada yada), I did horrible my freshman year at this school because I was not happy about where I was (not to mention I'm coming to terms with being gay). My cumulative GPA is a 2.97.

So, I am very adamant that I want to get out of this college. I did not consider Berkeley when I was applying as a freshman, as a family friend constantly told me of how bad of a school it was (not academic-wise; he just said you guys were assholes.) So I didn't apply. But now, I've done extensive research and I am very confident that this is where I need to be.

**My options:**

1. **Stay at this four-year university for my sophomore year.** I am not sure how I would fare mentally or academically. Under this plan, I'd apply to Berkeley as an out-of-state student from a four year university. I hear they don't have very good odds.

2. **Enroll in Berkeley City College for the Fall.** This is a very daunting option that I have recently come up with. I would drop literally every aspect of my life (born and raised in Ohio, no family in California, no friends, etc) and move to Berkeley, where I really think I want to be. I would work with the advisors at this college over the summer to put me in classes that will prepare me for Berkeley. In a perfect world, I would also be able to intern or help out in one of Berkeley's EECS research labs, preferably dealing with cyber security. Under this option, I would apply to Berkeley as a CCC student and, as statistics show, have much greater odds of getting in.

***Can I get any thoughts on this?*** I have not told my parents or siblings about this yet, and I'm sure they will dismiss the idea as lunacy. But I do firmly believe I would excel at UCB. My entire extended family has lived in Ohio for three generations or so.

1g6p9g,42,2013-06-12,"Asian parents trying to retire/YOLO, forcing their BS onto me.",cowchee,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1g6p9g/asian_parents_trying_to_retireyolo_forcing_their/,"Just discovered this place and i'm unsure if it's to seek advice or just rant - read however you'd like.

My parents gave birth to 4 daughters - I am the 2nd oldest. The folks really wanted a boy but they are too old to try again. (dad wants to cheat/remarry but thats another story). The parents are completely uneducated, blue collar  immigrants - this is important (I think)

Next important fact: since my sister's and I don't have penises, my parents really don't care about us - us daughters should marry away and so they can finally retire. My older sister failed school, left while in college, while stealing thousands of dollars from them - but of those 3, the parents only care about the money.

Here's the last fact before I connect the dots: My older sister is never coming back because she can barely afford her new baby. Well, that means I'm the next eldest,  so somehow I have a DUTY to care for the parents and younger sisters. 

Combine the three above and what do you get? Parents who don't give a flying fuck because they're trying to retire, but still believe I owe them for everything they've done for me. So they don't want me, but require me to raise the youngest sister as my own child and then send them 1/3 of my paycheck to help them retire? That way they retire 10 years earlier and don't have to deal with their failed sperm gamble. I don't think this has anything to do with asian, mostly stupid mixed with asian thinking.

Now introduce the last stupid asian belief - Daddy is always right. I logically prove them how wrong and hypocritical they are (like forcing me to care for the youngest, but them refusing to care for my newborn niece my older sister can't afford - or dad caught cheating so somehow everyone else, including wife, is wrong?). Still, they'll just think I'm rude and block me out. Of course I object and talk back, but that means I have the worst attitude and get treated like the worst daughter in the world. Sorry but I'm not paying for my younger sister's (only 2 years younger) gas or cleaning her mess just because I'm older and she cuts herself. If I help my sister out, it's a FAVOR because I love her, not my DUTY. 

I'm the worst daughter in the world, but they have to leave their hopes of retirement with me - my younger sister is depressed (which she just needs to suck up - she cheats on her lesbian girlfriend and gets depressed when the one she cheated with turns around and cheats on her). My older sister can't get her shit together because she's an absolute princess with a baby. My youngest sister is they one they're desperately trying to get rid of to retire. 

So they're mad I'm such a shitty daughter because they think I cheating them out of their only hope of retirement. as a result, they treat me like shit everyday at home (just graduated but need to find job). My depressed emo sister gets a brand new lexus SUV, I get a shitty used corolla that breaks and EVERYONE borrows yet I pay gas for (And I can't demand for gas money back because daddy bought it for me). They demand I clean the entire house when everyone else is on vacation. And they pile their crap in my room because my parents are HOARDERS too. Yea and I don't get any money from them, but they give the depressed daughter their credit card all the time to waste cash. 

It's so bad I realized I've been selling all my possessions just so I can 100% claim I'm not doing my own chores. My sisters won't help - they acknowledge I'm not getting fair treatment, but want me to solve it myself. THey won't however acknowledge that I get blamed for their mistakes.  I'm paying and cleaning their crap half the time anyway so it's a pretty sweet deal for them. I'm the shitty, clumsy, daughter that gets blamed for everything. I'm a punching bag, a dumpster.

Except, unlke them,  I don't fuck up in school, get into too much debt, pick cheating partners, steal from parents, or spend thousands on a gucci bag. Actually, I have latin honors, a packed resume, a frugal lifestyle, and a boyfriend who actually helps me solve all their bullshit. But none of this makes sense to my parents or my older sister who aren't educated. My BF is bad because he forget to say Thank you to them, but they don't say it to him, or even feel thankful he does their chores - It's somehow HIS duty as well. And god forbid trying to explain why unpaid internships are necessary in this job market.

They don't realize I'm actually a great daughter who loves my family despite their flaws. WHAT THE FUCK! I'd prefer Tiger mom over this shit, because at least they want me to do well. My parents are just selfish. I feel bad for my youngest sister, who's going through the worst half-assed parenting out of the 4 sisters. I hope I actually make enough to take her in. She's the next punching bag after I leave because the one 2 years younger is depressed and gets babied.

For now, I've been labeling and selling all my possessions so I can force my sisters to clean their own shit. I'm distancing myself, avoiding dinner, etc. just so I dont have to get yelled at for something I didn't do. I'm going to stay at home and save money until the next time they threaten to kick me out. Hopefully by then I can afford moving out. I've realized despite giving my sisters so much to save them from trouble, I can't count on them to do the same for me. It's sad my 10 year old sister is more understanding, mature, responsible than my 20 or 29 yr old one."

I took out student loans to go to college, and I am working toward a degree that is worthless without years of internships. Try as I might though, I was never able to get those internships.

I am one semester away from graduating, and I was never able to improve myself to become competent at life. I have bad social anxiety and often cannot even speak coherent sentences when I talk to people.

Right now I am working a summer job that is absolute shit, and I sob myself to sleep every night thinking about how this is what is in store for me forever because of my incompetence and mental retardation.

My boyfriend suggested I get to work on starting my own business and finish a novel I started over two years ago and did very little with. I want to do these things, but I just can't bring myself to do either. I am just too lazy. I go through every day feeling like crap (fatigue, muscle weakness, etc.) even though I have proper sleep and nutrition. If I lay down and take a nap, I sleep through my alarm and waste 6 or more hours sleeping.

I have a feeling of urgency at all times that keeps me from doing anything productive, but I still waste loads of time on the internet and just sitting around looking at the wall.

I am disinterested in everything, and it shows.

Just to give you some background many in my family are rushing to be a doctor or a nurses because ""that's where the money is."" Many of my older cousins/siblings are becoming doctors and my mom is a pharmacist. 

I hate how money oriented she thinks. I'm not interested in medicine at all. I'm interested in programming because I like it and am good at it.  I don't want all those years in school and I don't want to be surrounded by death.

It pretty much has you build a computer from the ground up using hardware simulators. I want to program at a low level and work on things like operating systems or embedded development. I am still in high school I should add.

How hard would it be to get a good job on operating systems or embedded development. Also how much money do they make on average.

* Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
* 4GB DDR2 (I believe) RAM
* (Ready for this one?) Intel Q6600 Quad Core (~2.1GHz)

1galuh,2,2013-06-13,Two prospective jobs...,kiramekihoshi,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1galuh/two_prospective_jobs/,"I graduated a year ago but didn't want to go into public school and didn't know much about private school options at that time. I spent the year working at a medium-sized daycare center (earning about $15,000). I had never worked with young kids, so it was a great experience for me. I love to do new things, but now I'm ready for my teaching job.

Prospective job one is a third grade position at an Islamic school, 18 students currently enrolled, max class size of 20. Pay is $24,000. I am not Islamic, but there are other teachers at the school that are not, so that would not be a problem. I gave a demo lesson to the second grade students (my future prospective students) in front of the principal, and he thought I was wonderful. I then gave a demo lesson to fourth grade students in front of parents. I overestimated the students' skill level, so we didn't even get half-way into the lesson I had planed, and I feel like the parents didn't get a good representation of my teaching ability or style. They said I did great, but apparently the were just being polite, because the next time I talked to the principal, he told he they thought I wasn't a good fit. He still speaks favorably to me, saying that he is trying to convince the parents. (Because it's a private school, he depends upon their donations.) He called me this morning to ask after my current state of affairs. I'm beginning Montessori Elementary I and II training (that is, children aged 6-12) this summer and will be out of town until mid-August. He had called to ask if I would be available for Common Core training at the beginning of August, but I'll still be out of town at that time. We made plans for me to call at the end of the month and again the day before the Common Core training, and perhaps we will set up some sort of note taking system for me to learn via another staff member. He ended the conversation wishing me luck on my Montessori training and by saying that he hopes I will be a teacher at the school, his way of saying that he still wants to hire me but isn't ready to offer me a position quite yet.

Prospective job 2 is at a Montessori school, which of course makes it more favorable to me. I had asked to visit a year ago (spent the morning there), and submitted my resume two years in a row. I subbed there once, and apparently the staff spoke favorably of me. I was asked to an informal interview, and the director and I really hit it off well. The director and I have similar visions, and we both thought this would be a good fit for me. The problem is budget. She's loosing two teachers this year, a third and a fifth grade teacher, one of which taught music. Even with two positions open, enrollment is way down this year. There will only be two fifth graders, so the director has decided to teach them herself. She would also like to teach the class of 10 third graders, but she knows that that would overwhelm her. She's made it a priority to find a music teacher, so she told me that she will find a position for me after she finds someone to teach music (pity I'm tone-deaf). At first, she mentioned the possibility of taking me on part-time if there wasn't enough money. Now she's talking about a ""paid internship,"" which I think may be a way of not having to hire substitutes because when I asked what a paid internship would entail, she said I would be working with all age groups, helping out wherever needed. Honestly, I would take that if offered. I want to be at the Montessori school, and working with all age groups would be something I would enjoy. It's just money again. $24,000-$25,000 would be ideal, but I would accept $20,000. Below that, I'd have to get another part-time job. And if she's talking about an hourly position now...

I was going to accept anything the director of the Montessori school offered me until the principal of the Islamic school called me today. Maybe it would be better to accept an actual teaching position, if the principal offers it to me. But then again, maybe it would be better to actually get into the school that I prefer. There's always the possibility that the director could upgrade me in the middle of the school year. And if not, I'd be first on the list to get a teaching position NEXT year if enrollment goes back up. What if I took the job at the Islamic school and the director of the Montessori school decided she needed someone and hired someone else because I wasn't available? Ugh, I'd feel like I blew it. Would it be best to turn down an ACTUAL teaching position for two part-time jobs, even if one was in the school I want to be for the better part of my career?

Can I tell the Montessori director about my bottom asking salary? My husband and I just bought a house, and I have student loans to pay, Montessori training to save up for, a new-used car to buy...

If the Islamic principal offers me a job, can I say, ""Wait, let me tell the other school and see if they have an offering for me, too?"" You know, not in those words, of course. How could I phrase it?

Sorry for the book... it's just so important to me. ;-;"

I feel stuck.",db2765,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1g8syi/anyone_here_ever_work_with_salesforce_currently/,"So just some quick background on where I'm currently at. I went to a technical college and graduated with an associate's in Control Systems Technology (http://www.ranken.edu/academics/electrical-division/control-systems-technology), but had terrible luck landing a job after getting out. Eventually a friend was able to land me an internship at a small marketing company close to home. They mostly do email and call center marketing (through ActOn and Five9). They called it an internship, but it ended up being a call center job. Luckily, I have a pretty strong background in Excel, and was able to take some side projects with their database team to write up some macros that they just didn't have the time to make themselves. After a month or two, they decided to bring me on full time.


Right now, I mostly spend the day pulling data in and out of Salesforce, creating reports, making layouts, custom objects for some of our clients, things like that. I feel pretty comfortable in Salesforce, for the most part. A while ago, I was able to start messing around with APEX code when they needed some help with triggers, and have been getting more comfortable with making workflows. I'm wanting to learn Visualforce, but haven't had a chance yet. Also haven't had much of a chance to do much with the Opportunity object yet, either. My manager deals with all the permissions and security, so I have no experience with that, either. There wasn't much training, mostly learned by fire. Was able to teach myself the APEX coding by reading code that was already written.


The issue is that the company isn't doing too great. There were massive layoffs back in December, and another batch of layoffs a few weeks after that. I never ended up getting my yearly raise, and when I went full time, I only got an extra $0.75 (only making $12.75/hr right now). I tried asking about a raise, but the question is always dodged by management. The company is small, so the only way I could advance upwards is if I became incredible at sales overnight and moved to that department. I want to get more experience with other parts of Salesforce, but I'm pretty much stuck on list pulling and report creation for now, and still do more Excel work than anything. The other two on my team just don't want to give anything up that they're working on so I can get more experience.


I love working with Salesforce, and have heard that the market for Salesforce admins is pretty good right now. I feel stuck though. I'm not sure if I really have enough SFDC experience to get a job somewhere else, and since the team won't give me more work, I'm not sure how to go about getting the experience I need. I mess around in our org when I can. Should I work on maybe getting certified? Just not sure where to go from here.


Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

1gc071,3,2013-06-14,"Any advice on negotiating a ""non-negotiable"" job offer?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gc071/any_advice_on_negotiating_a_nonnegotiable_job/,"I received a job offer from one of the 'web giants'. Their offer is quite generous, but standard nonetheless among new hires. All of my friends have received pretty much the same offer (~4 other people) from the same place, but I feel like I bring something special to the table with the unusual amount of experience I have and the not-so-insignificant business impact I had during my internship there (7 figures). They told me the offer is non-negotiable, as they do say to everyone. I don't have any competing offers since they try to snag you before you can find any (although other companies reached out to me on LinkedIn, including this very company for a Software Dev 2 position!), but I'm fairly confident I could work at one of their competitors if I'd like. The signing bonus and stock options are great, but I'm more concerned with the base salary as that determines my future at that company as well as market value, and I guess I'm willing to negotiate those for a higher salary (is this a bad idea?). How should I go about trying to get a better base salary? Also, I plan to go to grad school a few years down the road if that means anything. Thanks."

I finished my Master of Science about a year ago and only recently found new confidence in myself. The problem is I am quite a bit older and need more programming experience. I also would prefer a CS job (or something close to it), as I find interest in it and I didn't pay a lot of attention to my courses in maths anyway. (Grades are good though). So I need experience/knowledge no matter which field I would pursue.

I am currently doing remote studying to get some structure in the day and I have been looking for some internships (unsuccessfully). 

How would I go about getting more experience? Are there some Open Source projects I could work on full time that would look good on my resumee?

In case it is relevant, I am from Germany and being supported my parents. 

The language I am most proficient in (still not all that much experience) is Java.

Thanks for your interest."

1gb7kx,1,2013-06-13,Looking for some advice with a job and school.,Oo52,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gb7kx/looking_for_some_advice_with_a_job_and_school/,"I'm not entirely sure where to post this, so please direct me if I'm wrong.

Background: I'm studying engineering at a fairly respectable university. I was offered (and accepted) an internship (co-op) at a large contracting firm for 8 months (IIRC from the last financial records, it's a $500 million firm that stretches across the US). It was a lot of fun, I learned a lot and went back to school afterwards. 

Today: The same company offered me another internship (again, I accepted). This time it was in a new branch location that they just started. The new branch has taken off like crazy (2-3 years ahead of plan). My job description is essentially a department manager (responsible for roughly $1-$1.5 million of revenue), only the financials are in one of the full time managers departments. 

Issue: I'm considering staying at the company full time and continuing my education online. I've for the most part finished my engineering courses and only have the humanities courses remaining. I've asked my family and received mixed answers (which I more or less expected). 

I really would enjoy working here full time starting immediately. The work is a lot of fun, the guys I work with are a lot of fun to work with. I like the area I'm in. To me, it feels like the right thing to do. I'd be a fool though to not be worried about becoming overwhelmed and not finishing school, which wouldn't hinder my work but would hinder my personal goals, obviously. 

The company is in desperate need for a new full time manager, I know the company, system, and operations. It's a good fit for me, and I'm a good fit for them (statement of my supervisor on my last eval). 

Some more job details: 
Currently: Responsible for managing clients whose services equate roughly $1-$1.5 million revenue. Pay: $18/hr. I don't manage the jobs that much, but the back end of initializing the job and maintaining customer contact.

If I accept, I'd like to do a provisional period for the rest of the year to not waste their money. I would be looking for roughly $25/hr. My reasoning for the increase is the added responsibility of not only managing my own department and my own customers solo, but also responsible for other company operations like professional development of my subordinates (roughly 10-15 employees). After the provisional period, I would be looking for an increase to $36/hr (salary). My budgeted revenue would be probably close to $2 million (given the way the company is progressing). As a comparative, the other manager is making $50/hr (salary), but also has knowledge and experience I don't have. Also, the company isn't known for promising gold blocks, and giving gold plated tin; so I'm not worried about being promised the world and them not following through. This all sounds too good to be true, but I know it's not, which is why I'm highly considering doing it.

TL;DR: So my questions in short are:

Should I finish my education online to work full time?
Has anyone else run into similar situations?
Am I asking for too much from the company?


I think I need stranger's advice, someone that doesn't know me or have any biased (either way) of what they think I should do.

Thank you for any advice."

1geb8l,2,2013-06-15,Internship or Uni?,shulavalya,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1geb8l/internship_or_uni/,"Ok, first of all - I know I sound crazy. Why *wouldn't* you take an internship, I hear you ask. And you're right. Internships are hard to get and if you don't have one, it'll be extremely difficult to find a job. 
However, this is going to sound incredibly pitiful but uni has been the first time I've ever really had friends. Not only that but all these new experiences and the relative freedom has made this the happiest time of my life and I don't want it to end. If I look at it from a broader perspective than just my career, I have the rest of my life to work. I really do - when I leave uni, I will have to work for the rest of my life. 

Those grad programs aren't going anywhere. I can still apply for them when I graduate, I'll just be at a possible disadvantage. But if I take an internship, all the people I've grown so fond of *will* go somewhere. They will move on. And when I'm finished my internship, they'll all have graduated and probably be working full time.. They'll have no time for me anymore. (Although today, I've come to realise that I don't have as many real friends as I previously thought.)


**RELEVANT BACKGROUND**

I used to be normal. I applied for internships last year like crazy cos I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to get a job without one. I never even entertained the idea that I would be successful (yay, low self esteem!) but I eventually got one for a rather large company. I accepted the offer. Long story short, parents told me I wouldn't be able to handle full time work, simultaneously got accepted into this volunteer program at uni and I finally got into a class with a close friend of mine (this would be the only subject we had in common).  I started to think for the first time ""do I *actually* want this?"" Started to freak out. I thought I could just ignore my irrational fears and ""be rational"". A few sleepless nights later, I withdrew in the most humiliating fashion possible. 
And that was the end of that - never going to apply for anything again unless I'm absolutely sure. 

Since then I started to smell the roses and appreciated every single day of student life that I had. Slowly, I began to regain my okay-ness with working. My friend tells me about this job at his company. History repeats itself. I start to freak out. I did a pros and cons list (below - and I've amended it to be relevant to current me)

&gt;**PROS**

&gt; - Good for my career 

&gt; - Could be my only chance to avoid perpetual unemployment

&gt; - Friends don't give as much of a shit about me as I do about them - stupid reason not to do it

&gt; - I'm graduating later than everyone anyway (I did less than a full load for one semester)

&gt;**CONS**

&gt; - Miss out on life experience/the best year(s) of my life

&gt; - High probability of failure; I'll make my friend who told me about &gt;the job look like a fool

&gt; - Not even 100% sure if I can/want to go down this career path

&gt; - Have to go through that whole recruitment process

&gt; - I originally had a con about losing time with a certain person but that's now moot (unrequited love that I have since gotten over)

I ended up missing the deadline but then I'm like ""That would've been all right."" Okay, so that was the end of that. Again. Or so I thought. Now, there's another role at the company and it's happening *yet again*. 

This is why I need to ask for advice. (I've tried getting in touch with a careers counsellor at my university but they're never free)  I know it's irrational, but if I just dismiss my feelings, bad things happen. (That is, happened). Ultimately, what I want to know is if I should go for the internship. Is there any merit to my life-perspective? Would I actually be able to land a grad role without prior experience or being a genius? And if applicable, do you regret having put your career ahead of the people in your life in this fashion? 

Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for reading.


**tl;dr:** Should I take an internship even if it means sacrificing the best year(s) of my life (i.e. uni)?

[What's the best/worst excuse that someone has given you for failing to comply with probation that landed them back in jail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyde4?context=5)|One of my favorites was a female that consistently tested positive for meth each month. I tried to put her in treatment, refer her to community resources, etc. She denied she ever had a problem and stated simply that her use of Benadryl was the reason for testing positive for meth. We had about a one hour argument about how OTC allergy pills will not cause positive drug screens. She was absolutely sure that ""they make meths (sic) out of those pink pills, so that's why I tested positive."" Best bold faced lie ever. She was very convincing.
[Have there been any really sad cases you've dealt with that you felt the person totally got screwed, but you had to enforce the conditions of the probation/parole anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyde4?context=5)|I definitely feel for some of the people I work with. I see people get screwed a lot when they refuse to get a court-appointed attorney and then get slammed by the DA in court, which then puts them on probation. I had a guy who stole a $12 pair of shorts from Wal-Mart. He ended up with 12 months of probation, massive court costs, etc. I wish Wal-Mart wouldn't have pursued it. They got their damn shorts back after all. I feel for a lot of younger offenders that get placed on because of possession of drug paraphernalia or such. I also had a guy who got about 24 months of probation for stealing diabetic supplies at Target. He couldn't afford them normally. Sure, he could have found community resources and there is no excuse for stealing, but I still felt for him a bit.
[Thanks for the AMA, you officers are really spread too thin!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyde4?context=5)|But I never let my offenders know I feel for them. I might commiserate some, but I can't let them know my guard is down. A lot of PO's get worked over once a clever offender knows they feel sorry for them.
[She probably meant sudafed not benadryl.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak2gp9?context=5)|Yup, I'm sure that was what she was aiming for. She definitely couldn't come up with a coherent excuse.
[Sounds like a lot of your workload is covering crimes that are minor, but I guess that's why they're out on parole and not in jail. Also interesting to note that even a minor crime ($12 shorts\) can get heavy-handed punishment. (Not implying that crimes shouldn't be prosecuted or your work is easy\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyum9?context=5)|Yeah, a lot of my caseload is generally lower misdemeanors and felonies. Probation is *supposed* to be for lower risk individuals so that they can remain in the community. But I do have some very high risk offenders that are on for manslaughter, felony possession of firearm, assault with intent to kill, etc. We get a whole range.
[How does a person who tried to kill someone end up on probation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cakkye1?context=5)|My bad, need a correction. I have several on for assault with intent to cause serious bodily injury as well as several for assault with a deadly weapon. Actually also had a guy on for felony death by motor vehicle (this was plead down to from a 2nd Deg Homicide charge.) 
[So do you think it's appropriate in those sorts of cases you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/calhbtp?context=5)|To be honest, yes. But then again, I'm not the one passing judgment, that's for the court. But the few I've had on probation have been model probationers. They completed all of their conditions, pay on time, report on time, and maintain good communication. Maybe they realized what a freaking huge break they got and realize how much prison time they have if they get their probation revoked. Not sure.
 |For example, I had a guy who was on probation for death by vehicle. He was able to stay in the community, keep his job at a good car dealership (yeah yeah, a bit ironic), moved in with his family, got engaged a bit later, and paid back his restitution to the family of the deceased. That seems a lot better to me than a prison sentence that all taxpayers will foot the bill on. Then we'll keep footing the bill when he can't get a job when released from prison and other such similar things.
 |But those are only the cases I've seen. Certainly there are those out there that don't deserve to be back in the community but are. I do have several that I feel that way about, but they aren't for nearly as serious crimes as death by vehicle.
[Does your job make you jaded?  Are you now predisposed to think that the person who is sitting in the chair across from you is a criminal?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyq03?context=5)|Sadly, yes. I get lied to on a daily basis, and that is absolutely frustrating. I tend to not believe anything unless I have clear proof otherwise.
 |I try my best to not pre-judge anyone that comes in for their first visit though. My first question is for them to explain the circumstances around their arrest/trial/conviction. I can tell a lot by that. Do they take responsibility? Are they an ""injustice collector"" that remembers every single contact with law enforcement? Do they dodge the question? Are they a ""the-world-is-out-to-get-me"" type person?
 |Everyone that comes into my office has been convicted of something, so I hope that the court system has done their job correctly in determining guilt every single time. But I know that is impossible. I try to keep a open mind at all times.
[As someone who is looking to get into law enforcement. What advice can you give me on how to start the process? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajzpi0?context=5)|Not sure why someone downvoted you. Have an upvote!
 |Get a four year degree and get it in something you can fall back on. If you want to go into straight up law enforcement, realize that it is extremely stressful and has a high burnout rate. Make your degree something you'd enjoy if law enforcement doesn't go right for you. Most PD's absolutely don't care what degree you had. Get physically fit and stick with it. Go over to officer.com and check their recruit forums. Military experience can certainly help. Do a ride-a-long and ask questions.
 |That is my advice if you want law enforcement. But realize my job is only maybe 40% law enforcement.
[Have you ever had someone on parole/probation for computer crimes? If so how did supervising them differ from other offenders? What do you do if someone on parole/probation admits that they have broken probation (slipped up and smoked a joint or other relatively small infraction\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak2wsm?context=5)|I have not, actually. I've had a few that had computers involved somewhat in their crime (identify theft), but never anything direct. Some of our sex offenders use computers for child pornography, and in that case, we can usually get a little assistance from the US Marshals to conduct some forensic computer scanning to monitor their use.
 |If someone slips up and is honest with me, I'll usually go with the least punitive measure. Sometimes it could be me saying, ""Look... since you were honest, I'm not going to drug screen you this month. But as of this day, you are warned. So get it out of your system and let's aim for a negative drug screen in 30 days."" Or sometimes it could be me referring them to drug treatment instead of a full blown violation hearing. There are plenty of options. I respect honesty more than anything, so I always try and work with honest offenders.
[So I'll be honest I have a friend on probation that smokes mj every day and he just gargles listerine every morning to pass the saliva tests, - he is also a minor-. I want his PO to make it impossible for him to get away with this -because he needs to actually serve out his probation. What would be the best way to get in contact with his PO while getting him in the least amount of trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak38su?context=5)|Well, because he is a minor, it might be difficult to reach his PO. Laws for juveniles restrict a lot of communication.
 |You can always try calling the main probation officer, let them know you have information regarding an offender and just leave it at that. We'll usually act on any new info. 
[What the worst repeat offender you've dealt with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak0os5?context=5)|Hmm, tough to call. I have one fella that has a record stretching back to the late 60's without a break. But he knows the system so well now that he'll usually do what you say. He'll just end up committing a new crime though.
 |The worst are the serial absconders. They'll be placed on probation and within 72 hours, they are nowhere to be seen. And the court keeps putting them on probation even though they've avoided supervision four or five times in a row. Tracking them down is a pain in the ass and I have one right now who fits that pattern.
[Why do the courts repeatedly put such people back on probation? What sorts of charges/convictions are you used to seeing for such cases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cakkuww?context=5)|The courts do it because of the limited power of judges. They have their structured sentencing and have only some limited discretion. So they check their general statutes and roll with whatever they are allowed to.
 |For the repeats, it's usually assaults (usually on females), drug charges, driving while license revoked, and selling different controlled substances. When it comes to selling, it is very easy to get charged with a crazy trafficking charge, then the narcotics team makes you roll over on other sellers to get a reduced charge from the DA. So we end up with a ton of lower sellers that ratted out others in return for probation instead of prison.
[Do you ever have any ""bullshit"" cases? where you think it's simply a waste of time for both you and your ""probationee...?"" (person who is on probation\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak15n3?context=5)|All the time. I can't even count how many young adults I have on probation right now for possession of drug paraphernalia. Usually this stems from a larger charge that is plead down, but it still seems to be a waste of my time.
[For instance a kid with a Cannabis charge, he's honest, not a bad kid, just at the wrong place at the wrong time (getting caught\) and he has no real addiction problem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak15n3?context=5)|It can go either way though. Sometimes some of my lowest risk offenders turn out to be a massive pain in my ass. Sometimes they are the absolute most compliant. For example, I have one guy on for driving while license revoked. Itty bitty conviction, whatever. But he has previous serious violent felonies, so he is way more difficult than it appears.
[If you do, do those cases bother you? like ""this is a waste of my time"" or is it more of a ""oh sweet, this one will be drama free"" type deal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak15n3?context=5)|You have to look at everyone separate from their conviction. 
[Sorry if this question is silly. Just I don't know too much about how parole works, what do you base your decision on?  Also, have you ever been conflicted personally or emotionally that has affected your decision making at the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyfb0?context=5)|Hmm, not too sure I understand the first question. I don't base my decision of parole on anything. That is handled by the parole commission as to whether they grant parole or not. I simply supervise the offender once released on parole.  I am conflicted personally pretty much on a weekly basis. The job is all about figuring out if my offender is being honest with me, feeding me what I want to hear, or outright lying to me. Personally, I always get conflicted over positive drug screens for marijuana. My marijuana users aren't out there beating people or posing massive danger like alcoholics or other hard users. But it's still illegal, still in violation of their probation. I personally dislike recommending jail/prison time due to positive drug screens.
[*I personally dislike recommending jail/prison time due to positive drug screens.*  Then I hope you abstain from that behavior entirely.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/caleh9r?context=5)|Entirely? You believe that no one should serve any amount of jail/prison time due to drug use? 
[I wanted to learn a bit more about your personal ideology as it applies to the criminal justice system.  Do you favour longer sentences and stronger deterrents or are you more so on the side of restorative justice- that is the idea that to reform we need to forgive rather than punish, so that we can break the cycle of offence &lt;--&gt; punishment. Or perhaps your view is something different all together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajykuy?context=5)|I am driven completely by the ""best practice"" approach to criminal justice. I have a Master's and am absolutely for any program/deterrent/practice that is grounded in empirical evidence with proven outcome measures. Research was my background, so that is where I always look. Unfortunately, not many players in the CJ see it like this, although there has been a better push in recent years.
 |But being in the field, you come to understand that there are certain people out there that will absolutely continue to commit crimes regardless of intervention or forgiveness. And that fear pushes a lot of deterrence theory.  No judge wants to be the person who let someone off easy, only to have them go and commit a serious new crime. No PO wants to be that guy. So there are a lot of tough sanctions.
 |I think prison is absolutely necessary for extremely high risk offenders. Some people ARE too far gone to correct, and I believe that completely. But there are so many low level offenders in custody for petty and non-violent crimes. But you look at our department, and our programs are underfunded or gone completely. We used to have excellent cognitive-behavioral therapies that were free to offenders. A lot of these have been slashed. Our drug treatment centers have been reduced. There are programs across the entire field.
 |But on the flip side, I've seen offenders that rack up felony after felony. Very serious crimes. And they eventually get these plead down or dismissed although through weak DA's or such and they are on probation. I have some very dangerous offenders that should not be in the community right now.
 |The above comments seems like a grabbag of ideals, but I'll narrow it down and say that I land on the side of restorative justice and anything that is based on peer-reviewed research. If there are statistically significant trends that reduce recidivism, I am onboard :) 
[A friend of mine has a kid with a deadbeat father.  He was arrested for sexually molesting a 5 year old and only served 3 years and then was out on parole.  2\) Do you monitor certain types of offenders closer, hoping to find an offence?  3\) I have heard alot of parole officers say that they will violate someone and then not do it. Basically a blind threat.  Is that because theres to much paperwork to follow through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak1ork?context=5)|2.) Yes. I try not to pre-judge an offender on their previous criminal history, but some people are just way too well known in the community (for example, certain high-level dealers). Sometimes it may be an offender I had a year ago, got rid of, then right back on probation. I keep my eyes a bit closer on them because I know them well. I always keep my eyes moreso on offenders placed on probation for serious dealing/trafficking crimes. There is a pretty good chance the money is too good to give up, so they're more likely to be searched.
[1\) he was violated 3 times for violent offenses and yet the court let him out each time. Do you get fustrated with the courts when that occurs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak1ork?context=5)|1.) Absolutely. I can't count how many times an offender poses a CLEAR public safety risk and yet the court continues them or pleads something down to a ridiculous minor charge. Luckily, my state's parole commission is fairly tough and has no problem revoking parole for new serious/violent arrests.
 |3.) Haha, yes. Sometimes you need to threaten someone for them to respond. I try not to do that unless absolutely needed. For example, I have one offender that ALWAYS makes excuses to why he can't show up at the office for our scheduled appointment. But if I go to his house and threaten warrants, he'll report within 24 hours. I hate to do it, but sometimes I will. I will always back up what I say though, I just hope that it doesn't come to that.
[Hello and good day. I was charged with 2 misdemeanors (1 in 98 1 in 99\), left for Texas for a couple years and came back to turn my self in for the charges. I had my 2 charges upgraded to 1 felony, a class 4 in Illinois. Served my time, paid my fines and did my parole, made positive changes in my life after that. I recently graduated college ( im a late bloomer, age 40\) with a degree in social science and have aspirations of becoming a counselor some day.   I would love to counsel inmates that are going to be released from DOC, to help them see how making poor choices landed them in jail and hopefully how to prevent that in the future. I had even entertained the idea of parole/probation officer.   With my felony, do you think either of these are a possibility? Do you know of anyone in your field of work that perhaps had a criminal record but overcame that obstacle? Or am I just dreaming of the impossible? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak1ic6?context=5)|It absolutely depends on the state and the specific department that you are trying for. In my state, there are actually a few re-entry positions that actively seek individuals with previous prison time. I think that is remarkable and exactly what is needed. Many prisoners won't listen to anyone in a position of authority, but will absolutely listen to a former inmate that has life experience.
 |I actually know one female that we partner with in my community. She served about 5 years in prison and is now a re-entry working with a private organization that helps former inmates with resumes, interviewing techniques, etc.
 |I think there is a dearth of re-entry resources (at least in my state) and I wish we had more people like you that can be given resources to help those about to be released.
 |Awesome to hear of your success story.
[I'm actually very interested in this line of work. What are your favorite aspects of your job? Any advice for someone that might be looking to get started in that career field? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajzyyn?context=5)|My favorite part is that I set my own schedule and have very little micromanaging from my supervisor. I can use a lot of discretion. I also love balancing the roles of law enforcement with social work. On the one hand, I am more than happy to make an arrest or dig through an basement during a search. But I also love making real connections with people and building rapport.
 |In fact, that is my one warning to anyone interested in this field. If you want to be making arrests everyday and busting down doors, look elsewhere. If you never want to have to touch someone, go into awful houses, or just want to be Mr. Friendly, look elsewhere. Balance is everything and the best PO's I've ever met have that balance down to a  science.
[I wish I could remember his name. I'd like to find out if he's still working and go back to let him know I've kept my nose clean and that, although my life isn't perfect, I've stayed out of trouble. I bet he doesn't get a lot of thank yous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak4eon?context=5)|The job is definitely under-appreciated. You don't get kids saying, ""I wanna be a probation officer"" like they'd say, ""I wanna be a cop!"" Most people don't even know what probation is because we're very behind-the-scenes. But I like that to a certain extent. I never wanted a flashy job or a job that was too much in the public spotlight.
[I was on parole for one year after I got out of prison. I did good while on papers , got a job , paid on time , and passed my drug tests , and alwayd reported. I did get drunk a couple of times and almost got in trouble but then I went to aa and got sober.  When I was in prison I said to myself I wasn't going to get messed up , and couldn't figure out why I was doing the same shit again after what I had just went through. Us alcoholics and addicts get a bad rap from the get go . Thankfully I found out what was wrong with me. Please take into consideration that people on parole some of them might be an addict or alcoholic that doesn't know how to help themselves instead of being a jackass and treating them like a worthless human being. Send them to aa and tell them to get a sponsor. My question is are u a freemason? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajz0a1?context=5)|Absolutely! Glad to hear of a success story, man. If it matters, I always look differently at someone on my caseload that comes in with a drug charge than say, someone on for felony larceny. I know that those two people are going to have two extremely different needs and will have to overcome different challenges.
 |Nope, not a freemason. 
[What is your opinion on marijuana?  My former probation officer would tell me he had nothing against it (also mentioned his brother in law was a smoker\), and was just doing his job. How do most POs feel about it? Thanks for the AMA ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak0wze?context=5)|Most PO's seem to hate that we have to deal with it. Unlike drugs like cocaine, heroin, etc, marijuana stays in your system forever, so it may take several drug screens to clear it out, even if the person has abstained and is really trying. That's aggravating. Most PO's don't like the legalization idea, but I can't think of one that isn't for decriminalizing the hell out of it. I'd really like my state to reduce the penalties for personal use (somewhere around 1 ounce or less).
 |And trust me, I'd rather deal with a stoner any day of the week over an alcoholic or meth head. 
[What illegal drugs, if any, do you consider to not truly be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak0ljl?context=5)|Any mind-altering substance can be a problem. It depends on what else is going on in the life of that person. For me, there is no universal ""no problem"" drug. 
[If someone commits a misdemeanor or small crime and is put on probation, does it entail they have to be sober for the entirety of probation? Or is it true that that only applies if your charge was drug/alcohol related or a felony?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak095q?context=5)|In my state, anyone placed on probation is subject to drug screening. So it really doesn't matter what you crime is. Alcohol is fine so long as the judge didn't specifically prohibit it (which they may do in cases of DUI or similar). 
[So, usually, what are the reasons parole is revoked? (Particularly for repeat felons/addicts who are clearly not making an effort to comply with felony parole.\)  I ask because I've never been in trouble with the law, but someone I know is, and I'm wondering how bad she has to get before they put her back in jail. She's a drug felon and honestly jail is the best place for her. Shes been out 2 months. She is homeless, often high, and and is pretty quickly going back to her old ways. Her PO doesn't seam to care what shes doing. Examples include smoking weed, doing meth, leaving the state, not staying where she was paroled out to, not having a job, and not paying child support. What does she have to do to have her parole revoked? Is it subject to the 'opinion' of the PO?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak09yx?context=5)|1.) New criminal conviction (misdemeanor or felony)
 |2.) Absconding supervision.
 |However, if the original sentence is less than 90 days, we can send individuals to jail for up to 90 days for only minor violations (drug screens, failure to report, etc etc). We can send them to jail for 90 days up to three different times if they are on felony probation.
 |It totally depends on the policies of the specific department as well as the statutory guidelines from that state.  
[Agreed! I do truly appreciate your response, honesty, as well as down-to-earth understanding with this matter. And what would you suggest to someone who does need mental health services but just prefers to go without due to horrible health insurance, and all they want to do is prescribe drugs that they refuse to take? Also, what would you suggest to someone who still owes like 600 on their fines, and is about to get probation all over again? Should they pay? Since if you don't they don't seem to add it/roll it over to your new fines along with your new probation term? It's like they never even cared about it, they just reinstate the initial fine and write off what you owe on the last one. Why is that, and what incentive does a probationee in that situation have to pay that fine, that is gonna be considered void right after court? Shouldn't they keep that money and throw it towards there new fine? The fine question I'd really like answered, since I get the feeling your in PA, and these are questions pertaining to that state. You have been tremendously helpful, as well as insightful, I'm glad I've had this chance to ask you these questions. Again, thank you very much! And keep up your positive paroling/probationing, I think you can do a lot of good for those on probation! I hope you do encourage others to better themselves in many ways, would you be interested in helping to throw a program together, for prison as well as supervision, that is based on individuals finding purpose and passion in their lives through education, job &amp; skill training, giving back to the community, and entrepreneurial opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cakj85e?context=5)|Even if there are mental health issues at play (lack of services, poor insurance, etc), I still can't ever say to someone that it is acceptable to consume a controlled substance while on probation. That would be against my role as a probation officer. I would, however, work with any available resources to help them cease use. I always push my offenders away from primary care physicians who may not have the time or resources to dive into mental concerns (and therefore go straight to pharmaceuticals). I'll use up any available resources I have at my disposal to push someone away from marijuana as self-medication. In the end, is the marijuana really addressing ANY underlying mental health issues? I highly, highly doubt it. It's temporary relief at best.
 |I'm not sure about your question asking about the roll-over of fines. Each case of probation in my state is separate. So one can't really roll over into the other unless a judge specifically orders it to do so. The case can't expire unless in full compliance or the remaining money is moved into a civil lien or is remitted by the judge. I haven't seen anything like that (the rollover) in my state. Sorry I can't help ya on that one.
 |I'll tell you, I wish we had more programs in prison than we do. Some prisons are really great at GED programs and some vocational training. But there are still a lack of programs because prison is so expensive to begin with. Basic housing eats up money, so nothing is leftover for rehabilitation programs. EVERYTHING comes back to money, and when you're talking about corrections, no taxpayer and no politican wants to pay for it unless it's a new shiny jail/prison to show they're tough on crime or the closing of a jail/prison to show they're trying to save taxpayer money. It blows, man.
[While in college I was very interested in this profession. I was a Sociology major, and it was one of the professions they listed as a possible career you could have with a degree in Sociology. Unfortunately I was never able to get one of the internships in law enforcement my university offered, so I sort of got discouraged... My question is what was the path you took to get your job (i.e. a degree in x, or police academy etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak0d62?context=5)|I have a B.A. in Criminal Justice and an M.S. in Criminal Justice and Criminology. I kind of regret this though. I should have gotten a backup degree such as public administration or something in the IT field.
 |For my state, the job only requires that you have a four year degree in a social-science type field. Law enforcement experience does NOT count, actually.
 |I went from graduate school (focus on research) to unemployed for about five months. Then I got a job as a detention officer at a juvenile facility, then onwards to adult probation. But we have officers from all different fields of work. 
[Did you get into the social work subdivision of the justice system intentionally, or did it just happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak1y5r?context=5)|Well, I knew I never wanted to be strictly law enforcement. I applied at local PD's and did some ride-a-longs. It wasn't for me. But I wanted something similar. I had a friend who got into probation and it struck me as a perfect balance of social worker/law enforcement. I like being able to assume the different roles. Some people hate it, and they burn out of it quickly. You can't be too much of a hand-holding social worker, and you can't be a tough law enforcement officer. It requires a little of both.
[Have you ever encountered a ""sociopath""-type client? One who did not appear to have any moral center or care for people at all? Who would be capable of doing anything if it benefited them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak4frv?context=5)|Thankfully, no. I've met some who are excellent and believable liars. I'm met some who come up with the most amazing rationalizations for their behavior. People who truly believe the world is set against them. Those are the difficult ones. I've met some of the most absolutely selfish individuals ever. For example, one parolee who shook her baby to within an inch of it's life. Then choked it, then slapped him so hard he bled. It is amazing he didn't die. He is now permanently physically and mentally disabled. He is eight and can form about three or four different sentences. And she denies it all against three other witnesses and claims she'll get him back one day. She truly showed no remorse because she honestly didn't believe she did anything wrong. Ugh... I'm glad I don't supervise her anymore.
[Thanks for answering! you've been going all day @__@](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak6yze?context=5)|Hell, when you do an AMA, you might as well go for a solid day, right? :)
[Does the relationship between the rehab industry and the parole/probation department   ever bother you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajyh6x?context=5)|In what manner?
 |At least in my area, our relationship with drug treatment centers/providers is very good. They thrive off our referrals, and we get to keep people out of jail. We are able to share drug screens between one another and keep each other posted about offender progress.
 |The only thing that bothers me is that there are not enough options for drug treatment. I wish we had more residential options, lower cost options, etc. 
[Can you clarify?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajzfx0?context=5)| 
[A few questions... You said you're somewhat jaded on the job. Do you believe that you're generally pretty good about spotting the liars? Also, I'm not sure if you know Portugal's drug laws, but if you do (or if you're willing to look them up\) what are your views on them? Lastly, you said you work in the southeast US. Without giving away too much information, is your area a very conservative one? Are they really tough on things like marijuana? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cajzsx1?context=5)|I think my liar-spotting skills increase each day. But it's still difficult. You want to build rapport with offenders, but you can't JUST take them at their word unless they have established a good track record of it.
 |Hmm, I am very unfamiliar with any laws outside of the US, although I'd love to read up on other countries drug laws.
 |The area I work is really about 50/50 when looking at liberal vs conservative. Probably leaning towards conservative though. 
[Here is the **wiki** and here is a (rather one sided\) **article** about the law if you're interested :\) Thanks for answering the questions!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak3wc0?context=5)|I'll absolutely read up on it! Thanks for the links.
[Awesome to see this thread, as I just got put on probation :-   I've always heard how hardass POs here are, but I've been on since mid-March and haven't been piss tested once, haven't been able to make a single fee / court payment and my PO hasn't brought it up (since he knows my situation - I lost EVERYTHING in jail... All my businesses, my 10 year relationship, my house, everything\).  I guess my main question is how long would you personally let fees slide typically? I'm stressing bigtime about paying those. Is there a set limit, or do you tailor your lenience on the individual's demeanor and situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak1uzw?context=5)|Edit: The only time I care about money is if it is court ordered restitution to a victim. Then I have to get on my people a little bit harder. But if it's just court costs, attorney fees, fines, etc, I really don't care so long as a little bit of effort is there. I DO get upset though, when I see my offender bought a brand new 55"" TV and yet couldn't put in a payment for the month. That kind of stuff bothers me and I make note of it for any future violation hearing. 
[My house was searched illegally (cops just walked in when they had the wrong house... yeah\) and they found some NON-NARCOTIC pills that someone had left at my house (in their prescription bottle\) - Trazodone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak1uzw?context=5)|Wait, I don't follow. The police searched the wrong house but they found pills and attributed it to you?  For me personally, money is the last thing I care about. And the court (and therefore judges) generally don't care. I am way more concerned about any other court ordered conditions that are required (ex., attend drug treatment classes, submit to electronic monitoring, write a letter of apology, etc etc etc). I always tell my offenders to pay whatever they can just to show good effort each month. Even if that's just $5. If money is the only thing leftover when their probation term comes up, I'll always back them up in court (ask for an extension, modify conditions, or maybe just have them terminated and move the money to a civil judgment).
[Fellow probation officer, here.  Kudos man, your answers are well thought out.   I've thought about doing an AMA myself, but you beat me to it :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ggczl/im_a_state_probationparole_officer_amaa/cak5606?context=5)|Worst part of my job? Definitely some anxiety when conducting an arrest, doing a search, or when I know (or don't know) dogs are around.  Always on guard. I also fear bodily fluids, but I also worked in a jail, so I'm used to blood/shit... still freaked out by vomit.

So, what is the most morally offish thing you've printed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gggth/i_am_a_photo_lab_tech_at_a_massive_insanely_busy/cajzkt9?context=5)|I would probably say the time I had to print several pictures of a couple having sex in a public park.
 |However, you could tell the images were taken with a telephoto lens. It was obvious the pictures did not belong to the couple when they showed up, because the man who ordered them looked NOTHING like the guy in the picture. ...That's when I realized he'd probably been creeping about, noticed people having sex in a wooded area of the park, and used a telephoto lens to snap pictures.

I take a lot of the orders, assist people with ordering prints, etc.  So yes. I see these people. And chances are I printed those nudes. It's kind of awkward in a way to hand someone the envelope of their prints and just be thinking ""I know what his dick looks like"" or ""God, her nipples looked really strange.""

We'll scan the original image in on a flatbed scanner and we have a couple of specialists who will do photo restoration. The price is based on how long the job will typically take. I have seen people pay $500+ to get old (and I'm talking *fucking ancient*) family photographs restored.
 |We try and get a fair price for everyone, though. Usually when someone brings in something to be restored, I'll take it, go to the back, and discuss with one of our specialists what kind of job the restoration will be.
 |Restorations can cost a ton of money, but every time I see someone pick their order up, you can tell it's worth it. We deal with a lot of photographs where it may be the ONLY photo they have of a loved one who has since passed away. Just last week a woman in her 70s brought in an old picture from the 1910s for us to restore. It was a bunch of since deceased family members on the porch of an old house. When she came back for the prints and digital files, I took her to one of our computers, loaded up the CD, and zoomed in on her grandfather's face in the photo (it was almost impossible to see all the details with just the naked eye).
 |She started sobbing because she had never met her grandfather and this was the only picture of him. She had never been able to see his face very clearly in the original, so she had never known what he looked like.

I can't even tell you what a majority of the stuff I print is of, honestly. I see thousands of images everyday. I have orders where I have to hit 'next' 100 times.
 |That being said, rest assured that in most labs, we won't oogle at your photos or call attention to them. We print them, stick them in an envelope, and file them away. It's not that we're not interested. It's just that your pictures are just pictures. We deal with them every day. It would be like a banker scrutinizing a $1 bill.

Didn't think anything of it until we turned in our film to get developed and then my parents were like ""oh shit wait a minute. We just..."" But they never said anything.  So I'm guessing stuff like that is common enough. And shit I see parents take pictures of their kids in the bath and sometimes you see more than you'd want.

 |I work as a freelance photographer and I love using black and white film and I thought I was in a minority. However, I realized how wrong I was on my first say on the job. I work 9 or 10hr shifts each day and I probably deal with people dropping off around ~200 rolls a day, plus a ton of people picking up processed negatives.
 |We also have a massive film inventory. I recently organized it (some we keep in a refrigerator, others are stored in drawers) and we had over 40 different types of film.
 |Edit: Forgot to say that we also see a TON of people come through with old film they've found around the house/in the attic/etc. Most of the time they have absolutely no idea what is on it until we develop and give them prints/negatives/digital copies.

 |Oh God, I feel like this is going to fall under 'well, that escalated quickly'. We do a lot of print work for organizations like Child Protective Services, Family Protective services, etc. The order always comes in digitally (the files are uploaded into our database and we receive a printout that states how many to print of which ones in which sizes) The unfortunate thing, though, is that when we print these images and queue them up to our huge printer, we have to look through each and every digital copy to make sure nothing vital is cropped out. A majority of these pictures are for court cases about child and elderly abuse. We've also received images of violent crimes to print for law enforcement, one of which involved an attempted strangulation (you could see bruises in the shape of fingers on a woman's throat). Also, I have received one order that I suppose was for insurance purposes. Most of these pictures were of a horribly mangled, totaled car. However, towards the end there were several pictures of the victim, whose arm had somehow been severed in the wreck. It was so unexpected after staring at like 50 pictures of the same mangled car. I had to take a 20 minute break after that. I thought these kind of pictures would be printed in house at the bureau that needs them (like, I always assumed CPS printed at their office, I guess), but no. A lot of places order out for stores like us to make sure the prints come out well.

1ggo6u,2,2013-06-16,Internship interview this week. Tips?,Globe90Squatter,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ggo6u/internship_interview_this_week_tips/,"Let me start off by saying that this subreddit is the reason I got my interview. You've all been so helpful by sharing your own experiences. 

So Tuesday I have an interview for a marketing internship at a very cool software company. I have no formal education or work experience in software or computers, but like many Redditors, I am computer literate and I keep up with the trends. 

Anyway, it's a 2 hour interview with a ""project"" component and a face to face interview. The ""project"" component is also a group interview. I really have no idea what that entitles, it was very briefly mentioned in an email. 

So my questions are

1. I assume the ""project"" component has to do with testing how we're able to come up with marketing strategies. But as an employer, what else would they be looking for? I assume they're looking for the ability to work as part of a team and communication skills. I am very personable and I tend to make anyone I talk to feel at home and important. Naturally in these situations, when a project with strangers start, I would take the lead introducing myself and asking people about themselves and trying to make friends. Would this be wise to do in the group ""project""? 

2. Suppose there are some parts of the ""project"" that are over my head (since I have really no real work experience, just school in an unrelated liberal arts field) what should I do? On my own, I'd just Google the problem and search Reddit for perspective. I don't think this would be appropriate here. Should I just ask the other people there? Should I seek clarification from the interviewer? Should I just admit that it's over my head? Or should I just wing it the best that I can?

3. It's an extremely laid back work culture. Think Google. I was planning on wearing a suit. Would anyone advise against this? The job description even says that we can wear jeans to work. 

4. I applied for the internship months ago and since then, I've revised and edited my resume. I've edited some start and end dates that I caught were incorrect and I've taken out a small project that I was working on because I ended up failing in it. Should I give my interviewers an updated copy of my resume at the start? What if they ask me about the discrepancies? 

5. *sigh* I've been using the same email for over 10 years and I completely forgot to do a background check on myself. Well, I googled my email and some forums I use to go on years ago showed up. I'm hoping that since they invited me for an interview, they might have seen my history anyway and overlooked it. No questions really, but how bad is this, and what can I do to cover this up? I've made a new email since and will be putting that on my updated resume. 

6. One of the requirements is to be knowledgeable in Social Media. I don't use Social Media personally because I actually hate it, but I am familiar with different ones and I've made accounts with each one to familiarize myself more with them. If I get asked how frequently I use Social Media what should I say? I was thinking of going in and pointing out the pros and cons that I see in each of them, where I see the value for businesses to use them, but ultimately, for personal use, I don't use them. Is that good? 


Thanks so much r/jobs, really, you've been extremely helpful!

However, there are a small few who obviously are showing huge attitude towards me because they don't want to be taking orders from an intern.

I've asked other engineers at work for advice, and they said that their techs/ops ""know their position"" as the engineers can easily give them hell by making their work difficult. I don't agree with this fear method at all. 

Ideally, I would build relationships with them to gain their respect, but I'm only here for the summer. I've disregarded the job levels as I'm trying to learn from everyone. Yet, the few who have a grudge against me are starting to make things difficult.  What can I do in the meantime to make the course of my internship run smoother?"

1gj9v6,0,2013-06-17,What language should I learn now?,zipWith,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gj9v6/what_language_should_i_learn_now/,"I am currently a first year Computer Science student and I know Java, Haskell, and C. Then I have experience with Assembly and SQL. This summer I won't have an internship, but I would like to work on some projects (using raspberry pi and android). I would like to learn a new general programming language, suitable for almost every little project that allows me to be really productive. I was thinking about Python or Ruby. I don't want to open another of the endless discussion about those two languages, I just want to know ""in your opinion"" which one is the language that in my situation (regarding both my formation and the projects I am interested in) is the most suitable. I don't want to learn both (at least for now, because I think that it would not make my summer as much productive as it could be), but I really can't decide. At the start, I tried both and I like them (I never had any programming religion). I've read around 60% of Dive into Python and I think Python is really nice. I've looked at Ruby (not much, just solved some hackerrank/project euler problems with it while I was reading the doc for the syntax) and it seems really nice (I really like blocks). I am not interested too much about web development (I want to do a bit, but in case I wouldn't go with Django/Rails, but with one of Flask/Padrino/Sinatra. 

A little summary of what I am looking for is a language that:

- It could be technically used everywhere (but I am not gonna force it, each language has its own domain).
- I can program fast with it (I love Hackathons and in every hackatons I've been in lots of people use Python)
- It's fun (one of the most important factors)
Bonus Point: It is a good language to answer question during interviews.

I would like to use in a project using a raspberry pi and a webcam!


From what it seems to me, the first two points Python wins (it has a huge library and it seems to be one of the most used languages at hackatons), but from just messing around I think Ruby is a bit more fun.

I know that discussions about Ruby and Python are everywhere, but I am really unable to choose between those. Every time I think I chose one, I keep going back and searching online for comparisons leaving me with a feeling of wasting my time."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What is your response to someone that says, ""If I have nothing to hide, why should I worry?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakkan6?context=5)|One of my favorite questions!
 |One response is that you might have more to hide than you think, and you might not even know right now that it's something you want to hide.
 |Right now, people tend to talk about surveillance as a terrorism-fighting tool. So often, the public supports it, because nobody wants terrorist attacks except the terrorists. I don't want bombs going off either.
 |But what if the surveillance turns to target ... say ... people with Communist leanings? Or people of some other political persuasion deemed to be dangerous. We did have that whole ""Red Scare"" thing.
 |One of my colleagues, Geoff Fowler, wrote a [story](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000872396390444165804578008740578200224.html) about some students who joined a LGBT choir at college. The choir administrator signed them up for the Facebook group, and a notice went out to their families without their approval. It created a terrible situation for them. So ... did they have something to hide? Yes and no.
 |Another response is that, well, this could be exactly what the framers of our Constitution had in mind when they included the Fourth Amendment.
 |The Fourth Amendment was intended to address things called ""general warrants,"" in which law enforcement could just go through people's houses looking for contraband. Of course, if you were innocent and had nothing to hide, maybe it was just an inconvenience.
 |But is that really the society you want to live in? Certainly earlier in our history, important people didn't think so.
[Do you think there is any hope that Americans will see a level of privacy originally intended by the founding fathers ever again, or is there simply no going back now?  Do you expect the invasive practices of the US Government against it's citizens to get worse, or better?  *Also*, thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakkgtu?context=5)|To be honest, I don't know.
 |A lot of this is a question of technology. We're all carrying around little tracking devices--our smartphones. And the tech is only going to get smaller and more powerful.
 |There isn't much of a way around that. Who is going to say, ""No. Stop making computers more powerful and convenient?""
 |I'm a big proponent of technologies like encryption. But they are currently difficult to use, and privacy-protecting technical solutions often can be circumvented.
 |So really it comes down to a question of the law, I think. Plenty of people disagree with this.
 |But it's a matter of making sure lawmakers and the judiciary understand the technology and create legal protections for us. And it's a matter of the public voicing concerns, if they have them. Maybe the public really doesn't.
 |In general, I'm an optimistic person. Our country has gone through a lot. It wasn't too long ago that some people were legally prohibited from voting. So I'm hopeful we can handle this and come up with some reasonable solutions.
[How concerned are the conservative and Tea Party groups about and the widespread phone and internet searches and the loss of privacy?  When there was the gun control debate after Sandy Hook, these organizations were enraged about the encroachment on the 2nd Amendment, do they care that the 4th Amendment is now under attack?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakl493?context=5)|The only thing I know about the Tea Party is from my family back in Texas, and they seem concerned. Sample size of two, though!  One of the things I think is so interesting about this issue of surveillance is that it doesn't always break neatly on party lines. It has now been promoted by two administrations that are different politically. And it has now been assailed by people on both sides of the spectrum as well.
[What are they doing with my information? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakl0u9?context=5)|Your data can be gathered with incredible ease. For the most part, the folks doing this are the companies that are providing you the services. Google, for example, sifts through Gmail to show you ads. As you know, the phone companies can get a lot of information about the ""metadata"" from your calls.  To get content (what you're actually saying), they get a Title III wiretap warrant, which requires probable cause as well as minimization of extraneous content and other things.
[What are your feelings on the constitutionality of the various surveillance programs, as well as the potential for the SCOTUS to actually see the pending lawsuits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakk6nj?context=5)|That's a broad question, because all of these programs are different, and all of them are complicated. I think to decide the legal standing of these, you actually have to have a deep understanding of the technology. That can be difficult for people who aren't steeped in the tech.
 |I'll just talk about two aspects of this now, to simplify.
 |One is that in some respects, this is a First Amendment issue. You've seen companies such as Facebook coming out and announcing vague numbers regarding the requests they receive from the government. They are under gag orders, so they aren't free to disclose much.
 |I covered a [story](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303567704577519213906388708.html) in which a technology company fought a National Security Letter and said this strict gag order was unconstitutional under the First Amendment.
 |I think that's a very interesting argument.
 |Another interesting issue: standing.
 |Previously, courts have said people couldn't really bring suits about this because they couldn't prove they were affected. But more concrete disclosures might change that. The ACLU just filed a suit saying that because this tracking has been disclosed, they feel they will be affected because people will be afraid to call them.
[I'm as frustrated as anybody with what the government is doing. But i also know we need to be vigilant in trying to track and find out what real terrorists are doing. How can we strike the right balance between privacy and fighting against terrorism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakku05?context=5)|I might end up giving this answer a lot. But I think transparency is the key first step.
 |We can't, as a society, decide if we agree with something if we don't even know what that ""something"" is.
 |A couple senators on the Intelligence committee have been saying for some time, rather loudly, that there is a ""secret interpretation of the law"" that should worry us all. Turns out that secret legal interpretation is what allows this massive gathering of phone record information and so forth.
 |Those senators had been asking to have the legal reasoning be declassified, but they weren't able to effect that change.
 |To me, if you can't even declassify the way our own laws are being interpreted, that's a huge question for our system. That's not about protecting troop movements or activities. It's about whether we as citizens get to know what the law says.
[Is metadata available for warrantless search under the 4th amendment? What is the precedent for this? For example, is it legal for the police to write down the addresses of people who are sending me physical mail by sending an officer to the post office without a warrant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakktil?context=5)|Yes, metadata is available under the Fourth Amendment.
 |There are several reasons for this, including in cases involving physical mail.
 |The main one is what is called the ""third party doctrine."" This is a legal theory that holds that, if you give information to a third party, you can't really expect that it's private anymore. For example, if you tell a confidential informant something in ""secret,"" that's fair game.
 |A 1979 Supreme Court case found that investigators didn't have to have a warrant to get phone numbers a person had dialed, because the person would have to know that the phone company had those numbers anyway. (After all, they'd show up on the phone bill.) Another case held the same for banking records.
 |The difference now is that this metadata now reveals a lot more about us. Particularly with the advent of smartphones, you are giving off a lot of information in ""just metadata."" And with more powerful computers to analyze it, investigators can put together pieces like never before.
 |In a Supreme Court case last year, U.S. v Jones, the justices actually began raising concerns about this. They decided that case, which was about a GPS tracker on a car, based on a simple question of trespass.
 |But the concurring opinions dealt with the increasing power of tracking and data. Justice Sotomayor even questioned whether the judiciary should take another look at the third party doctrine in light of these technological changes.
 |So it is definitely an interesting question and will be for some time, I think.
[I sometimes hear that Government is always one step behind Technology and playing catch up when it comes to legal rulings. What are some ways Government can properly address Constitutional questions as technology advances at a rapid pace?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakkpm2?context=5)|One of the most important factors is transparency. Good technology education and advice also are important.
 |It's key for judges who are making these decisions to know what technology they are really dealing with. Secrecy for law enforcement is understandable and important in many respects. Certainly I wouldn't want anyone to be put in danger by disclosing, say, confidential informants and the like.
 |But judges and lawmakers need to have staff who understand this technology and what it can do.
 |There's [a magistrate judge in Texas](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/10/22/judge-questions-tools-that-grab-cellphone-data-on-innocent-people/) who has written opinions on ""cell tower dumps"" and other surveillance technology, stating that he doesn't think judges are receiving adequate information about the technological tools to truly make good decisions.
 |So I'd say transparency is the first step.
 |(I hope I understood your question properly. There were a couple ways to read it.)
[I really have to ask how you can work for Rupert Murdoch and look at yourself in the morning.  FOX news and the WSJ are some of the most corrosive elements in American society.  Why should anyone believe a thing you say when you are allied with FOX/WSJ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakkof6?context=5)|I see that this has moved down the page because of voting, but I want to respond anyway.
 |First, I take great pride in my reporting. I have been at The Wall Street Journal since before it was purchased by News Corp., and since it was purchased I have never had anybody tell me not to write or run a story or anything like that. The Journal is a great paper, and I'm honored to work here.
 |That said, the Journal's reporting staff has had a long tradition of, shall we say, not always agreeing with the opinion staff. The opinion page has in fact come out against the reporting of me and my editor, Julia Angwin, on this ""What They Know"" series.
 |It's part of our history at the Journal. This is a fact that is well-known within the journalism world but not among the public.
 |In fact, there is a blue plexiglass wall--a physical wall--between the newsroom and the opinion page. I'm on the first row of reporters on the reporting side.
 |We use this wall as a white board, as you can see [here](https://twitter.com/jenvalentino/status/312220740688691200/photo/1).

It's especially important to mention location data here. Location, location, location.
 |(2) The government is able to access or take much of this information, following certain laws. The key thing here is to tell people about the ""third party doctrine,"" which means that data about who you call, where you go, what you buy, and more can be accessed by the government without a warrant. That's because you've already shared it with a ""third party,"" generally technology companies.
 |(3) Finally, I'd talk about the secrecy surrounding these procedures and laws. We just don't know exactly what the government can take, what it gets and when it can actually use it in investigations. People might not understand technology or legal issues, but they can generally understand that making the law itself a secret is a little disconcerting.

 |Such technology makes it more difficult to spy on people, so in general I would think spies would find it annoying.
 |But people have a great many vulnerabilities. If someone really wants to track you, it's tough to get away.
 |One point I'd like to make that your question raises: Sometimes people say this sort of software is used only by criminals. And it's true that criminals are among the people who want to preserve their privacy. It's also true that I'm not a fan of criminals, and I appreciate all the work law enforcement does to catch them.
 |But other people use these things as well. Good people. Dissidents, journalists, women who have been stalked or abused, regular people who just want to be left alone.

[Hi Ms Valentino! Thanks for doing an ama. In the discussion of privacy protection, a question I've never seen answered is: does going to lengths to protect one's privacy put you on the ""radar"", as it were? You mentioned Tor, but it's obvious that a browser is using it. As for VPNs, obviously your ISP can see that you are connected to one, does that raise any red flags? Basically, does going to lengths to protect privacy make ""them"" suspicious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/caknjpa?context=5)|I have heard that in some cases it does, that using encryption is considered a red flag.
 |That's why I think it would be interesting if more people started using encryption or privacy-protecting measures generally. If more people use such tools, privacy becomes a public norm.
[Thanks for responding!  It's interesting, then, that we live in a society where locking a door is considered the norm, if not expected, but an equivalent level of digital privacy is considered suspicious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakwhe9?context=5)|Great analogy.
[Hi Jen,  Thanks so much for holding this forum. I wanted to ask you, since the government is involved in ""listening"" to the details of our online activities and phone calls, how can we truly trust the attorney-client privilege (or any other privileged conversations\) are really confidential and will not be used by the government in some manner? I am concerned that the idea of the government watching an online stream (e-mails/chats/texts\) between a client and their attorney or a patient and their doctor can be used against them in the future. With the new health care rules going into effect in January (and the old Death Panel rumors\), what's to say that the fourth and fifth amendments are really being protected when the NSA doesn't even require a warrant anymore to listen to our conversations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakoaue?context=5)|Again, at some point we have to rely on laws.
 |The government has long been technically able to conduct phone wiretaps or bug conversations between attorneys and clients. But they aren't supposed to.
 |Do investigators sometimes break the law? Of course. But as I see it now, that's a concern better addressed in specific instances.

[In your opinion, are the surveillance systems which are currently set up more about detecting and quashing ""national security threats"" or gathering information about consumers for commercial purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakledc?context=5)|More people are affected on a daily basis by commercial collection. So, your Web email is generally scanned. Your searches are scanned. Your purchases are recorded, and all of this information can help inform which ads to show you.
 |However, the fact that this information is recorded in the first place means that, at some point, it's likely available to the government as well. Fewer people will be touched by government surveillance in any sort of noticeable way, but in some respects it's of more concern to our society.
 |Traditionally the US has been less suspicious of private companies and more suspicious of the government. But the data can be sent from companies to the government, as is the case under the authorities we have learned about recently. 
[Could you single out one recommendation that in your opinion, greatly increases ones digital privacy significantly and if you can, please explain how this can be achieved. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gioc2/i_am_jennifer_valentinodevries_a_reporter_and/cakkhx1?context=5)|I think it's important to consider something called a ""threat model."" In other words, you need to determine what kind of surveillance worries you, and what type of surveillance you're most likely to see. The following recommendations go from easiest to more difficult.
 |For many people, protection against their threat model will just mean that they want to make sure tracking companies don't have information about them that could be used to influence the deals and offers they get. THAT mostly requires deleting cookies and using tools like [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/) and [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/).
 |The next step is to make sure you are using a more secure network on the Web as frequently as possible. A browser add-on called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) will help you do that.
 |Other people might want to protect their Web browsing further and really be anonymized as much as they can. That requires something called [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). 
 |Then beyond that, you can use encryption. I find that a great introductory encryption tool is something called [CryptoCat](https://crypto.cat/). That allows you to conduct encrypted chats and have cat emoticons. This is a good way to ease yourself into understanding that you can, indeed, use this sort of thing.
 |Beyond even that, you can check out Adium and Pidgin and something called OTR (off the record) chat. There is an IM server, jabber.ccc.de, that is quite good about not logging, etc. I suggest Googling those things.
 |A hacker called [The Grugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq), who is good at this stuff, recommends using Pidgin and OTR over Tor and creating multiple jabber.ccc.de addresses. He also [recommends](http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/13/ignorance-is-strength/) CryptoCat used over Tor.
 |And you can use PGP (""pretty good privacy"") encryption for email and other things. I wrote up some instructions on it on my [personal blog](https://jennifervalentinodevries.com/2012/01/22/how-to-use-pgp-for-more-secure-email/), but it's a little out-of-date. Could be helpful, though.
 |But all that said, if you are really in danger, be careful about relying on any of these things. There was a huge brouhaha over CryptoCat, for example, and whether it was safe enough for dissidents to use. The creators of that really do warn people whose lives are in danger, for example during the Arab Spring, that they should be careful about anything.
 |If someone is *really* after you, well, that's probably beyond a Reddit thread.
 |But anyway, that gives you an idea of threat modeling and the depths to which you can go.
 |(Edited to add further information about CryptoCat and OTR chat, as well as to link to The Grugq's Twitter feed, which I might regret.)

2.  I have no degree.

I ran out of money, didn't feel like acquiring more loans, and basically am going through a low-level crisis right now to the point where I'm not sure if I'll return to school in the fall.  However, I was called and offered a *chance* to get into this position, and I need to give them a salary.

I read that an associate's degree in computer science gets around 30k-33k (Can't remember where), which is about **16/hr**.  I went to the [Occupational outlook handbook[](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm#tab-5) and they said that the lowest a programmer makes with a bachelors degree is around 40k, which is **20/hr**.

Since I don't have any degree, I feel I can't ask as much as someone with a degree.  ***I'm thinking of asking for 21/hr, and being willing to negotiate down***.  I'm starved for work, and the only reason I can even live how I am now is by the grace of my parents, something I want to escape.

So, I'm in my first semester of engineering school, taking my second crack at the whole college thing. I'd previously studied graphic design, but after getting out of school I had absolutely no luck finding a job in the field, and I largely attribute that to my lack of work experience. I didn't do any internships in school because I didn't realize how important they were. I want to do it right this time.

So, I'm wondering, how much schooling do you think I need to get done in order to be able to reasonably get an internship? Some background info, which may be relevant:

* Previously studied graphic design, was one class shy of my BA. I'm finishing that class now. My dad, who's a mechanical engineer, tells me my background will have some good applications in things like CAD and industrial design.

* I suspect at least one person will suggest trying to use my dad as an in somewhere, but as I live in Pennsylvania and he lives in Texas, it's not really feasible.

* I'm currently in community college, taking some prereq courses: Physics I, Calc II, and CompSci. I plan to start some of the core engineering courses in the fall. After I finish out their 2 year program, I'll transfer to a 4 year school to finish my BS, most likely at either Temple or Drexel."

I am going to start learning programming using a mixture of Codeacademy, Udacity, some online books like Learn Programing the Hard Way and maybe edX. 

The question I have always had is what programming language to start?

My eventual goal is to make websites and services (backend and frontend) but I heard that C is much more versatile and that once you learn C, everything else is easier because they share characteristics. 

So my guess is to learn Java and Python first (because like I said I would like to make websites and services), then move onto C for Arduino programming, for example. 

Is this the right way to go? 

EDIT: I also would like to learn whatever is required so that I can at least be eligible to apply for a Google internship. 

EDIT 2: Thanks to everyone who actually took the time to comment and help a newbie out, instead of dismissing this post as an annoying side note. Newsflash: If you all keep on doing that, people wont be compelled to start. I need help. I read the FAQ and still wasn't sure.

But this one is true, and I really need some advice.  It's escalating, I'm not sure what to do.

This summer, I got an internship in New England.  I'm not going to be really specific, but the town is near the New Hampshire/Massachusetts line on the coast.  I'm from Georgia, so the whole area is really, really new to me.  I moved up with my fiance, who has family near here.  I've always wanted to get out of the South, and love living somewhere where my politics match up with the local folk.  Hell, you can buy alcohol in a Walgreens in New Hampshire.

The museum I'm working at is very small, but very old.  It's filled with ship models and old mariner's journals.  I personally get really seasick, so it's sort of a joke that I got this job.  But I love it, the people are great, and I've been here about four weeks.  

The building is mostly stone and masonry, which gives it a weird echo that makes some of the guests think it's haunted.  There is music that plays on the second floor, and in one of the rooms on the ground floor, if you're standing in the right place, you hear that music like it's right next to you.  We use it to freak out the kids who come in here, and to teach them about acoustics.

The second week I was here was the first time I was ever alone closing up, and the first time anything happened.  The first thing I always do for close is turn off all the lights but the ones in the gift shop, to save on electrical costs.  It doesn't actually make much difference with them off, as the building was designed to let in as much light as possible.  There's always a routine to it, too.  Turn off all the lights on the first floor, then the basement, then the second floor and turning off the music.  One room is always the last, the Jacob Library.  It's dedicated to some famous local author who's books I've never read.  It's the room directly above the gift shop, to give you an idea of the layout.

I sucked at counting out the register.  It's simple as hell, but for some reason I never get the pennies right.  Halfway through my fourth count through, the music upstairs started back up loud enough to make me jump and drop all of the change.  It was quickly followed by a loud crash that sounded like part of the building caving in on the second floor.  I didn't think I was that scared, but when I went to pick up the pennies I saw my hands were shaking. I finished up, took a deep breath and concluded one of the huge bookcases must have fallen over.  I locked up the money and made my way upstairs.

For the next few minutes, I looked around the second floor and attic.  There was nothing.  Everything was in place, nothing had fallen over, and there was no reason for the CD player to come back on.  I noped out of there pretty hard after that, and asked a coworker if she would stay with me after so we could go through the archives together.  But honestly, I just didn't want to be alone in the place.

Last night, my fiance started his new job, working nights at a hardware store on the freight dock.  I was alone in our apartment, cleaning up the kitchen and listening to SciShow on Youtube.  The episode ended, and there was silence for a moment as my hands were wet and I didn't want to ruin the keyboard.  I started humming the music from the museum, before falling quiet while trying to scrub burned rice off of a pan.

It took me a few seconds to realize that the music didn't stop.  It was so quiet, I wasn't even sure where it was coming from.  Wherever it was, it seemed like it was getting louder.  I yelled up to my roommate, asking her if she had music on, but remembering she would be gone until next Sunday.  It kept getting louder, and seemed like it was originating from the living room.

I did the thing you're not supposed to do and went to see if it was the TV or the radio.  Neither were on.  It was loudest in the corner, next to the bookcase and the couch.  That's when I saw it.  Tucked behind the little half dead potted plant, there was a figure, clear as day.  It looked like a shadow made three dimensional.  It looked more like a dog than a human.  The music got louder and louder.  

There was a pounding now, rhythmic, but not in time to the music.  When I turned to look at it, there was suddenly silence.

The knocking was my neighbor at the front door.  He wanted to see if I was alright.  Apparently I had been screaming for the better part of two minutes.  I told him it was a horror movie on TV, and I would turn it down.  He didn't seem convinced, but left when I pushed the subject.

When I got to the museum this morning, I opened alone for the first time.  I was still shaken, and hadn't slept, or told my fiance.  But when I opened the door, the music was on, all the lights were on, and the sinks were on.  The director closed the night before, and is a nut about saving resources.  I didn't tell him about it, because I thought he'd think I was crazy.  I feel like I'm being targeted.

I like this job, I want to keep it.  There's a lot riding on my success here  But I don't know what's going on.  I'm not sure who to ask.  I don't know where to start.

And I have to close by myself today.

[So pumped for Insidious 2! It's the only horror movie that's gotten to me, mainly because it avoided gore and isolated the viewer within the ""astral plane"" and what-not. I also noticed Night Owl from Watchmen in this new installment. It's kind of baffling after I saw the guy who played The Comedian in The Possession.  What's the scriptwriting process like for these movies? Are there visual artists and concept designers that flesh out the overall theme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal963d?context=5)|Also, unlike Hollywood movies, the director's have complete creative control and they choose the visual artists and concept designers. Some movies have them, some movies don't.
[What's Rose Byrne like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal963d?context=5)|Rose Byrne is a great actress to work with. She was on the fence about doing the sequel for a long time but Leigh's script finally got her to say yes.
[How did you get into filmmaking? How did you get your first job, did you have any contacts etc and do you have any advice for a young girl wanting to start working in film? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9bxf?context=5)|My first job was selling cable TV door to door. It was a commission only job and it was some of the best training I had to becoming a producer. My job after that was as a real estate agent in NY - also great training. The first film I produced was Noah Baumbach's ""Kicking and Screaming"" - he was my roommate in college.
 |My first job was for a company in NY called Arrow Entertainment. I met Arrow because they were going to finance ""Kicking and Screaming"" Ultimately they decided not to, but they thought I was a good salesman so they hired me.
 |I'll tell you a funny story about contacts. My family knew Steve Martin. I sent Steve Martin the script of ""Kicking and Screaming."" I did not know Steve Martin, but he read it and he called me. When he called, the phone was shaking in my hand because I was so nervous. I was 22 at the time. He said that he liked the script and he offered to invest a little bit of money in the movie. I asked if he could send me a letter saying how much he liked the script, which he very generously agreed to do. I ripped the cover page of the script off, put the letter from Steve Martin on the script and I sent it to every movie company that existed. And that's how I got ""Kicking and Screaming"" financed.
 |My advice to you, is not to wait for others but to go out and make shorts as cheaply as you possibly can and keep making films. Do not wait for other people to help you, but go out and make stuff yourself. And of course do stories that can be told inexpensively, ideally set in your own home or front yard.
[Why do you mainly produce horror films? Huge Insidious fan btw; I've seen it a good 9 times and the scene where the Dracula-looking demon is in the window of the baby's room scares me every time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9jia?context=5)|I love all kinds of movies, including horror movies. But one of the reasons I mainly produce horror now is that I really enjoy making low-budget movies with total creative freedom and having a big audience watch them. It's harder to make an action movie or a period drama really inexpensively. And if you make the movies more expensively you necessarily give up a lot of creative control.
 |That scene scares the hell out of me too. 
[Is the ""red face demon"" back in Insidious 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal93mm?context=5)|Without giving too much away, all of us fell in love with the red faced demon and we went about making the sequel to answer a lot of the questions posed in the first movie. I wish we had done this more in the early Paranormal Activity movies so we did it a LOT in Insidious Chapter 2. There is a ton of crossover between Insidious and Insidious 2 - think Back to the Future 2.
[I feel that I can really connect with your movies, especially paranormal activity and insidious due to the spiritual/demonic type of horror. It seems to me this is THE most scary type of movie, because you really have no control over those realms as a human.  What type of horror, in your opinion, makes the scariest type of movie? Do you ever feel that in the hacker/slasher type movies you could just fight back, and that takes away from the terror?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cala3pv?context=5)|I think that if you care about the characters and what happens to them, everything is inherently scarier. Again, we try really hard to make sure our movies have relatable and well developed characters. The drama is what distinguishes great scary movies.
 |The Purge is kind of a fight back type movie and I still find it terrifying.
[Hey Jason, I've been really excited for you to do this AMA and I have a lot of questions for you but I've narrowed it down to just a few so here goes nothing.  What inspired you to start making horror that was based more in social and political issues than the average slasher, haunted house story, or torture porn movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cala39c?context=5)|3.) Paranormal inspired me to start making horror movies as opposed to just enjoying them in the theater. I had spent half of my career in the independent film world and half of my career in the studio film world. And Paranormal was a perfect blend of both worlds. It was made completely independently and released by a studio. That has been the case with Insidious, Sinister and The Purge as well.
[How do you and your team option scripts and is there a sort of ""wish-list"" of directors that you have that you'd want to work with?  Do you only deal with popular writers and directors or do you ever accept unsolicited scripts that people send you in the mail? Have you ever passed on a script that soon became a popular film and, if so, how does that affect you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cala39c?context=5)|1.) We absolutely have a wish list of directors that we want to work with. Let me give you some examples of people on our list now: Juan Bayona, James McTeigue, Craig Brewer, Patty Jenkins, Jonathan Mostow.  4.) So flattered that you are interested in working with my company. We typically post our job listings online so stay tuned.   
[I've been very interested in working for Blumhouse Productions for quite some time now and if that were even remotely possible, how would I go about doing that?  Thanks again for doing this AMA. I have so many more questions but this is the stuff I need to know!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cala39c?context=5)|2.) Unfortunately, we do not accept unsolicited material. I have passed on many things that have become successful. It is always painful, but it is something I love about our business. No one is right all of the time.
[Do you believe in paranormal activity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9w2x?context=5)|Generally, as a rule I do not. But I have seen 1 ghost in my life. I was living in the basement of a storefront apartment on Crosby St. in NYC. I believe the exact address was 37. In the middle of the night at the foot of my bed a figure appeared holding someone else in his arms. Now I know everyone will think I was dreaming, but I was not. I know for certain I was not and the next day, I moved from the basement to the ground level so I never slept there again.
 |As a side not, I might also add, and this is true, we caught large rats in this apartment. It was when I was a real estate agent. Three of us shared  the apartment and my share of the rent was $300.
[What scares you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calav2j?context=5)|Earthquakes and carbs.
[Paranormal Activity made me interested. Until you named the Mom Julie in PA3 and the demon Toby.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal948u?context=5)|Sorry about the names on Paranormal Activity, we'll try to do better next time.
[Insidious made me unable to sleep and go into a cold sweat when I finally did sleep.  My question is, is Insidious Chapter 2 just as freaky as the first? I was forced to watch it three more times after my first because my brother and friends refused to watch it alone. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal948u?context=5)|I'm sad to say Insidious 2 is quite a lot scarier than the first movie. The budget was slightly higher, we had more toys to play with and when we have screened the movie audiences have said that they found the film scarier than the first.
[Do you know who the ""mater mortis"" or ""Mother of Death"" the Insidious: Chapter 2 trailer alludes to is? Who? This has been driving me crazy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal934f?context=5)|First of all, huge props for figuring that out. Someone had to point that out to me! ""Mother of Death"" answers some questions about the villain int he film. I can't say more than that right now.
[Hi :\) what is your favourite pizza topping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9cnn?context=5)|Very important question. I'm on a 5-2 diet right now that means that I'm allowed to eat pizza 5 days a week and then I fast for 2 days. Pizza happens to be one of my favorite foods and my favorite topping (which you can't get in most places) is actually pesto. And my favorite pizza is in New York on 8th Avenue and 32nd Street right by Penn Station. I also like Artichoke Pizza also in NY.
[Are you planning on producing a Purge 2 movie? I think the concept has a lot of potential for some interesting stories. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal92ko?context=5)|We are developing a sequel to The Purge. I think the first movie only touches on James DeMonaco's great, high concept idea. I think there are a lot more stories to tell in the world where the Purge exists and hopefully we'll come up with something good.
[What advice to do you give emerging producers about developing their careers? What were the major choices/victories early in your career that you feel set you on the road to becoming the producer you are today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cala3wa?context=5)|First of all, don't listen to too much advice from other people including me!
 |Find producers whose work you admire and offer to work for free or intern for them.
 |Believing in Paranormal Activity for 3 years when no one else did (except Oren). And using the success of Paranormal to continue in the model of Paranormal Activity as opposed to trying to make bigger budget films.
[Is it difficult working with children in the horror genre? Is there a specific tactic used to help separate the work from reality? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calashw?context=5)|It is always difficult working with children in film because of their limited hours. In the horror genre specifically, we always run what we are doing by the children's parents who are always with us on set. And they have the right to approve anything we do. The scares are usually done in a series of shots so that each individual shot is never frightening to the kids. Luckily in the first Insidious, Ty Simpkins spent most of the movie in a comma. However, he has a ton of great scenes in Chapter 2.
[Without any spoilers (of course\), how did you go about using the same family for the sequel? At the end of the first film, things seemed pretty doomed and pretty wrapped up. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9hly?context=5)|The sequel picks up right where the first story ends. At the end of Empire Strikes back things look pretty doomed, but they made another.
[If Insidious: Chapter 2 is successful do you think there could be a possibility for a third film? And how likely would that be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9jzc?context=5)|I really hope so. A lot would depend on, as you said, how successful the second film is and whether or not James and Leigh thought there was more to tell.
[Was the monster/demon from Insidious based on Darth Maul? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal97n6?context=5)|That's a good question. I haven't the faintest idea, but I'll ask James and Leigh.
[Were you surprised at all by the success of Paranormal Activity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9dwd?context=5)|Already answered about the success, YES, very surprised.
[Have you seen any  of the spoof or copy cat movies that have been made of it, and if so what do you think of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9dwd?context=5)|I loved the spoof Steve Martin did for the Academy Awards and I thought Haunted House was a funny movie. It's fun to be spoofed.
[Is Paranormal Activity 5 the last planned film in the franchise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9dwd?context=5)|We try no to think past the current film we are working on, but I hope not!
[Would you ever think of doing a purge 2 not based so specifically on one family and more on a city over the course of the night or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9odc?context=5)|We're open to anything right now and thinking about many different things.
[What are all the references from the blumhouse productions logo thing?  Are these classic movies, or just scary archetypes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calanko?context=5)|The latter. Aaron Becker did an amazing job designing our logo. He does the main titles for most of our movies including The Purge and he is currently working on Insidious: Chapter 2. He is brilliant. Check out his site: [Link to www.aaronbecker.tv](http://www.aaronbecker.tv)
[Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA, Mr. Blum. Big fan of your films and looking forward to checking out the Purge. My question is what is the biggest challenge with making a low budget film? And were you surprised by the enormous monetary success of Paranormal Activity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9ez3?context=5)|The biggest challenge is that you have very little time to tell the story (shooting days). I answered the Paranormal question previously, but YES. Very surprised.
[Would love to have you on an episode of my podcast to nerd out about movies, tv, etc. Can we make this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9nwr?context=5)|Direct message me and we'll figure it out.
[James and Leigh seem wild. they're my favorite filmmakers! What is it like working with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calabzt?context=5)|James and Leigh are at the top of their game. They have such crazy imaginations that sometimes you listen to them and you think ""this is bonkers"" and then they'll tie up the idea in this really coherent way and it's totally genius. For instance, in the first movie I thought the humor of Specs and Tucker worked against the scares, but then we screened the movie for an audience and what James and Leigh made me understand is that laughing and being scared work well together and one enhances the other as they are both expressions of anxiety in different ways. This is why I produce these movies rather than write or direct them.
[What's your favorite Nicolas Cage movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calaml1?context=5)|Lord of War is my favorite.
 |Also, I really loved Ethan Hawke's answer about Nicholas Cage during his AMA. See below.
 |[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fq1h6/i_am_ethan_hawke_amaa/cacojck)
[Do you have a submission process for queries for writers and/or directors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9ex5?context=5)|Unfortunately, we don't take direct submissions. Material has to be submitted through an agent or lawyer.
[What is your favorite horror film, and what was the movie that inspired you to pursue your career in filmmaking? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal96id?context=5)|Rebecca is my favorite horror film. There was no single film that inspired me to get into filmmaking, but Hitchcock is one of my favorites or maybe favorite filmmaker. I studied his films in college and they are a big inspiration to our company.
[Hey Jason, Thanks for doing this!  Question 1: Is ""the song"" in this one again? So very creepy.. Question 2: Do you have any favorite foreign horror films, directors or even sub-genres?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal9njz?context=5)|1.) The answer is... Yes. Wait, what's creepy about that song? 2.) Juan Bayona is one of my favorite foreign directors and I would love to make a movie with him. But I can't get a meeting with him!!
[Favorite morning radio show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal8ywm?context=5)|Howard Stern. Howard Stern. Howard Stern. Howard Stern. 
[Did you ever expect Paranormal Activity to be as successful as it has?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/cal97zf?context=5)|No one (except Oren) expected Paranormal Activity to be as successful as it was. It was a surprise to me, to Paramount, to our international distributors, to Katie and Micah and even to the people who own the theaters, the exhibitors. No one ever thought that there would ever be 1 sequel to Paranormal, let alone 5.
[I was wondering if you could ever develop any creepypasta's into movies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calacgp?context=5)|I think we've already done it! Insidious is James and Leigh's own creepypasta!
[Thanks for doing this AMA! I don't have any questions. Just wanted to let you know that I first watched Paranormal Activity when my wife was out of town, I had a three-story house all to myself, and it was 2am. I didn't sleep well for a few months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gl59q/i_am_jason_blum_producer_of_paranormal_activity/calb0xu?context=5)|I'm really glad to hear this. It means we're doing our job!

1gla3c,3,2013-06-18,"With no degree, and no money to continue, what can I do?",kkcreator,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gla3c/with_no_degree_and_no_money_to_continue_what_can/,"I was turned down today for a QA testing position because I didn't have a bachelors degree, and that spurred this post.

I've been in school for 5 years pursuing a bachelors in computer science in a program that emphasized java programming..  Long story short, I didn't do well enough to keep my scholarship (I believe I have a 2.8), and my parents are not signing any more loans for me.  I have two internships, and a decent reference in one of my former professors who lead one of my internships.  I got pretty burned out in school, and only recently discovered why, and it's taking some time to get over it (scars from childhood).  I work better when I do just that, work, and that's simply all I want to do.  I'd like to work in my field, so I can continue to get relevant experience, and can afford to go back to school.  I rather not have loans, since a 4-year local college is cheap.  School is complicated for me, but so far in life when I'm truly working, I feel great and motivated.

What are my options?  I don't expect a handout from any company, or equal pay or benefits or whatever, because I haven't earned any of that."
1gksoa,1,2013-06-18,Internship fail,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gksoa/internship_fail/,"To summarize:

1. Landed 'the internship' at a great tech company
2. Picked a team that worked with technologies that were completely foreign to me and difficult to learn (MapReduce)
3. Tried to make my intern project too ambitious
4. As a result, did not produce adequate results and was not asked to return


What happens now?  I've been interviewing around lately and I always stumble when they ask me ""describe what you did during your internship last summer"" or ""why aren't you working at the company you interned for right now?""


Truthfully, I know the answer to those questions are ""I fucked up by making bad decisions.  shouldn't have used X algorithm since it's fucking hard to implement and should've planned for time more carefully"" and ""they didn't ask me to come back.""


A lot of companies seem to let my resume past their screening phase simply because I worked at this company doing stuff related to this technology.  During the interviews they always emphasize it or want to talk about it.  I don't have the experience to talk about that technology in great detail.  I'm basically a noob that worked with it for 12 weeks one summer.  That internship is the best thing on my resume (no other internships, no super special projects, mediocre grades), so I don't really want to downplay it.

interview went well, I cleaned up my jquery code and was able to replace bits of jquery for css. My code ended up coming out really clean (at least that's how I felt). In the interview they seemed genuinely impressed for someone with no javascript/jquery experience prior to last week. I got multiple comments about the cleanliness of my code, which really did surprise me.

I'll here back later this week or early next week on the position, fingers crossed.

I've been studying computer engineering part-time as I have large mortgages to pay, and therefore can't do it full time. 
It's been 5 years now, and I still got one year to go, if I did it full time. 

I've been working as an intern at a fortune 500 company for 3 years, but quit this 2 years ago as I saw no progress. 

This company called me up, and told me to send my CV. I did, and we had a nice phone conversation and on Wednesday I will meet the daily manager and the director on Wednesday. 
The company focuses on servers and needs another consultant. 
I have some questions for those in the field, and for employers.

In my mind, a consultant should know his shit. I am fairly sure I got good knowledge, but still, I'm freaking out about this. What do you think? Am I justified in thinking like this? 

Follow up question: What will my job be? It says ""Focus on Microsoft server for companies"" 
-Virtual server
-Terminal server
-Active directory 
-MS exchange 
Will i benefit on knowing these subjects thoroughly, or is it better to just be honest and say that my interest is high, but I don't know enough. On their website it says they get all their employees the appropriate courses. I want training, but I know many companies want people that don't need this. And from what I think about consultants (they should know their shit, well), I think I should know at least 2 of the focus points very well before I meet on Wednesday. 

What do you think? 

On the phone he also said they want to make sure I finish my degree. I really want a full time job, and study on my own time, one course at a time. Experience, for me, is worth more than my education. (which I can finish anyways, at a slow pace). I'm afraid that they will say they want me as an intern and then fuck me over, pay-wise. I want a full time job, but I don't want to come off as an ass. How can I give the message, without sounding like an uneducated idiot? "

The only problem is that when I got this job I was very excited because they pay well ($17 an hour), so I got a six month apartment lease. I'm somewhere in the middle. This job is sucking the soul out of me, and I only have a few options, but I'm not sure what's best.

1. See if my mom would let me move back in with her and finish school (I only need one more year for my Associates in Information and Technology), then try to get a better job with that. Break my lease (80% of one month's rent would be charged) and job, and focus on school 100% for this year.

2. Try to move to the state I want to move to ASAP. I want to move to a state that is 12 hours away. I have a bit of tech experience, not much, but I have an IT certificate along with an internship that might land me a decent job, maybe data entry or a call center. I would stay at my current job, saving money, until they either fire me or I find a job in this other state, then pick up my stuff and move. Hopefully I will have more savings by then. Right now, all I have is $2,400 saved. This would require me not to go to school, because this job is so stressful, that I can't even focus on school when I'm working here. I tried it last semester and I was sore all week, skipping classes to sleep in because I was so exhausted, etc.

3. Quit my job immediately, take the $2,400, find a cheap apartment up there, buy a month or two in advance (or get a low-paying job and find a roommate), and find a job ASAP. Then try to finish my Associates at the new location, if my credits transfer.

I'm desperate, this job is killing me, but I'm not sure what to do. And please don't say, ""We can't say, it's your life..."" I'm genuinely asking for some direction here. Thanks for any guidance."
1gjvqy,1,2013-06-17,I am super scared... please advise (negotiating),thoraways318,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gjvqy/i_am_super_scared_please_advise_negotiating/,"Hi /r/jobs,

So I finally got a job offer from one of my most desired companies. I am super pumped, but worried I have screwed myself.

When discussing the job the salary range that I mentioned (at least 3 times) was around $50k. Every time I mentioned it to them they said it was fine.

The offer came in at $45k, which is actually less than I make now. I called the recruiter who I am working with and explained mathematically why I am hoping they can come up a little bit. He said that they had over 150 applications for the job, so if I negotiate they might just decide to move on. However, he also said to put my logic down in email and send it to him, which I did. 

Have I screwed myself over? Should I just take the offer? Do companies really take offers back when people try to negotiate?  This is an ""entry level job"" but I wanted to at least try to negotiate, and I have over a year in my current full time position and three years of internship experience, so I do bring talent to the table.

Thank you for your input!! "

[###""Ability to reconnect after dropping in a MP game. This is by far my single BIGGEST issue I have with COH2 (and historically coh1\), Massive issue when I playing with friends"". Making it limited to only if you had been in the game previously and that are already on your steam friends list. I'm not looking to join a game in progress or anything like that. Just the ability to rejoin after dropping for some reason.  COH2 feature request. Some sort of in game diagnosis/behind the scene checks that let users know if they will get the ""so and so is lagging"" due to ports not opened/forwarded correctly. ie. a little icon next to names in the game lobby etc.  World builder like coh 1 will there be modding support?  POV record/replay option?  Will there be more factions that just russian / german? finish? etc?  Will coh1 lobby be fixed for the new steam version? (leaderboards etc?\)  Units seem to not fire/respond to enemy attacks while on the move. Bug or by design?  Any plans for different AT gun types? airburst? switchable AP/HEAT rounds etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam8q6s?context=5)|We'll have Steam leadboards to start with, maybe more later.  We answered this a few times, there will be mod support as there was for the original game.  There's replay options, but the addition of Twitch.tv into the game is the first step we're making towards letting people watch, share and analyze games played much better than they could in the original game.  We've had a few replies on this topic.  It's Soviet and German at launch. As with the original game more factions may arrive later.  Not sure.  Some units can't fire while moving by design, check the unit description to make sure that they're not the ones you're seeing on it.  Anything that saw combat during the war is open to us adding it in.  We'll see some new units, maybe AT gun types.  Glad you liked the original game, and it's great to hear you're still playing it!
[Will ""spectator/observer"" mode be implemented for CoH2? - How many DLCs will be delivered for CoH2? Is there an estimated value for the amount of DLCs\)? - Are there any plans to improve the replays system such as rewind, quick jump to the end of the middle of the replay? - Will map editors be available? we are asking for the possibility of making some awesome e-sports focused maps. Please, tell us we will be able to make some maps. - Any plans to improve the UI (that mid-bottom line doesn't show any unit information, and it is a shame not to know the current damage or fire rate of my unit\). - Will ladderboard be implemented?  - That ""sync error"" thing that came back from CoH1, will it be fixed? - We already have the ""Control+A"" command to ping the map, but will we have any defensive commands like ""Ctrl+D"" to defend, ""Ctrl+S"" to scout, or ""Ctrl+C"" take control of that area?  - will we be able to veto any map in automatch or will we be forced to play every possible map? - Will Steam workshop be implemented? - Regarding the DLCs, are there any plans to include more historically coherent units like King Tiger, Fallschirmjäger, 88mm AA guns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5qeg?context=5)|We've integrated Twitch.tv as a starting point and will look to improve and add more ways for people to watch and share their love of CoH 2. - We don't have a hard limit, but have lots of great ideas! - This is technically very challenging for our system, but these are all ideas that we've discussed and hope to do at some point. - A map editor will be available some time post-launch. - Our UI team has been working with the community during the Open Beta and collecting feedback. We're always looking at ways to improve the game. - The first version of our leaderboards will be available through Steam. - We fix them where we find them. When you see a sync-error it means that data is mismatched between the two computers playing the game and which SOMETIMES implies cheating. - This is something that we're evaluating. Keep your eyes peeled! - Map Veto is part of our ongoing feature support.  So yes, we'll be adding it as soon as possible. - We'd love to add Steam Workshop, no set date on this though. - Regarding DLC we've got all of WW II to draw from.
[Any chance you'd be able to tell of any plans, even if they're ideas of DLC for COH2? I know it's early, but I'm spoiled. I'd love to see the Finns, Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and/or Italians be added later on as a new playable faction. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam59fe?context=5)|We do have ideas for DLC and expanding the game.  We can't share what those plans are yet, but if you look at how we expanded the original game you might get some ideas of the scope of what we're planning.
 |Also the Commanders give us a lot of flexibility in adding new content.

[I came here to ask this very question, not sure about the response =/ ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camehbo?context=5)|Sorry, we can't talk about unannounced games and we certainly can't talk about other studios' unannounced games.
 |But a Creative Assembly DoW game would be pretty awesome.
[I know I was scared the whole time! Viva SEGA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam59sx?context=5)|And yes, Viva SEGA!

[Huge fan of Homeworld here, could you tell about the process of choosing names for people, places, etc? Do you hire a linguist, or just have brainstorming sessions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6gia?context=5)|I don't remember where half the names came from.
 |There were some reference that were gathered, and a middle eastern feel to go with the desert environment.  It was a long time ago, I don't really remember.
 |QD.
 |I played Homeworld.  It's great.  No idea how it was made.
 |JS.
[How happy are you with the current balance of CoH2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5ewv?context=5)|Pretty happy currently. The metrics look good, but there is still work to do. We have to dig in and get more details from our stats. But we're going to keep working at it.
 |QD.
 |I think we've answered this, or a variation.  But yes we're happy with it.
 |However as with the original game we'll continue to adjust the balance on an ongoing basis for the life of the game.
 |JS.
[What type of metrics and stats do devs look at when dealing with balance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam8ag7?context=5)|We look at win/loss ratios for each faction in every different game mode and on every different map.
 |We also look at the feedback we're getting.  If it's split 50/50 between saying Germans or Soviets are OP then we know we're onto something.

[How excited are you releasing CoH 2 on Tuesday?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam59m7?context=5)|Everyone's very excited.  Company of Heroes 2 went through some pretty big events during development so it's nice to finally be near the finishing line.
 |However I think mostly everyone's just focused on finishing the final touches up and getting the game ready for launch.  We don't get to sit back and drink for awhile yet.
 |JS.
 |Very!
 |QD.
[What were the big events during development or is it classified info? :\)  Btw I love the new maps you released today and i'm waiting for starting Operation Barbossa! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5wtp?context=5)|For us the big events are always around press events and things like E3 and that's where we invest time in polish and quality.  The game makes a big leap forward and all of a sudden you know what you're doing, you know what you're building.
[Something I miss a lot from older games was the ability to create your own maps. Will this feature be available with Company of Heroes 2? If so will it be via an ingame option or similar to Steam Workshop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6op5?context=5)|We've covered this, but we do want to work with Steam Workshop.  No announcement yet.
[Your life story as a One-Liner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5mce?context=5)|Should have stayed in school. - QD.

[Can we expect to see the see the Pacific anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5zhd?context=5)|We're trying to convince SEGA to approve a team trip to Hawaii for research but they haven't given us the green light yet!  It'll be warmer than Russia!
[What is the most challenging aspect of creating RTS games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6p8c?context=5)|RTS games are complex and take a lot of iteration.  There's thousands of moving parts. Creatively speaking its trying to inject the right type of tone and story telling.  Post-ship there's this living breathing eco-system to keep tabs on and figure out what levers to pull to keep the game interesting and competitive. - QD  I can only compare it to working elsewhere on sports games. The easy thing about sports games is that everyone knows what you're talking about. My mom knows that I got to do something with sports league X and people she's heard of.  My dad can (sort of) play the game.  RTS is niche and it's a great and passionate fanbase but my dad's never going to give me a good game at CoH.
[Next time I visit, will I be asked to fix the build server again?  (PS: Miss you guys!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6f5o?context=5)|That's a standard part of the Relic studio tour.
 |JS.
 |You should have made it better.
 |QD.
[Very big fan of the games and COH continues to be my go to RTS. Today we get stuck with regurgitated sequels that update graphics and storyline and not much else in a lot of other games. What sort of mechanics are being introduced to COH2 that make it more of its own game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam72kh?context=5)|There's been dozens of changes in all areas including gameplay.  We've introduced True Sight which is a feels completely natural as part of CoH 2's gameplay.  Even little things like infantry vaulting small objects, which adds a lot of tactical variety and the environments having a bigger impact on the way the game is played.
[If I get collectors edition what is the difference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5ang?context=5)|The Collector's edition has a bunch of extra content that I'll post below.  If you've already pre-ordered a regular edition however you can always upgrade after launch.
 |24 Vehicle Skins Exclusive Collector Faceplate.
 |Collector’s Edition Faceplate with Integrated Badge Commander Archetypes.
 |Soviet Commanders Anti-Infantry Tactics Conscript Support Tactics Terror Tactics German Commanders Joint Operations Doctrine Spearhead Doctrine Commander Pass.
 |Access to Five Commander Archetype’s Available Post-Launch Theater of War Mini Pack.
 |Post Launch Content Bundle Company of Heroes Complete Pack.
 |The Award Winning Game Collection that Started it All.
[1\) Have you considered making a Company Of Heroes game set in the Pacific Theatre? 2\) During development, were there any points where CoH 2 was completely different from what's about to be released? 3\) Has Relic considered putting in weapons/vehicles/tanks that only existed in blueprints like the German E-series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6glx?context=5)|1) No, not really.  Islands are a challenge. Ship based stuff is a challenge, so it's rarely come up as a next step for the franchise. 2) Early we really pushed some crazy ideas completely re-imagining the economy and tech trees but it didn't feel like CoH. 3) No. We'll put almost anything in, but we really want it to have seen combat even if it was a rare vehicle.
 |QD.
[Can you give us an update about the status of the Warhammer 40k license? You don't need to confirm that you're working on DoW3 but is it even a possibility if we know that Slitherine is already working on a 40k strategy game of their own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5qw1?context=5)|We can't really talk about anything we may or may not be doing.
 |We love GW and the 40K-verse, and have a good relationship with them. We're still working with them to support our DoW and Space Marine games.
 |JS.
[Looks like some Soviet commanders have identical abilities (Shock Troops and Guards for example\). Why did you decide to do this? There were no identical abilities in CoH1 - all doctrines were different and had different options.  Will we see some new special Soviet abilities and German call-in units (infantry especially\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam60yw?context=5)|It allows us to do way more Commander Trees, and provide Trees with different flavours.  It also allows them to be flexible for expansion with new content.
 |QD.
[Are you guys ever going to make a sequel to Space Marine?  I absolutely loved the first one and felt it captured the setting excellently.  Anything Imperial Guard related would be fine too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam66nr?context=5)|I loved the first one too, I worked on it!  I was the last Relic employee working on it!  I'm still working on it!
 |We can't talk about anything that's not announced.
 |Having said that as a studio we're focusing on PC strategy games right now.  So while I'd love a continuation of Titus' story, we may have to wait.
 |JS.
[Space Marine was game of the year for me, I really loved it, you absolutely nailed the feeling of being in a giant suit of armour. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cambe3z?context=5)|It was a really fun game. I don't think any game captures that sense of raw power as well.  Going through a horde of Orks really felt like it should, like you were an OP unit and a goddamn Space Marine.
 |JS.
[Are you monitoring the forums companyofheroes.com as previously sega? - My big request, you have you considered this:   Star the camera positioned correctly (HQ own in south, enemy north\)   or customized?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6jgi?context=5)|I'm on the forums every day.  Way too much.  Even at home.  My wife says I am ignoring her.  Can you tell her it's important, she doesn't believe me. - JS.
 |Yes we had that option in for awhile.  It wasn't completed, and we'll look at it again. - QD.
[You don't have to answer all questions of course, but we'd love if you atleast answered one of them!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5gi1?context=5)|It's an interesting take on the game. We always love to see people taking the time to craft a different experience than the one we've delivered.
[Will there be any other playable factions/nations other than Wehrmacht/Soviet?  What will the multiplayer game customization look like? Will there be an ""unlimited popcap"" option when you're setting up a game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5gi1?context=5)|At launch we're introducing the German and Soviet factions. If you look at our history with the original CoH there's a pattern there that is likely to be repeated with new content coming.
[My question has to do with how you will support CoH2 post-launch. The original was amazing, but it was marred by the very slow patch cycle. It took a long time to fix big issues, and fixes came in such huge batches that you got massive pendulum changes and overcorrections. Under SEGA and with steam support, will you be able to maintain a more frequent patch schedule to better keep game balance in check?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camcboe?context=5)|JS.
[Is CoH2 going to come to mac? Will the first one come to steam for mac?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6wrf?context=5)|Nothing to announce, but as a Mac owner I'd love to see it.  I'm digging playing the first one on my Macbook.
 |Nothing to announce.  Not sure.  We didn't handle the port, so that's not all to do with us.
 |JS.
[One question comes to mind however, what is your official stance on modding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5gtv?context=5)|Adding Twitch.tv was a big step forward for us in expanding the ways people can view content together, and in enabling the community to share their experiences with the game.
[Is it something that you all at Relic have spoken about before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5gtv?context=5)|That being said we're interested in building out the toolset that our fans have in being able to promote their clans, learn new tactics and share their love of CoH 2.
[Also, speaking of Company of Heroes 2 specifically, will there be a theater mode added later on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5gtv?context=5)|GW.
[Is the process for getting community made maps into the game, and into the automatch queue, going to be any different than Company of Heroes 1? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6tkg?context=5)|We don't know yet.  We're still working that out, but hopefully it'll be easier.
 |QD.
[How's the relationship between your new publisher?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5bwz?context=5)|We've answered about SEGA elsewhere.  Short answer it's great!
[Why did you guys not go for a new engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5bwz?context=5)|We did iterate on the proprietary Essence Engine technology to make CoH2 the game it is today.  There's a lot happening below the surface (simulation) that combined with other systems is Relic's ""secret sauce"" and the essence of our games.
[The one in Company of Heroes 2 was used for the original and Dawn of War 2 right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5bwz?context=5)|GW.
[Hey Relic! You guys make amazing games, long may you continue! Also want to give a shout out to the sound design on all your games! The unit chatter, the music, the sound effects - you guys have had it nailed all the way from Homeworld 1.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam8zgu?context=5)|Having said that we wouldn't rule out doing another war in the future.
[Why is the Tiger tank available so late in-game for German players? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5dd0?context=5)|Motivation. :)

[Are you going to change the graphics for the base buildings? I think the structures in COH looked cooler, if less... realistic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5rq0?context=5)|The intent was to do front line buildings and to reduce the footprint of the buildings themselves. This allows more flexibility in map layout and gives the game more of an Eastern Front tone.
 |QD.
[Hey Relic, I'm a huge fan of your WH40k rts games (DoW2 was my favorite, love tactical squad action and Space Marines made me feel so powerful\) and I would like to say thank you for doing the brand justice (imo\).  I look forward to seeing more WH40k content from Relic!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5kzh?context=5)|No.  The team kept working on CoH2 through the auction. So the core of the game team remained untouched. The changes that did happen were with associated teams like changing marketing and QA teams and customer service and localization services. - JS.
[Question: Did THQ's disassembly halt the development process of CoH2? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5kzh?context=5)| 
[I have a question about performance. A lot of players have reported performance issues since around the beginning of open beta. Is this something you are looking into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6s1k?context=5)|We're constantly looking at improving performance.  We get metrics on what PCs people are using to play the game and are doing our best to optimize for those.
[Heya guys!  I've been a huge Relic fan since the very early days.  Looking forward to playing CoH2!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam7kxl?context=5)|There is only a Soviet campaign in the game.
[My question is in regards to the singleplayer Campaign.  Are there separate campaigns for Germany and Russia, or are they combined into a kind of super-campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam7kxl?context=5)|JS.
[Are you planning or at least have thoughts of releasing coh2 on a console? The UI in the beta felt very console-ish to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam7a36?context=5)|No.  We're focused on the PC.
 |While there's been some interesting RTS games on the console, I don't think any of them really had a control scheme that felt as natural and perfect as the PC's keyboard and mouse.

[What is the internal pressure you have both on yourselves and from publishers to make CoH 2 as big, if not a bigger, success than the original? It was my first RTS that I learned mastery over and I thank you ever so much for your kick ass games.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6ivg?context=5)|Thanks! We're glad you think our games kick ass.
 |The only pressure we have is to make the game the best we can. I don't think there's ever been a stated goal to outsell the original. It's more a creative challenge.
 |QD.
[Why did Relic stop supporting COHO?   Did Relic begin working on COH2 around this time? If not when did COH2 development officially start? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camde22?context=5)|THQ didn't want to be investing a lot of money in a new type of game (free-to-play) so CoHO for them wasn't what they wanted to be doing.  They closed a few f2p games at that time including a WWF one.  I don't have exact dates, but CoHO closing opened up the team to really focus on CoH 2.  A lot of the CoH 2 team are from the CoHO team.
[Cloud computing is the next big frontier in game development. In your opinion, do you see this as a problem or a benefit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam56nl?context=5)|Our servers are hosted in the cloud, it gives us the flexibility to scale based on need.  In the past this would require buying new hardware, configure it and get it going.  Now if we need to we can expand our server cluster all through the cloud.
 |GW.
[Google Compute Engine? &lt;/totally not shilling for his current employer&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam76or?context=5)|It may be a competitor.
 |JS.
[Are you going to make Soviet and German infantry DLC skins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5ios?context=5)|Skinning of infantry is particularly challenging due to the importance of unit recognition from a distance. Changing the colours of units can make them hard to see at a distance from 100 feet above.
 |We might have new units, but we're not looking at skins for infantry right now.
 |GW.
[Do you guys think you could add more options to the replay? Everytime after a game I love reviewing my strategies and I'd like the option of going back to a certain point not just have the thing play forward only.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6bd9?context=5)|It's technically very challenging, but it's something that we'd hope to do in the future.
 |The addition of Twitch.tv will give players another avenue to share their games with others, and better view other people's games.
 |JS.
[How long is the single-player portion/campaign of CoH2? And why is the graphics seems so sub-par? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6tbd?context=5)|It's about the same length as the original, though length will vary depending on player.
 |We've been updating graphics for the last few weeks. Maybe try adjusting your settings?
 |QD.
[What was your main goal for Company of Heroes 2? I played the beta and loved it and did notice some changes, personally all for better reason.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5qpt?context=5)|We started the original more than a decade ago.  We shipped it more than seven years ago.  We wanted a strong update in keeping with the feeling of CoH.
 |We re-imagined the creative vision for the game.  This one was to let the player experience the ""ruthless truth of war"" and tell the darker story of the Eastern Front where 13 of the 15 bloodiest battles in the 20th century were fought.  (The other two were in WWI).
 |GW, QD.
[ of all may I say you have done a pretty good job of laying the core foundations down to a very good game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5goc?context=5)|We ran a community survey in the Open Beta to collect people's views on AI strength, and will be acting on that.
[However, I have been playing multiple online games with people vs the AI. Can you explain how in some games a standard AI is too easy, and then in the next, is almost near impossible to beat? Even on Easy sometimes this happens and I imagine it could be rather daunting for newcomers to the series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5goc?context=5)|We've invested a significant amount of effort in improving the AI to make it more dynamic so that its more fun to play against it time and time again. This introduces new tactics to it, and gives it more variation which may be what you're seeing.
[Also, I was somewhat disappointed in the limited number of units - only because this is meant to be the next step in the series, and with complete honesty, it feels like a slight upgrade to CoH 1, with better effects and gameplay (without the expansions\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam5goc?context=5)|GW.
[With CoH2 almost out, do you already have something new on the table (even if you can't talk about it!\) or are you largely going to concentrate on supporting CoH2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6hvy?context=5)|We can't talk about unannounced games.
 |The team coming off of CoH 2 will continue to support CoH 2 and we've got a lot of stuff in the works for that.
 |Frankly I'm happy about it.
 |QD.
[Are you still working on Dawn of War III? Some of the early press releases (mosly regarding army customization\) made me very excited to see this game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6pfj?context=5)|Whatever may have been announced previously under a previous publisher isn't necessarily what we're working on now.
 |As we said we can't talk about games that aren't announced.
 |JS.
[With the COH2 release date drawing near when can we expect to hear about another Dawn Of War game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam8qxm?context=5)|We can't really talk about unannounced games.
[What are the chances of a Space Marine sequel somewhere down the line?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam8qxm?context=5)|For Space Marine it was a great game, I still love it.  However we're focused on PC strategy games for now and thus that one isn't going to happen in the foreseeable future.
[Myself and two friends were avid fans of Company of Heroes: Online (despite its flaws\) and we were sad to see it go. We were even sadder to hear about Brian Wood. If you can elaborate, how much of an impact did this have to cancel CoH:O?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camscg2?context=5)|Brian was a great guy and everyone loved him.  He was a big part of this studio, and CoHO.  He still is a big part of the studio, we have an internship named after him and most people here still remember working with him.
[On a less maudlin note, can you hint at any plans for the next IP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camscg2?context=5)|However his death had nothing to do with the cancellation of CoHO.  It would have happened regardless.
[Is the King Tiger in Company of Heroes 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6ai5?context=5)|Not yet.
 |QD.
[Are there any short term plans for introducing support for eSports into CoH2, such as leaderboards or in-game advertising for tournaments and community events?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6v7h?context=5)|To start with we'll be using Steam leaderboards - Nothing on in-game advertising - We do work with different groups for community events and tournaments. CoH2.org and GameReplays have been sites we've worked with to host things like Sunday Night Fights and we'll be doing more of that in the future.
[Any plans to bring COH2 to Mac?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camhuvh?context=5)|Nothing announced.  The original game did come to the Mac, so anything is possible.
 |JS.
[How does it feel getting paid to reddit now that your comrades left, Noun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam9kde?context=5)|It feels good.  It feels like DONUTS!
 |JS.
[I should really import a box of Tim Horton's and go through the backlog of C-Mart's Donemail I've been saving up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/caman1z?context=5)|I've got a one year gap of his emails I need to find and collect and then read.
 |JS.
[I thought Relic went out of business and sega purchased COH2 and finished it for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camc7j1?context=5)|THQ which was our publisher went out of business.  We as a studio were purchased by SEGA.
 |JS.
[Ohhh that makes more sense  :\)   Hows working for sega?  identical? or have there been some unwelcome changes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/camcixk?context=5)|It's really great.  They really understand the PC gaming market and have been fantastic in their support for us as a studio.
 |JS.
[Any future plans for the Space Marine franchise? That game is one of my absolute favourites this generation. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cammtns?context=5)|Not at the moment.  We're currently focusing on PC strategy games, rather than console action games.  But we love the game and one day would love to return to the story of Captain Titus.
 |JS.
[What video games do you personally enjoy? Anything you're playing now that you like? Anything you're looking forward to in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam7day?context=5)|The other two stepped out ATM.
 |I enjoy a lot of different games.  I'm currently playing Animal Crossing: A New Leaf and the Marvel Heroes MMO.  I'm also plugging through the new Tomb Raider in half an hour chunks.
 |I think the new Deadpool game could be fun, the marketing has been hilarious. I've not actually seen any gameplay footage so I've not pre-ordered it.  Lego Marvel looks enjoyable as does the new game in the Batman Arkham series.
 |JS.
[Hey Relic, I was super excited to see you guys got picked up from the ashes of THQ. You guys make phenomenal games and are really the only people to capture the feel of 40K, which I love. I know you won't answer questions about Dawn 3, but can you maybe talk about how you approach 40K and translate the mood and nuances so well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam9bxo?context=5)|Greg and Quinn both left, and I'm not actually sure either of them have worked on a GW game. I worked on both DoW II: Retribution and Space Marine.
 |We work really closely with Games Workshop who know the universe better than anyone.  They're really deeply involved with the development of the games right through to how they're marketed.
 |""Many of the folks that worked on the DOW games were already Warhammer 40K players and fans. When we write stories or create art, we get to ask the question, ""What would a 40K fan want from this game? What would be exciting? What would feel authentic vs. fake?"" It's one of the ways we evaluate what goes into the game; we know authenticity is a priority for people who truly love this universe.""
 |JS with assist from Daniel Kading.
[Are you planing to change the uniforms of either the Relief Infantry or the Grenadiers? (Saw someone in /r/CompanyOfHeroes talking about it being annoying that the relief infantry saw more germanlike or whatever\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6w0a?context=5)|The game's been localized in a number of languages, including Russian and German. We've been discussing options.
[Also: Are the any plans on adding ""true"" german and russian to the voices of the soldiers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6w0a?context=5)|QD.
[How many people worked on this game? And if it is also possible could you tell us what was the proportion of Designers, Arts and Programmers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocta/we_are_relic_entertainment_and_weve_made_company/cam6upe?context=5)|We got up to about 70 (in-studio) at the peak.  Designers are usually around 13 or 14.
 |There's also external groups like QA that we're not sure how many people may have worked with us.
 |The credits list is pretty big though!

[Thanks for doing this AMA... what are your thoughts on people like Manning and Snowden taking it upon themselves to get the word out the US government is acting shady?  Also, if you could have your say as to how national security policy is orchestrated, how would you go about doing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5df5?context=5)|I think that Bradley Manning is a person of conscience. He has been smeared in a despicable way in the media and portrayed as a scared degenerate. If you listen to the leaked audio of his testimony from several weeks ago, you will hear a calm, principled man who understood what he was doing and why he was doing it. Because of the publication of the Wikileaks cables, we gained great insight into the covert and overt actions of the US government. Ultimately, I believe it was an act of conscience that motivated him. The significance of the Snowden leaks is already manifesting itself. We are living in a hyper-secret society where those in power--Democrats and Republicans--put a premium on withholding information from the broader public. This has to be confronted. When the state is acting against the interests of its own people, it is the responsibility of those with access to the truth to speak up. And it is the role of journalists in a democratic society to provide the public with information that is not just the official party line. Snowden and Manning are both indicative of how out of control the government has become.
[Jeremy, since you’re a real journalist who doesn’t bow down to power, have you ever been intimidated or threatened by the government (or anyone else\) for your reporting?  P.S. That beard is **SEXY**. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam58u8?context=5)|I always cringe when I'm asked this question. I know a lot of journalists around the world who take serious risks everyday. They are in Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Colombia and elsewhere. Record numbers of journalists have been killed in recent years and most of their deaths go unreported in the US media because they aren't ""famous,"" or because they aren't Americans. I think all of us who do this kind of reporting meet challenges--at times serious--from various forces. I try to keep focused on my work and not let any assholes get to me. As for my beard... maybe I should give it a twitter account ;)
[What's your process for working on a big investigative story? Do you have a series of steps you take? Any good tips for journalists just starting out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5ftu?context=5)|I think it is really important to do a tremendous amount of research before going to any country to report. I often will write the equivalent of a thesis-type document about what I know before going somewhere new. You also need to review security issues and talk to as many reporters who cover the area as possible before going. As for advice, I think internships are fine, but my advice would be to get any job you can, save up money for several months or a year--enough to live on for 3 months in whatever country you are interested in covering--and then take yourself seriously as a journalist even if you don't have an assignment. Give yourself an assignment and develop a discipline of filing stories--even if it is just to your friends and family at first. Nothing can replace hands-on experience in the field. Many of the best journos I know never took a J-school class. They decided to do it.
[I've often seen apologists for the current approach to military/foreign policy say ""If we don't use the drones to eliminate our enemies, what would you replace it with? More soldiers in harms way or manned planes that can be shot down?""  More simply: How do you respond to the ""There Is No Alternative"" argument to our current use of drone warfare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5p9p?context=5)|My alternative is to stop engaging in actions that create more new enemies. It's an idiotic false choice between ground troops and drones. 
[What are your views on the recent PRISM scandal?  Do you take measures to secure your privacy/anonymity online?  With the ongoing war on journalism (whistleblowers, drugs, terror, &lt;insert some other bullshit here&gt;\) by the US administration, do you see a positive way forward for democracy (a real *Change* we can believe in, not the bullshit Obama-kind\), or is the system so entrenched with corruption that nothing short of a revolution would fix it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5ipa?context=5)|After my computer was breached a few years ago, I radically changed my online behavior. Obviously, I use encryption and OTR. A lot of sources now want batteries removed from cell phones when we meet and some won't engage in any electronic communications at all anymore--about sensitive issues. It is almost like we have to be Luddites to have something resembling private comms.
[I haven't read the book yet, or seen the movie(it's opening here later this week\), so I was wondering how you got into Pakistan, Somalia and the other countries you visited in making ""Dirty Wars.""  Did any of the governments, such as they are, give you major problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5blt?context=5)|I was banned from Pakistan, so I wasn't able to travel there for the film or book. My understanding was that my reporting on Blackwater was not popular with the government in Islamabad. As for Somalia, we spent months preparing for that trip, working out the logistics and security. I give great credit to my Somali colleagues for their incredible planning. In every country you travel to for this kind of work, you need to study the situation before you go. Sometimes it makes sense to travel with a bunch of armed guys. In others, it is better to try to roll light and not draw attention. Everything is a negotiation.
[Hi Jeremy, Long time fan of all your work. How much of a priority do you think apprehending Edward Snowden is for the United States? I have a tough time wrapping my head around the fact that Snowden has done two interviews with a English paper since he fled, and the most advanced intelligence agency in the history of the world can not find him. Is it possible that the United States doesn't see Snowden as any sort of real threat to national security, and that may be why they haven't apprehended him yet? Or is he just Jason Bourne? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5ieq?context=5)|I believe the US government will aggressively pursue him. I think it is a serious priority to capture him.
[How much has changed with Blackwater / Xe operationally since Obama's election? Is the company substantially different now, or are things still pretty much as they were during the Bush years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5s8j?context=5)|Blackwater is now called Academi. The company still works with the US military, State Dept and CIA under Obama, as do many other private security firms. Erik Prince has been living in the UAE for a few years and remains involved in the mercenary business in Africa and elsewhere.
[What did you think of Obama's national security speech last month? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5py0?context=5)|I think that President Obama was trying to have it both ways. He tried to sound like he is bringing the kill program under control and said that he feels bad about the killing of civilians. But, at the end of the day, his speech was a forceful defense of American exceptionalism and a rather bold declaration that the US will take military action--wherever, whenever--if it is deemed to be in the US interest. His administration is currently building the infrastructure for the kill program to continue in perpetuity. And liberals are going to be on really shaky ground next time a Republican is in office when they try to criticize the same policies. There's no such thing as Republican or Democratic cruise missiles.
[Do you believe that the navy seals actually killed obl in abbotabad, etc? if so, why? does it bother that you that the public never saw a body or any photos and the story is a dumping at sea? wasn't the timing of it all too perfect for obama to get re-elected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5n4s?context=5)|Yes, I believe that the SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. To me, the issue is whether there was ever a capture order. 
[Huge fan of Bill Maher and his show, I thought you made an excellent guest the two times I saw you on Real Time.  What is he like behind the scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5fp5?context=5)|Bill is actually a really nice guy in person. One little nugget: the Real Time set is also the set of The Price is Right. So, I've played some Plinko after hours...
[Which U.S. member of congress comes closest to representing your political views?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5jvc?context=5)|There isn't any one member of Congress that speaks for me. On certain issues, I agree with certain members. But I am not a Democrat or Republican. 
[Hey Jeremy--your book seems to suggest that Chalmers Johnson was right in the sense of a military coup (though discreet\) in the executive branch. With the cohesion of CIA/DOD, a completely dysfunctional legislative branch, and a f*cked up media--how do you see the military-industrial-congressional complex functioning in the future?  Also, who's the hottie on rebelreports.com now? ; \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5kmm?context=5)|We are living in a hyper-secret, radically-outsourced society. Some 70% of the US intel budget is spent on private contractors. There were more contractors than soldiers in Iraq during the war. The state's monopoly on the use of mass, organized violence is now spread across for-profit corporations. i think we will increasingly see corporations with access to their own armed units to defend their interests.
[Who is your favorite/least favorite politicians?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5nsf?context=5)|I'm not a fan of many politicians. I think some have taken courageous stances at various times. Barbara Lee when she voted against the AUMF in Sept. 2001. Russ Feingold who voted against PATRIOT Act. Kucinich many many times over his career taking principled positions. But until we get massive corporate cash out of our electoral process, nothing real will ever change.
[Hey Jeremy! Thanks a trillion-billion for doing this AMA!  Let's get to the point: Do you think your work will in any way influence the mechanisms of government secrecy? That is, beyond the objective of, say, Dirty Wars, which is to publicly expose these secrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5idq?context=5)|Thanks. I wouldn't do this work if I didn't believe we could make a difference. But I think we all need to take a humility pill and realize we are at ground zero in confronting the national security state. I have far more faith in the people than I do in the jackals on Capitol Hill. But, it will require millions of people in this country making it their business to actually care about issues of war and peace and civil liberties.
[Given your work, do you get hassled coming back into the US, as some other filmmakers such as Laura Poitras have, or does US customs mainly leave you alone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5jci?context=5)|I get detained pretty regularly at airports when I come back home. And it always sickens me because I am often released from a room where I was the only white person detained, leaving behind other people who have been pulled aside. And I have seen many frightened looking people from the Middle East and Africa--at times with their families--waiting and not knowing what will happen to them.
[Who were your mentors and who did you admire growing up, and also who today? And why ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5rzm?context=5)|Amy Goodman was the person who taught me journalism. I will always consider her my mentor. 
[What did you find most surprising about Anwar al-Awlaki's family after spending so much time with them and getting to know them personally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5j3e?context=5)|Awlaki's family is not Anwar Awlaki. I found them to be incredibly generous of spirit and unbelievably hospitable. We spent Ramadan with them and they invited us to break fast with them every night. We got to know them as people and, in the process, were able to tell a more complete story--especially in the book--about what happened to their family as a result of having a relative on the kill list.
[Would you share a memory of Michael Hastings? And maybe your own suggestions for young journalists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5frh?context=5)|I watched the Mayweather fight with Michael recently. He was a man who loved life, laughter and his friends. He was incredibly generous. 
[Do you think we could have avoided all of this if Gore had won in 2000?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5fg9?context=5)|No. I think it is pretty clear that Democrats and Republicans played a huge role in the post 9-11 policies that led us to where we are.
[I'm more partial to *Blackwater* because it had the most amazing fact-checker of the mid to late 2000s.  What made you want to do the documentary when you were researching the book? Does it add another dimension to what you were trying to get across to your readers?  Also, what's your high score on Buck Hunter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5i1l?context=5)|Garrett Ordower was indeed an amazing fact-checker. Is this his sister? ;)
[Is it a conspiracy that there is a lag while doing an AMA with someone involved with national security?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gocwe/i_am_jeremy_scahill_national_security/cam5nmc?context=5)|Haha. Yes. The lizard people are responsible!
[Everyone should certainly be in awe of your research and your ability to bring to light such harrowing aspects of living in the world today - especially under the shadow of the US empire.  Recognizing that, what do you think your role is as far as mobilizing resistance to these injustices? Being a highly visible and respected figure - heralded across partisan lines - do you feel that you have a responsibility to agitate for a movement against these crimes?

Drones are a weapon. I believe that our ""national security"" policy is making us less safe and is creating more new enemies than it is killing actual terrorists. I believe that we should confront terrorism as a crime and treat it as such. This war on the world/world is the battlefield crap is propaganda. Nations have a right to self defense, but what we are engaged in is pre-crime. And it will come back around and hit us. So, I believe we need to have an actual debate in this country about what a real security policy would look like and stop asserting our right to bomb any country we please.

I was enrolled in a sort of ""information systems"" degree that allowed you to pick what you wanted a career in. (Programming,  networking, Systems Administration etc etc). The program forced you to take a course or two in each concentration. At first I thought I wanted to go into a the programming concentration mainly because in highschool I had messed around with Websites and javascript etc. So i wanted to learn how to build things. 

Anyway my first semester we learned VB/C++ and I HATED IT. So after taking that freshmen class I avoided it as much as I could and went into networking. My 2nd semester of junior year I had put it off for awhile but I had to take it so I took Java. I ended up loving it. The professor was amazing and passionate about what he did and it was very inspiring. So much that I exceeded the class and went on to develop my program.

 It was an outside program that solved a problem at my school built on java swing and MySQL. That program is actually what helped me land a internship that summer and then this job that I received and started two weeks ago. Yet I feel like I rely way to much on google. Even when I was developing my program for almost everything I would quickly google the answer.

 For example just now I was programming and I had to google how to format dates in java. Even though I had used it quite a few times for my previous program. which made me think of am I too dependent on google?.. I know how to build out logic with control statements (ifs, loops, cases) and I know arrays lists queues etcs...but if you ask me a question specific question or something I feel like i'd be compelled to google it first or at google how to. Basically I want to know if this is normal and its goes away with time/experience....or this is something i need to actively work on? if so how

TL;DR: I just started a new job and I feel like I Google to much.Basically I want to know if this is normal and its goes away with time/experience....or this is something i need to actively work on? if so how"

I will be starting school this fall for computer science. I have been trying to teach myself programming beforehand, and I have also been contacting software companies in search of an internship.

Today I received an email from one of the companies offering me a possible contractor to full-time position. The only condition was that I provide either a .zip program like 7zip or a web video downloader like YouTube Downloader.

This kind of surprised me because it was beyond what I was searching for. It also seems to be beyond my skill ability at the moment. Either way it got me curious and I began searching for ways to write these programs by searching Google and looking at source code.

This led me to finding large amounts of code that I am not familiar with. I would still like to learn how to do these things though. 

My question to you guys is this. Should I continue to attempt this task in order to possibly land this job? Or is this well beyond entry level coding ability and I should back off?

I recently graduated from a program in travel and tourism. As part of this program I was required to complete a four month internship at a company related to my field of study. I managed to score a great placement and was praised for my administrative work and attention to detail, however, as the department I interned in was sales they were worried about my ability to communicate effectively with customers. Truth be told, my manager seemed to notice I didn't seem like a very happy person and I didn't want to scare her by telling her about my rather crippling depression and anxiety issues. I did end up finishing my internship and was told that though no positions were open at that time, there would be a position open in the fall and to apply and keep in touch. In addition, they recommended me to a friend who had just opened her own company. I did a few hours for this friend and was told that she would pay me for my time and be in touch once she looked over my work. Long story short, she never paid me and never replied to any of my emails. 
My first plea for advice is if I should continue to contact her or bring this to the attention of my former manager? I have spoken to a few of my former coworkers and they agree that I should at least get paid for the work I did. 
Secondly, I checked my former company's website for open positions the other week and they now have a position open in my city, I contacted my former manager and did not receive a reply although I was told I should apply if a position opened. I'm rather confused and concerned due to my previous experience with their friend and I am unsure how to approach this issue professionally. 
Finally, i am aware that my personality and mental health problems may have hindered my job prospects but I was told if I made an obvious effort to work on becoming slightly more outgoing and friendly that there may a realistic opportunity available. In the end, I feel that my depression and anxiety issues are clouding my judgement and I really have no one to turn to. Any advice would be appreciated or if anyone out there has gone through a similar experience let me know how you handled it. "

I already submitted an app on app store and currently working on other projects. 
Now my concern is, most Java related jobs I find require Java EE experience. Should I learn Java EE or continue working on iOS projects and apply for iOS jobs? I feel like I enjoy more on doing iOS development but fear that if it is worth for long term career."

It started in high school. I got to take ""special"" classes (for example AP Calculus as a freshman), since I was good at almost every subject: art, science, math, English, history. I was loved by some teachers and deeply hated by others because I was cocky in class and enjoyed interrupting them with questions and corrections.  I was a troublemaker but the school administration turned a blind eye since I was also so good at academics.

When college admissions came out, I got into a damn good school, but all people had to say to me was ""I expected you to get into Harvard or at least Stanford!!"".  During college, I also had the best amenities and benefits.  I studied computer engineering, and interned at both Microsoft and Apple.  During junior year, I became bored and skipped classes often.  This took a big toll on my grades.  I ended up graduating early.

Now as a young adult entering the workforce, people say that I am ""hard to work with"" and that I have ""a sense of entitlement"".  I have a habit of speaking out whenever and pointing out people's flaws.  For example, during one of my internships, I was in a meeting with lots of people (including a VP).  I completely exposed the VPs lack of understanding how the core technologies worked, effectively embarrassing him in front of lots of people.


I want to be humble, but I find it hard since my whole life I have been told that I was a tier above everyone else.  **How do I fix this?**"
1gn5az,3,2013-06-19,"Choosing the First Job, and Negotiating Salary",negotiating_advice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gn5az/choosing_the_first_job_and_negotiating_salary/,"I'm a recent college graduate, and I just got 2 comparable job offers.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to choose just based on location (they're on opposite sides of the US), but I wanted to know what other factors I should be thinking about.  

They're both web companies, one is closer to a consultancy (but doesn't seem to have a lot of the usual consultancy issues), and the other is just working on their product. One's java, the other's ruby on rails. They're fairly different companies, so I don't really know how to compare them.  Both have been around for a while, but both seem to be expanding a lot recently, though my gut tells me a web consultancy will be more likely to run into issues when this startup boom dies down.

The other question I had was about salary.  The job I'm thinking of taking is offering a tiny bit less (~2%), and it's not going to sway me in either direction, but I was wondering if it's worth mentioning that I have a slightly higher offer, and asking if they'll match it.  And if so, how to say that tactfully.  A part of me wants to just be honest and say that I'll accept the job either way, but ask if they'll match anyway, even though that's obviously a terrible negotiating tactic.

On a related note, the salary I was offered was much higher than I expected, especially given that I don't have internship experience or anything. Hell, my primary major wasn't even CS, it was math, so I'm a bit paranoid that there's some trap I'm not aware of."

I'm now in the position where I can apply to jobs again - but looking at code now gives me a headache and I've forgotten a lot of the CS concepts I was taught in school.

[Have you ever thought about playing some retro games just to see Conan's thoughts on them? (Mario, Crash Bandicoot, Donkey Kong, etc\)  Also, as a modern game suggestion; The Last of Us. :}](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camta6m?context=5)|Funny you should mention that - Conan actually wants to do a ""Retro Gamer"" where we play a bunch of classic games! He also wants to dress up like it's the early 80s - and I thought it'd be fun to put a VHS looking treatment on the whole thing. What do you think? - Bley.
[How do you feel about Conan hitting you all the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camt861?context=5)|I feel great about it. He once said it's because he thinks of me like his brother Neil - and since he can't hit Neil, he hits me instead! Writer Matt O'Brien and I are the ones he punches (Before Matt O'Brien, it was Michael Koman, co-creator of ""Eagleheart"") so I'm in good company! ;) - Bley.
[I saw you in ATL during the Conan LPFBFOTV Tour. Had a hell of a awesome time.

Way, way too many to name here - that was an incredible time. Either watching the sun rise over the desert as the ""Shady Ladies"" brothel swam up out of the distance (we didn't stop, don't worry) - or hanging out with Jim Carrey one on one two nights in a row, and him using my joke ""Just back in my street clothes, Conan"" - then coming back and high fiving me for giving him the joke! IT WAS MADNESS.

Well, everyday during the show I write the Team Coco Sync (which is our ""Second Screen Experience"" for the show). Other than that, my responsibilities depend on who's on the show that day! We try shoot a lot of web only content while the guests are here (like the Simon Helberg auditioning as Lincoln thing we just put out) and I'm in charge of all of that. Other than that... My responsibilities are putting out fires, coming up with ideas, and making sure Conan has someone to punch. ;) - Bley.
[Does Conan actually own a video game console?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camtbu3?context=5)|Yes! He's got a Wii, Xbox 360 and a PS3 - but clearly, he's not using them. - Bley.

Conan would literally do anything if it was funny enough. Back on Late Night, HE JUMPED INTO THE HORRIBLY POLLUTED EAST RIVER TO TAPE THE OPENING OF THE SHOW. He had wear wax noseplugs so he didn't get sick! Compared to that, looking stupid at videogames ain't no thang. ;) - Bley.

When people ask me how to get into this kind of a gig, I always point them towards an internship - a lot of the people working on our show were interns first, and internships (to me, at least) are really like the Minor Leagues in baseball... If someone is good enough, they get called up to the majors! That's for Production, of course. If you're more interested in being a writer, I would say do as much performing (either standup or improv) as possible. Hone your craft. Write every day. Then try to get an agent or manager, and get your stuff in front of people. I've always felt that getting into showbiz is really not as hard as people think it is - if you're willing to put in the work, eventually you'll break through! - Bley.
[What is your favorite current Conan bit, as a fan? Not including Clueless Gamer. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camtbbf?context=5)|Great question! Even though our amazing Costume Designer Scott Cronick would hate me for saying this, ""Mascots that should never dunk"" always makes me laugh. Cronick and his team are INCREDIBLE at the stuff they come up with, and the fact that we're making these people in these insane costumes jump off a trampoline is fucking awesome! I was a huge Conan fan before I started at Late Night, and the mascots bit brings back great memories of all those crazy characters we used to do. - Bley.
[Does it hurt when Conan punches you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camt7pj?context=5)|Ha ha ha ha. It depends!

[Can you play The Last Of Us with Conan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camt7to?context=5)|Maybe! I've been hearing really great things about TLOS!
 |The weird thing about the Clueless Gamer segments that I learned early on was that not every game really works that well for a comedy segment. Remember, we're trying to make something funny - and many times, the best parts of a videogame while I'm playing them (at least for me) are the emotional moments or huge plot twists. Because we really only have 8 minutes or so per segment, it's nearly impossible to convey that kind of gravitas onto the TV viewer... So the best kinds of games for CG are ones that have moments or pieces that are easy to convey in a short amount of time - and enough different pieces that, if something doesn't really work in the segment, that we can go to another part of a game that's totally different. Does that make sense? - Bley.
[I love Clueless Gamer segment , you both make a great team.My question is why did you start doing this segment ?And does Conan only play video games on this segment or he plays with his children?

We started doing the segment because I thought it'd be funny to have Conan try to play videogames and he agreed! I think he does play a bit with his kids (or at least his kids play) - I've heard him say it in passing. And Dead Space is actually so scary I had to stop playing, hahaha!

Favorite console?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqnzt/howdy_im_aaron_bleyaert_also_known_as_bley_conans/camthrz?context=5)|Braid BLEW MY MIND at the end, so that'll always hold a special place in my heart. I used to ride my bike to the Double Focus arcade in Ann Arbor Michigan as a kid to play Street Fighter II, so that's a huge one. In college I played Goldeneye &amp; Tekken 2 until my fingers were raw. I poured HOURS into Advance Wars, Fallout 3, Skyrim, Wii Mariokart, etc. too many to name. Right now I'm playing State of Decay and it's incredible. Slender is scary as fuck. I dunno. THERE'S TOO MANY AWESOME GAMES.

At least, not for that.  And here's a weird memory: My last day as an intern, all the other interns got their pics with Conan and I didn't. I didn't want to. I thought ""I don't want a pic because if I work here one day I'm going to feel real stupid"". Then I walked out of 30 Rock and thought ""Wait, I'm never going to work here, this is stupid, I'm going back to get a picture."" and as I was walking back in, Conan was walking out - and as he passed he said ""see you soon!"" - and I was like...

He's actually leaps and bounds better than when we first started. He weirdly picks things up extremely quickly - I think it's from all the remotes he's taped over the years of learning how to do all these different jobs. I remember we did this remote where he was going to learn how to drive a Monster Truck, and after like ten minutes he knew how to do it. It was insane. Luckily, every videogame is different, so all the buttons throw him off to the point where he's still terrible... If he ever gets good at videogames, we'd have to end the segment! - Bley.

It was AMAZING. The craziest part in the doc was at Bonnarroo - when I saw that in the movie (before Conan goes out to intro the bands) I was like ""THERE WERE CAMERAS THERE?! HOLY SHIT!"" That was a very dark moment. On the other end of the spectrum, there was a whole bit of Conan eating ice cream and crashing tables of people eating at the hotel in Jersey that I'll never forget (it was the same place where he says ""I""m going on at Midnight"" etc etc) - Bley.

I did very well (3.8 gpa), but honestly did not like the material at all and never obtained any internships so I kind of fucked myself over. Right now I work as a Quality Engineer with over 1 year on the job.

In order to pursue my true passion of programming, I'm going to obtain a MS in computer science. I was thinking about just going back for a second BS in CS, but it seems it is very difficult to get admitted for a second bachelors in CS to many universities.

First question: Do I need to take the GRE? If not necessary, I really DO NOT want to have to study for this stupid test. Most of the universities I have looked at, aside from Ivy's which I will not be attending, don't require it. I've read that the gre is not required with a high GPA. 

Does it help with financial aid?


Second Question: How are prerequisites handled? For many of the admission requirements it looks as if you can apply without having taken the required courses, and then be admitted with ""provisional"" status until you fulfill the requirements. Do I have to specify this in my application or is figured out from transcript?

I only took 1 or 2 programming classes for my EE degree so I will probably require a few prerequisite courses. I do have experience from high school courses, as well as programming on my own.

So, I work a 9-5:30 job in London. I'm an intern, so, usually I get out of work on time, and want to get home as quick as possible.

The only way out of London from where I work by tube is the Jubilee line. Following on from that I get a Met line home, usually takes about an hour. 

On this particular evening, I left work on time, only to find that both tube lines were part suspended due to some earlier signal failure and a trespasser on the track (I mean, what kind of a dumb fuck goes for a wander along the track at peak time?!). The crowds at the station were horrendous, and the barriers were shut off so no one was actually moving anywhere. Needless to say, I decided to look for a different route home.

For some absurd reason, my brain thought calling for a cab in london would be smart. I knew it'd be expensive, but I figured it beats waiting in the crowd, and let's face it, I had no idea when I'd be able to catch a train. 

The company I called told me it would be £25 to go from where I was to Baker Street. Bit of a bitch, but hopefully it wouldn't take me TOO long to get home, and sure beats travelling at rush hour with all these delays... Right?

Wrong.

Cab arrives at 6:15, at which point I'm already a little pissed since I would normally be close to home by this point, we set off and I drift off for a bit, since I figured it'd take about an hour in traffic. 

I wake up and it's 7:10, and I know I'm not even close. We're stuck in traffic not too far from where I work, and it isn't moving. Great. Then I get a call from my parents, just letting me know that they've already eaten because they thought I wasn't coming home for dinner (I don't live at home). Awesome... 

It's at this point I realise I have NO entertainment. I don't have my work laptop, I don't have my DS and I don't have my tablet. Nor do I have my headphones. If any of you have ever been in a particularly long car journey, I'm sure you'll appreciate how horrible it is when you have nothing to keep yourself busy!

I start redditing on my phone, and about 5 minutes later - it dies. Apparently I missed the low battery warning. Thanks Samsung!

So I sit there for another half hour thinking I'll be out of this stupid car *any minute now*, at which point the driver turns the radio on, and, as if to rub salt in the wound, a newsreader says:

*There are still severe delays on the Metropolitan line* - The one I plan on catching from Baker Street.. Followed by:

*The Jubilee line is now running a regular service* - Yep. The one I've just spent about and hour and a half in a cab driving through the entirety of london to avoid.

Finally, at 8:04, the driver pulls in at Marleybone to let me get cash out, and I pay him £25 for his trouble. He drops me off at Baker street, and I get out the car - only then noticing that I hadn't shut my purse properly. About £10 worth of coins fell from the purse in my hand and landed EVERYWHERE. Now, I'll be damned if I'm going to leave that money for someone else to find, so I picked up the coins that had landed in the car, and then proceeded to crawl around the outside of the car on my hands and knees picking up stray coins. I got so many odd looks (Likely due to the fact I was doing this in a skirt).

I scurry away, embarrassed out of my mind and just all round irritated, only to find that I have no money on my Oyster card and the queue is *huge*. I stand in line, top up, then make a dash for the Uxbridge train that's about to leave the platform, getting my bag caught in the doors as they shut. 

I finally sit down on the train, red faced, sweaty, and with a hole in my tights (I'm assuming from kneeling on the floor, but I didn't notice this until I was on the train). It took 40 minutes from Baker Street to my house, meaning I didn't get home till 9pm. On a normal day, I'd have had dinner, watched pointless and showered by this time. 

On top of all this, I was home so late I couldn't be bothered with cooking, and I live across the road from a chinese restaurant. Goodbye diet!

I really wish I'd just waited for the bloody train!

**TL;DR** Tube delays lead me to take a £25 tour of london, rip my tights, and ruin my reasonable attempt at a diet, whilst extending my journey home from 53 minutes to approximately 2 and a half hours"
1gsk6v,3,2013-06-21,"I've got admission to a MChem I don't want, my aim for Master's studies is Comp Sci/HPC. Unsure what to do.",Kalivha,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1gsk6v/ive_got_admission_to_a_mchem_i_dont_want_my_aim/,"Quick bit of background info: I'm at uni in the UK. I just finished my third year (of four) of a BSc in Computational Chemistry. Due to my good (or more like okay) marks this year, I've been offered to switch to an MChem (undergraduate Master's, an extra year of research and skipping the BSc thesis). 

I'm somewhat dissatisfied with my university. The computer science department is bad, the interdisciplinary stuff is awful because departments don't communicate (leading to me spending an awful lot of money on getting the comp sci modules I need elsewhere this summer because I got put on completely irrelevant ones this past year). I also eventually (at PhD level) want to get into electronic structure theory/software development, which isn't really done at my university (or many at all). 

I sent my uni a final year MChem project proposal which will probably *not* get accepted, for half the concepts I need to understand there will be no staff specialising in that topic, and I don't want to lose out on the comp sci component in the Master's year. 

Another university in the same city offers a MSc in High Performance Computing through their physics department which is much more relevant to my interests, offers modules on topics where I feel like I need to improve, and is generally more likely to be conductive to me getting the project I want to do actually *done*.

Caveats: I need to maintain my average (GPA, I guess?) to even meet their minimal application criteria. I've got approval for learning disability support next year, but don't know how much it would help. I do have a good amount of theoretical lab/coding experience and will gain some relevant comp sci and HPC certs later this summer, so if I make that average, I'm not too worried.  
The course is also expensive, always was but they doubled tuition for the 2014/15 year. I have 2 sources of funding, but might have to pay about £2000 out of my own pocket if I fail to get a scholarship. It's possible, but I kind of wanted to do another summer internship next year somewhere and would have to get funding for one of the two.

And then there's the question of what I want to gain through doing any kind of Master's degree. Let's say I want PhD admission. There is exactly *one* university that I am considering which requires a MSc or equivalent for that. But all the other options I've found seem to be very very competitive (Cambridge is one of the easier options). Most of them are in the US.  
But I also feel like I will gain a lot of useful knowledge through doing the Master's&amp;mdash;if I do the HPC one.

I don't know if it's worth the risk, but I do know I don't feel good about accepting the MChem offer, especially if my proposal gets rejected. 

I do feel like I've got decent chances of getting into a PhD programme in the US because my GPA isn't *that* bad (just not 4.0) and I've got more experience than most UK-based applicants would.

Edit: Right. Question/TL;DR. Sorry. I've got an unconditional offer for a Master's in chemistry, but feel like I wouldn't enjoy it much. I *want* to do a high performance computing Master's, but it would be more expensive and there's a good chance I won't get an offer for it. Ultimate goal is PhD, probably in the US. Should I take the risk and apply to the comp sci one?"

At BioWare San Francisco, we had a strong affinity for interns and co-op students (who would work a full semester at the studio for credit). In a very real sense, we would not have launched Dragon Age Legends on time without the contributions from our co-op team members. As such, one of my favorite times of the year was when the fantastic university relations team at EA would deliver the resumes of potential interns they were bringing to campus for interviews.

It was not unusual for me to review 50 resumes in one marathon session to pick out the prospects that I thought would fit a need on my team. Whether I was reviewing a stack of resumes for intern candidates or a single resume from a recruiter for a full time position, my process was almost always the same. Open a resume and scan it for about a minute to look for highlights. Open the portfolio website link and spend a significant amount of time reviewing (if possible). If a portfolio was great, I would request a phone interview. On more than one occasion, I called someone instantly because the portfolio was so good I didn't want to waste any time lest the candidate be snatched up by another studio. Sometimes the candidate already had. A high quality portfolio was the single biggest factor in landing a phone interview.

**Tangible proof**

If your professional experience is minimal or non-existant, the challenge you face is that you have no credibility that you will be capable of fulfilling the job requirements. When I'm looking to fill a job, I don't care about your mission statement, your extra curricular activities or your summer job in a completely unrelated industry. I only care about proof of your design abilities.

It can be difficult to know what to put in a design portfolio, as there are no standards for what a good design document is or how a game economy should be laid out. The best possible thing to have in your portfolio is shipped games. With tools like Unity and Game Maker Studio and the ease of self publishing, it is my opinion that a prospective game designer should exit college with one game on the app store for each year in school. There is no stronger proof that you are a capable designer than being able to show that:

*You know how to finish a game and release it to the world
*You took the time to listen to your players, either through metrics, comments, reviews or other feedback
*You can tell a meaningful story about how you improved your game based on player feedback

Being able to tell me that story in the initial phone interview is an instant ticket to a full team interview.

Building a proper portfolio will take months, if not years. In college, I tried on multiple occasions to assemble a team to make a game. I got plenty of interest from programmers or artists who wished to talk about a game and collaborate, but when it came time to start working on the game they did not deliver. Unless you have a team you truly trust, my advice is to start out by making small but completed and polished games that you can build on your own. If you don't know how to code, it's time to learn!

**Feature portfolio material**

What you build for your portfolio is [highly dependent on your mountain](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/). No matter what type of design job you have, the tools exist to prove you are capable of doing high quality design work. If your mountain is to work on open world RPGs, then dive into the Dragon Age or Skyrim mod tools and make quests. If you want to work on multiplayer FPS, then dig into Unreal Engine 3 or Hammer and release levels to the world. If you want to work on a MOBA, then get cozy with the WarCraft III or Starcraft II editor and prototype a new MOBA style gameplay mode.

No matter what your mountain is, you cannot wait till you ""land that gig"" before you start learning how to design content. Only by proving you can finish content, release it to players, listen to their feedback and improve your content based on feedback will you be able to land that first professional gig. And if your goal is as targeted as working on a specific game or at a specific company, if they have publicly available tools you better invest time in mastering them.

**Other portfolio material**

A designer's job is much more dynamic than simply creating levels or quests. There are a number of other documents or types of content you can create and share as part of a portfolio. Here are some suggestions based off the varied types of work I do on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) and other projects:

*Game Treatment* - no one is going to read a 75+ page game design document when evaluating you for a position. But they will scan a 5-7 page game treatment that outlines a game, its market and its core features at a high level.

*Feature Brief* - a detailed document that explains the full implementation of a single feature for a game, including UI wireframes and flow, goes a long way to impress. Design a new feature for an existing and well known game in the genre you wish to get hired in. Make sure that in the early part of the brief, you have a section explaining why this feature needs to be added to this game.

*Game balance evaluation* - much of a designer's job is tuning and balancing game variables. Pick a game and write a report evaluating balance of a particular system or economy. Take detailed notes on multiple play sessions, compile and summarize fan and review feedback and come up with a series of recommendations on how this system's balance can be improved.

*UI/UX redesign* - most of my work in mobile/tablet games involves designing or evaluating UI. Designing UI is a difficult task, especially if you've never done it before, but it is critical to a modern game's success. Pick a screen or flow from a popular game that you think is broken or unintuitive, and propose a detailed redesign.

*System balance spreadsheet* - most of my time as a designer is spent in spreadsheets or JSON files tweaking values. If you have followed the earlier advice and built some games, you will likely have a system values spreadsheet to share. Clean it up and add annotations so that another human can read it.

*Pen &amp; Paper prototype* - many games start as simple ideas prototyped on pen &amp; paper. Although you cannot easily share the results, you can share your process. Fully document with text and pictures the process of building a pen &amp; paper prototype complete with your final rule set. Explain the design problem you are trying to solve and show the steps you took to solve it, pointing out what does and does not work.

These are just a few examples based off my experience. If you've done your homework and spent time identifying job postings you would like to apply to, you may have other design deliverables you would want to build to prove one requirement or another.

**People are busy**

The hiring managers who will be evaluating your portfolio are likely to be some of the busiest people on the game team. They will not have a lot of time to review all the materials that you have spent months or years preparing. They will probably not install your game. They will probably not read your full document. They will probably not open your spreadsheet.

If you really want to shine, then for each piece in your portfolio you should create a 90 second or less video on youTube. In this video, show the piece of work, whether it is a level, design document or UI flow. Talk about the process of designing the work. What were your design goals? How did you achieve them? What feedback have you gotten from players or peers and how have you reacted to that feedback?

So, why go through all the effort to make materials that will likely only be glanced at? This will all be explained in the next part of the series about how to sell yourself."

I'm looking at starting a B Science (Computer Science) degree next year, I have a few questions for someone who is doing this program.

1) I'm interested in 2 majors: Computer Game Design and Construction and Artificial Intelligence. Is it possible to do a double major within the degree? The website was a bit vague on this.

2) I finished my HSC in 2008, and I'm finishing an Honours degree in Arts at USyd at the end of this year. My UAI/ATAR was well and truly less than the requirements for Comp Sci at UNSW. Given I already have a degree, what will my entry be based on and am I likely to be competitive?

3) It sounds like the quality of classes and teaching staff is by far the best in NSW, if not Australia. Is this accurate?

4) What sort of opportunity is there for internship programs in the final year? Is there any assistance from within the school in finding these?

Thank you to anyone who can help!"

I have experience with web development, Java, PHP, C++, C, shaders, OpenGL, and more. Living expenses are quite high here which I am looking to avoid. I am studying for my Computer Science bachelor and am living in the Netherlands at the moment. I'm 25 years old, but I'm planning this for some years from now. My English is good, but my French and German are rusty to say the least. I'm willing to pick up on (other) languages though (possibly before moving). I don't have any criminal convictions. So that answers the basic questions I think.  
  
The reason I am looking for something elsewhere is that I want to have a nice place to retreat to and to work on my own projects. I love nice sceneries, tranquility and a nice culture (hence I've looked into Asia as well). I think it might be possible for me to find an arrangement to work abroad (as was possibly at my last internship) for a part of the year, so I could arrange some income if needed (though this would defeat the purpose a bit as I need to time to develop my own projects too). A requirement for moving would be the availability of an internet connection, but I think with satellite nowadays that's not really an issue anymore (correct me if I'm wrong). I've been thinking I might be able to store some money so I could buy a (cheap!) house, which might dim the living expenses. Another requirement by the way, is decent hospitals. 
  
So do you have any suggestions? I take criticism too :)"

I'm a rising Junior majoring in CS and this summer was hired as an intern at a midsized auction/retail company working with IT and development.  The whole IT/development staff is just 4 people, 5 now including me.  I was thrilled about finding this job because I'd found that most companies didn't want to hire a sophomore without any experience, and even moreso because I was told at this job that they had specific coding projects for me to work on during my 8 weeks at the company.

Now, I've only been there a few days, but so far I've been finding it very difficult and rather discouraging.  My first project is to get information from a database, display it on a webpage, and make it searchable and filterable.  That sounds somewhat simple, but they kinda just threw me into the deep end.  I haven't really used any of the technologies they use (SQL, asp.net, SOLR for search).  Not to mention that their existing codebase and website I'm supposed to be building into is huge (or at least feels huge).  

've been seeking help when I need it, the problem is *I always need it*, and the two other developers seem busy all the time so I hate constantly pestering them.  I know CS is largely about struggling through and figuring stuff out on your own, and I'm generally pretty good at that, but in this case there is just so much I don't know where to start. I hardly even know what docs to read!  

Has anyone been in this situation before?  Maybe have some sage wisdom to impart?  I'm sure this is going to get better with time, I'm just a bit frustrated right now and am looking for a little guidance.  Thanks in advance, I'm really glad this subreddit exists!"

My friend works at our school district as a technical intern, and 2 days ago he went through the school and was asked to dispose of the old hard drives. I told him they might be worth something, so we went and dumpster-dove for them today. However, yesterday we had quite a heavy rainstorm, and we're not sure if the hard drives will work any more. (Some were still in their server boxes, so they may be dry- others, not so much). My question is, what's the proper method of testing these hard drives without shorting out my rig?

1gtxy7,2,2013-06-21,In need of some advice...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1gtxy7/in_need_of_some_advice/,"I have been working at Wal-Mart for the past 7 years. I get (minimal) health insurance, 401K (not much, but a start), and they work with me with my school schedule (currently working 16 hours per week). I also have traveled alot and they have been more than generous in giving me the time off to do so. I'm 25 and I live with my boyfriend, who is totally supportive of anything that I want to do. In fact, he is encouraging me to leave.

I am starting my second year of graduate school in the fall (for social work) and am ready to move on from the company. In the past year I have been really burnt out from the stress of working and going to school. I ended up getting pretty sick for 2 months. I am unhappy in the job for a lot of reasons which I won't share. To sum it up, I am just ready to move on and focus on what's next in my life. I got accepted to start an internship this fall and I am in a specialized program to focus on the elderly. In addition to the internship, I will be responsible to attend training, meetings, and other events that are career-related.

Although I am ready to move on from the company (and know in my heart it is time to do so), I find myself second-guessing myself and agonizing over this decision because I am afraid of change. I'm afraid of not finding a job right away after graduating. I will have enough of a stipend to last me the next two years of school and support myself. I believe focusing on my internships will lead me to a better career in the future. I will also have more time to focus on opportunities that will allow me to build a solid resume, make contacts, and gain experience (which I am lacking). I have been wanting to leave the company for a year and wanted to try to stick it out through grad school. However, every summer I stay I am completely miserable working in there and don't even pick up any additional hours because it isn't worth the stress. I'm also afraid I will never get the opportunity to travel again if I leave, because I will never have the time or a job that allows this much freedom.

I honestly have considered continuing working and going to school, but I just don't have the energy or will to do so anymore. I have become so comfortable in the job that it is preventing me from moving forward in my life (I.E. finding another job related to my field, taking advantage of opportunities, making more money, etc.). I just can't get past how stupid it is to quit a job (with benefits) in this economy. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it. I know that I want to quit, I just need help taking that leap of faith. "

So you know those people that you see from time to time but don't really know? Like the girl I've had three classes with in college but I've never actually spoken to. Or that one kid that's class schedule is weirdly aligned with mine so we pass each other on campus the same time twice a day. Or the guy that's on my morning train into the city with the fancy leather briefcase. I always wonder if I'm a character in their daily story the same way that they are in mine. And for at least one of them, it seems I am. 

I'm writing on here because a few days ago, on Friday, one of them talked to me. It was the guy from the train. He's pretty inconspicuous looking. Maybe 45 years old. Average height. Not skinny but not chubby. No facial hair. A full black head of hair. Always wearing a nice suit and a pair of sunglasses, even on the train. And he always carries this super nice black leather briefcase. Typical businessman on his daily commute. We leave from the same train station in the suburbs on our way into New York City every day. I see him more days during the week than I don't. 

On Friday, we ended up standing right next to each other. By the time the train gets to my stop, it's so packed that you have no choice but to stand between cars in that little enclosed area with the exit doors. I end up there by habit even if there's an open seat because I'm the last stop before NYC, at Secaucus Junction. 

On Friday, I had a morning doctor appointment and was going into work late, at around 10:30 am or so. I was surprised to see briefcase man at the station, but thought nothing of it. When I got on the train, he was right behind me and stood in the enclosed space with me. It was just the two of us as it was a later train and rush hour was long over. We made eye contact, or at least I think we did since he had sunglasses on, exchanged a quick smile, and that was it. At first. 

He looked at me and said, ""So how's your day going?"" I told him its fine, asked him the same, and he said he was alright but overslept since his alarm didn't work. It was all pleasant small talk at first until he asked how my doctor appointment went. I thought about the question for a second and realized I hadn't mentioned it yet. 

""How do you know I had a doctor appointment?""

""I know a lot about you, Zach.""

""How do you know my name?""

""I just told you that I know a lot about you. You grew up in [my town name] and went to [my high school name]. You're majoring in journalism. You're on your way to your summer internship right now for [company name]. You wake up every morning at 7:47, which you decided was the perfect alarm time because it gives you the most sleep without jeopardizing whether or not you make our train every day. You drive a black Volkswagen Jetta which you named Delilah.""

I'm sure he listed more than that, but I was running through what the fuck was going on in my head and I was in shock and I couldn't register what was going on. I wasn't sure if I should ask him how he knows these things, press the button that opens the door to the car and start running, or what. I ran through every possible option in what felt like two minutes but was probably ten seconds and as if he read my mind, the man said: ""You're going to regret it if you walk away from me right now. It's important that you listen. I'm not going to hurt you.""

And I felt like I had no choice. He has a deep, commanding voice and for some reason, I believed him. So I stayed. ""What do you want from me?""

""It's not what I want from you. It's what I'm here to do for you. In this briefcase, I have something that could change your life forever. I can't tell you what it is. What I can tell you is that it will help you achieve all of your life goals. There will be consequences that come with you accepting my gift, but the benefits will far outweigh those consequences. I can not tell you any more than this. You have three to days to consider my offer. On Monday, if you want to accept my gift, which I would strongly advise that you do, get on the train and walk all the way to the back. I will be waiting for you.""

With perfect timing, the train screeched to a stop on the Penn Station NJ Transit platform. The door opened. He got off. I waiting a few seconds to catch my breath and did the same. The man was nowhere to be seen. I have less than 24 hours to decide what to do. I've barely slept this weekend. I couldn't focus at work on Friday. It's weird, I keep hearing his voice and repeating what he said in my head. He was so monotoned. He seemed like a robot or something. I'm insanely curious and nothing is more important to me than my career goals, but I'm worried about what these consequences could be. 

I guess I'm looking for some advice or thoughts from you guys. I'm not sure what to do or who this man could be or how he knows so much about me. I have no idea what to do tomorrow morning. "

They thought the content of their calls was being listened to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caootvh?context=5)|Yep, i think that's part of the problem. it's a big and important difference. 
[What's the most stereotypical ""spy movie"" thing your father did? What part of being a spy would surprise us?  Also, what is the craziest thing you saw wile reporting?'](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon2dg?context=5)|Well, let's see.  When he was based in India, he did a lot of running agents and things like that, which involved doing ""dead drops"" and meeting his agents in the middle of the night.  Once, the KGB tried to recruit him, too, and that was a pretty dramatic moment, one I recount in the book.  Re the second question, being a spy has its dramatic moments,  of course, but they are also ordinary people, with ordinary challenges, and I think that goes against the stereotypical idea that all of them are, literally, like James Bond. Re reporting, there were so many crazy things it's hard to think of them all. Once I interviewed a 15-year old boy who had been a child soldier and had cannibalized people while running around in the jungle with Joseph Kony. That was pretty crazy.  
[How did you find out your father was a spy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon0qm?context=5)|I found out when I was 14. My dad took me to his office, in a suburban minimall outside Detroit, Michigan, and as we were sitting in the car, he came out with it, and told me he was a spy.  The whole story is in the book.  It was a pretty thrilling moment, and definitely marked a before and after in my life with him.  
[Why do you think he told you? Was it allowed by his employers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon7gf?context=5)|My dad and I had always been close.  However his work meant that there was this big secret he couldn't share with me.  So he told me because he didn't want there to be such a big area of his life that was off-limits to me.  He wanted to share as much of himself as possible with me. Also, I think it was partly practical. I was old enough to be figuring out the truth on my own.  So keeping the secret would have been more of a headache than anything at a certain point.  There are no hard and fast rules about how CIA officers tell their families. Each case is different.  Some never reveal anything to their children.  Others, like my dad, do so when it seems right.  
[Did your mother know before this moment? Also what did you think he did beforehand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon5bh?context=5)|My mother knew, yes. She had to be trained up as well (both she and my step mother, later) and so she was definitely in on the whole secret. There came a time when it was hard for her to keep up the lie and the deception. Before he told me, I thought he was just a ""diplomat"" or, later, a ""teacher,"" when we lived on a secret CIA training facility in southern Virginia.  
[Surely then, there was no immediate danger to your family if he was exposed as a CIA officer at this point in his life then. I feel like telling your family things like this couldn't be a positive if he was an active CIA spy at the time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonmqz?context=5)|Well, the point is he felt he could trust me, and he was right.  Remember that if he hadn't told me, I might have figured it out on my own anyway, so it was going to come up sooner or later.  It could have become a negative in certain circumstances, yes. But it didn't.  And all CIA families have to deal with this issue at some point. It's unavoidable.  Ask any other children, and many will tell you a story similar to mine. Ask Carl Colby, for instance. 
[Camp Peary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoo5je?context=5)|Yep.
[Okay thanks and congratulations for keeping the secret. Did you ever tell any friend though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonq78?context=5)|Nope, not until he had retired and it was okay to do so. he also ran a political campaign where he was out in public, so that helped. 
[How does someone become a CIA spy? Do you find the CIA or does the CIA find you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonffl?context=5)|There are lots of different ways.  You can actually apply!  Most of the time, people apply or get recruited through the military.  Sometimes the CIA will look for you and recruit you. My father had a kind of unique story -- he sort of recruited himself. It's a story I tell in the book. But basically he was in Mexico City, working as a professor. And he found out that the CIA was interested in the school where he was teaching because the KGB was trying to recruit students there. So he inserted himself into the mix, and thus put himself in a position where they recruited him. 
[That's so cool. What was your father's opinion of the USSR? Does he have that vitriolic distaste for communism or was he just doing job? And what exactly does the CIA look into re your political affiliations when you apply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoo63u?context=5)|He had a severe distaste for communism, yes. and i'm not sure what their take is now on political affiliations.  it's probably much different from my father's era. 
[Was it difficult knowing you had a parent that was a CIA spy and never being able to tell anyone? Also, did that life lead you to become a war reporter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon9u9?context=5)|There were definitely times when it was hard, yes. For instance, having to lie to friends and family over long periods of time was hard. Sometimes I wanted to, but I never did, even though there were people who suspected.  As to the second question, yes, I think it may have contributed.  There are real similarities between the two professions, spy and journalist (esp foreign correspondent) that became clearer to me over time -- going out into the world, cultivating sources, getting restricted information, being in risky environments and so forth.  
[What type of surfing do you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon89i?context=5)|Oh, pretty much any wave I can catch. I like pretty mellow lefts, maybe 4-6 feet or so.  I'm goofy. I love long, smooth rides with some good push.  Mostly I love just being out there with my friends, enjoying the beauty and the ocean.
[Longboarding or shortboarding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonhcb?context=5)|Both. I've got a 6'8"" for some days, and some days here in the Bay Area I'll rent a longboard to surf the small waves at a place like Bolinas :) 
[What do you feel is your most lasting memory from your time in Iraq and Afghanistan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caondi3?context=5)|Too many to recount here, I think.  I have very strong memories of some of the close calls I had, being bombed while riding in a humvee, for instance, or being ambushed and almost getting killed while driving north during the invasion. But those are pretty negative memories. I also remember certain interviews, talking with people about their lives, before and during the war, seeing them as human beings. I remember many wonderful evenings spent with Iraqis just talking.  I remember being rocketed in our house. And I remember friends who died, both Iraqi and American. 
[Are you aware of the research that MAPS and other organizations are doing regarding the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD?

I think it could lead to some exciting discoveries down the line. Generally, I think there's a lot of fascinating research being done in the world of psychedelics, like ayahuasca and so forth, but the extent to which it's all applicable to PTSD is, for me anyway, still unknown.  But I'd like to learn more. 
[Hey!  As part of the training does a spy learn martial arts/hand to hand combat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoncll?context=5)|Some surely do. My father didn't.  He did learn weapons training, both in rifles and hand guns. He also learned things like surveillance detection, writing in invisible ink and resisting interrogation.  Paramilitary types learn a whole lot of other stuff, too! 
[What do you mean by paramilitary types? Also, thanks for doing this AMA, really interesting stuff.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caookj4?context=5)|Well, the cia has a lot of paramilitary activities. read mark mazzett's book, ""the way of the knife.""

[What do you think about the upcoming withdrawal of US troops in Afghanistan?  The vice piece ""This Is What Winning Looks Like""(Link to www.vice.com certainly makes me concerned about the afghan police and militarys ability to keep any sort of stability.  What, if anything, do you think could be done to stabilize Afghanistan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonaft?context=5)|Alas, not a lot, in my view.  Developing stability there has to come from the Afghan side of things, and that, I think, is something that will only develop slowly, with a lot of good will and effort from Afghans themselves. It can't be imposed by us, and we should have learned that by now, but leave it to American policy makers to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. 
[Have you ever met anyone who you suspected was an undercover spy while covering a story? Did your familiarity with the CIA affect what sources you interacted with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonfmv?context=5)|I have met people I've suspected of being spies, yes, many times.  In Afghanistan, Iraq, Africa and elsewhere. In some cases, I've met people who I knew were spies, working either for the U.S or other agencies. In Afghanistan, we used to come across ""journalists"" who purported to be working for fictional news outlets, and we became convinced they were actually spies. Re the 2nd question -- I don't think it did, really. I just worked the way I worked, but maybe I was a little bit more sensitive to the fact that I knew a bit more about how certain relationships worked. 
[How much information is your father allowed to give you about his missions/operations? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caon98s?context=5)|Well, there are certain things he could never tell me. And he couldn't ever reveal what's called ""sources and methods"" which are the rules for how spying actually works. But he could tell me ""war stories"" if you will, the broad outlines of what happened, and how he was involved, without compromising national security or anything.  Also, when you're a child of a CIA officer, you pick up a lot just by osmosis over the years, so some of it came to me that way.  And finally, I've known a lot of CIA people as friends and acquaintances over the years, so you pick stuff up that way as well. 
[Any cool spy techniques you learned through osmosis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonla5?context=5)|Hmmm. Well, I think I learned some things just by watching my father, like how to deflect if a question cut too close to home. That's the first thing that comes to mind. I'll add if I can think of anything else. 
[How exactly do you deflect a question like a spy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonx9z?context=5)|Q: so what does your dad do?  A:  oh, he's in the gov't. boring bureaucrat stuff. hey, what's your girlfriend's name?  she's great!

I was in Baghdad before ""Shock and Awe"" started, yes, when Saddam Hussein was still in power.  I left just days before the actual bombing began -- my ""human shield"" visa had expired and the government was going to kick me out or throw me in jail. Then I went to Kuwait and covered the war as a ""unilateral"" journalist heading north behind the troops.  
[What was is like staying abroad, in so many different countries and continents?

For me it broadened my perspective, I learned languages, saw things I would have never otherwise seen, it was just terrific. Of course, moving was challenging, but I took to it with relish. Not everyone does, and that's fine, people are different.  But I loved it.  My most favorite country?  I think South Africa.  It's beautiful, diverse, interesting, people are friendly, there's incredible history...it's one of the most amazing places I've ever been.

He was a big supporter of the Pentagon Papers though, because it was targeted and because he supported the anti-war movement.  
[Do you think war journalism lends itself to the same kind of PTSD symptoms as active-duty?

I had some issues with it, and so did a lot of my friends. we don't talk about it all that much in journalism, but we're starting to more, and it has affected a lot of journalists over the years. 
[How did your father become a spy?

Re qualifications -- I think you need to be clever, enjoy mind games, be hungry for information, maybe patriotic or at least believe in what you're doing, skillful with people, psychologically astute, discrete...

Not sure, maybe there's something he did that he never told me about.  He did some pretty badass things that I do know about -- recruiting a Chinese spy in one instance, or running around Afghanistan with Special Forces implementing various ""psy ops"" programs with Afghan tribal leaders.

[Did your father ever question why he did the things he did? I don't necessarily mean asking questions that he knew he would never get an answer to, but more questioning his loyalty, if what he did was worth it, anything in that area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonovp?context=5)|He did, yes, and still does.  There's a long process of reckoning, I think, in a world like his, where the moral outlines are kind of hazy and there's a lot of murkiness to be waded through.  I think he did think it was worth it, on some days, and on others maybe less so. He was not always in line with the U.S foreign policy of the time, especially lately, and so it was hard to be a servant in its message at times. But he loves his country, the best parts of it, and I think he felt that America was worth defending against, say, the threat of Stalinist mayhem.  Obviously, it's more complicated than just that, but that's a snapshot.

I think I would never have had occasion to really think about what he did, and maybe not being let in on the secret would have engendered a more naive or trusting approach toward things?  Just a thought...then again, maybe I'd be just the same, and by now I would have known anyway, so it would have just come a little later.  It's hard to say, difficult to rethink what has already happened. But interesting to ponder...

Sometimes journalists need to be very centrist and objective and so forth.  And sometimes, there has to be more pushback because the tables are skewed too far in one direction already. See the reporting of Michael Hastings to get a better sense of what I mean by that.

I thought it was just the most interesting and exciting part of the profession. And in some respects it is. Not all though, and in more recent years I've found a lot of value doing other things. I did it when I was a young man, and in some respects it's a young person's job.

As you became older, has the life and the secrecy ever appealed to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonr76?context=5)|I gave up on becoming a spy when I was pretty young. I thought, and he encouraged me in the belief, that other lines of work would ultimately be more rewarding. That said, I am attracted by the idea of having a sort of impunity to exist in a morally ambiguous world with the backing of a government, it's powerful, hard to resist. I didn't, of course, but it's interesting to fantasize about, isn't it?  
[Was your dad ever ""too busy"" to spend time with the family? Was his job time consuming? Did he enjoy his job? Would he recommend it?  Same goes for you, did you like being a reporter in Afghanistan? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoorsv?context=5)|Sometimes he was too busy, but my dad was mostly there for us. and he mostly liked his job. i'm not sure he would recommend it, or if he did, not to everybody certainly. and i, yes, i loved and still love my job. 
[Has your father ever actually shared any of his ""Top Secret"" stories with you? And If so, are you able to share anything with us? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caons9m?context=5)|Only what he could share without breaking the law.  Read my book, there are a lot of great spy stories in there. I think you'll enjoy it. 
[Has your Dad ever talked about his cover being or almost being blown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caooo4a?context=5)|Well, it was always a risk when he was working during his career. but afterwards i didn't do anything to affect it. he was already out of the shadows by the time i was heavy into writing the book. 
[When you went to cover the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did you have to get special training?  Did you write about things that you thought were particularly important about the conflicts that weren't printed?  Do you prefer to write freelance or for a particular newspaper or magazine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoo1ea?context=5)|I did get some special training yes. Most journalists of my time, and into the present day, have taken security courses where we're taught what to do if kidnapped, for example. I took a course in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. Also, first aid. All were helpful in some ways during the time I spent in war zones.  I wrote for Newsweek for most of my career, still do occasionally, actually. But now I'm mostly freelance. 
[Did you dad try to hide from you that he was a spy? How did you find out? Do you have cool spy gadgets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonu55?context=5)|I answered this above. There's a story in the book about how he told me and in what circumstances.  I don't have any cool spy gadgets, no. I wish!
[What is your thoughts on television/films showing such intimate portrayals of either spies (anit-CIA\) or CIA agents themselves.  Obviously, ""The Americans (FX\)"" comes to mind in particularly.  What is the most accurate film or television series depicting CIA life?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoovpq?context=5)|I haven't seen the americans yet, but want to, i have a feeling it'll be the closest to the real thing? maybe?  i also liked ""tinker, tailor, soldier, spy"" but my dad didn't. he said it was too emotional and too fraught with feelings about betrayal and stuff. i'm not so sure. 
[As someone who works in the mental health field I don't think we have great ways to treat PTSD.  I've recently heard promising anecdotes about alternative ways to help folks with PTSD - some are even pretty out there like sweat lodges.  Have you come across any alternative or even sorta out there methods that you think might hold promise to help folks manage or heal their PTSD? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonqmg?context=5)|I don't have anything more to offer than what the qualified medical professionals are already recommending. The problem isn't really innovative ideas, it's education and making them available to large numbers of people. 
[I'm seriously considering a career as a post-trauma therapist, I'd love to help people suffering from PTSD. Is there any advice you can give me about a career in this field? Or is there anything that most people don't know about before starting in this field that I should consider before making the decision to pursue this career path? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonytj?context=5)|Well, be prepared to see, hear and immerse yourself in a fairly steady stream of horror. If you like that, or think you can handle it, then by all means go for it.  But it's not for the faint hearted. At least that's my sense of it.  Very interesting stuff though. it's bound to be a career that will keep you interested and excited. 
[If you can answer, What type of spy (case officer\) is/was your dad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonnv3?context=5)|He was just a regular case officer, not sure what you mean by the question...
[Why did you choose Journalism as your profession? Did you ever think of following your father's footsteps and joining the CIA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caonxu5?context=5)|Journalism and the world of intelligence are eerily similar in many ways. I addressed this above. I think journalism was my way of sort of following in my father's footsteps, but doing it on my own terms.  They're similar enough to be noted, but different enough to feel autonomous. 
[Which journalist do you look up to the most? Any moments that inspired you to become a journalist? Thanks so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoopyp?context=5)|So many other writers i admire. kapuscinski (sp?), david grann, mark singer...on an on the list goes. the moment i stepped into the newsweek office in paris, and saw that world, i was hooked. from then on i knew i wanted to be a journalist and writer. 
[This has always boggled me. How does one actually get such a job as working as a CIA spy? Or any sort of ""higher up"" government position? I'd love to know how it actually happens.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoog9o?context=5)|I answered some of this above. you can actually just apply. but there are many routes in, from many different sectors, it depends on your skill set and lots of other things. 
[Are you familiar with the work on PTSD of Peter Levine or David Berceli? Their stuff has been hugely helpful to some folks i know, despite being a bit ""woo"". I've seen some pretty incredible results, particularly from Berceli's ""TRE"" method.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoomx6?context=5)|Yes, it's fascinating stuff. Levine's work, in particular, is very interesting. 
[How old are you and what was the timespan of your father's career? did your family ever live in a country that the US was not friendly with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoofnw?context=5)|I'm 39. my dad was a case officer for 25 years, from 68-94 or so. then he was an independent contractor for many years after 9/11. 
[How often did your dad have to leave for work?  Was he ever in a life threatening scenario?  Does he have any cool stories.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoo03l?context=5)|Yes, see some of the above answers. i've tried to address this there. and you can also read the book to find out more. 
[Do you feel that using MDMA could be effective at helping people with PTSD? Or is it more of a temporary fix for a very serious long term problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caooh8k?context=5)|I don't know enough about the mechanics of it to give a thoughtful answer, sorry. 
[I had a friend in High School who's father did similar work in covert operations. She was often stressed because she knew he would be overseas on assignment but was rarely able to contact him for extended periods of time. For example, she was allowed to know he would be in a region or country, let's say somewhere like Syria, and then he wouldn't return her emails for a week(s\).  Did you have a similar experience? Was it ever rough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gwx0f/i_am_the_son_of_a_cia_spy_and_a_former_war/caoo2w9?context=5)|Yes, I did. My dad would go on assignment to places like Afghanistan and there were times he'd be out of touch for a long time. I was, too, as a journalist, and so I was more used to it. But it was hard on my step mom at times. And he had some close calls, yes.  Once, in Pakistan, he narrowly escaped a car bomb at a restaurant. That was nerve wracking to hear when he told me about it later.

1gwahq,3,2013-06-23,Question regarding non-competes [MD],dguy101,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gwahq/question_regarding_noncompetes_md/,"I work in a small engineering firm in Maryland and have been with the company for about 9 months between an internship and being hired full time. This past week our HR manager sent out an email saying that we were being required to sign a new NDA which basically turns our existing NDA into a full blown non-compete agreement. Our company is in a pretty small industry that offers a very specialized type of product. The company is pretty known to have a very high-turnover rate (about 67 people in 7 years) and since our industry is very up and down the possibility of layoffs is always there.

In late 2011, we lost a handful of employees to two different competing companies and just a few weeks ago, we lost one of our employees to one of our suppliers. This I believe forced my bosses hand at changing our current NDA into a non-compete. To not get into much detail about the specifics right now, the basics of the new NDA is that regardless of how our employment ends (voluntarily, involutary with or without reason, layed off, etc.) we cannot work for ANY company that our company has been associated with in the last three years for 12 months after leaving. Our industry is very small and specialized and this part of the NDA is a major concern for a lot of the engineers in the company because basically we can't work anywhere in the industry for a year. There's several of us who worked very hard to get into this industry and basically this new NDA is signing away our future for at least a year if we decided to ever leave the company (like I said, high turnover rate and a lot of the employees leave the company due to the treatment of the employees by the execs). 

My question is, is there anything we can do as employees to avoid signing this NDA? Our company is very small with about 20 employees (7 of which are engineers). Currently there are 7 employees that I know of that have expressed concern with the NDA and have plans to take it to an employment attorney to seek advice. Four of these people (including myself) are engineers, so we feel that if we refused to sign the chances of half the engineering getting fired is highly unlikely. I was hoping reddit might have some insight on the situation.

TLDR; company wants us to sign a non-compete preventing us from working anywhere in our industry for a year, people don't want to sign, what can we do?"

Also, I'm a part-time intern in an office - doesn't matter what kind of office, the important thing is that there are mostly women.

One of my friends told me that ""it's not healthy to have only female friends"". So, my questions is... is it unhealthy?

I mean, I don't go only for the ladies, but I just meet them. I don't have any urge to make friends, it just happens and yeah, the fact that they're all females is also just a case.

I don't care to be honest what she said but I'd like to know your opinion.

What funny little mishaps have your interns done?,djsupersoak,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1gzo28/intern_messes_up_ninite_configuration_quadruples/,"So we have Ninite One implemented at most of our client locations. It is so convenient because it automatically keeps workstations up to date with the basic things like Java, Flash, etc.

The way it is normally set is to download any updates to the server then have the workstations pull the files from there, thus saving bandwidth.

Well our intern missed that setting during setup...now we have 120 workstations downloading all these updates individually...

Here is the [bandwidth usage](http://i.imgur.com/hZ2mEyI.png) from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm...at 2:30 the downloads kicked off. As you can see, bandwidth usage has essentially quadrupled since then.

The blue is HTTP traffic coming from various sources downloading updates for things like Java and the like. The purple is all Adobe traffic once Ninite got to the adobe updates.

They are going to have a slow afternoon.

1gyov4,0,2013-06-24,How do I make one of my biggest career based decisions right now?,faceplusbeard,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gyov4/how_do_i_make_one_of_my_biggest_career_based/,"Yes, /r/advice, another 16 year old here who has no idea what to do with his future life. Luckily, I took notice of my lack of notice before it became too late, and well, here I am, asking for help.

Here's my dilemma. Until a few months ago, I wanted to be a chartered accountant. I had made a decision to ditch my science based subjects (which I studied for 3 years) and take business based subjects later on, and try to fill out my business based subjects deficit in a 3 month long summer break (which I could easily do, no doubt about that).

However, I recently took interest in Biomechanical/biomedical engineering, or research based work (think genetic research etc). And, well, I have the opportunity to intern at a really good genetics lab tomorrow. The problem?

I have 3 months to make a huge decision, and if I waste too much time doing an internship in a field I won't like later on, I'll be in a huge dilemma later on.

Here's a list of pros and cons:

CA/Business field: (Pros)

I get to wear a suit (that's a huge plus for me)

I have numerous family members in that line of business, so I can get help easily.

I can actually envision myself doing this later on.

Cons:

The field is too saturated, and may become more so later on, meaning that it'll be harder for me to make a career out of this later on.

I haven't studied business based subjects as of before, meaning that I could get into something that I will hate later on.

Biosciences field: (Pros)

Relatively new field, meaning that scholarships are somewhat abundant.

Not as saturated as the CA field.

I somewhat love Biology, and it is one of my favorite subjects as of now.

Cons:

I hate chemistry. Seriously hate it, and can't bear myself to study it later on.

This may be one of the toughest fields to break into, since it requires you to be extremely qualified at numerous subjects.

So after my mini rant above, as well as a list of pros and cons, what would you guys suggest? Am I wrong in my line of thinking?"

1gxvwy,2,2013-06-23,Scared...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1gxvwy/scared/,"Hello...after wondering what to do for a while, I figured I'd come here. I just need to write something down, whether or not someone reads it.

So, this morning I woke up with a loaded .45 S&amp;W revolver next to me on the bed. Last night I went out with my roommate and his girlfriend, got pretty drunk, and apparently came home in a depression and toyed around with the idea. I don't really remember loading the gun or much else. 

A little about me. I'm 28, former military officer. Right now I'm going back to school on the GI Bill and for work I have a paid internship about an hour away. Commute sucks, but I'm learning a lot. I've always had a little streak of depression somewhere in me. When I was in the military I had sort of a similar episode where I'd drink heavily and just be depressed about life in general. Sometimes I handled my pistol and sort of bounced the idea around in my head - what would it be like to pull the trigger? A couple of times in about the last 4 years I've taken a lot of pills - not enough of or anything strong enough to do any real harm, I don't think, but still. I am painfully lonely. I don't really have any friends to speak of. I recently moved to a new town, but even before that I didn't have anyone that I regularly hung out with. I've gotten to the point where I actively avoid human interaction because it's an inconvenience to me. It's just easier to sit in my room and fuck around on the internet. I've always had a bit of a 'lone wolf' streak - I enjoy some time alone - but I know where I'm at now is unhealthy. Last year I had an emergency appendectomy with no insurance. With the bills sitting at about 28k, I've pretty much resigned myself to declaring bankruptcy, but I can't really muster the conviction to get that ball rolling. Debt collectors call every day, repeatedly, and I'm starting to fall behind even on other bills that I usually didn't have a problem with. Other than that, things are more or less okay, I guess. I mean, there is nothing happening in my life that I feel is insurmountable. I have a roof over my head, a car, a job, already have a college degree, I'm going to school, etc. I'm just fucking depressed all the time. I know there has to be a better life out there, but mostly I just feel unmotivated to do anything about the aspects of my life that I know are making me depressed. I don't try to date or meet new people. I almost feel like I've forgotten how to 'meet' people or act normal around other people. Which wasn't always the case - I was always the class clown growing up, had no trouble meeting people and had plenty of friends. For the most part I let my hobbies languish and I don't try new things. I know this is pretty rambling, but after this morning I am actually scared. I don't think I really want to kill myself, but I know that I have to make my life worth living. I have to find a way to create happiness and something actually worth living for in my life or I'm fucked. So - I guess, just wondering what other people have experienced here. Anyone gotten over depression? What works? what did you do? Thanks."

A very good friend of mine needed an internship. I arranged that she could have an internship at my workplace. This was going on for quite a while 5 months or so now. But in the mean time a lot happend between us, I kinda fell like a sucker for her but she totaly rejected me. Though as we were friends before this shifted into a kinda awkward atmosphere.

As the sales in the shop goes down I am only able to work once a week since there are only two employees including the boss. I was working 3 days a week but dropt to 1. Since she was working an internship she did most of the same job I was doing but for free.

The boss has desided to go on a vacation in the near future and needs the shop to be open for 2 weeks. Now normaly I would be the first one to ask, if the shop needs to be open. But instead for some reason she asks the internship first. I assume because its free.
She accepted the offer and later that day the boss tells me about it.

During this the boss gets pulled away by some family because there was still being delt with a funeral. And kinda left me without a chance to reply.

Later that day I speak to my friend and tell her I'm pissed off that she just takes up the job offer without thinking of me. This results in some name calling and a dramatic exit.

For me it was fine like that but then I get called up by my boss that she just had a crying girl on the line giving up the job offer that she just accepted. And that I was out of line. And she also askt what I was still doing there. The next day I get a text message just saying that it was fine.

Now tomorrow is the day that i'm gonna work again and i'm kinda freaking out over here. What should I expect. Have I been wrong on my part that I should be aware of. I don't want to lose my job! Any advice is welcome!

p.s. Excuse me for my english."

All I've got is a few illegal jobs (as in, without a contract) and a couple internships that were completely useless. All I got from those jobs is pretty much nothing in terms of money or experience. Add a severe case of slacking on my behalf to that (yeah, I'll admit I haven't really tried at all) and what you get is a 30 y/o deadbeat still living with parents.

I'm ready to redeem myself. So, basically, I have to start anew somewhere.

For a series of reasons, I want to leave my country (Italy) and move somewhere else, possibily some place where English is the main language, as it's the only language I know besides my mother tongue. Staying in Europe would be easier since there's no immigration limits anymore, but I wouldn't mind trying somewhere else, as long as people there speak English.

I have a few uncertified, self-trained skills to bring to the table, but I'm not sure how interesting could they be to any potential recruiter. Besides my degree, I know two languages, I'm a proficient user of graphic design software, a decent writer/translator, handy with all things computer, I know some basic programming.

Would it be a good idea to apply for an internship or junior position in some foreign country and start like that? Or would you recommend some other course of action, since I'm an ""adult"" and not some fresh young graduate?

Thanks for any advice."

1h1yla,1,2013-06-25,Too Early/Clueless for Internships?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h1yla/too_earlyclueless_for_internships/,"I have a B.A. in English and after several years of fun but financially mediocre day jobs decided to go back to university for a CS degree. Since it's the same school I graduated from before, I have a large portion of my degree complete already and found myself in a place where I only needed to collect maths and comp sci classes.

I have now been back for one year. At this stage, all I've worked with in school is C/C++, but most of my preliminary requirements are done and I only have two years of classes left (all CMPT). The most complicated thing I can comfortably do is basic stuff with trees and lists. I still suck at it and don't program every day (but am willing to change this fact).

**The Point**

* I'm about to go into my 3rd year of school, but have yet to take any 2nd year CMPT classes.
* I'm a Canadian, married an American, already have a green card. My university is in Canada.
* My in-laws live in LA.

**I would like to get an internship in the Los Angeles area between my 3rd and 4th year (2014, summer).**

It would make my in-laws and my wife really happy if we could crash with them for a few months while I work on my degree, but I don't know exactly how to go about doing that.

I'm going to keep my ear to the ground in regards to career fairs and internship opportunities in the fall, but since I'm looking for an international internship I don't know how much information I'll be able to get locally. Also, September feels like a long way away and I'd like to know more about it sooner rather than later so I can limit inappropriate hope/hopelessness."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[When is it estimated that NASA will be able to send people to an asteroid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxqpv?context=5)|The President's goal is for NASA to do so by 2025.  If we find the right asteroid, we'll be able to do so as early as 2021.  We'll use mostly hardware we've already got and are already working on, including the SLS launch vehicle and the Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle. 
[How does the President propose to achieve this goal when he cut NASA funding? Or did the funding cut not hit this program?  Also, is there a plan to bring one home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy6gm?context=5)|In fact, it's the President's 2014 budget request that enables NASA to do this.  The entire initiative is in the 2014 budget, which is publicly available, and the White House has been fully supportive of both the asteroid mission and the Grand Challenge.
[2 questions sir...  1\)How much time do you think it will take for us to successfully capture and harvest resources from asteroids for use on earth ?  2\) Do you have any potential asteroid candidates so far? How do you shortlist potential asteroids? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxzny?context=5)|1) That's a question for some of those companies proposing to mine asteroids.  If I were to speculate, I'd say that our nation is decades away from this business becoming mainstream, but the sooner it starts, the sooner we'll see it happen. 2) I think I answered this one elsewhere in this AMA, but thanks!
[What is your plan for human space flight when the International Space station is finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy19p?context=5)|We'll visit an asteroid by 2025 to teach ourselves how to visit Mars a decade later.  This is going to happen comparatively soon!  It's an exciting continuation of NASA's 50 years of human space exploration. 
[If an meteorite (similar to the one that recently hit Russia\) was headed towards Time Square or Washington D.C., how much time would you need to deflect it? What could be done about it? Does NASA or the government have any current contingency plans for this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxx16?context=5)|Probably it would not take long for the thrust from a small spacecraft to deflect an asteroid that size (months?  just a guess off the top of my head).  But we would need even more time to prepare the spacecraft, launch it, and rendezvous with the asteroid.  That's a reminder that technology for building spacecraft rapidly and providing ready access to space are part of the broader problem of protecting the planet.
[So what you're trying to say is that Armageddon wasn't exactly a documentary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capz95n?context=5)|Exactly.
[I'm an idiot on this subject, and please forgive me.   So are you guys going to... blowup, asteroids?   Like with a missile or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxpyy?context=5)|The asteroid initiative includes plans to send a robotic spacecraft to move a small asteroid into an orbit near the moon.  It also includes a Grand Challenge in which we ask for the world to engage with NASA to identify the threats asteroids pose to human populations and then know what to do about them.  The Grand Challenge addresses your question.  There are many ideas about how to keep an asteroid from hitting the Earth, but the best offense is a good defense: know where they are, and the sooner we know, the easier it will be to deflect them.
[How exactly does one land anything on an asteroid? Aren't those things moving at an incredibly fast rate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy65n?context=5)|Great point.  When a spacecraft performs a rendezvous, it matches the speed of the target.  In this case, the spacecraft will have been given a lot of energy by its launch, and we'll keep adjusting the velocity with electric propulsion until the spacecraft catches up to the asteroid.  Also, we will have selected an asteroid with a trajectory that our spacecraft can attain.  When the speeds match, and the spacecraft is in the right position, the spacecraft would grapple with the asteroid or select a boulder from its surface (or one of several other possible mission architectures).  There have been other missions that have already successfully done some thing similar: Stardust, NEAR, and the Japanese Hayabusa 1 missions, for example.
[What is the point/what can be gained from moving a small asteroid into orbit near the moon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy2t7?context=5)|So much!  We'll learn how to send humans beyond Earth orbit, using technologies that will take us to Mars in the following decade.  The moon is relatively convenient and safe, compared to trying out these systems for the first time in Mars orbit.  So, this is a very cost-effective and yet ambitious way to make a lot of progress towards exploring Mars.
 |We're going to send the first, robotic spacecraft under the power of solar-electric propulsion (SEP).  So, this mission will be a technology demonstration of a technique that is broadly applicable across NASA's portfolio and will help the commercial space industry as well.  Our plans are to use a 30-50 kW SEP system here, which is traceable to at least 10x that level.  This is a bold move, depending on a technology demo.  That audacity recalls Apollo and the other work that has made NASA great.  
[Does the Outer Space Treaty apply to plans to mine asteroids? Are there any plans or mechanisms to reserve specific asteroids for scientific study? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxqx4?context=5)|NASA's plans involve using an asteroid for scientific and human-exploration purposes.  As you know, there are other organizations out there considering how to use asteroids for commercial purposes.  They'll have to consider the implications of the treaty.
[What did you pursue in college/graduate work and how did you get to where you are today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxxtl?context=5)|I started out studying English.  In fact, I have a Master's degree in medieval literature.  Later on I got a B.S. and Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering.  My first job was at Hughes (now part of Boeing), and then I worked for Honeywell, all of which was great experience.  I came to NASA from a faculty position at Cornell, to which I'll return eventually when my time here is over.  I wouldn't suggest that path for everyone, though!  Keep it simple!
[What is the actual chance of an astroid large enough to do some serious damage actually hitting us anytime soon? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxnug?context=5)|Very low.  None of the asteroids we have found are expected to impact the earth in the foreseeable future.  And we have found most of the largest asteroids.  There are still many smaller ones that remain undetected.  That's the current challenge: where are those asteroids, and do they pose a threat? 
[How big or small are we talking here? What qualifies an asteroid to be ""big""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy6wt?context=5)|The asteroid that blew up over Chelyabinsk in February was only about 17 meters across.  That did a lot of damage.  We have detected about 95% of the asteroids larger than 1000 meters (1 km).  But there are thousands within that range, large enough to strike the Earth but too small to have been detected yet.  Again, through the Grand Challenge, we're looking for YOU to help NASA find them.  The asteroid we hope to redirect into lunar orbit would be 7-10 m, which is small enough not to be a hazard even if it were to enter Earth's atmosphere (which it won't).
[How am I supposed to help find them? That doesn't make sense, could you elaborate? For example, I have a crappy beginners telescope, but how the F am I supposed to help NASA... Freaking NASA find an asteroid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capym3b?context=5)|Thank you for asking!  This is at the core of the Grand Challenge.  We are looking for very new ideas.  I'll give you an example.  The Minor Planets Center has an immense database of observational information available for public use.  How about some new software that analyzes data we've already got?  How about fusing together tens, hundreds, thousands, of small-telescope observations through a new data-analysis technique to characterize and track known asteroids?  How about a new product: a make-it-yourself device that sits on the end of anyone's home telescope and transmits observation data through Bluetooth to the internet?  I can think of several admittedly far-out answers, but I think you and the rest of the nation can think of many more.  That's why we're trying to ""crowdsource"" answers here--to leverage the creativity and energy that we know is out there. 
[What do you think about Eve, asteroid farming, and the privatization of space travel? Do you think there is anything dangerous about it? Personally I think it could be a great way to further our reach into space and increase our precious resources bank.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxu6g?context=5)|That's a big question.  Let me narrow it down to one of resource utilization.  At the moment, everything we use in space we also had to launch into space.  What if we can change that ratio so that far more of what we use comes from the space environment?  If we do, we'll make the cost of launching spacecraft a small part of the overall value of a science or exploration mission.  We'll need advanced manufacturing techniques to turn regolith or space debris into usable hardware, but NASA, DARPA, and others are already getting to work on this problem.  The solution is what I've called ""massless exploration,"" and we think it will change the economics of space.
[If your team ACTUALLY DID find an Asteroid 'the size of Texas' hurling towards Earth and bound to impact in 18 days - would your first instinct be to gather a rag-tag team of deep sea oil drillers to drill a nuke into the center of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy7h5?context=5)|Just like Hollywood likes to remake movies, we're thinking that we'll do Armageddon a little differently next time.
[What is the technologically hardest part of getting to an asteroid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy6ph?context=5)|I'll give you my top three for the redirect mission overall.  We'll need high-efficiency propulsion to ensure that the trip can be done without using a lot of propellant mass.  We'll need high-precision navigation, particularly for the rendezvous with the asteroid.  And we'll need the grappling, or robotic-manipulation hardware.   Remember, we're assembling the pieces of this mission from capabilities that already exist or are planned for this timeframe.  We're leveraging a lot of great work to make this happen.
[Do you believe that increased public and government support of asteroid related activities is a direct result of the Cheylabinsk meteoroid?  In addition what are your thoughts on the commercialization of space travel? Specifically do you think that the Outer Space treaty should force corporate entities to be merely additional arms of the government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capyaq2?context=5)|That Chelyabinsk event probably encouraged the public to think about this, but NASA's planning for this initiative started more than a year ago.  And we've been doing asteroid-detection work for decades.  In fact, it was Congress that most recently set NASA on the course of discovering all the asteroids greater than 140 m in diameter.
[Is it possible to put a Habitat Laboratory Module (HLM\) on the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxyyt?context=5)|Well, it's mostly a matter of resources.  But the benefits to human exploration are very clear here, even without adding a habitat: we'll learn about how to help astronauts survive the deep-space radiation environment, and we'll learn how to operate long-term life-support systems, how to navigate outside Earth orbit, and the list goes on.  And we'll accomplish these goals using hardware we've been building for years, even before this asteroid initiative was announced.
[Do you have any asteroids in mind for your 2021 - 2025 date?  If so approximately how much energy would it take to change the trajectory to a lunar orbit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy4pk?context=5)|There are a few asteroids we already know about, but none are baselined.  We expect to detect many more in the next few years, thanks to an increased effort in NASA's Near-Earth Object observation program.  While we're looking for these objects, we'll also discover a lot more that may pose a hazard; so, the exploration activities and the Grand Challenge go hand in hand.  www.nasa.gov/asteroidinitiative has the presentations from last Tuesday's roll-out event.  Bill Gerstenmaier's presentation provides some detail on the orbit mechanics.
[What is the timeline for this? Is this something that we can use to inspire the current generation to go into STEM fields? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy00r?context=5)|Depending on what asteroid(s) we identify as viable candidates, we expect to send the robotic spacecraft in a few years (launch ~2017-2018 and rendezvous ~2019), and the human mission in roughly 2021-2025.  It's really just around the corner!  Yes, I think this is uniquely inspiring for all of us.
[What's the most prevalent thought on how to avoid a large asteroids from hitting Earth?  I thought Bruce Willis and Been Affleck, but I saw you said that's not going to happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capxya6?context=5)|Again, deflecting the asteroid (if we know its trajectory early enough) can be accomplished in many ways.  One would be to land a small spacecraft and apply low thrust for many years.  Alternatively, use a means to change the spectral properties (color, brightness) of the asteroid to encourage solar pressure to nudge it out of Earth's way.  In fact, we're looking for other good ideas as part of the Grand Challenge, ideas that individuals or institutions like universities could demonstrate in small scale. 
[Hello Mr, Peck, you just said you're asking for the world to engage with NASA to identify the threats asteroids pose to human populations and then know what to do about them. Does that imply we can actually (people from ALL over the world\) have a part in your decision of how to stop the thread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capybh3?context=5)|Yes.
[I don't think I totally understand. What benefits do humans have landing upon an asteroid? Mining? Signs of life? Just to say we did it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capywcx?context=5)|The robotic and human missions that will take us to an asteroid will create a capability to explore deep space.  The President’s budget enables NASA to take the first step toward Mars, learning how to operate a spacecraft well beyond Earth orbit and enabling humans to survive the trip.  We’re already building the crew vehicle (Orion) and the launch vehicle (SLS), and this ambitious mission architecture uses the test flights and technology demonstrations to accomplish something we would not be able to afford otherwise.  But you have to do it to learn it—merely writing equations and creating computer models will not get us to Mars.  And, yes, the asteroid samples we return will provide very valuable data to answer a number of scientific and technological questions.
[Dr. Peck, what's your criteria for which asteroid to visit? Are you thinking of just minimal delta V, or are you vying for a specific composition? Personally, I'm very interested in asteroid mining and would like to see a visit to one with a high ice content. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capytlz?context=5)|NASA would choose one that balances the science opportunities with the human-space objectives and the technological capabilities to be demonstrated.   This mission represents NASA’s contemporary way of doing things, where we successfully integrate human-space and science objectives, while at the same time we’re taking bold steps in technology to make it all work.  Let’s also remember that NASA’s overall asteroid strategy encompasses a lot more than this initiative.  We’ve got a fantastic mission coming up, OSIRIS-Rex ([Link to osiris-rex.lpl.arizona.edu](http://osiris-rex.lpl.arizona.edu/)) which will return a very carefully chosen asteroid sample.  The missions complement each other wonderfully, with OSIRIS-Rex teaching us about the origins of the solar system and the human mission teaching us about how to explore deep space.
[What's the timeline on having a human rated rocket again? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capye7x?context=5)|We expect NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) to have its first flight in late 2017—that’s Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1).  But we’re also working with companies like Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to produce commercial launch vehicles for transporting cargo to the space station.  These commercial capabilities are expected to provide human access to space in a few years.  You’ve probably heard that SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has successfully launched its Dragon capsule to the International Space Station twice, now, and returned it safely to earth.  Orbital Sciences’ Antares rocket just had its first, successful flight.  We’re taking a competition-based approach brings out the best in our nation’s innovative technology companies, and it’s working out great: technologically successful and very quick. 
[Both you and NASA as a whole have a history of supporting student spacecraft projects at the university level. Do you anticipate a role in this mission for science or engineering students, outside of NASA internships? If so, what type of role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capyj2l?context=5)|The Grand Challenge absolutely represents an opportunity for students to contribute, in many ways.  In fact, we expect that some of the best ideas will arise from unexpected sources, probably non-traditional contributors such as students and people not involved in the aerospace profession.  Also keep in mind that NASA offers many opportunities through the Space Technology Mission Directorate for universities to receive funding for space-technology research (for graduate funding, see [Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/stp/strg/nstrf13.html))  And NASA’s student fellowships in science, human space, and aeronautics continue to provide the next generation with means to pursue education in areas relevant to NASA.
[Do you think there's a high chance that in our lifetime we will have to take action on such a disaster as an asteroid or meteor flattening us all to charred pancakes?  Edit: Thanks for doing this by the way! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capy91w?context=5)|The chance is very low for an event that extreme.  But keep in mind that the Chelyabinsk meteor and the one that (likely) caused the Tunguska event happened about a century apart.  And there are historical records of asteroids impacting the earth, although they may not have been understood fully at the time.  So, the risk is small in the short term, but still a risk that that our species can mitigate if we all pull together and take this on as a worldwide challenge.  In that regard, this challenge may serve as a pathfinder that helps us all learn how to collaborate globally, using technology to realize humanity’s potential.
[Are there any plans in the works to research the long term effects of radiation that astronauts would be exposed to on an extended mission beyond near-earth orbit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h1n14/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/capytl5?context=5)|Yes.  Those are going on right now, through a combination of scientific research and technology development in NASA’s Human Research Program and the Space Technology  Mission Directorate.  It’s a hard problem, but we’re working it, with the collaboration of US businesses and academia.

My name is Joseph and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production. 

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate. 

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for positions you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Now I'm just sitting here idle.

I've asked the other interns if their situation is similar to mine, and they have said that either they're given the same amount of work, they're assigned reading for the tools and framework we're using, or they're doing absolutely nothing lol.

I was wondering if this is a common thing in internships? At least for the beginning few weeks. I don't blame my manager. He and his team seem pretty busy with the project they're working on. 

I would ask my manager for more work, but our team is in the middle of a project iteration, and they seem really busy. Last time I asked him for work, my manager pushed me off 4 days later until he finally came up with the small project I just finished. I feel like I'm pestering him when I shouldnt feel like that haha.

I guess I don't mind chilling, but it would be nice to be occupied. Should I just wait, or should I do something else? Right now, I'm reading technical programming books and browsing reddit until otherwise haha.

Thank you!"
1h193h,2,2013-06-25,Help give me some viable career paths given my background,hectron,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h193h/help_give_me_some_viable_career_paths_given_my/,"Hi all,

I graduated in 2011 with a degree  in **Mathematics** and **Actuarial Science**. During my time at the university, I worked in the IT field doing hands-on support. The only computer science classes I took were Intro To Object Oriented Programming and Open Source Technologies (an upper level CS course). 

My first job was at first at a NOC center, then moved onto customer support in Web Development. There I mostly did Drupal and Sharepoint support, with some C# work every now and then. During my time there, I studied to pass an Actuarial Exam (Exam P) but failed it twice. I left after 8 months as the commute was a killer, and I was earning $12 an hour.

My next job was solely as a Web Developer where I built and maintained a few Drupal websites, and worked on some Java projects for an in-house software system we were building. I was learning a lot, but the amount of stress was too high. I was in a team of three, where I helped maintain everything (Windows servers, Linux servers, backups, databases, version control, backup internet lines, e-mail, employee support -- you get the picture). After a year of hard work, I expected to receive a raise or a change in title as my responsibilities were growing by the month. I started at $18.50 and left when I received a raise to $19.

My brother works at a fairly big Software company where he mentioned that the company was switching over to a Linux stack, and adapting more and more Open Source technologies (AngularJS, Django, Postgres, MongoDB). They were looking for an intern in Software development, which is where I applied. I took a pay cut from my previous job, but the stress is pretty much gone. I have been trying to go above and beyond the typical intern. This was apparent when I pitched an idea to a few managers to improve our product, and they had me present this to several important people in the company who would like to make it happen. Furthermore, I have been helping out other developers with their new open source projects, teaching them new Linux techniques and methods of testing their software. The internship lasts until the first week of September.

The reason that I am so concerned to move up the ladder fast is because when I went to school, I figured that I would get a job as a Statistician or an Actuary. Therefore, I could afford the amount of student loans I took out. Little did I know that I was going to start off with such little pay.

What I would like to do moving forward is pay off my student loans, move closer to a good paying job and afford a conservative lifestyle. I intend on making tutorials (videos and text) of learning new things (programming, design, diy home stuff, weight-lifting, etc). As time progresses, I sort-of want to know how I can **blend mathematics, statistics/probability and programming**. I feel that since going into the programming field, I have learned a lot to visualize these big data transactions.

tl,dr:

Math/Actuarial Science major working in Web Development wanting to combine major with work.

Any advice?"
1h1660,35,2013-06-25,AMA request - anyone working in 'Bollywood',Ubima,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1h1660/ama_request_anyone_working_in_bollywood/,"Not amateur filmmakers, not film students, someone who was actively involved in the development and/or production of a Hindi film that got a release in a cinema hall in India.

EDIT: Questions for the AMA
1) How they got involved in the field? Recruitment from a technical film production course, working your way up from an intern at a production house, amateur actor who slowly worked their way up to professional actor, etc. Did they have any help from a relative or close friend, or did they have a filmy moment where they got 'recognized' and some bigshot offered them a job, etc.

2) How much control to Producers (as in, financiers) have over the end product? Starting from the story, to casting, and finally how many and which songs? Have you heard or experienced personal rivalries and feuds get in the way? (like, a certain producer will only work with certain people, or will actively try to sabotage people they don't like?)

3) How 'professional' is it? Are payments made when noted, are contracts respected to the letter, do people take each other to court or do they give up and try to settle things themselves (in case there is a dispute)

4) 
(For mainstream films only) Is there a sense of love that goes into the films? Or do people working on, let's say, a Golmaal 4 or something constantly telling themselves 'people seem to like it, and it makes me money, so what the hell' - how much of it is a personal drive for the sake of the medium, and how much of it is calculating how to get a larger box office return? 
(For 'parallel' films only) To what extent are films aimed at solely the Film festival circuit and not the 'average' cinema-goer? How much of an effort is made to make a film approachable by 'most' people, as opposed to being a totally artsy exercise?

5) To what extent does the government interfere / cooperate in producing and promoting films? Are they very keen and cooperative when a production team approaches them for permissions, or is it a big mess of red tape? Do certain departments see it as a gold mine for frivolous fees and fines, or do they lay it all out in the beginning, collect their due, and leave you to it?"

1h130q,6,2013-06-25,Should I transfer colleges?,bluzard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h130q/should_i_transfer_colleges/,"Hi, I'm a undergrad who just finished my freshman year at a large state school (ranked in the 80s according to US News) with a solid CS department. My major is CS with minors in math and econ. I chose my school because it was the most affordable option. Academically, I am doing well (3.9/4.0 GPA). In my spare time I try to code as much; I'm learning R at the moment, but know Python (along with some Django), Java, Matlab, some C/C++, HTML5, and Javascript. I also started working in a Professor's lab doing scientific computing in R/Matlab (and some Python).

 I would like to work in a startup one day or start my own. I'm particularly interested in machine learning/AI and its applications for robotics (i.e. computer vision) and computational biosciences/bioinformatics. Luckily, money is not an issue as it used to be. I've had thoughts of transferring since earlier in the year. I don't mean to sound pretentious, but I personally feel that I can do 'better', and go to a more rigorous school. I'm interested in transferring to Rice, Brown, Cornell, Michigan, and the University of Virginia. A few questioins:

- Beyond the school's network and rigour, is there any other benefit a more well known school provides? Does going to a school with exceptional peers really make a difference? I figure the only way to get better is to play a smarter opponent? There isn't really a great startup scene at my school, but I know the schools I've listed have had more measures taken towards encouraging entrepreneurship, so perhaps there's a greater chance of finding other founders. 

- Does the name really matter? I sometimes feel I have to compensate for the lack of brand name value my school provides, such as when applying for internships. There's not really a lot of on campus recruiting, so it's more hustle from my side. I notice that my friends who go to brand name schools have fantastic alumni networks.

- For those who're out of college, how do you feel about all the non-CS courses you took? Do you feel that the overall education that you received as an undegrad is equally important to the specifics you learned for your field/major?
	
- I'll graduate in four years, have the same of amount of debt (maybe a bit more for some schools), and be able to transfer all my credits sucessfully.

Thanks!

In the past month alone I have forggoten countless things Im sure, but I can only remember a few examples. I have bought a new laptop charger only to find out that I forgot to pack it at my friend's apartment and then forgot it was there. I payed a locksmith to stick a glorified coat hanger in to my car window because I locked my keys in the car while they were still in the ignition and the engine was running. I have left the gas stove or oven for hours before anyone noticed. I frequently forget to eat or I make food and leave it out without eating it. 

Now, I'm in danger of losing my research internship because I keep leaving equipment out or leaving the door unlocked. No one will give me another chance if I lose this, and I need undergrad experience to get into grad school. Also, I'm going to be a shitty researcher if I can't fix this and remember things.

So, besides my obsessive mental rehearsal and intense anxiety and self doubt, how the hell can I deal with my forgetfulness?

I've noticed the trend of people taking their 30min lunch breaks and the majority are eating out/buying their lunch from food places. 
For me, I'd much rather get paid that 1/2 hour, than sit in a food court by myself or wander aimlessly doing nothing, or even sit at my desk eating. 
The cost of taking a half hour lunch is the amount you pay for lunch (~$6-12 depending on where you go) and the opportunity cost of that 1/2 hour unpaid break (for me it would be $6) plus any coffee costs that you might spend during the day. 

Maybe I'm just a poor college kid, or still not too involved in my work environment, but it would save a lot to just troop through the whole day and just get that extra money!

[What are the primary resources you hope to mine from asteroids, or are you kind of just playing it by ear to see whats out there to get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqnzgr?context=5)|Right now, we think we have a okay idea of what there is in various types of asteroids from the 50,000 meteorite samples that have landed on Earth.  We expect to mine water out of C-type asteroids for the first product.  Water gets used for everything in space - drinking, breathing, rocket fuel, radiation shielding... and is very expensive in space given launch costs.
 |Structural materials would likely be second - bulk material is expensive in space. After that we would look into mining materials that are scarce on Earth (platinum group metals).  Those have industrial uses that are likely to grow as world's economy grows.
 |TL;DR, water is the first step.  platinum later.

 |**EDIT:** -For additional information, there has been work on using carbonyl processes to refine asteroidal material which has a number of advantages (reuse of the carbon monoxide) and is appropriate based on the metal content.
[What are your thoughts on Kerbal Space Program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqp0el?context=5)|I am fairly certain that is where one of our interns learned everything he knows about orbital mechanics.

[How many SCVs do you think you will need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqpmdf?context=5)|It depends on how much Vespene Gas we require.
[1\) Are you aiming on developing your own launch systems or using an existing platform?  2\) What is going to be your primary attitude / secondary maneuverability systems on-board the Arkyd 100 spacecraft?  3\) You have mentioned a Geocentric-LEO orbit, but what about eccentricity, synchronicity, and/or pseudo-orbit classifications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqo8p8?context=5)|Since our spacecraft are really small we are planning on piggy-backing rides on launch vehicles using their excess capability.  This puts our orbit details at the mercy of the primary spacecraft.  Luckily, we're pretty flexible about where we go, and there are lots of options.
[4\) Being a space nerd myself as well, I'm going down the path of space propulsion technologies, I am doing this because it sounds bad@$$ and phenomenally challenging at the same time.

I'm looking forward to growing our propulsion as we move out to the asteroids. --HG.
[There are other near earth object mining ventures in the works. How do you foresee ""claims"" being handled? For example, do you expect to be able to say ""this asteroid is ours"" and have that respected, or will you need to have actually begun mining it before your claim is respected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqocrk?context=5)|There are many precedents from the long history of mining and resource development on Earth.

[Why would you quit spaceX?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqnvhp?context=5)|SpaceX is super bad ass.  I wanted to move back up to the Seattle area to buy some land and raise chickens, sheep, and kids.
[What asteroid do you plan on mining first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqnvhp?context=5)|It's likely that our first asteroid is yet to be discovered.  Over 1000 near earth asteroids are discovered every year, so we're building the Arkyd 100 in order to help us gather the data required to make this decision.
[What got you started into asteroid mining?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqnvhp?context=5)|The sheer audacity of the goal and the massive upside potential for mankind.  I wanted to be part of making that vision happen.

[Please describe how you will make the steel to build those structures from the raw iron and other elements/minerals you find out there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqou92?context=5)|Warning: long answer. The natural metal in asteroids is more or less a stainless steel.  The metal has high nickel content, potentially high cobalt as well as a mess of other metals (PGM, scandium, etc in various amounts).  Back in the 1970s, NASA designed a process to extract individual materials from the asteroid material.  This system used carbon monoxide to extract pure nickel, iron, and cobalt from native metal. Once you have those materials, there are a number of processes that would be able to create tailored steels.  I caution though, zero-gee smelting is still in early stages and we will be working on solving the issues over the next few years.  3D printing looks extremely promising as a technique to combine the materials. TL;DR - chemistry and 3D printing --MB.

Zero G drilling, how to do that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqr4rd?context=5)|Take a look at [asteroid 25143 Itokawa](http://imgur.com/VrvhaO0).  It's what is known as a ""rubble pile"" and has been bashed to bits by collisions over the eons.  If you need crushed asteroid on Itokawa, you can go to the areas of the asteroid that have already been crushed.  By starting with ""water"" in space, it may be that no rock blasting, crushing and grinding are required - as basic solar distillation may be the way to go.  Still much to learn here, which is why we need to prospect candidate asteroids with Arkyd spacecraft! -- CL.

[What kind of time scale are you expecting for this project? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1h47je/we_are_engineers_from_planetary_resources_we_quit/caqowpb?context=5)|There are several short term milestones and some longer term goals.  In late spring 2014, we are launching a small satellite called A3 to demonstrate our core technologies.  In 2015 we will launch the A100 space telescopes, one of which is the subject of our [Kickstarter\] (\[Link to www.kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1458134548/arkyd-a-space-telescope-for-everyone-0))  Kickstarter participants and educators will be able to use the A100 to take images of the Earth and space phenomena, in addition to taking ""space selfies"".
 |The A100 will also allow us to identify interesting near-earth asteroids that we may want to prospect in-situ using our A200 and A300 spacecraft.  The timeline for these later missions is dependent on our progress with prospecting and solving the hard problems of building deep-space satellites, such as radiation and communication.

We have to worry about single event upsets, which can cause glitches in electronics and software, and total dose, which can eventually kill electronics.  The challenge is in building a spacecraft that is robust to random transient and permanent failures, and able to survive long enough and be reliable enough to do something useful.

1h4fr8,22,2013-06-26,Career Change to CS -- Second Bachelors or Masters?,b-enchante,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h4fr8/career_change_to_cs_second_bachelors_or_masters/,"Hi everyone,

I've been following this thread for a while now and have learned a ton. Thanks so much to everyone who takes the time to answer questions. I really appreciate it.

I recently graduated with a very fulfilling yet very useless bachelors in film. I've realized that film is not the place for me, and I've discovered my passion for coding and CS over the past few months. I've been spending almost every minute of my spare time practicing coding and learning as much as I can from online resources. Without a doubt, I would like to pursue a career in CS.

I was accepted into Oregon State's online post-bacc CS degree. It fits my needs very well because it is intended for people such as myself who have already completed a bachelors (thus no need to re-take GEs that don't transfer), is very affordable compared to getting a second bachelors at another institution, and can be completed in one (very intensive, 60 credit) year. I'll come out on the other end with a B.S. in CS.

My family, however, has been pressuring me to get a masters in CS. To them, the masters degree is the golden standard for getting a job. From the research I've done and from what I've seen on this thread, it seems getting a masters in CS is not always a great idea, especially if one didn't get a bachelors in CS. One might miss out on some of the foundational CS courses offered in a BS and be a worse programmer for it. A masters also might be too specialized. It seems from what I've read that, contrary to fields in the humanities, a bachelors in CS is usually the standard in this field.

I've also considered self-teaching instead of a bachelors, but I really want to make sure I have all my bases covered and ensure the longevity of my career, because I've read that some companies, although not all, only hire people who have a bachelors in CS, and the bachelors should help open doors for the career search.

One potential downside to the program I'm entering is that because it is completed in 1 intensive year (4 quarters, including summer), I do not have a summer break with which to complete an internship, and even while I'm studying, I'll be living in a smaller town that doesn't have CS internship opportunities. I've read that completing a side project independently, putting my code on github, and possibly working for open source projects is a good way to offset the disadvantage of not having completed an internship, although maybe that's not a feasible alternative in some people's eyes. I do have to say that I am a very hard worker who is used to putting in many more hours than is necessary for class into side projects, which is what I did during my bachelors. Another potential downside to my program is that it is an online program, and I’m not sure if some employers would look down on that.

So, to end a very lengthy question... Does my line of thought make sense, or am I completely off? In your opinion, would a post-bacc second bachelors or a masters be preferable for my situation? Would the online and internship-less nature of my degree be too much of a disadvantage?

I obviously want to ensure my future success by laying the foundations of my education properly. And I also want to be able to argue cogently to my family why I am making the best possible choice for my future, because, after all, they are footing the bill! 

Thank you so much for reading, and I appreciate your help!"

I figured that you guys would be more effective at helping me than they could ever hope to be.

Here it is:

Hello all,

Over the past few months, my Dell Inspiron N7010 laptop has had extremely slow performance than borders on freezing. Because my internship next week requires a laptop, I'm now attempting to fix this. So far, I've ran MalawareBytes multiple times and nothing has come up of interest. 

Yesterday, I had everything up and running well at normal speeds surprisingly. That being said, once I shut down the slow speeds started up again starting with the ""Starting Windows"" message at start-up which took almost 5 minutes just to get to the log-on screen. As soon as I got on my account today, I immediately opened Windows Task Manager to see if there was any process that was slowing me down and I've found nothing suspicious. Windows Task Manager is reporting that my CPU Usage is at 0% and Physical Memory at 33%. For example, if I open the Start Menu and type something into the ""Search programs and files"" search bar it doesn't even come up and the Start Menu seems frozen for almost two minutes. From my knowledge, there were no suspicious programs or files ever downloaded onto this laptop. I mainly only used it for Microsoft Word and schoolwork. 

While I believe this might be a O/S or virus problem, I could be physical. This laptop has always been unnecessarily been prone to overheating. For the amount of money I paid for this, I should be getting a better quality product.

As for the warranty, I doubt that is still intact. I purchased this laptop over a year ago. 

If anyone can help me, that'd be greatly appreciated. If you need any information to help me fix this, I'll gladly provide it. 

Note: I'm using my desktop computer to post this.  

Update: Now it's frozen at System Information after I tried to scroll down on it and System Information is ""Not Responding"" :(

I am a summer intern about to start my freshman year of college. This has been a great experience that has enhanced my knowledge of Microsoft products and network environments (we are a Microsoft Partner). I work mainly in new system deployments and old system repair. I came into work and found a HP Pavilion dv4 (without it's battery and **covered** in stickers) sitting on my desk. ""Joy of Joys,"" I said. These computers are nothing but POS and I know this will be interesting. Apparently it's the a computer from the CEO's friend. Her teenage daughter, the user, wrote us a long note containing these following tidbits:

* ""Recently, the laptop was taken apart to clean out the ventilation system. I do this **REGULARLY** and have never had a problem re-assembling the computer, however, now it will not boot properly. I am not sure whether I put something back together incorrectly, or if I damaged the motherboard, or if the hard drive has just decided that it is time to leave us."" 

* ""If the problem does indeed rest within the hard drive, I would like to have that replaced. I am interested in seeing what better performance I could get with a solid state drive, though it is not a necessity and perhaps not practical since I use the laptop almost constantly and would like to have something that is going to last me for a few years more. If a solid state is not a practical option for this machine, anything with ""a lot"" of storage space will do (and by ""a lot"" I mean something larger than the measly 212 GB that the current HDD has). 

Side notes (if the main problem can be fixed):

* The optical drive doesn't work and I can't install drivers.
* The current OS is Windows Vista, and I would like to keep that. I **do not want** the OS upgraded to Windows 7. 

I really wish people wouldn't try to be good with technology when they know so little. "

The first few years they had me doing various data entry tasks, but later they had me working IT. My duties included the usual tech support for the finance folks, but I also was responsible for providing site-wide support for a document routing system. This system was used to managed all financial documents (purchase orders, travel orders, etc.); all these documents were created, approved, and tracked inside the routing system. 

One day, about 15 minutes before das Feierabend, I get a call from one of my usual suspects (this was someone who seemed to stack all her document creation tasks during the day and wait until the final hour to actually do them). She's getting an error message that she's never seen before and doesn't understand: when trying to create a new document she is informed that the row is locked by a user. After asking various questions about the situation, I determine that this is in fact a new document that she hasn't released yet, and it's impossible for anyone else to have it open. So the only answer is that this is a database problem and not a problem with the front end.

Knowing that I have neither the knowledge nor the permissions to handle this issue, I ask the usual suspect if I can do some research and call her back once I have a solution. Then I call the DBA to get his guidance/help.

bouchard: Hi DBA, I just had a user call me with an error message saying that the row is locked when she tries to create a new document. This seems to be a database error that's beyond my abilities to correct. Do you have any ideas of what would be causing it? [OK, I actually rambled a bit, but that's the gist of what I said.]

DBA: Is the user Usual Suspect #15?

bouchard: Yes...

DBA: She does this all the time. She'll open several instances of the front end and create all her documents before submitting them. Sometimes she'll click the ""Next Document"" button instead of the ""New Document"" button and the application tries to open a document that's being created in another window, resulting in the error. The only way to clear it is go to her desk and *close all the windows for her*. She doesn't understand when you tell her to exit. She's only a couple doors down from me; I'll go take care of it.

**TL;DR User opens 20 connections to the database and tries to open a record that she's in the middle of creating.**

Epilogue: Later, when I was working as a financial manager on the same site but in a different office, I worked with this woman. She never knew that I was the same person who used to provide her tech support."

One of the company policies is that we can pretty much choose when we work. It creates some issues with people coming in at 6:00AM and others coming to work at 3:00PM, but mostly it's just really, really nice. For example, I can play a game of League of Legends before work, or sleep in, or make a Reddit post. On the other hand, if I get up really early and feel motivated, I can just get into the office and be off by 3:00. Plus I don't have to worry about being late for work. I feel like it definitely makes the team more productive over-all. 

I'm just wondering how common this sort of policy is in the software industry. Also, as a bonus question: how relevant is deep-level C and basic perl scripting in the industry?

I'm an Electronics Major, I took a lot of computer classes in college, and very much enjoyed my math and java classes (never had trouble with it unlike most of my engineering class who whined about it). For some reason though I did not think of it as a career option in college and went to work for a start up in power/infrastructure industry for 3 years and was officially very sick of it by the end of 3 years. It ended up being a very dead end job because of some major projects that were closed down. 

I had done some IT internships in college in testing mostly, in big companies like Siemens. I tried doing codeschool/code academy for the last few weeks, I just feel I keep going over the basics of things that I already know and I want to build something, and have that to show to employers (if i get an interview). Idk what I should say in my cover letter and resume about my career switch to even get to the interview stage. 

For now, one of my uncles wanted me to build him a simple website for his new company, I've made him a basic website from scratch (not using any tools) in a day and i'll work on it to make it look nicer and add things like a login for employees etc. 

And I've started working on a simple web application using rails/git which I'll keep trying to add more features too once I'm done with a simple version of it. 

I have a goal of having something presentable and hosted online that I can show i did by the end of July. I don't know if that is enough at all to get interviews and hopefully jobs. 

I have done java, python projects, some c for microcontrollers in college, i even took a lot of these programming/microcontroller classes for fun. Don't knwo fi that matters at all now after 3 years. 

Please help with any inputs/suggestions you have. "

I've figured out that I don't really like programming that much. Sure, it's more interesting than a lot of other things (hello literature and history), but it's not particularly fun for me.

Instead, I find that I enjoy doing the stuff that we did in my AI and algorithms classes -- there can still be coding involved, but it's also a lot of math (probability, statistics, theoretical CS). A logical path, then, would be to go into academia.

But I fear that even if I successfully go on to grad school and get a PhD, the competition for academic jobs would be too much for me, and I'd probably end up getting a similar job to what I would get with just a bachelor's or master's degree.

So which careers would let me do more theoretical work (of the type I described above) while not having as high of a barrier to entry as academia?"

My friend is going to jail for a crime she didn't commit, how can I help her?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h73mz/reddit_i_need_your_help_my_friend_is_going_to/,"Please take the time to read this entire post; there are a lot of details that are important to the case.

 My friend who just received her undergraduate degree was a lacrosse coach at a local high school and had a very good relationship with girls on the team. There was one particular girl whose parents were going through a bitter divorce but the mom was good friends with the coach (my friend). While the dad is pretty well off the mom works nights at a restaurant and regularly needed my friend to give her daughter a ride home from practice. One night in October of 2012 an emergency came up and the mom had to leave for the night leaving her high school age daughter and middle school age son at home. She asked my friend to watch them for the night and she agreed mostly because she felt bad. She knew initially it wasn’t a great idea especially because the daughter had previously made advances on her which were respectfully declined. 


After the dad learned about this he decided to take action and write a letter about that night and sent it to the cops. The letter included information that the daughter and my friend slept in the same bed and that the son confirmed that it happened. This isn’t the first time the father had tried something like this, he accused two of the mom’s previous boyfriends but the cases were dropped due to lack of evidence. Apparently this letter is enough. The father coaxed the son into talking to the police about it and even though the son later returned and admitted he was lying the police are sticking with his initial statements. An email was also sent to my friend by the daughter apologizing for this and saying that she is too afraid of her dad to speak up. This email was turned into the police but was later determined insufficient due to the fact that “anyone could have sent that email from that account.” 


For the few months my friend has been fighting these charges and using all the money she had saved for law school on attorneys. She’s had a lot of help because she had an internship at our local courthouse. However, the only important thing it seems is that the dad has money and she does not. She had the option to go to court but was afraid that the jury would take the young girls side and she would have gone to jail for up to 10 years. With the passing of her dad and her bank account empty she doesn’t have the money anyway. Instead she is pleading “no contest” which basically means she isn’t saying she did it but she’s not fighting it either. She has never even been questioned by the police and it is all based off of the dad’s original letter. If I can’t help her soon she will be going to jail on Monday for up to two years and be permanently placed on the sex offenders list. 
Some additional important information for you legal buffs even though I don’t fully understand it: the mom contacted my friend to apologize and say that she would fight for her but when the courts found out my friend contacted the family it was considered breaking her bond. Additionally when talking to her lawyer she made a comment about rather being dead than going to jail which was taken seriously and provoked her admittance to a mental facility for a week on suicide watch. At the facility when talking to a social worker she made the poor choice of saying something (which she now obviously regrets) that was taken as a threat to the dad. The social worker was obligated to report this which was also considered breaking her bond. I believe that part of the reason she may be facing jail time is due to breaking the bond but I’m not entirely sure.


To make matters worse she has been informed that the media has already applied for passes to cover the case. She has also been told that they will say she is pleading guilty. I assume this is either because it is simpler to explain than “no contest” or that it will make for better news. I’m afraid that the media will make my friend look like a monster who is a child predator and that she will go to jail. Additionally because of these charges even if she had the money for more schooling she won’t be able to practice law. 


Reddit I’m pleading for your help, I’m not asking for money because I don’t even know if it would do any good. I’m asking for advice, what can I do to help my friend? Is going to jail unavoidable? Is there any way she can ever become a lawyer after all this?


**edit 1** - If local law matters we are in Michigan

**TL:DR** - My friend was babysitting a girl whose parents are going through a nasty custody battle. The dad took this opportunity to accuse her of sexually abusing his daughter in order to prove the mother unfit to keep the kids. He even convinced his son to give a stamen to the police as a witness, the son later came out to say he was lying but for some reason the cops didn’t take it seriously. There is no doubt in my mind that my friend is innocent but she doesn’t have the money to fight the charges. I don’t know what to do or how to help her.

**Best way to call VB.NET function from Java?**

I'm interning as a software developer for a company. There is a client-installed software program written in C# that has dll's in VB - both on the .NET framework. Our entire cloud-based server is written in Java, so for now, my task is simply to call a function in Java that gets/sets a private(? sorry, not really familiar with VB so I might be using this term inappropriately) variable located within the dll. Ultimately, though, my task will be to collect data from the client program and put it in our server. I've been researching how to go about doing this for the past few days and have found a few options:

- Java Native Access (JNA)
- Java Native Interface (JNI)
- COM/ActiveX bridges (though I can't entirely say for sure that I know what these are/how to use them_
- JNBridge

Now as far as I know, these are the issues I've found with each, respectively:

- Using this option requires an intermediary from Java to .NET using either C or C++, and given that I only really know Java, I'd not really like to get tangled in this mess.
- Seems a tad bit more complicated than JNA, and I think it has no real advantages over JNA anyways. They both appear to have the need of a C/C++ intermediary.
- ... can't really say much aside from the fact that I'm not really sure how I can go about implementing this method.
- This and other similar bridges has to be a last resort. The developer license for this product is quite pricey, and I'm sure they we don't have the resource to use this product. I could try asking, but I don't really think it's in the place of an intern to ask that a company invest so much.

To add to the fact that I'm not really that adept in programming, I've been left to mostly do this on my own so thanks so much in advance for reading my question. If there's something I haven't fully explained that necessitates further explanation, please let me know! Any other tips/pointers would be immensely appreciated.

I grew up in a great town, with a lot of great friends. In high school I played football, did a lot of extra curriculars, got excellent grades, etc... I then went to college far away and lived on campus, gaining fresh new perspectives on life and some of the best friendships a person could ever ask for. I sometimes tear up thinking about how amazing that time was, but that was a year ago.

I graduated last year with an insanely good GPA, a solid job offer at a fortune 100 company, and all the confidence a man could desire. The world was at my feet. 

My place of work wasn't far from my hometown either. I moved back home and had planned to stay at this company until I could knock away some of the egregious loan debt that school hit more for.

Here's my problem... The job I was hired for- well I wasn't exactly qualified, and my boss is the smartest and most ambitious person I have ever met. My coworkers are also incredibly smart, and have a lot of fun working together. My boss loved my performance during my internship the summer beforehand, so he hired me, planning that I would work my tail off to catch up to these guys and be a part of their speedy ship to the top of the corporate ladder. 

Well, he was wrong. I am fucking terrible at my job.

For the first time in my life, I am not successful. I started to quickly lose my confidence, people at work never accepted me as one of their own, and as far as my plan to quickly pay off my loans? Well, I still have more to pay off than I originally took out. I did move closer to work, because I thought the issue was living at home. Now I have rent, cable, electric, car payments (i originally carpooled with my mom), AND my loans.

Point is- I know it doesn't sound like an insanely depressing situation, but I have no more friends. I have no one I can talk to. My whole life's work of confidence and friendships and success was a fiction. My emotional well being is in shock. I live alone, have gained 50+ lbs in the last 7 months, and continue to be mocked and ridiculed at my current position (which, by the way, is made worse by the fact that my boss has to PRETEND like i'm doing well, to make it seem like i was a good hire). I smoke cigarettes (never used to do that), drink every night (never used to do that)- my life has turned a complete 180.

I know this is probably too long for anyone to read or to respond to, but i needed to get it out there. I think about suicide daily. Fuck me right?"

So far, here's the gist of what I've taken (in the major):

* Programming classes (Java/C++). I understand the cornerstones of object oriented development (classes, inheritance, etc). I feel I have a beginner to intermediate understanding of the languages. I still have to look at the APIs and Google around to figure out how to do a lot of stuff.
* Data Structures. I understand the basics, and more advanced ones like graphs, various trees, and hash tables.
* Operating Systems. Just general Linux/Windows stuff.
* Computer Organization. We worked with some x86 assembly, and talked a lot about microarchitecture basics.

Most internships I've seen are looking for people who are in or done with their junior year. What's more, it seems like a lot of them expect experience in things that I haven't even seen classes for. It almost looks like they're looking for cheap labor, rather than to help *teach* somebody and get them experience in the field.

Looking around, I'm just starting to get stressed out. 

Outside of school, I've mostly been working. I have just started to look into Android development, but I've been working too much to dedicate much time to it.

Is my knowledge pretty typical for someone with 2 years of schooling? What else should I be doing to better my chances of getting a good internship/job? What kind of skills would be valuable to have? How much do you need to teach yourself, versus learn in classes?

Thanks for reading!"

1h9ac5,1,2013-06-28,Need advice please. I want to work in software/ engineering but my current skills will not be up to par for another 2 years.

Unfortunately, I found myself stuck in a business program and graduated recently. I see myself in engineering because my favorite classes were programming, linear algebra, diffy q's etc. I learned a lot of programming and web development on the side in my spare time, but that alone is not as comprehensive as a dedicated CS degree.  
  

I am certain that I will very soon have the knowledge/skills needed, but right now I just haven't been able to put the hours into it. My time was unfortunately spent writing bullshit case studies and other business school busywork (sorry any business majors, but it's true).  

I'm really entrepreneurial and can learn things quickly, 10x so if I am being constantly reinforced by a demanding job. Like I mentioned, I will be starting my masters in EE/CE at Boston University in this special program that lets people go from unrelated under to a masters in engineering. I need a job that has synergy with what I will be soon learning. Plus, I would love an engineer-y company to take advantage of tuition reimbursement. All of my technical skills are shallow ATM, but I know with a demanding environment, I will pick it up in no time. I can write java, OOD, etc, know html, jscript, just learned PHP, Drupal. When I have time I really like writing little programs just to see how far i can get. I wrote a blackjack game and am trying to write a really basic emulation of matlab's linear algebra stuff.  

I do have really solid computer technician experience. Is that a way to get into a company and maybe transfer out to their engineering depts later?  

Should I just explain to potential companies that I am weak technically but can make up for it in short time? All the prereqs seem so high even in internships!  

**Tl;dr- business undergrad going to get my masters in EE/CE. Feel unqualified atm, but will definitely have skills very soon and I learn very fast. How do I get a job in engineering?**  


Sorry for huge wall of text, but I appreciate any advice at all"

Before my current job I had a web development start up with another partner of mine and I loved every single moment of it but sometime after (about 1 year) I got a good offer  from one biggest corporations Mexico (yes I’m Mexican) to work in the Strategic Planning department.  While I do enjoy my current job, I feel that I have much better opportunities trying to succeed on the IT department rather than the project and strategic planning department.

Now here is where things get a little bit funky. I have 2 choices… 

1)	Stay at where I’m at right now, I know that if I stay here I will have a steady somewhat good salary and climb the corporate ladder.

2)	I have an opportunity to take an Internship based on Shanghai, China on as a web developer, I would be getting payed much less than what I could be possible winning if I stayed where I’m at.
I’m leaning towards China since I don’t have anyone that relies on me (kids, wife, etc) and I think much better opportunites could appear because of this.

Thoughts?

I do realise that a course in which I mostly learn syntax doesn't really translate into knowing the language, but I figure that the more languages you know, your code in any language will be influenced by the ""way of thought"" of the others. Learning more programming will also allow me to attack ""that would be cool""-projects with more confidence; like, say, making a smartphone app for my own use, or interfacing a webcam with my Raspberry Pi and writing a program in C++ so it can ""see"" so I can turn it into a killerbot, and then combining the two for all I know. 

Also, even if I'm the bomb when it comes to implementing numerical methods with MATLAB, an employer may not necessarily be interested in this particular skillset, they may not use MATLAB for what they do. 

I've heard talk of Java, Lisp, Perl, Ruby, Visual Basic, Lua and many others; but beyond descriptions like ""oh, it's kinda like C++/Python"", I'm more interested in what they typically are used for/are great at than the learning curve.

Suggestions?"

I'm in my final year as an undergraduate Physics and Engineering student and for my summer project I thought I would try my hand at building my own pc. Other than needing a new machine to handle some of the more intensive programs I need for my major, I need something that can satisfy my gaming needs. Most recently I have been trying to make the transition from console to pc gaming and unfortunately my little macbook pro can't handle it. :(
I've done some fair research into this build and I have had some friends help me out with it, but I need /r/buildapc to review it for me before I pull the trigger. I have never spent this much money before and so I am little anxious/nervous about this. I will be getting my stipend for my summer internship here in the next few days and I feel this would be the best way to spend that money. All other peripherals have been provided since my birthday was just last week! I will appreciate any tweaks or suggestions. Thank you for your time! :)

I've found from my personal internship search in addition to what I've heard from most seniors (a lot of them end up going to grad school). I can't really afford to take on another year of school to do a CS minor, but I do have room in my schedule to take 3-4 CS classes this upcoming year. Basically I want to get some CS experience just in case in order to leave my options open after I graduate. 

I put together a kind of tentative plan to transition into the CS industry. Over the next year I'm planning on taking the CS classes at my school that seem to directly apply to most CS jobs (I've heard from friends in CS that a solid understanding of Data Structures is important). So if I were to take these 3-4 classes, would it be reasonable to get an internship? Also, if I were to intern for ~6 months, would it be difficult getting a full time job in CS? "

I have a bachelor degree in computer sciences with a specialisation image processing.


I am looking to switch to software development, I don't really have a field of interest.  The only problem is that I basicly only know c++ but almost all the jobs I see don't use c++.  I have done some internship before at a big company in software development.


I was wondering what I could do to put all the chances on my side to find a good job that I will like.  What language, framework to learn, how I can show off my skills.  I was thinking of probably C#.net and or Java.


For reference I am based in the region of Montreal, Canada.  Any advices are welcome.

1h7r8j,6,2013-06-27,Legal Advice for Pet Ownership/Custody in Illinois,SapphirePrincess,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1h7r8j/legal_advice_for_pet_ownershipcustody_in_illinois/,"I am looking for some legal advice about trying to get custody of my pet cat. The background story is a bit long and complicated, but please try and understand. For my 17th birthday, my boyfriend (now fiancee) and his family adopted a black kitten for me. I had/have pet dogs, but I always wanted a cat. I had begged my parents for years to no avail. I get the kitten, love her, take care of her and all. Family situation in the mean time deteriorates and my parents end up getting a divorce. I decide to continue to live with my mom because of the cat. I started going to college out of state and my mom agreed to take care of the cat since I lived in the dorms and could not bring her with. 

My relationship with my mom was never very good, but my mom thinks we were really close. My mom is so angry and bitter about the divorce that she ends up ruining the relationship between her and my older brother and also my younger sister. To this day my younger sister has no relationship with my mom and it has been over 5 years. Anyways, I hang around and live with my mom while my siblings live with my dad. My mom's poisonous and anger just dragged me down and she would constantly yell at me for everything including things my siblings did or things my father did. Things that happened before I was even born. Anytime something went wrong or my mom would fight with someone all the anger and frustration would be directed at me. I would constantly be yelled at. I started getting serious depressed and I could no longer take the abuse from my mom and I moved over to my dads house. The two houses are 15 min drive apart. I would still go to my moms from time to time on my college breaks to see my cat because I could not take her to my dads or college. The yellings would continue from my mom and every break from college I would end up going back hysterically crying after dealing with my mom. After having my two siblings around growing up and being spoiled by my dad, my mom had grown accustomed to have so much attention. At this point, one 19 or 20 years old can not make up for that lose and it put a lot of stress and pressure on me. I was always trapped in the middle of my parents and I took all the abuse from my mom. It finally got so bad that my depression got so severe that I had to be hospitalized because I was suicidal. After this point I started working with professionals at my college to improve my life and become happy again.

At this point I really stopped going over to my moms house or talking with her on the phone. I would constantly struggle with the desire to see may cat that I love so much and my avoidance to see my mom and get yelled at by her. My mom figured out that I was only going over to her house to see my cat when she was not home (for obvious reasons) and so she started changing the locks so I no longer had access to the house. She still expected me to come over and take care of the cat, but it had to be when she was home. 

For the last three years, I have hardly gone over to see my cat. I was studying abroad for 7 months and working an internship during the summers. My relationship with my mom only really got worse and I started to avoid interacting with her completely since I was finally starting to improve on my depression and do well in college. You can ask any of my family or my fiancee's family and they know I would struggle every time I was home with seeing my cat. I ended up deciding not to because not dealing with my mom was the best for my overall health. 

Now, I just graduated from college, got a job, and moved into my own place. When searching for places to rent I had every intention of bringing my cat to my new home. I had to deal with 5 years of college without her and I was extremely excited at the idea of being with her again. She always made me happy and even though she isn't the cuddling type of cat, she makes a great companion and keeps me from feeling lonely. Well my mom being the controlling and unreasonable type has refused to allow me to take my cat to my new place. After 5 years of her complaining about having to take care of her and pay for food and the vet and try to give her to me, she now refuses to give me the cat. 

My mom acts like she is doing this for the cats best interest, but when it comes down to her argument it is just that she is unhappy that I have not done everything for her. She is bringing up things like me not spending Christmas and thanksgiving with her because I spent them with my dad or my fiancee's family. I did not do anything special for her birthday or mothers day. I don't thank her for anything. I do but she yells at me about things so much that I don't really feel like thanking her for anything. She says her main reason she will not give me my cat is because I ""abandoned"" her for the last three years and had nothing to do with her. The whole situation has been continuing for over a month now. My fiancee has tried to mediate because his family and him got the cat for me with the intent that we would take her with us after college. He has tried his best, but my mom is unreasonable and I am so angry and fed up with dealing with my mom while I just moved and started my first full time job. The situation has been making my depression worse and I am struggling with living alone now. My cat was like a therapy animal for me when I lived with her. My mom complained about cost so my fiancee and I said we would compensate her for the expenses for the last five years. My mom really refuses to do anything until I apologize for every wrong doing anyone has done to her for ever and show her respect and appreciation. My mom believes she has done nothing wrong and that everything is all my fault. 

Here is where my legal question is. Is there a way I can get my cat from my mom? The vet records are all in my name, but my mom has covered expenses and taken care of the cat the last five years due to me being in college. It seems kinda of a silly thing, but to me my cat is like my first born kid and I love her more than anything. Any advice would be beneficial. Sorry for the long family drama history. "

1hdmz7,3,2013-06-30,College freshman in need of guidance...,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hdmz7/college_freshman_in_need_of_guidance/,"Hi, I'm an incoming college freshman who'll be majoring in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I wanted to get an idea of what I could do to make the best of my education. I had a few questions regarding CS/general advice regarding the major:

- I've been spending most of my time learning Python and Java. The first few classes are taught in Java and I figured it'd be a good idea to get a head start. Additionally, I've been trying to work with the terminal on my Mac most of the time. I'm assuming familiarity with Linux is really important.

- I'm also considering doing a minor in Math. If any of you double majored in Math or minored in it; do you think it has been beneficial?

- Side Projects: I've started some side projects and  have some more ideas, and I don't know if they're great, but whatever I choose to make- should I put it on github? I'm learning, and obviously the stuff I build won't be amazing, but effort counts for something, right? Additionally, what should I do if I want to contribute to open source projects (I know Python has some cool libraries I'm interested in)? I'm at a total loss here.

- Summer Internships: I'd like to get a job for the summer after my freshman year.  I'll only have taken 2-3 CS courses by then. I'm not sure how to apply for jobs if I have neither experience nor too much knowledge. If I can demonstrate some skills though side projects, will that be a solid substitute for the time being? Any other advice will be helpful...

- Lastly, does the school's rep matter a lot? I know UMass isn't Stanford/MIT, it's not ranked very high overall as school (90 something according to US News), but it does really well in graduate school rankings for CS (#20). Would it be worth it to transfer to a higher ranked school for more prospects?

- Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!"
1hdkrp,2,2013-06-30,How should I go about leaving my job?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hdkrp/how_should_i_go_about_leaving_my_job/,"I started my career with an internship as an intern for a company that was close to my campus; I stayed for about two years.. I left the company a couple of months ago (almost three months ago) to pursue a paid position and it turns out that I'm not really interested in what I am doing.. I was applying for a few places and I was pretty sure that I wasn't going to get any bites. However, I ended up landing a position a lot closer to my residence and a lot more relevant to my field of studies / interests and at a company that is very highly renowned in it's field..

I wouldn't have such a hard time thinking about this or approaching this if it wasn't so close to a time of heavy volume / activity at my current job (open enrollment period).. This, combined with the fact that someone else is leaving the beginning of this month, makes me feel really guilty; however, I feel like I'm doing what is going to be better for me..

How should I go about telling my supervisor/manager?

DSA is the first real CS class that I've taken. My question is if the whole undergrad you learn a lot of theory and math, how does this turn into software development? They seem so far from each other, yet obviously so close. But how? I love what I'm learning but the programming I've done has been really just command line applications. How can I tie my learning into the real world. I obviously have a lot to learn but if I were to get an internship, I feel I would not know what to do. Sure I can program, but all I really know is CS theory, not developing business applications."
1hcr09,1,2013-06-30,Help with a resume for a web development internship.,resumehelpthrowaway1,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1hcr09/help_with_a_resume_for_a_web_development/,"So basically I'm in a GIS certificate program and I'm currently looking for an internship or a full time position. I recently heard about an opening at a software company for an internship program. Well, an employee at the company suggested that I look over my resume again, so I'd like help improving it.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-F37kGnmo98ZmJFbmFGVV9sTW8/

As far as my job at the software company, it was a short term full time contract position. I was close to the end of my contract, and work ran out. It was less than two months, but I left on good terms with the company and I can get good references. But I did not do any programming. I am also still under an NDA.

Should I add another section for the internship I had in the NOC at a power company? It is a technical postion, but it was right before I started the year-long internship, so it is kind of old and my resume is getting close to a full page.

What about my educational experience? Should I leave on the part about studying electrical engineering? I did not complete the degree, but I did take a few programming classes so I feel that it is relevant to the position. I also have kept a good GPA during the certificate program. Should I put that on if I'm leaving off my cumulative gpa?
Does anyone else have any other suggestions? I think my resume might be a little out of date. I already removed the part that said references were available by request. Thanks a lot."

She doesn't want that, her family wants her to be somewhat the stereotypical house wife. She wants to work, be independent. Therefore she has to fight for every single little thing and she's giving up. She tries to work hard in college and right now she has a great internship for the summer. However, her family just shoots her down, saying it's not what they wanted from or for her, and lately she has been taking aspirin, lots of it, to make her family see her pain.

I've been begging her to think about us and our future together, but she is adamant saying this is the only way that her family will see or listen.

She says every time she fights for herself, she gets hurt; and she can't take it anymore. So I'm asking the people of reddit for advice. I love her so much and she means everything to me. I'm not suppose to be even doing this because I promised her I'd keep this between us, but I'm desperate and I want her to be happy, and safe. So please help is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much to anyone that contributes."
